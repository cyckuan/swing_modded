EDITORS: NEW THROUGHOUT, UPDATING with Texas Legislature reaching a
compromise on school funds
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONFEREES REACH 11TH-HOUR DEAL ON SCHOOL FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   By KATHY WALT &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ House and Senate negotiators salvaged a $3.8
billion school finance plan at the 11th hour Saturday, after they
found an extra $100 million in funding.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached around 10 p.m. grants $3,000 annual pay raises
to teachers and $300 million for kindergarten and pre-kindergarten
programs. It also grants $1.2 billion in school property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement came after days of mostly private negotiations between
leaders of the Republican-dominated Senate and the
Democrat-controlled House, who earlier Saturday appeared to have
hit a brick wall in their talks.
</P>
<P>
   They were fighting over a difference of about $47 million,
minuscule compared to the spending plan, but one that represented a
huge philosophical chasm.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the agreement, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry compared the
negotiations to Aggie football _ ``you play until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty million dollars of the extra money came from a new lottery
revenue projection from Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander after a
lottery bill that was approved Friday changed the outlook for
income from the games.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Senate that did most of the compromising, with the
new version of Senate Bill 4 taking on all the features House
members had demanded, except for the Senate's idea of creating a
new funding level to help mostly fast-growing school districts
retire debt.
</P>
<P>
   The upper chamber agreed to a House proposal to give all
teachers and librarians a $3,000 annual pay raise, the largest
state-funded pay hike for public school teachers in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also yielded to House plans on how much to increase
per-student funding and even the $300 million the House wanted to
put into early childhood programs and ninth-grade dropout
prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those educational programs had been the sticking point in
earlier negotiations, but Perry said chief House negotiator Paul
Sadler, D-Henderson, had been ``very persuasive'' in persuading the
Senate to fund such programs. Those concessions were made even
though senators were aware they meant it would be impossible to
achieve a goal of $2 billion in taxpayer relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bill is better now than when it left the House.
Things that were important to House members are still in there,''
said Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston. School districts will fare a
little better because they will have a bit more discretionary money
than the House plan had called for.
</P>
<P>
   The bill still faces a race to passage before the legislative
session ends at midnight Monday. A 24-hour waiting period is
required from the time the final version of the bill is placed on
members' desks, and there must be time for printing up the new
version.
</P>
<P>
   If approval cannot be given in time, the Legislature faces a
likely special session to handle the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush ``made an impassioned plea'' to Sadler,
the House Public Education Committee chairman, and to senators
negotiating the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Saturday night, after making a commencement speech to
Brazosport High School, the Republican governor had said, ``The
general consensus is we'd like to avoid a special session, but if
there has to be one, there has to be one. And a legitimate reason,
of course, would be for schools.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bill is not passed this session, both Bush and Perry
would lose _ at least temporarily _ some of their major campaign
promises.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, his goal of seeking $2.6 billion in tax cuts already
is impossible. But his plan to ban social promotion, also included
in Senate Bill 4, will survive. Also salvaged Saturday night was
Perry's call for ``master reading teachers,'' who would be paid
bonuses for their special skills in helping to teach students to
read.

HUSON WORKS HIS WAY AROUND ANGELS INFIELD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Andy Sheets, acquired after shortstop Gary DiSarcina
broke his left hand in spring training, was benched Saturday night
after going hitless in his last 18 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, replaced by Jeff Huson, wasn't expected to provide much
offense. But after he committed his first error in his last 25
games Friday, manager Terry Collins gave him the night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just seemed like a good time,'' Collins said. ``He has given
us more than we could have expected on defense. A rest here and
there isn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, acquired March 29 as part of a deal that sent Phil Nevin
to San Diego, has never played more than 88 games in a season. That
was last year when he split time at short with Chris Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Huson started at first base Thursday against Baltimore and moved
to third Friday to give slumping Troy Glaus a breather. Glaus, who
entered the game with just three hits in his last 43 at-bats,
returned to the lineup and hit a two-run home run in the sixth
inning, his sixth of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Huson came in batting .375 (3 for 8) on the homestand and
singled, stole a base and scored the Angels' second run in the
fourth inning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Draft update: The Angels do not have a pick in Wednesday's 1999
amateur draft until 68th, one ahead of the Dodgers' first
selection. Their first pick (No. 17) went to Boston as compensation
for signing Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 10 (including DH) projected opening-day starters
are products of the Angels farm system, including former No. 1s
Chuck Finley (Jan. 1985), Darin Erstad (June 1995) and Glaus (June
1997).
</P>
<P>
   After losing Jose Offerman, Dean Palmer and Tim Belcher to free
agency, the Royals will have six of the top 58 selections. They
already had the seventh pick overall and added No. 25 and 32 as
compensation for Offerman, who signed with Boston. They received
No. 43 and 54 for Palmer, who went to Detroit. The Royals did not
offer arbitration to Belcher, who signed a two-year, $10.2 million
deal with the Angels, and received no compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Local honors: Before tonight's game, Kansas City pitcher Kevin
Appier will be honored by the Lancaster Pony League for his
contributions to youth baseball in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Appier, who was struck above the left ankle by a line drive
Friday, received treatment before Saturday's game and reported the
injury was much improved.

MARTINEZ WINS 10TH FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ When Pedro Martinez showed up Friday at Jacobs Field
with the mistaken notion it was his turn to pitch, Nomar
Garciaparra shook his head and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Pedro,'' the Red Sox shortstop said. ``That doesn't
surprise me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, after Garciaparra helped make Martinez the
majors' first 10-game winner with a tiebreaking, three-run home run
in the Red Sox come-from-behind, 4-2 win over the Cleveland
Indians, he was reminded of Martinez's confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing he didn't think it was a 7 o'clock game,''
Garciaparra said. ``He'd probably just be getting up now.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a shame for anyone to sleep through this one,
an exquisitely played exercise that Martinez, for all his
magnificence (nine strikeouts and no walks in eight innings), stood
to lose until the Sox rallied in the eighth for four runs against
the Indians' own Dominican dandy, Bartolo Colon, and two relievers.
</P>
<P>
   And Garciaparra hardly looked the part of the hero against
Indians reliever Paul Shuey, when he was called for two check-swing
strikes and fouled back Shuey's potential punchout pitch. But then
Shuey left a split-fingered fastball at Garciaparra's waist, and
the Sox shortstop drove it 409 feet into the left-field seats, his
third home run in two games at Jacobs Field, his fourth in four
games, and ninth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those moments that had Sox manager Jimy Williams
sounding like Shirley MacLaine again, except Ms. MacLaine, for all
her past-life experiences, has not been introduced to Ty Cobb yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's those guys he used to play with,'' Williams said,
when asked to explain Garciaparra's knack for the grand gesture.
``I don't know. Some guys do it. They're just special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians threatened to upstage the Sox in the ninth, when
Martinez, his right hip aching, was lifted by Williams after giving
up a broken-bat single to Kenny Lofton to open the inning. Lofton,
the Indians' leadoff man, had three of the team's five hits off
Martinez, all singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hit was just like the one Lofton had in the eighth inning
last fall,'' Williams said, alluding to Lofton's rally-starter in
the playoff game that ended the Sox' season last October.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Tom Gordon walked the first two batters he faced, loading
the bases with nobody out for Manny Ramirez, who leads the planet
in runs batted in (60 in 47 games). But Gordon induced Ramirez to
ground to John Valentin, who stepped on third and threw across the
diamond for a double play as Lofton scored. After a walk to Jim
Thome, Gordon dropped a third-strike curveball on a mesmerized
Travis Fryman to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Watching those last three outs should have been as
nerve-wracking to Martinez as anything he faced through the first
eight innings. After giving up a run on two singles and a sacrifice
fly by Roberto Alomar in the first, Martinez didn't allow another
runner past first, retiring 23 of 25 batters until the ninth.
Martinez threw just 98 pitches, 72 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   While there may have been an epidemic of migraines among those
watching at home, Martinez claimed he never entertained a single
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get nervous,'' he said. ``The worst that can happen is
we lose the game. I know I have one of the best, if not the best
closer, in the last two years. I trust that man. I don't care if he
gives it up. Hopefully, he'll keep it all together, but I don't
care about the fact that the game is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust him. I trust everybody on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Martinez feels trust, the Indians should have fear. Six
times they have faced Martinez, including the playoff opener last
fall, and have lost to him five times. He has held them to just 33
hits and nine earned runs in 49 innings (1.65 ERA), while striking
out 51.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is doing it to everybody, of course _ his eighth
straight win improved his record to 10-1, with a 2.01 ERA _ but the
Indians, who still have the majors' best record (32-15) despite
losing two straight to the Sox, can't be relishing the thought of
seeing him again come October.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws all his pitches and he throws them for strikes,''
Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``On Manny Ramirez's first
at-bat, he threw a curveball and he got him out. (David) Justice
came up, and he's throwing 2-and-1, 2-and-2 changeups for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't throw a straight pitch. If it's up around the
waist, it's there for a purpose. If he's not the best pitcher in
the game, he's one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone else better right now.''

 CAP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The wrong horse got all the publicity. While
high-profile trainer Bob Baffert was making the grand tour of
Boston on behalf of his charge, 1997 Kentucky Derby-winner Real
Quiet, Jim Bond was up at Saratoga, quietly preparing Behrens for
Saturday's running of the $600,000 Massachusetts Handicap at
Suffolk Downs. This time, the silent treatment worked, as Behrens
wore down English invader Running Stag in the final yards to
prevail, while Real Quiet tired badly turning for home, and
finished a well-beaten third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in Saratoga nobody knows my phone number or my
address,'' said Bond, who did not bring Behrens to Suffolk until 7
a.m. Saturday. ``If he had been beaten, I'd have been a bum and
been thrown out of Boston. But Behrens likes his own environment.
He likes it up at Saratoga. If we ship him, sometimes he goes off
his feed. I don't like to ship him around. He ate breakfast just an
hour early at home and we put him on the van at 2:45 a.m. I thought
we had a good shot this way. This horse just gets better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   When the gate opened, Running Stag, who has shown very little
speed in his four previous races in the United States, sprang to
the front under Shane Sellers, sending a ripple through the crowd
of 17,174 with the unexpected move. Running Stag was closely
followed by Real Quiet, handled by Gary Stevens in his last ride in
the United States before switching his tack to England, and
Behrens, ridden by Jorge Chavez. Chavez was intent on stalking
Stevens, and the three raced in close contention, Running Stag on
the inside and Real Quiet in the middle, to the quarter pole. But
when the real running began, Real Quiet dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was three-wide, but that was the best part of the track,''
said Chavez, who had a great day overall, with three wins in four
rides on the card. ``Stevens tries to keep me out there, but I
didn't mind because it was the better going. When the other horse
(Running Stag) went to the lead. I didn't change anything in my
mind. I have a lot of confidence in Behrens, very, very much so.
So, I knew he could finish well. I was keeping my eyes on Real
Quiet, I wasn't really concerned with the other horse. At the
quarter pole, I realized I had more horse than Gary. I said to
myself: `This is my race.' But the other horse kept going. Then I
said: `Oops!' I have to go to work. I always thought I'd catch him,
but he kept going. Finally, I got him at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin was just a half-length, a measure that prevented a
daylight heist by an 8-1 shot. Real Quiet was sent off a favorite
at 4-5, while Behrens was 9-10 ($3.80 to win). The time for the
mile and one-eighth was 1:49, and Behrens needed nearly every inch
of that distance to gain the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when Running Stag went to the lead,'' said Bond.
``I was hoping there'd be a rabbit in the race, but I didn't expect
it to be him. And, I was surprised we were three-wide. Our game
plan was just to stay close to Real Quiet. I've been riding Jorge
for so long, that I know when he's in trouble and when he's not.
When he got to the turn, I knew he had a great shot. On paper it
didn't look like anybody wanted the lead. But things change very
rapidly when you get in these big races and Jorge made a great
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, a 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony, was already the
leader in the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's Champions
series, and he picked up six more points for his MassCap victory,
for a total of 28. Owned by William Clifton of Waco, Texas, and Ann
and Donald Rudder of Avon, Conn., Behrens, who also has won the
Gulfstream Park and Oaklawn handicaps, has a chance to become the
Handicap Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in what kind of horse he is, but I wanted to show
the world,'' said Bond. ``He has not gotten much respect for an
NTRA standing leader. In fact, I hardly ever hear his name
mentioned. Basically, he's matured. He knows who he is. He has the
will to win. He's got it down, got it down pat. It's going to take
a good horse to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond isn't sure what's next for Behrens, but the Breeders' Cup
(At Gulfstream Nov. 6) is the ultimate goal. For now, the horse and
horseman will return to their humble ways at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to bragging, you get in trouble,'' said Bond. ``I
want to keep my big mouth shut and let the horse do the talking.''

NY IS STILL ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thank God for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   New York's dysfunctional family has given us more than our share
of intrigue and entertainment in the last month. It has also given
us something in all too short supply: a rivalry. Or, shall we say,
as much of a rivalry as can exist in this era.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Knicks meet an Indiana Pacers team that literally
cut its playoff teeth against New York. Earlier, the Knicks went
down to the last shot to eliminate the Miami Heat, another
crypto-rival.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps best of all, the Knicks spared us the indignity of
having to watch an Atlanta-Indiana conference final.
</P>
<P>
   We won't even begin to contemplate the corporate intrigue from
the last month. It's ongoing. Peter Vecsey of the New York Post
called for coach Jeff Van Gundy's head on Friday while, in the same
space, pronouncing that Garden boss Dave Checketts is the Mormon
Tabernacle Liar.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, we think, we'll get back to basketball Sunday.
Reggie Miller has been salivating for New York ever since the
Pacers dispatched Philadelphia in four games. Small wonder. He has
scored 30 or more points seven times in 23 playoff games against
the Knicks. Only Michael Jordan (15 times) has done that more often
to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the fourth time in six years that the teams have
met, and each series has had its share of Miller Moments.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5, Eastern Conference finals, 1994: Miller scored 25 of his
39 points in the fourth quarter, including 19 in less than six
minutes, to rally Indiana from a 12-point deficit to a 93-86
victory and a 3-2 lead in the series. He had five 3-pointers and
one choke hold directed at Spike Lee. Alas, the Knicks won the
series in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1, Eastern Conference semifinals, 1995: Miller scored 10
points in the final minute to give Indiana an utterly improbable
107-105 victory. The Pacers trailed, 105-99, with 18.7 seconds to
play, but then scored 8 unanswered points, all by you-know-who.
Miller tied the game on two treys in a space of 3.1 seconds. Then
he made two free throws with 7.5 seconds left to win the game.
Miller also had 29 in the seventh game as Indiana won the series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4, Eastern Conference semifinals, 1998: New York was a
rebound away from tying the series, 2-2. But a loose ball ended up
in Miller's hands as time was winding down and he drained a
wide-open trey to send the game into overtime. He went on to score
a playoff-best 38 _ including 7 in overtime _ as the Pacers won,
118-107. They then closed out the Knicks at home to win the series
in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff time is Miller time. Since the Pacers became a serious
playoff regular (1993-94, starting with the Larry Brown era),
Miller has increased his scoring average in the postseason and has
a flair for big moments. New York, it seems, gets to see most of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers-Knicks series has all kinds of subplots. There's the
emergence of the new Knicks, who like to run and don't seem to need
Patrick Ewing. There's Van Gundy's creaky status. Chris Mullin, Sam
Perkins, and Mark Jackson, all are native New Yorkers. Indy
president Donnie Walsh is as well, and he secretly admitted he was
pulling for the Knicks when it became apparent Atlanta was going to
go down without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I only have sentimentality if we win,'' Walsh says.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are playing well. They haven't lost yet in the
postseason. But they also have beaten two teams (Milwaukee,
Philadelphia) who were your basic happy-to-be-there clubs, neither
having been in the postseason since 1991. The Knicks outlasted
Miami and then got Atlanta on a platter. The Hawks may well have
been the most offensively challenged team to participate in the
postseason since the introduction of the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the way we're playing,'' Walsh said. ``We
lost our way somewhere during the season. But then Larry Bird made
some adjustments and we got it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird ended the Pacers' dancing introductions. More important, he
stopped his two-platoon system and started going with his starters,
including Jackson, down the stretch. He also incorporated Derrick
McKey into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all Bird has left is to figure out which Rik Smits is going
to show up and he'll have all his bases covered. And by the way,
Donnie, what about those God-awful black socks everyone's wearing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year our team votes to do something together for the
playoffs and each year they always forget Rik is on the team,''
Walsh said. ``Last year, it was the shaved head. Rik looked awful.
This year, it's the black socks. It wouldn't look so bad if he
didn't wear them so high. But that's how he likes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearances notwithstanding, the Pacers are ready. They'd just
as soon have started Saturday to avoid a conflict with Sunday's
Indy 500, but NBC made the decision for them. Walsh said a lot of
people in town are upset over what they see as a totally
unnecessary conflict. But the game will go on and time will tell if
Miller writes another chapter in his book.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain tried, honest he did, not to trash Shaquille
O'Neal. But, well, Shaq is such an easy (and legitimate) target
that Chamberlain couldn't restrain himself. ``It's a game of
skills,'' he said, pronouncing skills as if it were spelled
``skeels''. ``Not Shaquille.'' O'Neal, if possible, further lowered
himself after the Lakers were humiliated by the Spurs. First, he
again blew off the team meeting for the second straight season.
Then, he took a shot at Penny Hardaway, going so far as to say,
``As soon as I left, all the pressure was on him and he couldn't
handle it. He got his wish for back-dooring Superman.'' This is the
same ``Superman'' whose teams now have been swept out of the
playoffs in four of the last five years. This is the same
``Superman'' who, in the fourth quarters against the Spurs, took 15
shots and made seven. This is the same ``Superman'' who, in those
same fourth quarters, managed two blocks and four rebounds. This is
the same ``Superman'' whose teammates were terrified to give him
the ball down the stretch because they knew he'd be fouled and,
well, how does 2 for 10 sound in a close game? This is the same
``Superman'' who graced the cover of Sports Illustrated wearing a
white tux in a story about players who want to be singer/stars and
vice versa. The Lakers were eliminated a few days later.
Chamberlain referenced a poll in one LA-area paper in which 95
percent of the nearly 1,700 respondents said that Shaq should be
traded. ``He's not doing something right,'' Chamberlain said of
Shaq. ``There's something he's doing wrong and I don't even think
he himself knows what it is. But it's not just Shaq. The whole
Laker organization is in turmoil _ total turmoil.'' Meanwhile, Shaq
has a new motto: ``I've won everywhere but college, the pros, the
Pacific Division, and the Western Conference.'' . . . Former
Georgetown coach John Thompson said there wasn't any truth to
reports that he was being romanced by the Nets. But, he added, that
should not be construed to mean that he's not interested in the
job, or in any NBA job. Au contraire. ``I want to do this,'' he
said. He said his name may have come up in a general discussion
with the Nets a while back, but not in any serious way . . . The
Vancouver Grizzlies are shopping their No. 2 pick for a veteran
power forward. They believe they have enough young pups and don't
believe Elton Brand, whom some scouts believe will measure 6 feet 6
inches or 6-6 1/2 in Chicago, is the guy . . . Several general
managers say the Celtics aren't just shopping Ron Mercer, they're
all but putting him up for auction . . . Jalen Rose on Bird in this
week's Sporting News: ``He doesn't walk around with his 1989 press
clippings in his pocket.'' No, he doesn't. He played six games that
year.

   Seattle GM Wally Walker flew in for the Bill Russell tribute and
said he's confident Vin Baker will be back to All-Star form next
season. Walker had better be right. Baker dropped like a stone this
year, reporting out of shape and then getting hurt. He was a
monstrous disappointment. ``He'll be back, playing at the level he
was before,'' Walker said, saying Baker will stay in shape by
playing in the US Olympic qualifier in July. Baker is expected to
opt out next month and then the fun should really begin. As for the
Sonics, Walker said, ``We're not going to overreact to a 50-game
season. We felt we had a real solid team. We just have to shore up
our weaknesses.'' . . . Rick Pitino went on WEEI this past week and
said the state of college basketball was abysmal. He's right. The
NBA and its union blew a golden chance to improve two games _ the
college and the pro _ by failing to enact punitive salary scales
for kids leaving school early. There's only one reason why the
exodus continues _ money. If the union and league had adopted
scales based on years of school, and made the money a severe
deterrent rather than a panacea, the kids might stay in school,
grow up, play college ball and actually be ready for the NBA . . .
The Sixers' Theo Ratliff sat out Game 4 of the team's series with
Indiana because of a strained calf and took some heat _ anonymously
_ from teammates. He was not happy about it. ``I know myself,'' he
told reporters last week. ``If I was able to get out there, I would
have. That's all that matters, if I know in my heart that I would
never do anything to get out of it.'' Ratliff finished third in the
league in blocked shots in the first year of a seven-year, $62
million deal. His agent, Joel Bell, said Ratliff should have come
out long before then. ``He played the last part of last season on a
knee that was so bad, the doctor said stop and have the surgery
right now,'' Bell said. ``He did have the surgery after the
season.''

   The city of Charlotte launched a trial balloon this past week
and the Hornets promptly shot it down. The question: What if the
city offered to pay 30 percent of a new arena? The answer? Not
enough. The next two arenas, Miami and Indiana, are roughly 50/50
partnerships and that's what the Hornets are looking for. But as
long as the hated George Shinn is in charge _ he already drove off
Michael Jordan _ there will be little interest in helping the
Hornets . . . The Utah Jazz face an interesting future. They have
seven free agents, among them Karl Malone, Jeff Hornacek, and John
Stockton. Malone picked a bad time to deliver the worst scoring
game of his playoff career _ 8 points on 3-of-16 shooting _ in
Portland's clinching victory Thursday night. ``I'll get over it,''
Malone said. ``I just couldn't get anything going and I'll be
enough of a man to say that.'' If, as expected, Malone wins his
second Most Valuable Player Award, it'll be the first time since
1988 that the winner's team didn't at least get to the conference
finals. Jordan won the first of his five that season and the Bulls
lost in the conference semis to the Pistons. How much money do you
think you'd have made had you bet in January that the Lakers, Jazz,
or Rockets would not make it to the conference finals?

REVOLUTION FIND SCORING TOUCH

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Revolution discovered an effective
midfield attack and broke their scoring slump Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. But
their trademark, defense-first approach suffered as they played to
a 3-3 tie with the MetroStars, then won the postmatch shootout.
</P>
<P>
   During the first two-thirds of the game, the Revolution
displayed some of their best offense of the season in snapping a
360-minute scoreless streak. Giovanni Savarese scored twice in his
return to Giants Stadium after three seasons with the MetroStars.
But the Revolution twice squandered the lead in a wide-open, sloppy
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept the ball a lot and showed we have the ability to play
some football,'' said midfielder Ivan McKinley, whose 21st-minute
goal was the Revolution's first since May 1. ``But this season, we
never got down, not for one minute. If you look at our losses, only
three have been in regulation time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, who host Chicago Saturday, moved into a tie with
the MetroStars for fourth place in the Eastern Conference with
eight points in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time this season the Revolution have shown
the resourcefulness to rally after trailing. Eduardo Hurtado's
sixth-minute goal was the fourth this season the Revolution have
surrendered in the first 10 minutes of a game.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley tied the score by placing a header off the inside of
the left post in the 21st minute. Defender Dan Calichman started
the sequence by moving into attack, then Savarese found John
Harkes, who chipped to McKinley about 15 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution then took command of the midfield. Jair moved to
central midfield as Harkes went to the right side, Kris Kelderman
retained his supporting role, and McKinley took the left side.
</P>
<P>
   In the 34th minute, Savarese's first goal gave the Revolution
their first advantage since a 3-1 win over D.C. United April 24.
Kelderman drove a pass from the center circle to Harkes, who
penetrated to the end line and scrambled a pass to Joe-Max Moore,
who then found Savarese unmarked 12 yards from goal. Savarese sent
a low shot off MetroStars keeper Mike Ammann's left hand for a 2-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese scored his fourth goal of the season and 45th of his
MLS career early in the second half after an Arley Palacios free
kick had tied the score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars capitalized on controversial decisions by referee
Ali Mohammed Bujsaim of the United Arab Emirates. Calichman was
called for a foul on Hurtado, then Mohammed Bujsaim cautioned
Savarese as the Revolution defensive wall was forced back even
beyond the 10-yard norm. Palacios's curving free kick into the
upper left corner of the net left goalkeeper-coach Walter Zenga no
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it wasn't a foul, then he moved the wall back 12
to 15 yards, so we might as well not have had a wall,'' Calichman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearing to be offside, Savarese quickly finished with
a left-footed drive for a 3-2 lead in the 54th minute. But the
MetroStars launched themselves into attack and Hurtado and Petter
Villegas set up Brian Kelly for the tying goal in the 58th minute
as the game accelerated into a frenetic pace.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute, Revolution substitute Jamar Beasley bumped
Ammann and the ball into the net, but the goal was rightfully
disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes scored the lone shootout goal for the Revolution. Backup
goalie Jeff Causey replaced Zenga with two minutes to play and made
one save in the shootout.

AS SABRES MOVE ON, JUNEAU FUTURE UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ He has heard the rumors, but the sound of Ottawa
doesn't ring quite right to Joe Juneau's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep hearing that, too,'' said Juneau, the former Bruin who
will be an unrestricted free agent as of July 1. ``But Ottawa
doesn't make sense, because everything I read, they'll have trouble
paying the players they already have. So I doubt I'm going there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Juneau carries on here with the Sabres, now
with a chance of playing in the Stanley Cup finals for the second
year in a row. Washington's top scorer in last year's playoffs, he
was dealt to the Sabres at the March 23 trade deadline, Buffalo
hoping that he could add some touch to the power play. He popped in
his third postseason goal Thursday night against the Maple Leafs,
finishing off a shorthanded strike and his 10th point in 12 playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   But where will Juneau be when the season ends?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right here _ I hope they make me an offer,'' he said, before
the Sabres beat the Leafs, 5-2, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in Game 4 of the
Eastern Conference finals. ``I like it here, and if they sign me, I
won't feel so much like a rent-a-player.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone going forward with Juneau, the rent these days is
high, which probably does exclude the small-market Senators from
getting into the bidding. Following his successful '98 playoffs
when he collected 17 points in 21 games, Juneau signed a one-year
contract extension with the Caps that brought him $2.2 million. The
Sabres ended up paying about $350,000 of that to bring him in for
the stretch drive. The market changes hour to hour in the NHL, but
it's conceivable Juneau's next deal could be worth $8 million to
$10 million over the next three or four years _ even if his
offensive productivity has diminished the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner (John Rigas) has talked to me a couple of times and
he's told me, `We're going to do what we can to keep you,' '' said
Juneau, who, like Rigas, is an RPI alum. ``So that's nice. It's
more than I ever heard from Harry (Sinden, the Bruins' president
and general manager).''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres also have their budget restraints, and despite what
Rigas may be saying, it likely would be a stretch for Juneau to be
back here in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, now that they've ditched the likes of Mark Recchi
and Vincent Damphousse, could be enticed by Juneau. He's a Quebec
kid, and at, say, $3 million a year, he'd be making less than what
Recchi and Damphousse made last season. The Rangers could come
calling, too, especially if they begin striking out with their
lengthy wish list, which is believed to contain Theo Fleury and
Damphousse, among others. If the price were right, Juneau also
could be an interesting pickup for St. Louis, where a partnership
with Pierre Turgeon would have the potential of boosting both their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Word around Ottawa is that former Sabres forward and coach Rick
Dudley, the Senators general manager last season, soon will hitch
on with Tampa Bay as the Bolts' new president. Dudley actually had
the GM job in Tampa last year, but was detoured to Ottawa when Art
Williams cut in line and bought the team before Bill Davidson could
finalize his own offer. A year later, Williams has sold to the
76-year-old Davidson, Dudley's former employer with the Detroit
Vipers (IHL). A possible deterrent to Dudley signing on with the
Bolts: the Senators' wish for compensation; one report had them
seeking Rob Zamuner from the Bolts. A couple of names that have
popped up as Dudley's potential successor: Pierre Page and John
Muckler. Page is still looking for work after being let go a year
ago as the Ducks' coach. Muckler makes $1 million a year as the
Rangers' coach. Unless the Blueshirts were to bump him out from
behind the bench, he wouldn't be headed to the Senators . . . The
Rangers also have former Bruin Stephane Quintal on their free-agent
shopping list. The ``Q'' wanted a new deal in Montreal last summer,
but the Habs balked. They finally came up with a four-year offer,
worth about $8.4 million, around the All-Star break, but Quintal
didn't bite . . . How costly is the waiting game? The Rangers just
committed $34 million to Brian Leetch for the next four years (at
$6.5 million next year he'll make $500,000 more than Ray Bourque).
Had the Blueshirts done the deal last year, the four-year extension
likely would have been in the $25 million to $28 million range. But
when the Avalanche cut Peter Forsberg's new deal at $10 million per
season, the ante went up for everyone _ one more time . . . Toronto
coach Pat Quinn has seen enough of Dominik Hasek dropping his stick
in the crease, a move the Czech goalie has perfected, almost every
time he gets in trouble around the cage. ``To me,'' said Quinn,
``that's a penalty. A forward can't do it, so why should a goalie
be allowed?'' Perhaps Quinn is right, but Hasek was victimized by
the antic in Game 3 of the Toronto series. He was still without his
paddle when an Alexander Karpovtsev slapper whistled past him after
deflecting off Alexei Zhitnik's boot. Zhitnik had just finished
turning back to the play after pushing Hasek's stick back into the
crease. It's usually a successful prank, but that time the prank
was on Hasek . . . I'm not sure what this means, but Minnesota has
12,000 girls playing ice hockey . . . Meanwhile, a favorite
Minnesota son, Lance Pitlick, should cash in big this summer. The
Senators' character defenseman, who spent about six years in the
minors before making it to the big time, recently was declared an
unrestricted free agent . . . A recent survey showed that 29 of the
top 52 draft picks in '97 _ including Calgary first-rounder Daniel
Tkaczuk, the sixth pick _ remained unsigned. Clubs have until
Tuesday to get those picks under contract or they will be placed
back into this year's draft. The Bruins last week had yet to come
to terms with '97 picks Jim Baxter (180) or Eric Van Acker (218).
Ben Clymer (27) is looking to be declared a free agent, but his
case is headed to arbitration . . . WBZ Radio's Bob Beers, who
doubles as a Providence Bruins blue-liner, would have some trouble
holding the microphone these days. Slashed in Game 3 of the
Providence-Fredericton playoff series last week, his left middle
finger was fractured in six places.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ted Leonsis, the AOL executive who awaits league approval as new
majority owner of the Capitals, flew unannounced to Boston for one
of the Bruins-Sabres playoff games and watched from the stands.
``It was great stuff, a lot of fun,'' Leonsis told the Washington
Post. ``I got there early and walked around every floor of the
building. We could learn a lot from them.'' Prior to convincing Abe
Pollin to sell him the Capitals, Leonsis failed in earlier bids to
buy the Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Dodgers . . . The Wings
announced Friday that Scotty Bowman will be back to coach next
season. ``I looked at the alternatives,'' Bowman said, ``and they
weren't all that attractive.'' In other words, he didn't want to
retire or move into scouting. He also knows, at age 65, that his
working years are growing short. ``When I was in Pittsburgh, and
the late Bob Johnson was coaching _ he took the job, I guess, in
his late 50s _ he would always relate everything to golf,''
recalled Bowman. ``He said then that he was on the back nine.
That's how I feel, too. I don't know what hole I'm on, but I'm on
the back nine.'' . . . Two of Bowman's top aides in Detroit, Dave
Lewis and Barry Smith, could be on some clubs' short lists for a
head coaching job. The Kings could have an eye on Lewis, who played
for them between stops on Long Island and in New Jersey. Smith was
runner-up to Jim Schoenfeld two years ago in Phoenix. GM Bobby
Smith dismissed Schoenfeld last week, just about a week after
voters resoundingly accepted the formation of a stadium district
aimed at building the Coyotes a new 18,000-seat arena at what is
now a dying shopping mall (Los Arcos) on the Phoenix/Scottsdale
border . . . Less than a month to go before the expansion draft and
the Atlanta Thrashers still haven't named a coach. GM Don Waddell
said last week that he expects to bring a handful of candidates to
Atlanta next month for final interviews . . . The Minnesota Wild
expect to have a GM named around July 4. Some of the reported
candidates include: Les Jackson, Dave McNab, Mike Smith, Paul
Holmgren, Herb Brooks, and Page.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether the Penguins will exist next season. Mario
Lemieux reworked his proposal last week for presentation to
bankruptcy judge Bernard Markovitz, which leaves the whole process
only one step from being offered on E-Bay. The league even has
talked publicly about the franchise being dissolved, which would
mean the likes of Jaromir Jagr would be up for grabs in some form
of dispersal/purchase draft. Remember, Markovitz has to protect the
creditors (some 200 of whom are owed approximately $125 million),
which means selling off the players and going out of biz really
isn't an option . . . Last week's tribute to Celtics great Bill
Russell has me thinking. May 10, 2000 will be the 30th anniversary
of Bobby Orr's overtime goal that clinched the 1970 Stanley Cup for
the Bruins. Imagine the crowd inside the Vault if Orr and pals were
brought together again on that date. Imagine the charity money it
would generate . . . There's a lot to like about Buffalo _ contrary
to what my pal Dan Shaughnessy writes _ but Sabres fans should feel
ashamed over the derisive chants they fired Bourque's way at Marine
Midland Arena during the Boston-Buffalo series. Foolish. What would
they have thought if Gil Perreault had received the same treatment?
Now, as for the city, without doubt Buffalo is in sad decay. But
there are a lot of bad cities in America. The shame of Buffalo is
not what it is, but that it refuses to play to its strengths (i.e.
waterfront, large surrounding population base, superb highway
infrastructure leading to Toronto, Boston, Manhattan, Cleveland,
and Pittsburgh). It could be one of the Northeast's great cities,
yet it just sits there with a dunce cap pulled over its eyes _ very
similar to what Boston had become by the mid-'60s . . . I'll listen
to sports radio again when someone approaches the art that David
Brudnoy displays nightly on WBZ. The media industry is a copycat
commerce. Why can't someone in sports take the Brudnoy schematic,
raise the standard (if there is one), and see what comes out of the
box? . . . It's not a fait accompli that Brian Sutter is back as
Flames coach next season. Management has picked up the option on
his contract, but the former Bruins coach would like a bump in pay
(he made less than $300,000 in US dollars last season) and a
contract extension. Coaches on one-year deals find it hard to
command respect from players, who figure the guy behind the bench
is a lame-duck boss . . . The big winner in the bounce of the
Ping-Pong balls in the NHL lottery drawing was Chicago. The
Blackhawks would have picked No. 8 overall but, with only a 3.7
percent chance of having their ball picked first, got bumped up to
No. 4. It's their best position since 1984, when they claimed Ed
Olczyk at No. 3. The Hawks also have the No. 23 pick. Perhaps they
could package the No. 23 with Alexei Zhamnov and land another prime
pick . . . The Cleveland Lumberjacks will be Chicago's IHL
affiliate next season, after Tampa Bay, under new ownership,
switched to the Detroit Vipers. Cleveland will have no fewer than
three coaches: Phil Russell, Blair MacDonald, and Perry Ganchar,
one of whom will get the No. 1 job. MacDonald, Wayne Gretzky's
first right wing in Edmonton, scored 46 goals in the Great One's
sidecar, prompting Oilers boss Glen Sather to say, ``A fire hydrant
could score 40 goals playing with Gretzky.'' . . . Speaking of
Gretzky, he was in the Madison Square Garden audience last Friday
night for the Daytime Emmy Awards, sitting with wife Janet Jones
and the cast of ``One Life to Live.'' During his playing days,
Gretzky appeared on ``The Young and the Restless,'' playing a thug
(``I'm Wayne from the Edmonton operation'').

DODGERS' PEREZ GETS SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carlos Perez has had discussions with Dodgers ace and
Mr. Work Ethic, Kevin Brown, the past few days. And manager Davey
Johnson wanted to get Perez out of Saturday's game with only
positive thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Dodgers were looking out for the puzzling
left-hander, but the biggest difference might be that Perez was
looking out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to play around a lot before the game, but he was
acting like this was more of a championship game,'' Dodgers catcher
Angel Pena said. ``He concentrated. He was different when he came
in (the clubhouse).''
</P>
<P>
   He was different on the mound, too.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed two hits in five shutout innings and got help from
four relievers as the Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves 2-1 in front
of a season-high 49,258 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's first win since April 30 also marked the first time in
four starts he's allowed less than four runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Kevin Brown was saying, `One pitch at a time, one
out at a time,''' said Perez, who improved to 2-6 and lowered his
ERA to 5.73. ``I really prepared myself. I never beat Atlanta (at
Turner Field). I just changed things a little bit. I used a lot of
fastballs inside. My velocity was a little better, especially when
you have an idea of what you're doing and you know where (the ball)
is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves lefty Tom Glavine (3-6) allowed six hits in seven
innings, but his downfall was an uncharacteristic four walks, three
in succession in the fifth inning. Though the Dodgers went 0 for 15
with runners in scoring position, Glavine issued bases-loaded walks
to Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wanted a lead for Perez in the middle of the game and
got it. Though Perez threw only 71 pitches, after he hit Bret Boone
with a pitch and Chipper Jones reached on an error in the sixth,
Johnson went to his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jamie Arnold got a pair of ground balls, the second
resulting in a double play to end the sixth. Jones homered off Alan
Mills in the eighth, but closer Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his
11th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if I got a chance to give him a win after five innings,
I'll do whatever I have to,'' Johnson said. ``If I had to use Shaw
in the eighth, I would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As adamant as Johnson was about getting Perez out of the game
feeling good, Perez and Pena were equally insistent about pitching
inside. Pena said that's why Perez hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the one that gets him over the hump,'' Johnson
said. ``I think a game like this can help ease the pressure. He
wasn't going to lose it. I wasn't going to let it happen. I needed
something positive for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez admitted he's been feeling the weight of signing a
three-year, $15 million contract during the offseason, especially
since he hasn't performed nearly the way he did last season when he
went 4-4 with a 3.24 ERA in 11 starts with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's velocity dipped to the low 80s on his fastball a few
starts ago, but it was back to the mid-80s against the Braves.
Things were going so poorly for Perez that five innings and no runs
qualifies as a windfall pitching performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really needed a win, and for it to keep going,'' Perez said.
``This year, I'm not going too good. I make good money, the team
takes care of me. I hope everything changes beginning with
tonight.''

 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ So the parties in this split between the Indy
Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams are talking.
Actually, they have been talking for quite some time. The fact that
there is even a dialogue is a positive development, but,
unfortunately, it is the only one in the ongoing discussions
between Tony George, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president and
IRL founder, and Andrew Craig, CART chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, the talks were joined last week
by NASCAR president Bill France and CART board member and car owner
Roger Penske, both of whom have a vested interest in bringing about
a reconciliation between the warring open-wheel series after their
two companies _ International Speedway Corporation and Penske
Motorsports _ merged earlier this month into a mega-motorsports
enterprise that will control 10 tracks throughout the country, with
four more on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to published reports that the IRL and CART were on
the verge of a merger, George confirmed there indeed had been a
meeting last Thursday in Indy between the principals, but he denied
that the sides had reached any kind of accord. He even went so far
as to suggest the story was planted by CART operatives ``in order
to manipulate their stock price,'' and to ``distract from this
race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no indication, from what I've picked up on, that
we're any closer in philosophy,'' George said. ``Talking may lead
to something, but as we talk today there's nothing that leads me to
believe we're closer (to a reconciliation).''
</P>
<P>
   All this, of course, should come as disheartening news to
open-wheel racing fans who would like nothing more than to see the
IRL and CART patch up their differences, reunite in a new series _
which could be called, quite simply, Indy Car _ and regain whatever
losses they have suffered in this costly and fractious dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It only seemed to get worse Thursday when Leo Mehl, the IRL's
executive director, openly groused that the only way a
reconciliation could be reached was if there was a compromise on
the engine rules, which appears to be the biggest stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the IRL is concerned, there is no room for
compromise,'' said Mehl, who launched into a harangue against CART
when asked about reports of a merger. ``I don't know anything about
that, but let me tell you my take on it. Just call it the May
Whine. The CART guys get the May Whine. They sit around in their
wine cellars and they see 50 hours of Indy on TV. There's a lot of
pressure from their sponsors; some of their sponsors are upset that
they don't have the right equipment. It's worse this year than I've
ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   CART officials have refused to engage the IRL in a war of
rhetoric. Ron Richards, CART's vice president of communications,
indicated that it was CART's intent to continue to work toward a
mutually beneficial reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I was disappointed in that comment,'' Penske said,
referring to George's remark about the series still being far apart
in philosophies. ``Because I think that the conversations that have
taken place, and I'm sure there have been many, they're genuine and
they're positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that was really what Tony was thinking,'' he
added. ``I know that Leo had some real sharp comments, but, really,
when you're trying to bring something together, comments by people
who are key really should be guarded so you work towards a solution
and not to drive the process further apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what encouraging developments the talks had produced,
George said, ``I can't say that we're encouraged about anything. I
think the media, in this case, jumped to conclusions. I can tell
you that we're going about our business and I'm sure they are doing
the same thing. All I can say is that anybody (from CART) who
chooses to run here is going to have to do so under the rules that
we have in place, and it's going to have to be for the series.
They're all welcome to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   But not until, it seems, CART first returns on its knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the fun times I had in the week or two we'd
spend at Indy, going to St. Elmo's and a lot of the stuff we'd used
to do, we miss that,'' Penske said. ``And certainly, we'd like to
see that come back, but we need to think positively and there's no
question, in my mind, that we can pull this back together. But one
man's got to make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our group is poised and ready to sit down and put it
together,'' he added. ``And I think they're prepared to put
something on the table that would be rational and easy to do and
everybody would win, but we'll see where this takes us.''
</P>
<P>

   After finishing runner-up to Jeff Gordon in the last two
Coca-Cola 600s, Rusty Wallace, driver of the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford
Taurus, hopes the third time will be the charm in Sunday night's
NASCAR Winston Cup race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C.
``Two years ago we led the 600 right until the end and got beat by
another team taking only two tires while we got four,'' Wallace
said. ``Then last year we led the thing until the very end and got
beat by a team taking on four tires when we got two. The thing is
that we lost them both to the same team and driver.''
Coincidentally, Gordon made a daring late-race move against Wallace
that, for all intents and purposes, wrested the lead and the
victory away from him in the 1999 Daytona 500. ``It really gets
frustrating to see the big wins like those just slip right through
your fingers when you're so close to winning them,'' Wallace said.
``It's doubly frustrating when it seems like it's the same guys
always taking away your big paycheck.'' . . . Dale Earnhardt Jr.,
the 24-year-old son of the seven-time Winston Cup champion, will
make his debut in Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600 after an impressive
qualifying effort Wednesday night in his Budweiser-sponsored
Chevrolet Monte Carlo (184.407 m.p.h.) that even outdid his old
man, who qualified 15th fastest (183.692 m.p.h.). It was the
culmination of Earnhardt's much-anticipated debut after Budweiser
announced a record $50 million-plus sponsorship deal with the
reigning Busch Grand National champion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr. said he was ``running on 8 to 8 1/2 cylinders''
after getting back behind the wheel of his car after suffering a
broken right ankle on the first turn of the season opener at
Homestead, Fla. ``I'm better, much better,'' he said . . .
Indianapolis Motor Speedway will honor the nation's 116 living
Congressional Medal of Honor winners at Sunday's race, including
three from Massachusetts: Thomas G. Kelley, a 60-year-old Vietnam
veteran from Boston; Thomas J. Hudner, a 74-year-old Korean War vet
from Concord; and Charles A. MacGillivray, an 82-year-old World War
II vet from Braintree . . . Arie Luyendyk, the pole sitter who is
retiring from open-wheel racing after Sunday's Indy 500, was
selected as an overwhelming favorite in an informal poll of 24
national media members, garnering 11 votes. Greg Ray and Scott
Goodyear tied for second with 4 votes apiece, while Robby Gordon
had 3 and Billy Boat and Kenny Brack each garned 1 vote . . . The
Globe's prediction: We're going with Ray. Last year's dark horse
has blossomed into a thoroughbred. Giddyap, Greg.

GROUP'S RISE MIRRORS REGION'S GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1949, the San Fernando Valley was nothing like
the sprawling, economically vital and diverse center of commerce it
is today.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, everything west of Sepulveda Boulevard
consisted of ranches and farms and orchards, with a few small
communities such as Chatsworth, Northridge and Canoga Park mere
dots in the otherwise rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Los Angeles County was the largest farm crop producer
in the nation, and the Valley was a key part of that.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of local industrial leaders had a different vision
of the Valley. They saw it as a place where people could both live
and work. They wanted to create not just housing, but businesses
where the people who lived in those houses could work.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they wanted to help spur growth by creating a balance
between the houses built and the jobs available.
</P>
<P>
   So they founded the Industrial Association of the San Fernando
Valley, a group dedicated to development, land use and
transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is the group that in 1981 became known as the Valley Industry
and Commerce Association. And it is a group that celebrates its
50th anniversary with a gala dinner Saturday at the Sheraton
Universal Hotel in Universal City.
</P>
<P>
   Has the nonprofit VICA succeeded in its mission? According to
former chairman David Fleming, the answer is a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of VICA is found in the fact that the majority of
people that now live in the San Fernando Valley have jobs in the
San Fernando Valley,'' said Fleming, who attended his first meeting
of the group in 1959. ``That, in effect, is the `A' on VICA's
report card. That never would have happened without VICA.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Valley has grown, so has VICA. Starting out as an
advocacy group focused on development, land use and transportation
issues, VICA's reach has extended beyond that to embrace education,
immigration, welfare and other social and political issues that
members say are crucial for a healthy business and economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, VICA focused on the San Fernando Valley and worked
with local officials to accomplish its goals. Now, it also
represents the neighboring Santa Clarita, Antelope, Conejo and Simi
valleys, and members are no strangers to Sacramento or Washington,
D.C., where they lobby hard on behalf of local interests.
</P>
<P>
   And from a purely volunteer-driven organization, it now has a
professional staff of 20 that helps further the organization's
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key point is the changes in VICA just reflect the
changes in the Valley, the changes in the economy, the changes in
the needs of Valley businesses,'' said Ross Hopkins, who served as
VICA's president in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   According to VICA officials, the association took the lead in
establishing the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda
Basin, expansion of the freeway system through the Valley, and
zoning that encouraged industrial development in the Northwest
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It also influenced the development of Warner Center in Woodland
Hills, Porter Ranch in Northridge, Universal City and Fashion
Square Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   VICA is filled with longtime members such as Sanford Paris, who
runs Encino-based Paris Industrial Parks. He joined VICA in 1968
and is a past chairman of the association.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the now 61-year-old was developing properties in
Pacoima. He was brought into the VICA fold by Walter Burke, a
longtime industrial real estate broker who had chaired the
association's water committee ``and used to regale the board with
the future problems of water for Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, joining the association seemed the natural thing to
do, Paris said. Plus, he was impressed with the membership, which
included top people from the various utilities, banks and the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the movers and shakers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, he witnessed VICA's dramatic growth and its
increasing influence both in and out of the Valley. For example,
VICA members in the early 1970s traveled to Sacramento to help
resolve the controversial issue of where to locate a liquid natural
gas depot.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was to locate it somewhere along the coast. But the
demand for liquid natural gas fell and the facility was never
built.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the association during those years became more inclusive,
drawing in other types of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the name was changed: It's now Valley Industry
!ital!and!off! Commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The changing face of the Valley's business environment also is
reflected in the way its membership has changed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more women, there are more smaller businesses and I
would say the membership is probably younger on balance, despite
all us old people,'' Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   Many past chairpersons left a profound mark on the association.
During Fleming's tenure in 1989 and 1990, for example, VICA
developed its political clout, lobbying to an unprecedented degree
at the state and federal levels on behalf of local business
interests.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   It also began inviting nationally and internationally known
figures such as Henry Kissinger to its annual dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has helped elevate the state of VICA,'' said Fleming, now
chairman of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley. ``We
now do outreach programs to Sacramento and Washington that had
never been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   In the more political and social arena, VICA has actively
supported local bond measures; worked with the city on business tax
reform; supported the Valley's right to study secession and
distributed petitions; supported the North American Free Trade
Agreement; advocated education and welfare reform; and is now
involved in reforming immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   It's all an impressive set of accomplishments, says Stuart
Solomon, a member since 1970 who helped create VICA's education
committee in the middle of that decade. Yet most people simply are
not aware of the crucial role that VICA played in bringing them the
things that they now take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   But it's this track record that keeps Solomon a happy VICA
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of this organization, as you would hear from
the people who've been involved over the years,'' Solomon said.
``It's really done a lot for the Valley.''

VICA TO TARGET TRANSIT, PUBLIC SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over its 50-year life, the Valley Industry and
Commerce Association has grown into one of the most influential
bodies in Los Angeles, extending its interests from business to
encompass educational, social and quality-of-life issues.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the association has reached the half-century mark, what
do current members and officers foresee from VICA in the next 50
years? More of the same, they say, given the association's track
record.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond laboring for a better business environment, the
association will take a more active role in improving
transportation and public safety, said Steve Lew, chairman of the
VICA board and a consultant in civic affairs at Universal Studios
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Also needed is some unity between state and federal immigration
laws, now a confusing mish-mash that cause problems for employer
and employee alike, he said. It's an issue that VICA is already
dealing with at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are issues that will be with us well into the 21st
century as they have been in the 20th,'' Lew said. ``So for those
reasons, VICA's future is very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lew and other members, VICA's focus on such issues
is essential to maintaining and strengthening the region's economy.
And given the region's economic importance, what's good for the
Valley will be good for the state as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality-of-life issues will always be a major focus, not
only for businesses but residents in the greater San Fernando
Valley region,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that VICA will stop looking out for business
interests. On the contrary, association President Bonny L. Herman
expects VICA to expand its role in the business advocacy arena _ in
the Valley and perhaps the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business issues now have no geographic boundaries and,
therefore, VICA can become a Southern California if not a statewide
advocacy brand name,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Hill, an association vice chairman, has seen VICA's role
evolve dramatically in the 10 years he's been a member.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined, the association focused primarily _ though not
exclusively _ on business issues. Over the years, he saw its
influence extend into social areas that only seem to take VICA far
afield from its original intent.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Hill and other members, these issues are
crucial to preserving the region's economy. Simply stated, better
transportation, improved public safety and the like make the Valley
_ and the state _ a better place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state becomes economically healthy it becomes
attractive to businesses ... from around the world,'' said Hill,
vice president of corporate relations at 20th Century Industries
based in suburban Woodland Hills. ``And the reverse is true: The
ability to market California products and California services to
the rest of the world is enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he sees VICA's influence expanding over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see that VICA will play a major role in the promotion and
preservation of the economic vitality of the state of California,
and that VICA will have an increasing role at the national level,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's one disappointment is that VICA's membership isn't
growing fast enough for her satisfaction. VICA now has 330 members,
about half of them small businesses of 20 or fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's a problem that VICA shares with other business groups such
as the Valley's various chambers of commerce. Collectively, she
said, VICA and the chambers have some 7,000 members, yet there are
60,000 businesses in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Her wish for the coming years is to find ``the magic solution''
that will result in more businesses supporting their chambers and
VICA, thus taking ``a more active role in protecting their own
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The collective voices of many are more powerful than a few,''
she said.

TRINIDAD RETAINS IBF CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Felix Trinidad was an advertisement for himself
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF welterweight champion not only crushed the hopes and
several vital organs of Hugo Pineda when he knocked him senseless
with a left hook to the solar plexus in the fourth round but also
made a persuasive argument that he is the best welterweight in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   This may not prove to be the case, because Oscar De La Hoya will
have something to say about that if the two meet as scheduled Sept.
18, but until such time as they do _ and there is not yet an
agreement between Trinidad and promoter Don King to make the match
_ Trinidad cannot make his case any more emphatically than he did
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Roberto Clemente Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Trinidad takes his opponents out with withering shots
to the head that temporarily render a man unconscious, but this
time the damage was done by a string of body shots that left Pineda
gasping for air after three rounds and on the floor and out of both
air and the fight by the end of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me to the body so hard and so much it knocked the air
out of me,'' Pineda (36-2-1) said. ``I was in good condition and
that let me go an extra round. But he punches very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It was evident almost immediately that Trinidad's hand speed was
vastly superior to Pineda's and the challenger realized it as well.
He made few bombing runs in the first two rounds and when he did,
he failed to deliver the payload that had brought him 27 of his 36
victories by knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Pineda would throw occasionally, but Trinidad either eluded his
punches or countered with a quicker return that scored, which is
why the challenger connected on only nine percent of his punches
(23 of 245).
</P>
<P>
   By the third round, the champion had turned into a stalker,
walking ever closer to Pineda in search of the opening he knew he
would find. Once he rocked Pineda in Round 3 and the partisan crowd
of 8,156 bellowed Trinidad's name, but Pineda stayed composed and
no further damage was inflicted beyond his growing reluctance to
move his fists too far away from his own ears as the air slowly
escaped from his belly.
</P>
<P>
   This obviously complicated Pineda's offensive efforts, but in
the very next round Trinidad closed the distance and the show with
two short right hands to the head and a crushing left hook to the
belly that dropped Pineda to the canvas in a crumpled heap.
</P>
<P>
   One hand clung to the bottom rope for a moment as if he might
use it to pull himself upright, but Pineda made no real effort to
move as the champion ran across the ring and climbed up on the
turnbuckle, his arms thrust toward the sky while the referee began
his count.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad remained atop those ropes with his back to Pineda,
supremely sure of his victory until he sullenly glanced over his
shoulder as referee Roberto Ramirez finished his count at 2:53 of
the round.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad not only landed 50 percent of his 151 punches, but in
the final round closed the show like a champion, connecting on 32
of the final 52 he threw.
</P>
<P>
   That Trinidad (35-0, 29 KO) can fight was obvious long before
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, but there remains scant evidence yet that he can
sell, which is what the fight game at his level is all about.
Although his performance Saturday night elevated him further in the
eyes of boxing purists, the IBF champion did nothing to help his
argument for a larger purse than the $8 million guarantee he
already has been offered to face De La Hoya because nearly 4,000
seats were left empty at Clemente Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a matter of boxing business. What Felix Trinidad did
Saturday night to Hugo Pineda was about the fighting business and
on this night, at least, Trinidad was king of that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WBA flyweight champion Leo Gamez (32-6-1, 24 KO) stopped game
but outclassed Josue Dickie Camacho (16-7, 6 KO) at 2:06 of the
eighth round after beating him consistently from first bell to
final punch . . . Former WBA featherweight champion Fred Norwood
(34-0-1, 20 KO) reclaimed the title from the man he first took it
from, winning a boring and foul-marred split decision from Antonio
Cermeno (35-3).

PATRIOTS BRASS PUTS THINKING CAP ON 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Tuesday is the day NFL teams start clearing
out veterans to make salary cap room for their rookies. It's the
day a team can cut a player and be able to spread out the remainder
of his signing bonus over several years, rather than absorbing it
all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Teams like the Patriots, who once plucked defensive lineman
Henry Thomas in a post June 1 move, likely will be active.
</P>
<P>
   According to the team's salary cap guru, vice president Andy
Wasynczuk, and coach Pete Carroll, the Patriots aren't likely to
wield the ax Tuesday, but wait until they get closer to signing
Damien Woody, Andy Katzenmoyer, and Kevin Faulk, their top three
draft picks, who are in line for decent salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing what needs to be done to prepare for things we
have to do in the next few weeks,'' said Carroll. ``We're making
sure we go through all of our options before we do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Their current plight is rather ominous. They are just $35,000
under budget, just enough to pay Zefross Moss's takeout bill but
not enough to sign their rookies, add a veteran defensive tackle or
running back, and continue contract extension talks with Ty Law and
Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk points out that restructuring existing contracts _
namely those of Bruce Armstrong and Ben Coates _ are two obvious
avenues available to them, or they could release players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will be cut at some point during the
summer,'' said Wasynczuk. ``It's not something we're going to do
right away or something we have to do right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' prime candidate for release is offensive tackle
Moss, a player some would argue was the team's most consistent
lineman last year. But he also has a contract that would save the
Patriots a good chunk of money at a position where they have
maneuverability and the need to introduce some youth into the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Moss's 1999 salary is $1.1 million and his pro-rated signing
bonus is $450,000, which the Patriots would have to absorb against
their cap for the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the possibility, much less likely, that if it was
decided that second-year man Tebucky Jones was going to start at
right cornerback, that Steve Israel, in the final year of his
contract, could be cut, providing a savings of $800,000.

   If Todd Rucci was the choice, the team would save his $1.085
million salary, but his pro-rated $560,000 bonus would count
against the cap through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been told anything, and I don't see it,'' said
Rucci's agent, Jack Bechta.
</P>
<P>
   Other less likely possibilities for release include Shawn
Jefferson, who will earn $1.3 million, with the team responsible
for the $518,500 against the cap. Jefferson already has received a
$350,000 roster bonus, which leads one to believe he is safe. Max
Lane, who will be paid $1 million this year, already has been paid
a $100,000 roster bonus. Safety Willie Clay will earn $1.5 million,
but it appears the Patriots want to keep him.

   Carroll says Jones has made so much progress he is a legitimate
candidate to start at the right corner spot. ``We can't wait to get
him out there,'' said Carroll. ``He's shown in some of our drills
the ability to stay with his man. We're very excited about him at
this point. We'll wait and see how he performs in training camp and
in the preseason games, but our inclination right now is to give
him a great chance to win a job.'' . . . Clay, a former teammate of
Barry Sanders, was taken back by the future Hall of Fame running
back's handling of his squabbleswith the Lions, which included
major criticism of the organization from Sanders's father. ``I'm a
little disappointed in Barry,'' said Clay. ``I know it's his
father, but Barry has to step in there and not let those things be
said. It puts the entire organization in an uproar. It puts (coach)
Bobby Ross and the organization in a tough position. Barry is the
best player in the NFL, but I don't know what's wrong with showing
up at least one day for a minicamp just to show his teammates that
he's a part of the team.'' . . . Clay spent last weekend overseeing
his camp in Pittsburgh, which attracted 650 youngsters.

   The Jets' minicamp was swimming with former Patriots last week.
Ray Lucas, who suddenly finds himself the fourth quarterback behind
Scott Zolak and Tom Tupa, may see more duty as a receiver. The Jets
still covet his special teams ability. Keith Byars, meanwhile, was
not in attendance. He has said he'd like to return to the Jets for
another year, but Parcells is looking at his younger players at the
moment . . . Quite a sight at the Jets' camp at Hofstra is Richmond
rookie defensive tackle Marc Megna of Fall River, who likes to work
out after the workout . . . University of New Hampshire running
back Jerry Azumah, drafted by the Bears, already has been converted
to defensive back . . . Dave Meggett has finished school at Towson
and is expected to sign with either Cleveland or Tennessee next
week . . . Todd Burger, the offensive lineman cut by Parcells after
one year on the Jets' roster, is about to resurface again with
either Tampa Bay or Carolina. Burger was signed to a major deal
after Parcells lost out on Rucci. It may or may not be a
coincidence that Burger was the only Jet who didn't show for the
offseason conditioning program last year.

   Local agent Brad Blank said defensive lineman Jeff Lageman has
retired after 10 years, the last four with Jacksonville, but he may
pull a Charles Haley and resurface when a contending team is in
need of a pass rusher. In the meantime, Lageman, a newlywed, may
try his hand at broadcasting . . . Patriots fullback Tony Carter
was married two weeks ago . . . The Patriots managed to avoid one
of those overseas exhibition games that can mess a team up for a
week. Last year, the Patriots didn't make out too badly in Mexico
City, but this year, on Aug. 7, the Chargers and Broncos play in
Sydney's Stadium Australia, site of the 2000 Olympics . . . Members
of the rookie quarterback class will face each other in three
exhibition games. Cleveland's Tim Couch opposes Minnesota's Daunte
Culpepper Aug. 21, Chicago's Cade McNown faces Philadelphia's
Donovan McNabb Sept. 2, and McNabb faces Culpepper Aug. 26. That's
providing the players are signed and ready to go . . . Parcells
praised Zolak in minicamp last week. Zolak arrived in decent shape
and has thrown the ball well. Tupa also impressed with his punting.

   Tests are certainly the fad in this country. We hear of the MCAS
tests for students and tests for teachers, etc. Now agents are
being given 50-question tests on the collective bargaining
agreement, which was due at union offices last Friday. The union
hasn't said what it will do if agents fail it, but they are serious
about agents responding to it . . . Brace yourselves for the new
jargon during NFL telecasts next season when the new instant replay
system is born. The system will use digital computer technology
rather than videotape, as was used from 1986-91. The new system
gives quicker access to replays because there's no tape to rewind.
The four individuals in the replay booth will be called the
``replay assistant, technician, video operator, and communicator.''
The replay assistant is the only link to the referee on the field.
The head coaches can challenge two plays per game, but in the final
two minutes of each half and in overtime, the replay assistant
makes the call as to whether the play is reviewed. The replay
assistant will be someone who has an officiating background. There
will be a buzzer system in place in which the head coach, wearing a
belt pack containing a buzzer, can buzz if he wants to challenge a
call. The buzz goes to the referee and the umpire and to the replay
booth. The communicator has 90 seconds to make the call. Sounds
like a good system, except why is human error no longer acceptable?
``It's a good system,'' said Carroll, who was introduced to it at
the owners' meetings in Atlanta last week. ``It adds a whole new
set of things a head coach has to think about during the game. You
have two shots to challenge and you have to pick those spots
carefully. Like anything else, it'll take a little practice.'' . .
. Boston agent Jack Mula was playing in the Ted Johnson Golf
Tournament in a foursome with taxman Mitch Halpern, and financial
analysts Gino Ellison and Kevin Leahy. The celebrity chosen to play
with Mula's group was Patriots defensive end Brandon Mitchell. ``He
shows up in jeans and work boots with golf clubs that Bobby Jones
probably used,'' said Mula. ``He had never played golf in his life
and he makes two eagle putts from 30-40 feet. On the first hole he
drove the ball about 310 yards. It was unbelievable.'' Mula's group
won the tournament with a 10-under-par score.

BAFFERT TAKES BLAME FOR `TIRED' HORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 60th running of the Massachusetts Handicap Saturday
had just finished at Suffolk Downs and Bob Baffert was asked to
give an analysis of the race his horse, Real Quiet, had just run.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who never looks or sounds flustered in the biggest of
races, offered no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Quiet,'' said Baffert, ``was real tired.''
</P>
<P>
   After a mile-and-an-eighth endurance race on a track that
Baffert said Real Quiet never quite took too, no one would argue
with the trainer's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just came up empty,'' said Baffert, who a year ago watched
Real Quiet come within a nose of winning the Triple Crown, getting
edged out in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk crowd had expected a match race between Behrens and
Real Quiet, the two heavy betting favorites at post time.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet came into Boston as the biggest celebrity in the
race. Baffert, had done radio promos, highlighting the fact that
the MassCap had a Kentucky Derby winner in its field.
</P>
<P>
   When Real Quiet worked out Thursday morning, the Suffolk stable
hands came out for an up-close-and-personal look.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday Baffert recognized a sluggishness in his horse.
</P>
<P>
   Although he showed no initial effects from the plane trip from
Kentucky to New York and a nearly five-hour trip by van to Suffolk,
Real Quiet showed signs of fatigue that Baffert and jockey Gary
Stevens hoped would not show up Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem to like the track,'' said Baffert after a race
in which Running Stag took the lead early and forced Real Quiet to
extend himself in trying to stay with both Behrens and Running
Stag. ``He was having trouble with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the race, Real Quiet was calm coming out of Barn 22 and
in the paddock as Baffert talked casually with Stevens and owner
Michael Pegram. Baffert gave every indication that his horse was
fit to run _ and run well.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after Real Quiet came down the stretch and Stevens
asked him to give the extra boost that had won the Kentucky Derby
and Preakness, there was not enough left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got beat,'' Baffert said. ``The other horses just beat
him. He just didn't kick in. That was my fault. I didn't do a good
enough job in preparing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Baffert said that Real Quiet's unfamiliarity with
the track was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't used to the race track,'' reiterated Stevens, using
an explanation that many beaten favorites use. ``It's a little
different type of track than he's used to. It's a little deeper and
more sandy. But we really had no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   No excuses. No one to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet ran his race and got beat. And as quickly as the race
was run, Baffert and Stevens, who is headed for a long engagement
of racing in England, were gone, running to catch planes.
</P>
<P>
   As for Real Quiet. He spent Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Suffolk. By 6
a.m. Sunday, he was also on the move, sharing a van back to New
York's Belmont Park with Running Stag.

GLAUS COMES ALIVE FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ May is almost over, and Troy Glaus can breathe again.
</P>
<P>
   After a tortuous month that finally resulted in his benching the
night before, Glaus' sixth-inning home run Saturday helped give the
struggling Angels a 4-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often a pitcher can be overshadowed when he has a
no-hitter in the sixth inning and a chance for his first career
shutout into the ninth, but Angels starter Steve Sparks (2-4)
gladly stepped aside to watch Glaus' 410-foot blast clear the
center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have dropped into last place in the American League
West because of a sputtering offense. At the center of the problem
has been Glaus, who had just three RBI in May and no homers since
April 29.
</P>
<P>
   After a terrific April, he was 3 for his past 44 and manager
Terry Collins wondered aloud if putting a guy two years out of
college in the heart of the order was too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus even looked miserable striking out in the second inning
against winless rookie Chris Fussell.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere between that at-bat and the thought of a trip back
to Triple-A, Glaus came alive.
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't have even come to the plate in the sixth, batting
only after Fussell misplayed a two-out throw to first for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Fussell (0-3) then fell behind 2-1 and threw a belt-high
fastball. The Angels' three-game losing streak was over and so they
hoped Glaus' slump.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as easy as it sounds. Sparks loaded the bases in the
ninth and Troy Percival was brought in to close out the game, but
pinch-hitter Scott Pose hit the first pitch to the gap in
right-center for a three-run double. Suddenly it was a 4-3 game
with the tying run at second.
</P>
<P>
   But Percival recovered to strike out Carlos Febles and retire
Carlos Beltran on a fly ball to center to end the game and record
his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who hadn't gone more than five innings in his past three
starts, was scheduled to pitch Friday. But he was bumped to keep
ace Chuck Finley pitching every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks threw twice between starts, but probably was too strong
for a knuckleballer and walked two batters in the first inning. He
then retired the next 14 Royals in a row. The only trouble came on
a second-inning drive by Royals first baseman Larry Sutton and
Garret Anderson caught at the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring Rey Sanchez to open the sixth, Sparks allowed a
clean double to left-center by Febles. He walked the next batter,
but got out of the inning. He also allowed a seventh-inning double
to former Angel Chad Kreuter in the seventh and an eighth-inning
double to Johnny Damon, but kept the shutout intact.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks was given a 1-0 lead in the fourth on a one-out homer by
Todd Greene, who was back behind the plate Saturday after playing
right field the night before. It was Greene's ninth home run of the
season and ended an 0-for-15 slump.
</P>
<P>
   He took a 4-0 lead into the ninth, but gave up a one-out double
to Kreuter. Joe Randa followed with a single to right, but Kreuter
held at third.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks nearly allowed a run to score on a knuckler that ticked
off of Greene's glove for near wild pitch. He walked Sutton to load
the bases and turned the game over to Percival.

ASU RUNS ITSELF OUT OF SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ In the instant that Erica Beach forgot a
lifetime of softball, Arizona State's hope of staying alive at the
Women's College World Series disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it was just the first inning of an elimination game
against California on Saturday, but chances are few in college
softball at the highest level. And having runners on second and
third with one out against a flustered pitcher is almost a
mandatory scoring situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very main opportunity,'' ASU Coach Linda Wells
said. To fail to score in what ended up a 2-0 loss before 3,558
fans at Don Porter Hall of Fame Stadium was ``killer, it was a
killer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made multiple mistakes on the play,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Missy Hixon ran from third toward home on Beach's grounder, a
break so unexpected that Cal first baseman Kirsten Drake almost
froze. But she threw home in the nick of time. Hixon was ruled out
on a play in which umpire Lisa Harvey could have blinked and seen
the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze was left to Beach, the first-team All-American, who
turned to watch the play at the plate _ ``I was about to complain
about the call,'' she said _ and forgot to finish running to first.
She was doubled up on a relay from catcher Megumi Takasaki to
second baseman Lisa Iancin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much went through my mind,'' Beach said. ``I can tell
you I'll never do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   In dropping the rubber game of five against California this
season, ASU (41-28) ended its first CWS appearance since 1987 with
an 0-2 record. The Sun Devils (41-28) are on a six-game CWS losing
streak dating back to 1982, the first year of NCAA sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   But with its Fab Five (Beach, Hixon, Kirsten Voak, Erin Wardein,
Nichole Thompson) here as freshmen, and with offensive help coming
next year in recruits Kara Brun and Sara Kahler and the return of
injured outfielder Devyn Braga, the Sun Devils expect a quick
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot just being here,'' said Beach, whose father
perhaps set the tone for next season when he won a contest for
tickets to the 2000 CWS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll learn a lot from this,'' Beach said. ``Some of the
things we can't fix, but most of them we can learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing runners would be a start.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, sixth and seventh innings, the Sun Devils put the
leadoff batter on base but were able to advance only one, and that
on a wild pitch. In the sacrifice situations, Chris Gill, dropped
from cleanup to eighth, popped out on a bunt, while Jennifer
Langenhuizen and Holly Smith struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are signs of freezing up in the clutch,'' Wells said.
``We've been riding on the shoulders of our freshman pitchers
(Beach and Voak), and it didn't work out this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we owe an apology to Nebraska for not taking this
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 16-ranked ASU won two of three from Nebraska to capture the
Region 6 tournament. But the Sun Devils stranded four in the first
three innings of a 4-1 loss to Washington that was scoreless
through five innings and similar to the wasted opportunities
against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' hero was Lisa Iancin, who homered to left off Beach
(16-14) in the fourth and singled in an insurance run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Nicole DiSalvio (19-11) improved to 2-1 against ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Hixon slapped the next pitch for a single to left, then beat a
throw to second on Langenhuizen's sacrifice, with Voak moving both
runners to third. But the bizarre double play followed, swinging
momentum to Cal that it carried into a Saturday night elimination
game by beating Fresno State, 1-0. &QL;

TAKE A BOW: KIM IMPRESSIVE IN EARNING SAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter walked toward his
newest player, Korean right-hander Byung-Hyun Kim, and bowed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a matter of respect and recognition for a job well done.
</P>
<P>
   With the flames of a New York comeback flickering at his feet,
and the Mets' top three hitters _ Edgardo Alfonzo, John Olerud and
Mike Piazza _ waiting to take their swings, the 20-year old Kim was
unflappable in his major league debut on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He retired Alfonzo and Olerud on fly balls and struck out Piazza
on a foul tip to preserve Arizona's 8-7 victory in a 3-hour,
40-minute marathon at Shea Stadium and help the Diamondbacks
(29-21) increase their National League West lead to 1{ games ahead
of San Francisco, which lost again at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're lucky to be in the big leagues and see something like
this,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper had hoped to bring in Kim for the first time in a
situation with a little less pressure, but in this case, he didn't
feel like he had a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Gregg Olson, who saved Friday night's victory for
Arizona, had thrown 30-plus pitches. Right-hander Darren Holmes
still had not recovered from stiffness and soreness in his lower
back that led him to receive an epidural injection earlier in the
week. Right-hander Amaury Telemaco, the only remaining member of
the bullpen, is not accustomed to the closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   As the gate opened to the Diamondbacks' bullpen beyond the
left-field fence, Kim walked through and gazed around at vast
expanse of outfield and the multi-colored seats and heard the roar
of the crowd, which had been pumped up by Benny Agbayani's solo
home run in the sixth inning and a run-scoring double by veteran
Rickey Henderson that brought the Mets within 8-7 in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if it was a dream or real,'' said Kim, who
signed for a $2.25 million bonus on Feb. 19 but didn't arrive in
American until about a month later. He began the season with
Double-A El Paso and later was promoted to Triple-A Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   It was real, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's first pitch to Alfonzo was a ball, followed by a strike.
He became confused by catcher Damian Miller's signals. The
6-foot-2, 212-pound Miller put his arm over the shoulder of the
5-11, 176-pound Kim, straightened things out and reassured him that
he was doing what he was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo ran the count to 3-2, including a couple of fouls,
before hitting a liner to right-center that was tracked down by
center fielder Steve Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's first pitch to Olerud also was a ball. But Olerud, who hit
a two-run homer off former Met Armando Reynoso to tie it at 5 in
the fifth, took two strikes before lining out to Luis Gonzalez in
left field.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Piazza's turn. Kim watched him walk to the plate as
he had many times while watching the Los Angeles Dodgers on TV back
home in Korea, when Piazza was fellow Korean Chan Ho Park's battery
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was watching Piazza all the way, then he (Kim) kind
of smiled,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Did Kim know who it was?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes!'' Kim said emphatically, without the use of a translator.
</P>
<P>
   A called strike was first. Then Piazza fouled away three pitches
before swinging and tipping a rising slider that landed in Miller's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   A rising slider? Yes. It rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws a Frisbee,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said, ``He had nasty stuff, obviously. Some of those
pitches to Piazza were `Nintendo sliders,' like the ones you see on
video games that have a big bend to them. For him to show the poise
that he did in a situation like that was a big plus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Jay Bell provided the margin of victory, hitting
a three-run homer off left-hander Rigo Beltran in the sixth inning
to make it 8-5. Henderson couldn't get to it as the ball landed
just beyond the left-field fence. Scoring ahead of Bell were Tony
Batista, who led off the inning with a single, and Steve Finley,
who hit a one-out double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might have a chance,'' Bell said. ``The ball
carries pretty well here in the daytime. I figured the least I
would get out of it was a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part about this was watching the kid out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Olson is still the closer, and that Kim will be
used on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just let him revel in the moment right now,'' Showalter
said. &QL;

   Danny White was sidelined with a broken wrist. So his job that
night in Anaheim was to relay plays from Tom Landry to quarterback
Steve Pelluer.
</P>
<P>
   White was standing next to the Cowboys coach when a team
employee, a former FBI agent, approached Landry and whispered in
his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Without explanation, Landry handed White the game plan and
walked hurriedly to the locker room. He returned a few minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' White asked.
</P>
<P>
   Landry said a threat had been made on his life. A sniper might
be in the stands. ``They said I had to wear this,'' he said.
Opening the front of his dress shirt the coach revealed a
bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later Landry turned to give White a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach,'' Danny called out, ``you're gonna have to speak up!''
</P>
<P>
   White had moved 15 feet away. Coach and player shared a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who know Tom Landry, White always thought of his
coach as bulletproof. Maybe it's because he flew B-17s over Germany
during World War II or because he led Dallas to 20 consecutive
winning seasons and five Super Bowls. Landry was the stoic man in
the hat.
</P>
<P>
   Then the other day White received a call. The news shook him.
His former coach had received another death threat _ this one no
joke. Landry has leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   If cancer were a willful football player, Landry would put the
disease in its place with what White calls ``the look.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny never will forget his coach's glacial stare. There was
that game in Pittsburgh when White decided on his own to fake a
punt and run for a first down. The Steelers stopped him a yard
short.
</P>
<P>
   White returned to the sideline filled with dread. He knew Landry
would find him. And when he did, ``I'll never forget the way he
looked at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Recreating the moment, White slowly turned his head, and fixed
me with a withering gaze. `` `You just can't do it,' '' Landry
said, biting off each word, and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That look,'' White recalled, ``could make more impact on a
player than if he made you run 900 wind sprints or fined you a
million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   They had disagreements. But when you ask White about the 13
years he played for Landry, he speaks of his coach with admiration
and deep respect.
</P>
<P>
   Danny still can see the front-page photo that appeared in a
Dallas newspaper the day after Landry was fired after the 1988
season. White and Landry, who left the Cowboys the same year, were
pictured together. What Landry said to White that day surprised
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny,'' Landry said, ``I'm really going to miss coaching with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With'' you? White had never spoken of a desire to join the
Cowboys staff. ``I just think he knew I could be a coach,'' White
said. ``As a player my arm wasn't overpowering. Roger (Staubach)
relied on his will and his legs. I relied on my knowledge of the
game. Anticipating what defenses were going to do. But I never said
anything about being a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't recall what his mentor once said about him _
``Danny White was probably as fine a winner as we've ever had'' _
the man who moved back home and became head coach of the Arizona
Rattlers can talk at length about what Landry gave him and what he
means to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still find myself asking, `What would Coach Landry do in
this situation?' '' White said. ``I'm not talking so much about X's
and O's. It was the way he handled people. He had such a profound
impact on so many players. The way he dealt with people and
adversity is his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of his firing, Landry called his team together to say
goodbye. The stone-faced coach became emotional. As he groped for
words, his voice cracking, the room grew quiet. White thinks of
that raw moment now as his 74-year-old coach lies in a hospital
bed, battling the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, what Landry said to the team seems prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the last thing he told us,'' White said. ``How you
handle a crisis is more important than the crisis itself.'' &QL;

LUYENDYK KNOWS EMOTIONS WILL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ This is it. One more walk. One final trip down
memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Turn out the lights, Arie Luyendyk. It's almost over.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, 45, is calling it a career after today's Indianapolis
500, and saying goodbye to the circular beast is about as easy as
saying goodbye to a daughter on her wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   Tears?
</P>
<P>
   Are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll still be around to experience the cool-down
lap (after the checkered flag),'' said Luyendyk, a two-time Indy
500 winner (1990 and 1997). ``Then, I think I'll be taking a long
time to compose myself before I get to the pits.''
</P>
<P>
   If the gods of Indy are really kind, they'll put Luyendyk in
victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Nah, too corny.
</P>
<P>
   Even A.J. Foyt didn't win the final race of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, however, has been driving as if he's planning to give
some Hollywood producer a script to drool over.
</P>
<P>
   Although Luyendyk hasn't suited up for a race since winning the
1998 season finale at Las Vegas, he's notoriously fast at Indy and
won the third pole of his career here a week ago. Luyendyk also was
runner-up in 1993 and third in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I've done well here,'' said Luyendyk, who
moved to Scottsdale nine years ago. ``I know I can run with
anybody. And I've envisioned myself winning. It would be
unbelievable to finish my career like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I won't be devastated if it doesn't happen. I think
there's 10 or 15 guys who can win this race. Really, it might be
too much to ask (to win).''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk is right. The lineup is formidable, starting with the
front row, which includes Greg Ray and Billy Boat of Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Ray bullied everyone for nearly a week before coming up a nickel
short on pole day, concluding his four-lap qualifying run with an
average speed of 225.073 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk clicked off blistering laps at a 225.179 average, and
Boat rode home third at 223.469 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the kind of month we've had, but I don't know if I want
to be considered a favorite,'' Ray said. ``I was a favorite for the
pole, and look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat warned not to read too much into qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg and Arie have had the most speed in practice, but the
thing about this race is everything changes on race day,'' Boat
said. ``The race brings the field closer together. Instead of two
or three running at a certain top speed, there's 15 all running
about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to back the engine down. It's an endurance race. It
doesn't do any good to be the fastest car for 100 laps if you're
not there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the past several years, the 500-mile race, many
believe, has evolved into more of a sprint than a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   It may take longer to complete, but drivers are flexing their
machinery's muscles almost from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't coast around for 150 laps, then start
charging,'' Luyendyk said. ``I remember when I won in 1990, guys
were going really fast and blistering their tires. A couple of
years ago, (Tony) Stewart and I were running 220 miles per hour
halfway through the race. We were running as hard as we could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what you'll see (today).''
</P>
<P>
   What you might see even more than a blurry pace is Canadian
Scott Goodyear sticking his nose into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, who is starting on the outside of the third row, has
come within 10 seconds of being a three-time Indy 500 champion, not
a zero-time winner.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, who won at Phoenix International Raceway in March,
drove to the closest runner-up finish in race history, crossing the
line a scant .043 seconds behind Al Unser Jr. in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Goodyear finished .057 seconds behind Luyendyk.
Although Goodyear was seventh in 1993, he was only 7.911 seconds
behind winner Emerson Fittipaldi.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget 1995, when Goodyear led with five laps to go, was
penalized for passing the pace car on a re-start and wound up 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I look at it, `Yeah, I could have won a few,' '' he
said. ``But sometimes I think I've been pretty lucky. I've been a
contender. I understand how to get the car around the track, and I
understand how to get the car to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Luyendyk. &QL;

PARK DECLARES FUTURES IS NOW  
 SHUNS ENDORSEMENTS TO START 
</HEADLINE>
 FUTURE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She has been referred to as the best women's player to come
along in golf in the past 10 years. But Grace Park plans to take a
drastically different path to the pros than some of her celebrated
peers, most notably Se Ri Pak and Kelli Kuehne.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who recently turned 20, said she will not sign any
contracts, or join any agency, when she turns pro after this week's
U.S. Women's Open in West Point, Miss. She enters the tournament as
an amateur on the exemption she received for winning last year's
U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, (signing contracts) is not my priority,'' said the
two-time All-American, who decided to skip her final two years at
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to concentrate on the Futures Tour for the rest of the
summer and hopefully get my LPGA card (by finishing among the top
three money winners on the Futures). If that fails, I'll try to get
my card at Q-school (in October).
</P>
<P>
   ``But until I get my LPGA card, whenever that is, I'm just going
to stick with golf and not worry about (financial matters).''
</P>
<P>
   For Pak and Kuehne, who both signed with International
Management Group before they were officially on the LPGA, the cart
came before the horse.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, the defending champ in the U.S. Open, turned pro at age 19.
At that time, she signed a one-year, $1 million contract with
Samsung, the electronics giant in her homeland of South Korea, the
same country where Park was born. That contract, however, came
before Pak's rookie season of 1997 and has since been renegotiated
into a 10-year, $10 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, who just recently found her feet on the LPGA, got a $1
million deal from Nike when she skipped her final two years at the
University of Texas. Kuehne, who failed in her initial attempt at
LPGA Qualifying School in 1997, also was 19.
</P>
<P>
   But Park is so committed to playing her way into professional
golf via the Futures Tour that she recently turned down exemptions
into three LPGA events later this summer _ the Rochester
International, the Shoprite Classic and the Jamie Farr Classic.
</P>
<P>
   According to Park's father, Soo-Nam Park, a wealthy restaurateur
from Seoul, playing on the LPGA at the moment is of no consequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace told me that (winning an LPGA event and receiving
immediate playing status) is not realistic,'' he said. ``Plus, by
playing the Futures, she can adjust to the (rigors of travel)
slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said his daughter made up her mind to turn pro after the
Dinah Shore in April, an LPGA tournament where she tied for 39th
just a week after finishing 21st in the Standard Register PING in
Phoenix. He added that winning the individual championship last
weekend at the NCAA Championship in Tulsa had no bearing on her
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Dinah Shore, she went back to playing college
tournaments, and shortly after that, she said, `Dad, there's not
enough competition for me (in college),' '' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   But deciding to turn professional rather than get her college
degree was not as easy as it might sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace always planned to go to school and get her degree,''
Park said. ``When she decided (to turn pro), she cried all night.
It was hard on her emotionally, even though she knew she was
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Soo-Nam Park said he realizes that his daughter is lucky to be
from a well-to-do family and not have to worry immediately about
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are not trying to (drive up her market value) by doing
this,'' said Park, who plans to travel with his daughter on the
Futures Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only gives her the chance to do what she wants without a
lot of distractions. She is very happy with this idea of playing
the Futures.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who already has missed eight Futures events, has 10
tournaments remaining on the women's equivalent of the men's Nike
Tour. Her first event will be the Aurora Health Care Classic in
Pewaukee, Wis., June 10-13.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Eunice Choi leads the Futures money list with
$23,374, while the No. 3 player on that list, Elizabeth Bowman, is
at $17,765. However, with prize money that ranges from $6,600 to
$9,900 for first place, Park still has time to finish among the top
three players and earn the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Zayra Calderon, the chief executive officer of the Futures Tour,
said Park's arrival ``is great for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is joining a talented group of women golfers,'' Calderon
said. ``But she certainly brings us some star power and adds great
talent to our tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Futures money is a pittance when compared with the
$36.5 million that is offered this year on the LPGA. But Soo-Nam
Park insists this is not about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very close family, and when Grace and I are not
traveling (on the Futures Tour), we plan to visit her brother and
sister, who are going to college in New York City, and her
mother,'' he said. ``So we are really in no hurry. We want Grace to
develop at her own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is about Korean culture, to play for your family
and country, and to win tournaments that make everyone proud.
Everything else will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim McNulty, an agent with Cornerstone Sports, one of several
agencies pursuing Park, said the family is doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good for the player is often lost in the mix these
days,'' McNulty said. ``I don't think for one minute that they're
holding out to make more money on her accomplishments. They simply
want to give her time to adjust and to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   McNulty said that with Park's resume, which includes 55
victories in 118 starts, as well as every major amateur and junior
title in women's golf, ``She is head and shoulders above anyone (in
college).
</P>
<P>
   ``She's possibly the best woman to come along in golf in the
past 10 years, because she's photogenic, feminine and has a golf
game that is all-world,'' he said. ``Especially her length off the
tee. Few women can hit the ball as far as Grace. That in itself
will take her a long way in terms of her marketability . . . when
the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said moving from the amateur to pro ranks has given her
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm nervous,'' she said. ``But it's a good
nervousness.'' &QL;

SOME SCATTERED SHOTS, OBSERVATIONS, SUGGESTIONS

<P>
   Suddenly, Cheryl Miller and I have two things in common: We both
got a haircut and neither one of us is coaching the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC is predicting the Suns will use the ninth pick to draft
Northwestern's Evan Eschmeyer, who is 6 feet 11, 245 pounds, very
slow and very much in need of a tan. Or, as the Web site explains,
just ``the kind of player that Jerry Colangelo covets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought it was safe to embrace the Cardinals:
After getting squashed by the Rio Salado vote, the Bidwill clan was
bathing in sympathy. They became legitimate martyrs. People were
vowing to never spend another cent in Mesa. Support was filtering
in from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Now you learn that the $75 million the Cardinals were willing to
contribute wasn't exactly their money. That some of it _ and I'm
guessing all but $16 _ was floated by the NFL as an interest-free
loan.
</P>
<P>
   This is how you earn voter distrust. The kind that lingers for
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis historian Bud Collins insists that until Pete Sampras
wins the French Open, he can never be considered the best player in
history. Like playing tennis in a sandbox counts for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Two area athletes requiring an interpreter for our benefit:
Byung-Hyun Kim and Simeon Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of local sports radio was unavoidable, a domino
effect triggered by the devastating loss of the three-tooth wonder,
the Howard Stern of the Harley crowd, that painful reminder that
nothing is as blind as a microphone . . .
</P>
<P>
   Anyone else miss Wild Bill?
</P>
<P>
   Say it isn't so: The Suns need to get tough, they need a
presence on the blocks, they have a $2 million exception and, just
the other night, Charles Barkley was wandering through Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   If he returns to the Valley to train, fine. It's a free country.
But in the name of civic sophistication, do not refer to a
convicted rapist and prison veteran as ``Phoenix's own Mike
Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   And unless you want to sound like a hick town lost in the
cornfields, how about a moratorium on Tom Gugliotta's nickname?
</P>
<P>
   During last year's stretch run, Jamir Miller requested a chat
with Vince Tobin. He told the coach he wanted to rush the passer.
Tobin thanked Miller for coming by, but if he didn't mind, the
Cardinals happened to be in playoff race and there was no time for
such individual, egotistical, salary-drive nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   All together now: Vince! Vince! Vince! Vince!
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's down to about two at-bats per week, Bernard Gilkey
might want to check whether his credit cards still work in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Why you can't beat Mike Keenan: Once in Montreal, Keenan walked
into a bar. He started singing along with a classic tune from the
Everly Brothers. He spotted a Canadian columnist he knew and
demanded that the scribe sing along with him. When that columnist
ignored the directive, Keenan simply punched the fellow in the
chest, sending a mug of beer skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the columnist was singing like a parakeet.
</P>
<P>
   Shandon Anderson is a free agent and would look great in a Suns
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   New Arizona: Jake Plummer, Jason Kidd, Travis Lee, Rob Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Old Arizona: Open roads, Al McCoy, Bruce Snyder, Cotton
Fitzsimmons.
</P>
<P>
   And three traditions ready for retirement: The Sun City Dancers,
The Gorilla, The Whiteout.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to assume that Daniel Snyder, a 34-year-old who paid
$800 million for the Washington Redskins, never held a paper route.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ex-Blackhawks goalies looming in the NHL, it figures
that Dominik Hasek is in Buffalo, Eddie Belfour is in Dallas and
you end up with Jimmy Waite.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Arizona Wildcats are set to open the season as
national championship contenders, can someone please explain what
happened to Sun Devils football?
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the ouster of Jim Schoenfeld: A new coach
will sound a lot more appetizing to Robert Reichel, a skilled softy
pondering a permanent return to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And a little advice for Gregg Olson, who is refusing to speak to
the media over earlier ``negativity,'' as he called it: Take a look
around. Pick up the tabloids. And be thankful you're not making a
living in New York. &QL;

WILLIAMS DEFENDS ROOKIE FROM METS' HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The barbed-wire tattoo that Matt Williams got in the
off-season means ``protector.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks third baseman filled that role Saturday when
20-year-old right-hander Byung-Hyun Kim entered the game against
the New York Mets in the bottom of the ninth for his major league
debut.
</P>
<P>
   As Kim warmed up, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine came out of the
dugout and stood next to plate umpire Larry Poncino, gesturing
toward the mound. It was Valentine's goal to see what pitches Kim
was featuring, but the greater purpose was to disrupt the pitcher
by trying to lure Poncino out to the mound to check Kim's glove.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently a form of retaliation for Mets right-handed
reliever Turk Wendell having to go into the dugout Friday night to
change gloves when umpires noticed that it had two color tones.
Wendell said afterward that Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter was
behind it, but Showalter denied it, saying it was all the work of
Friday night's third-base umpire, Steve Rippley.
</P>
<P>
   So Valentine apparently figured, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in the dugout thought it was an oversize glove,''
Valentine said. ``It figures, these guys (umpires) have a thing
about gloves. All they said was that it's one color and it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't OK with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He walked between the plate and the mound and stared at
Valentine, walking in his direction as Valentine headed back toward
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high-school BS,'' Williams said, his blood pressure
obviously rising. ``What purpose could there be for standing there
while the kid is warming up for his major league debut, other than
to try to (expletive) him up? It's stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, get the (expletive) back into the dugout.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was one of the first to greet Kim after he preserved
the 8-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed as confident as he could be,'' Williams said. ``He
handled himself really well. I think having a lot of international
experience probably helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Williams asked Kim to throw his slider that
rises instead of drops. He was amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he does it. He's got two of them, one that
drops and one that rises. He's amphibious,'' Williams said, smiling
at his intentional malapropism.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is certain to become more popular among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told the team that he was being called up on Thursday,
I told the players, `Put yourself in his shoes. You would want to
be welcomed,' '' Showalter said. ``And they have responded. They've
taken him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim's exploits were chronicled in Korean newspapers in the
United States and back in his home country, but there also was an
interested party in England _ Diamondbacks Managing General Partner
Jerry Colangelo. He called team public relations director Mike
Swanson four times to get updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him Kim was facing Mike Piazza with two outs,'' Swanson
said. ``He predicted Kim was going to strike him out. He said,
`He's going to get my ``paisan''.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kim followed through, striking out Piazza on a foul tip.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the road take Kim from here?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows, except that he has Williams as his bodyguard. &QL;

DAAL'S SHOULDER PROBLEM WON'T KEEP HIM FROM NEXT START

   NEW YORK _ Omar is OK.
</P>
<P>
   That's the latest word on the Diamondbacks' medical front.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander &UR; Omar Daal, who left Friday night's game against the
New York Mets after seven innings because of stiffness in his
shoulder, is expected to make his next start on Wednesday night in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Daal was examined by one of the team physicians, &UR; Dr.  &UR; Roger
McCoy, and took some anti-inflammatory medication Friday night. On
Saturday, he reported to Shea Stadium and went through some
range-of-motion exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the doctor about any red flags we should look for and
there weren't any,'' Manager &UR; 
 &UR; Buck Showalter said. ``It was actually the flip side. Omar should
be ready to go by Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal (5-4) said, ``I'm OK. I'm a little sore, but that's usually
what happens after a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal, who commonly throws in the bullpen the second day after a
start, said he will skip today and might throw in the bullpen on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it feels,'' he said. ``I might skip that, too.
An extra day of rest never hurts.'' &QL;  &QL; 
With friends like these . . . &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder &UR; Luis Gonzalez made some new ``friends'' on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Mets fans beyond the left-field fence arrived early,
many perhaps, with a little extra octane running through their
veins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on us even during batting practice,'' Gonzalez said.
``I said, `Uh-oh, they know us even without our numbers,' We got a
couple runs early (two in the second inning) so that quieted them
down a little. But I've heard words I've never heard before.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans got to talk a little more trash Saturday, when the Mets
scored two runs in the first inning. &QL;  &QL; 
Is it fall already? &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third-base coach  &UR; Brian Butterfield made an interesting side
trip on Friday afternoon. He took a few players to watch a New York
Jets minicamp workout at Hofstra University. Butterfield is an
acquaintance of Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   During the workout, Parcells called for a defensive alignment,
referring to it as ``baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned to us and said, `How did you like that one?' '' said
Butterfield, a native of Maine who was an avid fan of the New
England Patriots when Parcells was there and still is.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Butterfield wore a Jets cap in the clubhouse. Does
that mean Parcells wears a Diamondbacks cap in the Jets' locker
room?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're darned tootin,' '' Butterfield said. &QL;  &QL; 
Gentlemen, start your . . . &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander &UR; Gregg Olson found an innovative way to draw
interest in the annual Indianapolis 500 pool _ he marked the bottom
of tiny toy cars with the appropriate Indy car number and teammates
made their choice by taking the car. &QL;  &QL;

AL, NL TEAMS NEED NEW FOES
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next weekend will bring the latest round of interdivisional
play. Baseball officials continue to call it interleague play, but
it's simply not so.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive year, baseball's two leagues will mix
it up, but only within their own rival divisions. So once again,
the Oakland Athletics will play the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopee!
</P>
<P>
   This was not what baseball said was going to happen when
interleague play was introduced in 1997. At that time, then-acting
Commissioner  &UR; Bud Selig said these match-ups would rotate, with
each division playing other divisions in ensuing years.
</P>
<P>
   But all we've had is the same division playing its equal in the
other league. If this keeps up, interleague play will mean nothing
in years to come. Baseball officials need to realize that
interleague play needs to be kept special.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of achieving that goal than to create a
rotation of divisions playing each other. For instance, the
American League East should have played the National League East in
1997, then the NL Central last season and should be getting ready
to play the NL West this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have the NL East playing the AL East for the third
straight year, with all the other divisions following in line.
That's plain wrong.  &UR; Bernie Williams and the Yankees should be
coming to the desert for a series at Bank One Ballpark instead of
playing the Mets for a third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Bombers coming to play the Diamondbacks, who are
managed by their former skipper,
 &UR; Buck Showalter, would make for a far more riveting series. It also
would be a way to introduce clubs to unfamiliar places, and that's
what building interest is all about.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves and  &UR; Greg Maddux and Co. could be making a
trip to meet  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. and Seattle this year. Or the St.
Louis Cardinals with  &UR; Mark McGwire could be visiting Tampa Bay.
Whatever the match-up, it would keep interleague play a fresh
concept instead of one that will start to lose its appeal before
long.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough fan interest in the Valley for high amounts of
anticipation if the Boston Red Sox and  &UR; Pedro Martinez were coming
to town. By the same token, imagine the Diamondbacks making a trip
to Baltimore's Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then you could still have the Yankees and Mets playing each
other in games that would have three years worth of buildup, making
their games that much more special. Instead, get ready Diamondbacks
fans, the Texas Rangers will be in town next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Oh boy, can't wait till next year, when Minnesota and St. Louis
should be playing for the fourth straight year. Oh, the
excitement. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; With last week's trade that sent closer  &UR; Rick Aguilera from
Minnesota to Chicago, the Cubs can lay claim to having had seven of
the top 12 on the career saves list. Name the other six besides
Aguilera, who entered the weekend series ranked 12th with 281
saves. &QL; 
Dancing with the devil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays have gone through a stretch of games
that the most mean-spirited person might not wish on their worst
enemy. The Devil Rays, who came into the majors with the
Diamondbacks, have truly been snakebit (no pun intended) of late.
</P>
<P>
   To recap:
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, rookie  &UR; Ryan Rupe gave up one hit while needing
only 87 pitches through nine innings of a scoreless game against
Texas before being pulled in favor of closer
 &UR; Roberto Hernandez, who gave up four runs on 31 pitches in the 10th
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Quinton McCracken, voted the MVP of last season's
inaugural club, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee while attempting a catch against the wall. He's considered out
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president  &UR; Mike Veeck, the son of former White Sox owner
 &UR; Bill Veeck, resigned abruptly to spend time at home with his
7-year-old daughter, who is going blind. Veeck was hired to boost
attendance, which continues to plummet in Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's lone All-Star Game representative, pitcher  &UR; Rolando
Arrojo, landed on the disabled list because of tendinitis in his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that has been replayed to death, pitcher  &UR; Tony
Saunders, the first overall expansion pick, broke a bone in his arm
and will miss the balance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get a blow, it seems more and more
gut-wrenching,'' Hernandez said. ``I don't know if this team can
take any more blows.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of their unceremonious homestand, the Devil Rays
were in third place in the AL East, trailing Boston by 2{ games and
second-place New York by one game. Tampa Bay started the weekend
three games under .500 and 5{ games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Devil Rays have a major league-high 14 players
on the disabled list, including 10 from the opening day roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit some tremendous voodoo,'' outfielder  &UR; Dave Martinez
said. ``I don't know what it is. I've never seen anything like it.
We have guys going down every day.'' &QL; 
Thar's a feud a brewin' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for St. Louis Manager  &UR; Tony La Russa and Los Angeles
Manager  &UR; Davey Johnson to exchange pleasantries anytime soon. The
two took pointed verbal shots at each other last week after their
two clubs had an on-field brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believed Cardinals utility player  &UR; Shawon Dunston
overreacted when he charged the mound after becoming the third St.
Louis player hit during last Sunday's game between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hit three times today,'' La Russa said. ``At some
point, enough is enough. But they did us a favor. Every time they
hit us, guys got ticked off and that gave us better at-bats. If
they wouldn't have hit us, we probably would have just beaten them
5-3 (instead of 8-3). They were upset with him for running the
bases hard (Dunston stole with a four-run lead in the seventh).
That's Dodger baseball. Didn't they invent that game?''
</P>
<P>
   The benches emptied after Dunston, who plays the game as hard as
anyone in the league, flipped his bat down and raced at Dodgers
rookie  &UR; Jamie Arnold, who was body-slammed to the field by Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three points for a takedown,'' Cardinals pitcher  &UR; Juan Acevedo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Johnson took La Russa to task for insinuating that
Arnold purposely threw at Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a little respect for La Russa for accusing the kid of
nailing him,'' Johnson said. ``That was the farthest thing away.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa said, ``Losing respect can go both ways.'' &QL; 
Looking in the mirror &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After attempting to nail Phillies management over being too
cheap to field a competitive club, Philadelphia ace  &UR; Curt Schilling
poked fun at himself while taping a commercial for the club's local
ALS ( &UR; Lou Gehrig's disease) auction on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling appears in the spot with his wife, who is expounding
on the merits of coming to the auction. All the while, Schilling is
next to her with a piece of tape over his mouth, giving the thumbs
up to everything she says. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Cubs listed among the career saves leaders are headed by the
top dog himself,  &UR; Lee Smith, whose 478 saves rank first. Also
joining that fraternity are  &UR; Dennis Eckersley (third all-time,
390),  &UR; Randy Myers (fifth, 347),  &UR; Goose Gossage (eighth, 310),
 &UR; Bruce Sutter (ninth, 300) and
 &UR; Doug Jones (11th, 294). &QL;

SMITH IS GIVEN OK FOR COACH INTERVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith has received permission from
at least two NHL teams to interview candidates for the club's head
coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, reached Saturday in Toronto, where he is scouting junior
players for next month's draft, would not identify the candidates
or the teams he has contacted.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that one of the candidates is Detroit Red Wings
assistant coach Barry Smith, who was a late finalist for the job
two years ago just before the hiring of Jim Schoenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule him out, but I wouldn't put him front and
center, either,'' Bobby Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this, I ``have'' been talking to some people. I've
talked with both agents and teams, but that's about all I will say
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The only candidate Smith has confirmed is Coyotes assistant John
Tortorella, who will be given a formal interview Tuesday in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a good candidate,'' Smith said. ``I've already had a
lengthy, productive discussion with him, and as I've said before,
he is a very serious candidate. I have great respect for John and
his hockey ability, and we will talk again soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith probably will interview at least three candidates and
possibly four or five before naming the new coach. He said again
Saturday that he has no timetable for a decision. He added,
however, that he has been contacted by several coaches at the NHL
and minor league levels who have expressed an interest in replacing
Schoenfeld, who was fired Monday after two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from a lot of people, from a lot of agents,'' Smith
said, adding that out of the dozens of inquiries he has had, 10 to
12 could be considered legitimate possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't met with anybody yet, but I've been on the phone,''
Smith said. ``I'm working. I'm making calls and taking calls. . . .
I wouldn't rule out anybody at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   One name that can be ruled out is former Los Angeles Kings Coach
Larry Robinson, a former teammate of Smith's with the Montreal
Canadiens. Robinson accepted an assistant coaching job with the New
Jersey Devils last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keenan, who has coached the Philadelphia Flyers, Chicago
Blackhawks, New York Rangers, St. Louis Blues and the Vancouver
Canucks, said from the day Schoenfeld was fired that he would be
seriously interested in coaching the Coyotes. Keenan's aggressive
pursuit of power and his extreme intensity likely will preclude him
from being a serious candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Former Kings Coach Barry Melrose, a hockey analyst for ESPN, has
told friends that he might like to meet with Smith. But Smith
showed little interest in Melrose two years ago while seeking a
replacement for Don Hay.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, representatives of former Buffalo Sabres Coach Ted
Nolan apparently have telephoned Smith to gauge his interest in
their client, the NHL's Coach of the Year in 1996-97. Nolan
interviewed for the Kings job last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible candidates include Bryan Trottier, an assistant
coach with the Colorado Avalanche; Dave Jackson, an assistant with
the Pittsburgh Penguins; Dave King, an assistant with the Montreal
Canadiens; and Ted Green, an assistant with the Edmonton Oilers.
Both King and Green have former head coaching experience, Green
with the Oilers and King with the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, who will be paid the full $400,000 salary he was
scheduled to make next season, told ``The Republic'' that he plans
to stay in the Valley for at least another year. He said he has not
ruled out coaching again, but added has no immediate plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family and I will probably go up to Canada for a month or
so this summer,'' he said. ``Other than that, I can see myself
doing a lot of golfing.'' &QL;

`ARMCHAIR DRIVER' GRADUATES TO BIG TIME

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Eight years ago,  &UR; Greg Ray climbed inside a race
car for the first time. He was 25.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he will attempt to win the Indianapolis 500 from a
middle front row starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Time flies, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had my midlife crisis at 25 instead of 45 or 55,''
Ray said. ``In 1991, I think I became an armchair driver. You know,
when you watch football and basketball and say, `Man, why did you
do that? That was stupid.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, a little voice in my head said, `If you think you're so
good, why don't you do it?' For the first time in my life, I didn't
have an answer for the question. I jumped up and went to the store
and bought a racing magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't read racing magazines at the time, but I had seen the
ads on the back for driving schools. So I called and signed up.
From that day on, I have yet to smoke a cigarette or drink a drop
of alcohol. If you want to be successful, you have to eliminate all
of your excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray attended the school and won the Sports Car Club of America
Formula 2000 championship the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I stood up in the school and said, `My name is Greg
Ray. I'm from Dallas, Texas. I'm an entrepreneur. And I've never
driven a race car, but I'm getting my driving license because I
want to win the Indy 500,' '' Ray said. ``They all laughed their
(butts) off, and I sat down with my tail between my legs. But I won
the school race, the most aggressive driver award and the kamikaze
award.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ray will try to win the Indy 500. &QL; 
Classy field &QL; 
Of the 33 drivers in today's race, 32 have attended college.

   Ray (University of Texas) and front-row starter  &UR; Billy Boat

<P>
   &UR; Buzz Calkins (row nine) is working toward a master's degree in

ANDRETTI WINS A THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Ill. _ This is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andretti, winless since last year's season opener,
survived a robust challenge from Helio Castro-Neves and won the
Motorola 300 on Saturday at Gateway International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti's heart, still pounding with emotion from the
exhausting pursuit by Castro-Neves, made it nearly impossible for
him to voice how much the win meant at this point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti is Championship Auto Racing Teams' all-time leader with
38 career wins, but until the .329-second victory over
Castro-Neves, he had gone 23 starts without a kiss on the cheek
from a trophy girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, I was driving as hard as I've ever driven,'' said
Andretti, his distinctive voice quivering. ``I was right on the
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   And right there with Andretti was Castro-Neves, whose dogged
pursuit over the final 41 laps of a 236-lap race nearly reduced him
to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking in my helmet, `This is Michael Andretti and
this is me,'' said Castro-Neves, a 24-year-old second-year driver
from Brazil. ``He has such great experience and we're racing
together. I can't believe we're racing together,' '' he continued,
his voice cracking. ``Next one, I'm going to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti's emotional triumph in a Swift-Ford ended super rookie
Juan Montoya's three-race winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya finished 11th, but still nearly stole the show with an
assortment of pulsating passes over the tricky 1.27-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was Andretti and Castro-Neves who had a crowd
of nearly 40,000 standing on their tip-toes, their necks craning to
see the next minute of the electrifying battle unfold.
</P>
<P>
   It started on Lap 189, when the front-runners all pitted during
the last of nine caution flags.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti drove in fifth, but emerged the leader after taking
fuel only.
</P>
<P>
   Castro-Neves was sixth on the grid on the restart and began
picking off drivers as if he were knocking down ducks in a shooting
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   By Lap 199, Castro-Neves was third. Four laps later, he was
second, 1.8 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   By Lap 206, Castro-Neves was within 0.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Although an unrelenting Castro-Neves made valiant efforts to
squeeze by Andretti, it was like trying to pass through a metal
detector with a pocketful of quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Beep-beep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not taking on fresh tires during that last stop was a
gamble,'' Andretti said. ``I was praying the whole time they would
hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro-Neves was praying, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think he heard me,'' said Castro-Neves, who tied a
career-high finish in an unsponsored Mercedes-Lola owned by Carl
Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Castro-Neves made one last effort to overtake Andretti on Lap
234.
</P>
<P>
   But Andretti diligently protected the inside line entering Turn
3 to shut the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Michael's car moving around with about 30 laps to go and
I talk to myself to be patient and wait for the traffic before I
make a pass,'' Castro-Neves said. ``But Michael's excellent and he
made perfect passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On Lap 234), I didn't want to go from hero to zero, so I
stayed back.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the finish, Montoya retained the lead in the driver
standings over Dario Franchitti, who made it to the podium with a
third-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti made the biggest jump, from sixth to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (win) was for the old men,'' said Andretti, who is 36.
``We definitely had to stop (Montoya's) streak. And I'm glad I was
the one to do it.'' &QL;

SABRES PUSH LEAFS TO BRINK

   BUFFALO _ Either the Buffalo Sabres are getting better, the
games are getting easier, or the Toronto Maple Leafs already have
left for their summer cottages without notifying NHL security.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, the red-hot Sabres now may be only 60 minutes
away from returning to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time
since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the least, I'm pleased with our effort,'' said coach
Lindy Ruff, after his Sabres embarrassed the Leafs in a 5-2
thumping here Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Marine Midland Arena. ``We came at
'em in waves.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, Buffalo's seventh straight on home ice this
postseason, handed the Sabres a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven
Eastern Conference finals. They now have three chances, beginning
Sunday night at Toronto's Air Canada Centre, to advance to the
finals, where they would face either the Colorado Avalanche or the
Dallas Stars (that series is deadlocked at 2-2).
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres rolled to their 11th postseason victory with the aid
of a four-goal second-period outburst that built a 5-0 lead over
the hapless Maple Leafs. Ex-Whaler Geoff Sanderson, his career in
the doldrums for the better part of five years, popped in two of
the second-period strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs, just as in Game 3, repeatedly made errors in their
own end of the ice, either blatantly giving up the puck or failing
to cover rebounds for their star netminder, Curtis Joseph. They
allowed three goals on only four shots in a span of only 2:35. When
Sanderson rifled home a shot for a 5-0 lead with 5:50 to go in the
second, the dispassionate, listless Leafs looked as if they were
watching the credits scroll down on their season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't respond well,'' said Toronto coach Pat Quinn, who
challenged his Leafs after their loss in Game 3, to the point of
labeling them ``pretty boys.'' Their response was anything but
pretty. ``We didn't respond hardly at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, there were times they looked like the Maple Leafs of
old. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   --They were working with a power play in the first period when
Dixon Ward broke out and zapped in the go-ahead goal, good for the
Sabres' team-record third shorthanded goal in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   --They watched Steve Sullivan throw a blind pass into the slot,
in his defensive end, that was instantly cashed in by Brian
Holzinger for the 2-0 lead. ``It was such a nice pass, it caught
everyone by surprise _ including Curtis,'' said Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   --They even watched Rob Ray, without a goal in 110 straight
games, chop down a pass from Stu Barnes that would turn into the
3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' said Quinn, the ex-Toronto defenseman Boston
fans might remember for decking Bobby Orr with a brutal elbow in
the playoffs 30 years ago, ``that's a good hockey club we are
facing. I didn't expect we'd win, necessarily, but I didn't expect
that kind of response.''
</P>
<P>
   Mats Sundin scored Toronto's two goals, the first on a penalty
shot at 6:59 of the third when Jay McKee was caught for closing his
hand on the puck in the crease. He popped in the second with 1:57
to go.

GLAUS COMES ALIVE FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ May is almost over, and Troy Glaus can breathe again.
</P>
<P>
   After a tortuous month that finally resulted in his benching the
night before, Glaus' sixth-inning home run Saturday helped give the
struggling Angels a 4-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't often a pitcher can be overshadowed when he takes a
no-hitter into the sixth inning and a chance for his first career
shutout into the ninth, but Angels starter Steve Sparks (2-4)
gladly stepped aside to watch Glaus' 410-foot blast clear the
center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have dropped into last place in the American League
West because of a sputtering offense. At the center of the problem
has been Glaus, who had just three RBI in May and no homers since
April 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been frustrating, but not overwhelming,'' Glaus said.
``You just have to keep working hard and hope you get a little
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   And a little reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   After a terrific April, he was three for his past 44 and manager
Terry Collins wondered aloud if putting a guy two years out of
college in the heart of the order was too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus even looked miserable striking out in the second inning
against winless rookie Chris Fussell.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere between that at-bat and the thought of a trip back
to Triple-A, Glaus came alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so great to see him finally break out,'' Collins said.
``When a youngster struggles this long you have to wonder how long
you can go. You think about getting him his swing back and getting
his head on straight. Yes, the minor leagues could have been a
possibility, but were we ready to do that? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus said his teammates have been very supportive during the
slump. Some offer advice, some keep their distance. Everyone stayed
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have (hitting instructor) Rod Carew and (coach) George
Hendrick to work with you,'' Glaus said. ``But it's your teammates
that really get you through this. Everyone has gone through it, but
having your teammates behind you really means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus shouldn't have even come to the plate in the sixth,
batting only after Fussell misplayed a two-out throw to first for
an error.
</P>
<P>
   Fussell (0-3) then fell behind 2-1 and threw a belt-high
fastball. The Angels' three-game losing streak was over and so they
hoped Glaus' slump.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as easy as it sounds. Sparks loaded the bases in the
ninth and Troy Percival was brought in to close out the game, but
pinch-hitter Scott Pose hit the first pitch to the gap in
right-center for a three-run double. Suddenly it was a 4-3 game
with the tying run at second.
</P>
<P>
   But Percival recovered to strike out Carlos Febles and retire
Carlos Beltran on a fly ball to center to end the game and record
his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch was right down the middle,'' Collins said. ``I
wanted Sparks to finish the game, but I couldn't do it. We needed
Troy to close it out.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   He said the home run would have been pretty hollow if the team
had blown a four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so important what I did,'' Glaus said. ``The win was
much more important. If we lost, I wouldn't have felt very good
right now. As it is, it's only a start.''

SPARKS TRIES TO MAKE COLLINS' DECISION TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Slumping knuckleballer Steve Sparks was bumped from
his Friday night start in favor of Chuck Finley. He knew he might
get passed over altogether in his next assignment because the
Angels have three days off in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I wanted to make it very difficult on them to do that,''
said Sparks, who won his first game in nearly a month Saturday
night, a 4-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals. ``I want to keep
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Royals, Sparks certainly did that. After allowing 15
runs in his previous 12 innings, Sparks took a no-hitter into the
sixth inning and a chance for his first career shutout into the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival came in after Sparks loaded the bases on a walk to
Larry Sutton and allowed a three-run double to pinch-hitter Scott
Pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to keep him in there,'' manager Terry Collins
said of Sparks. ``He pitched so well and still seemed to have a lot
left. But when he threw a bad knuckler on 3-2 (to walk Sutton) I
knew I had to go get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who did not allow a hit until Carlos Febles' one-out
double in the sixth, threw 126 pitches. He figured 100 of those
were knucklers and he wasn't going to go with his second pitch even
if it meant loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the pitch that has gotten me here,'' said Sparks, who
hadn't gone more than five innings in his previous three starts.
``I still had a lot left, but now we were looking at the game on
the line. I'm glad it all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets sits: Andy Sheets, acquired after shortstop Gary
DiSarcina broke his left hand in spring training, was benched
Saturday night after going hitless in his last 18 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, replaced by Jeff Huson, wasn't expected to provide much
offense, but when he committed his first error in his last 25 games
Friday, Collins gave him the night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just seemed like a good time,'' Collins said. ``He has given
us more than we could have expected on defense. A rest here and
there isn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, acquired March 29 as part of a deal that sent Phil Nevin
to San Diego, has never played more than 88 games in a season
(1998). Sheets split time last year at short with the Padres' Chris
Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Huson started at first base Thursday against Baltimore and moved
to third Friday to give slumping Troy Glaus a breather. Glaus, who
entered the game with just three hits in his last 43 at-bats,
returned to the lineup. Huson came in batting .375 (3 for 8) on the
homestand and had two hits and a stolen a base and scored the
Angels' second run in the fourth inning Saturday.

   INDIA-PAKISTAN (New Delhi, India) _ Update on Indian-Pakistani

are still unsure whether they want to participate in any such
negotiations. By Barry Bearak.

<P>
   NEPAL-POLITICS (Katmandu, Nepal) _ With 22 million people, Nepal
is an Arkansas-sized nation landlocked between India and China.
Until 50 years ago, it was largely isolated from the rest of the
world. The annual per capita income is still only $210. The adult
literacy rate is 40 percent. Life expectancy is 57. In 1990,
political agitation forced Harvard-educated, walrus-mustached King
Birendra to give up most of his absolute powers and to accept a
constitutional monarchy. But the years of democracy have been
marked by a hapless cavalcade of seven prime ministers, most them
the product of bizarre alliances cobbled together only to fall

   MEXICO-DROUGHT (Torreon) _ In Torreon, a city in Coahuila State
600 miles north of the capital, and all across the country's arid
north, Mexicans have been praying for rain. In recent days, the
federal government has declared 10 northern states, covering about
half of the national territory, as disaster zones because of the
drought. Officials have explained the mounting water shortage as
one of the vagaries of nature, since for several years rainfall has
been lower than usual in northern Mexico. But Torreon residents,
and several experts as well, contend that deforestation, wasteful
irrigation, and water-intensive industrial processes ill-suited to
an arid region, have worsened the crisis. By Sam Dillon.

   REFORM-JUDAISM (Undated) _ More than a century ago, leaders of
Reform Judaism declared such practices as wearing skullcaps and
prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to be the dated relics
of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on social ethics and a
highly cerebral approach to the faith. But in a symbolically
resonant gesture, and with an eye on the approach of a new century,
Reform's rabbinic arm, the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
last week adopted a document that encourages the movement's members
to explore traditional rituals. By commending study of the mitzvot,
the sacred obligations that include traditional rituals that are
required in more conservative branches of Judaism, the rabbis
positively acknowledged a trend among many of the 1.5 million

from the comfortable Democratic incumbents of the late 1980s to the
Republican revolutionaries of 1994. Maybe Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa,
is a fitting symbol of the current House: the edgy, ever-shifting
House where Republicans are trying to govern with 222 votes, the

TRIAL OF KURDISH REBEL LEADER STARTS IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ In a legal and political confrontation likely
to attract worldwide attention, the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan is to be tried for treason in a Turkish court beginning
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 until his capture in February, Ocalan headed a
guerrilla army that has been fighting to establish a Kurdish
homeland in southeastern Turkey. The authorities call it a band of
terrorists, and blame Ocalan for the more than 30,000 deaths the
war has caused. Among the dead are more than 5,000 Turkish soldiers
and security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders, enthusiastically backed by the mass media,
have for years been denouncing Ocalan as a brutal killer dedicated
to sowing chaos and ultimately splitting Turkey apart. In most of
the country he is an intensely hated figure, and there seems no
doubt that he will be found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the top lieutenant to Ocalan, Semdin Sakik, was
sentenced to death, and in all probability Ocalan himself will be
sentenced to hang. But it is uncertain whether the sentence will be
carried out. Death sentences in Turkey must be confirmed by
Parliament and the president, and there have been no executions
here since 1984. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit opposes the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit has said that he will seek to change the composition of
the three-judge panel that will try Ocalan by replacing its
military member with a civilian. When the trial opens Monday, there
may be a motion to postpone it until Parliament can approve such a
change.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will be held on the remote prison island of Imrali in
the Sea of Marmara, where Ocalan is the sole inmate. He will
reportedly be placed in a bullet-proof glass box in the specially
designed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocalan will only be able to communicate with the chief judge
through a microphone,'' said one of his lawyers, Ercan Kanar. ``He
will not be able to hear his own lawyers or anything else in the
courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanar also complained that he and other defense lawyers have
been allowed only limited access to their client, and that their
interviews with him have been monitored by hooded soldiers. He said
Ocalan has not been allowed to read the charges against him or
other trial documents.
</P>
<P>
   This week, two New York-based groups complained about the
conditions under which Ocalan has had to prepare his defense. Human
Rights Watch said he should not have been held in ``incommunicado
detention,'' and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights asserted
that his lawyers have had to work in an ``atmosphere of
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 10 million Kurds among Turkey's 65 million
people, most of them with roots in the southeastern provinces,
which have been shaken by violence for the last 15 years. Some say
they have been oppressed under Turkish rule, but the government
insists that they are granted the same rights as other citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish authorities say they have all but wiped out Ocalan's
guerrilla force, the Kurdistan Workers Party. Although they report
fatal clashes every few days, they say the capture of Ocalan has
been a devastating blow to the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kurds in the southeast disagree. ``This movement is not
going to be finished by arresting or executing one person,'' said a
Kurdish businessman from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``One is going, but thousands are
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Many details of how Ocalan's trial will be conducted are still
unknown. Human Human rights advocates and many foreign governments
are anxiously awaiting its beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the world will understand if Ocalan is found guilty
and even if he is sentenced to death, but only on condition that he
gets a trial that meets international standards of fairness,'' said
a foreign ambassador based in Ankara. ``He has to have access to
the lawyers of his choice. The lawyers have to be able to work
freely. Ocalan himself has to be given the right to say whatever he
wants in the courtroom. Neutral parties need to be allowed to sit
in the back and take notes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this happens, most of us will be satisfied,'' the
ambassador said. ``Otherwise the trial is just going to reinforce
negative stereotypes about the Turkish justice system.''

ISRAEL CONFIRMS DISCOVERY OF SUBMARINE LOST IN 1968 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For three decades, a missing submarine has haunted
Israel. Accustomed to bloody battle and gruesome terrorism, the
country was lastingly unsettled by the quiet tragedy of an
unresolved mystery.
</P>
<P>
   One January night in 1968, the Dakar, a British submarine newly
refurbished for the Israeli navy, disappeared in the midst of its
maiden voyage, from England to Haifa. A 69-man crew vanished with
it, lost without a trace in a maritime enigma that became a
legendary part of Israeli history.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the wreck of the Dakar was found 9,500 feet beneath
the Mediterranean Sea, between Crete and Cyprus. On Saturday night,
the Israeli navy confirmed the findings of a joint Israeli-American
search team. Underwater photographs taken by an aquatic robot
proved that the hull belonged to the Dakar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more exciting to find than the Titanic because to me
the Titanic is just a shipwreck,'' Thomas Dettweiler, who led the
search teams for both vessels, told Agence France-Presse aboard his
boat. ``With the Titanic most people have died who had any
connection with it, but with the Dakar it's still living.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 31 years after the ship was lost at sea, Israel
officially went into mourning. Newspapers printed pictures of each
downed naval crewman and officer, pictures frozen in time. Israel
Radio played somber music, and, repeatedly, a recording of the
final transmission from the ship _ a musical tribute to the ship
sung by its new crew.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where the ritual of burial is a national obsession,
many urged the government to try to raise the submarine from the
deep to retrieve whatever human remains might exist after all this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that they will pull the submarine from the sea and
bring the boys to burial in Israel so we will have somewhere to go
and cry,'' Shmuel Shenfer, whose son Reuven was aboard, told Itim,
the Israeli news agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a disturbing coda to the Dakar saga, a former navy commander,
Adm. Michael Barkai, killed himself hours after hearing that the
submarine had been located. His brother, Maj. Avraham Barkai, had
been the ship's deputy commander.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral, whose decorated navy career ended abruptly 20 years
ago after he stood trial and was acquitted on sexual assault
charges, had been sick with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1968, an Israeli crew set out from Portsmouth,
England, to introduce the new submarine into the Israeli naval
fleet. Purchased from the British, the World War II-era vessel had
been refurbished and proudly inaugurated before the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Just off Crete, the ship sent what would be its final message to
shore, including the group warbling of a giddy, prideful tribute to
the new craft, written by Avraham Barkai: ``The Dakar is in the
depths in full strength,'' they sang.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ship disappeared. For two weeks, the Israeli navy
searched, with help from other navies. In mid-February, Moshe
Dayan, then the defense minister, and senior military officials
pronounced the hunt futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day the Dakar was declared sunk with all hands aboard has
remained indelibly etched on my soul,'' Zeev Schiff, the military
editor of Haaretz, wrote Sunday. Schiff described how a crowd of
the crew's relatives, gathered at a naval base, was stunned into
silence after officials proclaimed the search to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff continued: ``Then, one voice started wailing, and the
floodgate of tears was let loose as an untamed cry of bereavement
arose from the hundreds of voices in unison. The mood swung from
grief to pandemonium, as everyone stormed the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayan, he said, sneaked out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   About a year after the initial search was called off, the
submarine's emergency buoy washed up on the coast off the Gaza
Strip. The navy made the assumption that the boat had veered from
its course to go down in relatively shallow waters off Egypt. That
assumption governed a new round of searches for the Dakar, which
were made easier after Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, under continuing pressure from the relatives of
the crew, the navy asked for help from the United States, which
assisted with further explorations. A few months ago, American
Nauticus Corp., which discovered the remains of the Titanic, was
hired by Israel to use its advanced technology to sweep the ocean
floor. With sonar gear and robot-guided deep-sea cameras, the Dakar
was found about 300 miles west of Israel _ precisely on its
original course.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine had vanished, though, during an era when
delicately balanced superpower rivalries were being fought out
beneath the seas, when Israel and Egypt were still enemies and when
Soviet and Egyptian fleets dotted the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Its mysterious disappearance inevitably spawned any number of
theories, and the mystery will not be resolved for some time, if
ever. An initial examination of the submarine suggested that it did
not sink because of an enemy attack, but more likely because of a
technical malfunction, human error or a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Gideon Raz, a former deputy commander in the Israeli
navy, visited the site of the wreck Sunday and observed the
submarine through an underwater camera. He said that the front
section was whole, the middle section damaged and the rear section
separated from the main body. Parts were spread about the ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can say that it was not caused by a large
explosion, or explosives, or ammunition,'' he said. ``One thing is
clear, given that the pieces did not spread over a large radius: It
fell almost whole until the end of its fall.'

   CULLMAN, Ala. _ Before sound bites, before the press was called
the media, before the talk of broadband communications,
narrowcasting or dot-com Web portals, there was The Cullman Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Times, which sells 10,358 copies daily, has been there for
43 years. And it is still there for big events: it was the first to
tell many of its readers of the death of Diana, princess of Wales.
More recently, it let them know when $13.50 worth of gasoline was
stolen from the grocery-store pumps on Route 278. It went nuts over
the state championship girls' basketball team from Cold Springs
High School. It regularly notes who is admitted and discharged from
the Cullman Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is one of 940 daily newspapers around the United
States with circulations of 20,000 or less. Many such newspapers
once had profit margins only a family could love. But recently,
while attention was focused on cable and Internet companies, these
far-flung atolls of the information age have been bought, sold and
swapped like the most valuable properties in a manic Monopoly game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, more than 300 daily newspapers changed hands,
according to Owen Van Essen, whose Santa Fe, N.M. firm _ Dirks, Van
Essen &AMP; Associates _ brokers newspaper sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, a new generation of companies is emerging with a
different profile from earlier groups. The newcomers have borrowed
the strategy _ favored by Thomson Newspapers and others _ of buying
clusters of newspapers in one geographic area, sharing printing and
accounting facilities and offering big regional advertisers five or
six papers in a single buy.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the established publishing companies, which acquire
large and small newspapers in both rural and urban settings, the
newcomers have focused exclusively on community newspapers in
out-of-the-way regions where the skies are truly dark at night.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the new wave is a Birmingham, Ala., company called
Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., which bought The Times and 44
other newspapers late last year and, in the process, became the
biggest little newspaper company in the country (95 dailies, 125
weeklies).
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Community Newspaper Holdings is a rarity: Its sole
investor is a pension fund, which has provided all its working
capital. The Retirement Systems of Alabama, which has $22 billion
in assets, has lent the company $1.13 billion to buy newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   What would a pension fund want with small newspapers, the bottom
end of a business that is, in the polite putdown of the financial
world, mature? Small newspapers are suffering from the same
problems as their larger brethren: declining circulation and
limited growth potential for the ink-on-paper product.
</P>
<P>
   But Community Newspaper and others see gold in the steady if
unspectacular cash flow of small businesses that often operate with
little or no competition.
</P>
<P>
   There are other incentives. Think synergy at its most basic. The
director of the Alabama pension fund, David Bronner, wanted a solid
return on his investment and a media platform from which to sing
the virtues of his adopted state of Alabama. With Community
Newspaper, he gets both.
</P>
<P>
   John Morton, a newspaper-industry analyst, set up the
pension-fund manager's calculation like this: ``I can invest in the
bond market and earn five or six percent _ or I can invest in all
of these teeny cash-flow engines stuck all over the place'' for
double that return. ``Even if we have a national recession,''
Morton added, ``these are pretty durable.''
</P>
<P>
   That durability, however, depends on putting the right
combination of newspapers together. Not all regions fit Community
Newspaper's vision. Ralph J. Martin, the company's top executive,
is looking for areas with stable or growing populations, far enough
away from large television markets that there are few competitors
for local advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   He has developed a rough formula. For long-term economic
stability, Martin said, it helps if a newspaper is near a county
seat (lawyers tend to be newspaper readers; governments take out
legal advertising); near large educational and medical institutions
(educated work force, recession-resistant employers); near large
government operations (recession-resistant, stable employers), and
near an Interstate highway (truck traffic and tourism keep
communities healthy).
</P>
<P>
   He has selected Community Newspaper's newspapers with an eye to
minimizing the effects of an economic downturn. Martin, the
president and chief executive of Community Newspaper Holdings, said
recessions tend to hit the country at large for 18 months to two
years; in markets that fit his formula, he said, recessions have
lasted eight months or less.
</P>
<P>
   To further reduce risk, he is diversifying. Community
Newspaper's publications are based in a mixed basket of
microeconomies in places from northern New York to Kentucky to
Texas, reducing the risk that all the revenue streams would dry up
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, newspapers are not exactly a traditional investment for
a pension fund, but then again, Bronner is not exactly a
traditional pension-fund manager. His investments have also
included a New York skyscraper, a steel mill in Birmingham,
chemical plants in Mobile, a Wal-Mart distribution center in
Cullman, and his favorite, a series of golf courses around his
adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stein, a law professor and pension specialist at the
University of Alabama, said some pension-fund members regarded
Bronner as ``something of a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a lot of unorthodox things,'' Stein said. ``He's an
entrepreneur in an industry that is dominated by passive
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bronner took over the fund in 1973, Stein said, it had $500
million in assets _ ``one dollar for every four dollars we owed.''
In 25 years, the assets have grown to $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reason to be out on the cutting edge on some of the
things I do,'' Bronner said. ``But I think about it very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment decisions, he said, are made for financial reasons
first, and then are designed to meet one other unique criterion:
``Can I change the image of Alabama?''
</P>
<P>
   So when the state got a round of terrible publicity in 1990,
when the Professional Golfers' Association held its tournament at
an all-white country club, Bronner's response was to pour $120
million in retirement-system funds into a string of
state-of-the-art golf courses, open to all. The Robert Trent Jones
Golf Trail now has 324 holes to play in seven locations around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bronner wanted to spread the word. Which is where the
newspapers come in. In addition to interest rates ranging from 9
percent to 10.4 percent, the Retirement System of Alabama requires,
as a condition of its loans to Community Newspaper, that the
company's papers provide free advertising space to the pension fund
to tout the virtues of Alabama. (He made a similar deal when he
invested in a small television company.)
</P>
<P>
   Community Newspaper's creators had different, though
complementary, agendas. Martin had worked for another large chain
and wanted to run a company of his own. One of the company's other
partners, Tom Lindley III, is a reporter turned editor turned
publisher, who is living out old daydreams of running his hometown
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the company's financial goals fit Lindley's notion of
the right balance between profit and investment in journalism. The
interest payments to the pension fund consume 9 percent to 10
percent of Community Newspaper's profit; the overall margins
expected from the newspapers, Martin said, range from 19 percent to
26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is well below the 30 percent-plus margins of some Wall
Street favorites, like Gannett Co. But Martin said he preferred to
reinvest the difference in presses, computer technology and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the first generation of chaining was going on,'' Martin,
a former executive at Thomson Newspapers, said, ``there was so much
opportunity from a consolidation standpoint'' that executives
focused on efficiency. ``I don't think there was an attack on
news,'' he added. ``It just fell through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he wanted local editorial autonomy, and said he
offered only a few guidelines. Editors and publishers may not
double as local political leaders and no article may be run unless
the subject of the piece has had a fair chance to present his or
her side.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has encouraged the 53 Community Newspaper publications in
Oklahoma to create a common statehouse bureau that none could have
afforded on its own; the bureau opened four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is a question about whether the state of Alabama, through
its pension fund, could have a financial interest in a paper like
The Cullman Times without tainting its journalism. Will Alabama get
kid-glove treatment from Community Newspaper? ``No,'' Bronner said,
``because I know we will drag one foot forward and shoot it off
every once in a while.'' All he wants, he said, is to make clear
that ``there are some positive aspects along with the negative
aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy did not work well at one twice-weekly newspaper,
The Floyd County Times in eastern Kentucky, which Community
Newspapers bought last year. The newspaper lost two senior
reporters after a dispute with the publisher installed last year _
Martin's brother Ed.
</P>
<P>
   As described in the current issue of American Journalism Review,
the reporters covering the corruption-ridden, economically
depressed community balked at Ed Martin's insistence that when it
comes to news, ``good and bad have the same weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Dowling Jr., editor and publisher of The Cullman Times,
said in a recent interview that a classic newspaper-company mistake
``is to think that all markets are the same and can be approached
in a cookie-cutter fashion.'' He wants the latitude to earn his
community's respect.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley, who is also editor and publisher of The Evening News in
Jeffersonville, Ala., has similar aims.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lindley was the matchmaker between the two key players
in Community Newspaper. He introduced Ralph Martin to David Bronner
in late 1996. One of Bronner's conditions, on making the initial
loan, was that Lindley would be one of the company's owners.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley had firsthand experience of what small-town newspapers
can go through. When he arrived at The Evening News (circulation
10,305) in August 1995, he said, he found a demoralized staff.
Starting salaries for reporters were $265 a week. Just a few months
before, a feature writer had been living in a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   When Lindley asked the dean of Indiana University's journalism
school to give him the names of prospective reporters, he said, he
was told, ``We don't recommend your newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   He started to make changes. Then in mid-1997, the owners of Park
Communications Inc., who had hired him, sold their newspapers to
Media General Inc., now part of Cox Communications Inc. When
Martin, who was running Park's newspaper division, called to tell
him of the sale, Lindley urged Martin to form his own company and
buy some of those properties _ like The Evening News _ back from
Media General.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had long thought about running his own chain, but was not
sure where to get the capital. So Lindley introduced him to
Bronner, whom he had covered as a statehouse reporter for The
Birmingham News.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Bronner hit it off, and Bronner agreed to provide the
company with working capital. In January 1997, Community Newspaper
Holdings was formed with 13 former Park Communications newspapers.
Then Martin went looking for more. Community Newspaper's most
recent big deals brought it 28 newspapers from Donrey Media Group
last September and 45 more from Hollinger Inc. in December.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Martin said, Community Newspaper is resting on
its laurels. Some future acquisitions and adjustments may be made,
but none are on the immediate horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Lindley now worries about both profit and news, but more about
news. ``If we don't do a good job in that regard, then the money
will never come,'' he said. He has hired a city editor and a
photographer, neither of which the paper had. As of now, he said,
``It's not great yet, but it's gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   The news staff is up from nine to 11 and starting salaries are
up 35 percent, to about $360. And letters to the editor are pouring
in; at the end of last month's mayoral race, Lindley found the
angry incumbent mayor banging on his door on a Saturday night,
``scorched'' in Lindley's word, by letters he didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   At The Cullman Times, Dowling is still getting to know his new
bosses. He said he had not lost ``the local autonomy to do what we
need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be heavily involved in this community,'' he said.
``We want to be a cheerleader when people deserve it, and we want
to scold people that need scolding.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For three decades, a missing submarine has haunted
Israel. Accustomed to bloody battle and gruesome terrorism, the
country was lastingly unsettled by the quiet tragedy of an
unresolved mystery.
</P>
<P>
   One January night in 1968, the Dakar, a British submarine newly
refurbished for the Israeli navy, disappeared in the midst of its
maiden voyage, from England to Haifa. A 69-man crew vanished with
it, lost without a trace in a maritime enigma that became a
legendary part of Israeli history.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the wreck of the Dakar was found 9,500 feet beneath
the Mediterranean Sea, between Crete and Cyprus. On Saturday night,
the Israeli navy confirmed the findings of a joint Israeli-American
search team. Underwater photographs taken by an aquatic robot
proved that the hull belonged to the Dakar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more exciting to find than the Titanic because to me
the Titanic is just a shipwreck,'' Thomas Dettweiler, who led the
search teams for both vessels, told Agence France-Presse aboard his
boat. ``With the Titanic most people have died who had any
connection with it, but with the Dakar it's still living.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 31 years after the ship was lost at sea, Israel
officially went into mourning. Newspapers printed pictures of each
downed naval crewman and officer, pictures frozen in time. Israel
Radio played somber music, and, repeatedly, a recording of the
final transmission from the ship _ a musical tribute to the ship
sung by its new crew.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where the ritual of burial is a national obsession,
many urged the government to try to raise the submarine from the
deep to retrieve whatever human remains might exist after all this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that they will pull the submarine from the sea and
bring the boys to burial in Israel so we will have somewhere to go
and cry,'' Shmuel Shenfer, whose son Reuven was aboard, told Itim,
the Israeli news agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a disturbing coda to the Dakar saga, a former navy commander,
Adm. Michael Barkai, killed himself hours after hearing that the
submarine had been located. His brother, Maj. Avraham Barkai, had
been the ship's deputy commander.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral, whose decorated navy career ended abruptly 20 years
ago after he stood trial and was acquitted on sexual assault
charges, had been sick with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1968, an Israeli crew set out from Portsmouth,
England, to introduce the new submarine into the Israeli naval
fleet. Purchased from the British, the World War II-era vessel had
been refurbished and proudly inaugurated before the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Just off Crete, the ship sent what would be its final message to
shore, including the group warbling of a giddy, prideful tribute to
the new craft, written by Avraham Barkai: ``The Dakar is in the
depths in full strength,'' they sang.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ship disappeared. For two weeks, the Israeli navy
searched, with help from other navies. In mid-February, Moshe
Dayan, then the defense minister, and senior military officials
pronounced the hunt futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day the Dakar was declared sunk with all hands aboard has
remained indelibly etched on my soul,'' Zeev Schiff, the military
editor of Haaretz, wrote Sunday. Schiff described how a crowd of
the crew's relatives, gathered at a naval base, was stunned into
silence after officials proclaimed the search to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff continued: ``Then, one voice started wailing, and the
floodgate of tears was let loose as an untamed cry of bereavement
arose from the hundreds of voices in unison. The mood swung from
grief to pandemonium, as everyone stormed the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayan, he said, sneaked out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   About a year after the initial search was called off, the
submarine's emergency buoy washed up on the coast off the Gaza
Strip. The navy made the assumption that the boat had veered from
its course to go down in relatively shallow waters off Egypt. That
assumption governed a new round of searches for the Dakar, which
were made easier after Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, under continuing pressure from the relatives of
the crew, the navy asked for help from the United States, which
assisted with further explorations. A few months ago, American
Nauticus Corp., which discovered the remains of the Titanic, was
hired by Israel to use its advanced technology to sweep the ocean
floor. With sonar gear and robot-guided deep-sea cameras, the Dakar
was found about 300 miles west of Israel _ precisely on its
original course.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine had vanished, though, during an era when
delicately balanced superpower rivalries were being fought out
beneath the seas, when Israel and Egypt were still enemies and when
Soviet and Egyptian fleets dotted the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Its mysterious disappearance inevitably spawned any number of
theories, and the mystery will not be resolved for some time, if
ever. An initial examination of the submarine suggested that it did
not sink because of an enemy attack, but more likely because of a
technical malfunction, human error or a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Gideon Raz, a former deputy commander in the Israeli
navy, visited the site of the wreck Sunday and observed the
submarine through an underwater camera. He said that the front
section was whole, the middle section damaged and the rear section
separated from the main body. Parts were spread about the ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can say that it was not caused by a large
explosion, or explosives, or ammunition,'' he said. ``One thing is
clear, given that the pieces did not spread over a large radius: It
fell almost whole until the end of its fall.'

INDIA STILL UNDECIDED ON PEACE TALKS WITH PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Two days after Pakistan offered to hold peace
talks with India about the current crisis along the cease-fire line
in Kashmir, the Indians said Sunday they are still unsure whether
they want to participate in any such negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that the proposal is under consideration,''
said Raminder Singh Jassal, spokesman for India's Ministry of
External Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to elaborate other than to say that certain ``ground
realities'' must be observed. ``Ground realities'' is a term
frequently invoked by the Indians and can be taken to mean that
they believe they are now succeeding in turning back the incursion.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth day, Indian fighter jets pounded away against a
force of several hundred militants who have taken positions in the
grand but treacherous Himalayan peaks of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Infantry fighting at such altitudes _ as high as 17,000 feet in
what is called the Kargil sector _ requires special training and
expensive cold-weather gear. The Indians say the Pakistanis have
not only provided this logistical support, but have disguised some
of their own troops and sent them into the battle as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistanis deny this, and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
offered to send Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz to New Delhi for a
round of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Aziz said he remained hopeful that there would be a
meeting ``in the next few days.'' He had read press reports that
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee called such talks
unnecessary, but ``we have not been officially communicated any
such thing,'' he said. ``We have asked the Indian side which dates
suit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1947, when India and Pakistan were born into nationhood
from the dying British Empire, the countries have been in conflict
over Kashmir, a vast territory of geographical extremes _ some
parts lush, other utterly barren _ that lies between them.
</P>
<P>
   In the complicated and emotional give-and-take of Partition,
India, which is predominantly Hindu, ended up with Kashmir, which
has a Muslim majority. India considers Kashmir to be one of its 25
states, while overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan insists that the
Kashmiris should be allowed to vote on which of the two nations it
wants to join.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the result
of which is a cease-fire line that runs jaggedly through the
western part of the region. Fighting across that line has continued
year after year, slowing but never stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Pakistan has wanted to involve the United
Nations or another third party in talks to settle the conflict _
something India has resisted. Commentators throughout India suspect
that Pakistan has now contrived a plot in the Himalayas to draw the
world's nervous attention to an old dispute between two new nuclear
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bomb has not deterred Pakistan from its Kashmir
cross-border terrorism; it may have even persuaded Islamabad to
step up its involvement on the grounds that the world would have to
take notice,'' wrote one columnist, M.J. Akbar.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the world cannot help but notice. On Sunday morning,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke with India's
foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, by telephone to discuss the
crisis, according to Jassal. Britain's foreign secretary, Robin
Cook, called Saturday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The crisis in the snow-capped mountains has left India's
caretaker government with its own political avalanche. Vajpayee's
Bharatiya Janata Party is facing elections in September. The BJP _
self-described defense hard-liners who tested nuclear bombs a year
ago _ are not only being faulted for the massive incursion into
Indian territory but also for a peace gesture last February.
Vajpayee rode a bus across the Pakistani border and embraced
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   To many here, that gesture in February now seems naive _ and it
has the government back on its heels defending its olive branch. On
Friday, India's defense minister, George Fernandes, partially
exonerated the Pakistani prime minister of blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this entire episode, the Pakistan army has hatched a
conspiracy to push in the infiltrators, and the Nawaz Sharif
government did not have a major role,'' Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sniping at the BJP, the Indian public has rallied
around the war effort. The five-day air campaign has produced
absorbing daily dramas _ the tragedy of two lost planes and a
helicopter gun ship, the derring-do of soldiers charging up
mountainsides. Combat has pushed the ongoing World Cup of cricket
off the top of the news.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, during briefings for the press, Indian military
spokesman Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh reported the results of an autopsy
of a downed Indian flier whose corpse had been returned. There were
two bullet holes in the body, the general said.
</P>
<P>
   This was ``a cold-blooded murder,'' he said, calling it ``an act
of cowardice.'' Later in the day, a Pakistani military spokesman
called the report baseless.
</P>
<P>
   More exuberantly, Singh then described a battle on Saturday
where Indian troops encircled and overran one of the militants'
hard-to-attack perches. In this ``very gallant action,'' an Indian
major ``made the supreme sacrifice and laid down his own life,''
though not before he ``shot dead four of the intruders.''

 &HT;    END of the INNOCENCE: Racing hype a heart-breaking reminder of
tragedy for N.C. family
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONNELLY SPRINGS, N.C. _ It had been a typical Saturday for the
Pyatte family, and life was good.
</P>
<P>
   The granddaughter's tee-ball game that morning was entertaining,
and the dinner in nearby Lincolnton that evening was excellent.
Vickie Pyatte was glad that her husband, Roger, seemed to be
holding his own with his heart problems, and her 21-year-old son,
Randy, who was attending an open-wheel auto race in Concord that
night, had moved back home.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple returned from Lincolnton that evening with Roger's
nephew and wife to the modest Pyatte home, a doublewide trailer,
they chose conversation over television. So they muted the volume
on the TV and talked. An hour later, an emergency bulletin
scrolling across the bottom of the screen caught their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Accident at the fourth turn at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Spectators
hurt, maybe killed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps out of curiosity, maybe motherly concern, Vickie began
searching for a business card, which had the number of the cellular
telephone Randy had purchased that afternoon. He was attending the
VisionAire 500 race at Lowe's with two cousins and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie quickly dialed the number. No answer. She tried again. No
answer. She tried again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   Her curiosity and concern turned into fear, and she began
thinking something was terribly wrong. Roger noticed. In an effort
to calm his wife, he told Vickie that Randy probably left the cell
phone in the car, because that's the way he takes care of his
things.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger decided it would be a good idea to leave a message. So
he dialed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy, this is your daddy,'' Roger said. ``Call me as soon as
you can. It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   They waited.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Growing into an adult
</P>
<P>
   As a shipping clerk at Synthetics Finishing, a company in
Hickory that applies Scotchgard to fabrics, Randy Pyatte loaded
trucks and packed orders. He liked the job, especially talking with
the truck drivers, who had tales of traveling cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   Work helped ease the pain of personal problems. Randy was
engaged to be married to his high school sweetheart on March 27,
but his bride-to-be broke the engagement two weeks before the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty broken-hearted about it,'' his father said. ``He
always talked to me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy moved back into his parents' home, and Roger cleaned out
the largest bedroom in the well-kept trailer. Randy always kept his
room immaculate. He polished his silver dumbbells and wrapped them
in towels after every workout.
</P>
<P>
   Randy, who graduated from high school in 1995, was a good
athlete, and his father thought he might become a football player
because of his son's 6-foot-1,180-pound frame. But Randy's first
love was basketball. When he was younger, his father built a cement
basketball court in the backyard with some money he inherited from
an uncle. That's where Randy imitated his idol, former University
of North Carolina and Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Randy and his cousins, Chuck Bess and Rodney Pyatte,
left their small community off I-40, about 60 miles east of
Asheville, and went to Charlotte for the ``Hoop-It-Up'' Tournament,
a citywide three-on-three competition. ``The Mystery Boys,'' as
Randy's mother dubbed them, came home from the big city with the
first-place trophy for their division.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, ``The Mystery Boys'' would head to Charlotte
again.
</P>
<P>
   When Rodney, a truck driver, was given complimentary tickets to
the May 1 IRL race by a client, he asked Randy to come along. Randy
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Randy talked briefly with his parents
during breakfast before he left to buy the cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hugged him and told him how much I loved him,''
Vickie said. ``That Saturday, I didn't get to talk to him much
because he was so excited and was getting everything ready for the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   After buying the telephone, Randy drove to Rodney's house in
Hickory. Rodney, 29, is married and has two children, with another
baby on the way. They spent the early afternoon at Rodney's
8-year-old son's Little League game, then returned to Rodney's
house to leave for Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 p.m. Saturday, the four men -- Randy, Rodney, Chuck Bess
and Jeff Patton, a close friend of Rodney from Connelly Springs --
loaded into Rodney's champagne-colored Ford Explorer to make the
drive to Lowe's, a few miles north of Charlotte on I-85.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly Springs is located in the heart of the stock-car-racing
world; life-sized advertisements of NASCAR drivers Jeff Gordon,
Richard Petty and the late Davey Allison greet customers in the BP
gas station where Diane McGee, Randy's aunt, works. But Randy
wasn't brought up in a racing family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really liked racing, but my parents liked it, and I
had to go to the races when I was younger,'' Vickie said. ``I
always cried when the cars wrecked because I thought someone was
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   So Randy was a rookie, attending his first race. Patton, married
without children, was the biggest racing fan in the group, dragging
Rodney to the paved half-mile track at Hickory Speedway the
previous three Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour drive to Charlotte, the men rarely talked
about the race. They didn't really know about any of the drivers in
the IRL. The real attraction was speed: Rodney explained to Randy
that Indy cars could go as fast as 220 mph on the high-banked oval.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, Rodney played a recording of the sermon his
pastor, Mark Robinson, had delivered the preceding Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about heaven and hell,'' Rodney said. ``He was talking
about how it's going to be when we get to heaven's gates. After we
listened to it, I told them, `Isn't it great to know that we're
going on to heaven, regardless of how or when we die?'''
</P>
<P>
   Randy agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: New market for IRL
</P>
<P>
   When the group arrived at the track around 4:30 p.m., the scene
at the speedway resembled nothing like the two NASCAR races held
each year at Lowe's. Around the track, the open grass fields,
usually transformed into a makeshift campground of RVs, tents and
converted school buses, were not filled with fans. The crowd was
estimated at less than half of the 175,000 fans who cram the
facility for Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   The track had been known as Charlotte Motor Speedway before its
naming rights were sold to Lowe's earlier this year. It was 40
years old before millionaire Bruton Smith, a Charlotte automobile
dealer and president of Speedway Motorsports Inc., allowed
open-wheel cars to run on the 1.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a bold gamble at the time, bringing the
unfamiliar cars and foreign drivers to the South, where stock-car
racing grew from bootleggers running moonshine in the mountains to
the multi-billion-dollar business it is today.
</P>
<P>
   The sport lost much of its appeal after Indianapolis Motor
Speedway president Tony George broke away from the Championship
Auto Racing Teams (CART) circuit, which had controlled Indy-car
racing since 1979, and formed the Indy Racing League (IRL).
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling IRL negotiated a three-year contract with Smith's
Speedway Motorsports Inc. in 1997, allowing the series to race on
ovals in such bigger markets as Atlanta, Charlotte, Fort Worth and
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   CART endured its own problems in July 1998, when three
spectators were killed and six injured during a race at Michigan
Speedway. A car driven by Adrian Fernandez of Mexico slid into the
wall, and the right front tire and suspension broke off and flew
into the crowd in the fourth turn. The parts cleared a four-foot
wall with an 11-foot fence before killing fans in the eighth and
10th rows.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney said he and his friends knew nothing about the sport's
dangers. They never discussed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought we'd go to Charlotte, have a good time at the
race and go back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Moved to different seats
</P>
<P>
   About 4:45 p.m., the four found their seats in Section D of the
fourth-turn terrace -- row 9, seats 4 through 7. Before the IRL
race started at 8 p.m., though, they became irritated by a group of
five men and a woman sitting behind them, who apparently were
drinking. Rodney said one of them made a ``smart remark'' to Randy,
so the group decided to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of empty seats around us,'' Rodney said.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't move far, dropping down to some vacant seats in
the eighth row. Randy sat in seat 1, next to the aisle between
sections C and D. Rodney took the seat to Randy's left, and Patton
sat two seats to his left in seat 4. Bess moved to seat 1 in the
seventh row, in front of Randy.
</P>
<P>
   When the IRL race started, the conversation stopped. The cars
were so loud that the four were wearing ear plugs and were limited
to hand signals and facial expressions. From their seats close to
the track, the cars seemed like a blur when they zipped down the
front straightaway. The first 50 laps were mostly uneventful; the
bumping and grinding often found in NASCAR were absent.
</P>
<P>
   During lap 59 of the race, however, something went very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   According to an IRL report, driver Stan Wattles crashed alone in
turn 4, breaking a right-side wheel, probably the rear one. The
track's 15-foot-high catch fence initially contained the tire,
deflecting it back on the track, but then a trailing car driven by
John Paul Jr. knocked it into the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Bess says he saw a puff of smoke and turned to his left to see
the accident. A month later, he still can't let go of the memory of
what he saw: a tire flipping end over end, hurtling into the
bleachers. The tire seemed like it was moving in slow motion, but
it was flying at nearly 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a puff of smoke, and then I saw a tire flying into the
crowd,'' Bess said. ``As soon as I saw the tire, I hit the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney was looking to his right, watching the leaders exit turn
1 when he heard the wreck. As he turned to his left, he saw a black
object in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked back at turn 4 and saw something in the corner of my
eye,'' he said. ``I pulled around really quick and saw something. I
thought it was a bird or something black. It was flying right at my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney said Patton probably never saw the tire. He was struck in
the face and died instantly. The tire bounced right and struck the
left side of Randy's head, killing him, also instantly. Another
man, Dexter Mobley, 41, of Statesville, N.C., a native of Albany,
Ga., sitting a few sections away, also was killed before the tire
came to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney and Bess embraced after realizing what happened, and then
they wept on the metal bleachers. Eyewitnesses said that Rodney
avoided the tire's path when he leaned over to talk to Bess,
sitting in front of Randy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people behind us said Rodney was leaning down and talking
to me, and that's the reason it didn't hit him,'' Bess said. ``We
probably wouldn't have been hit if we hadn't moved down a row.
That's what's ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL and Lowe's officials canceled the rest of the race and
refunded the costs of tickets to fans, many of whom donated the
money to a trust fund for the victims. Eight other spectators were
injured, including a 9-year-old girl, who recently was released
from a Charlotte hospital to start rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I never want to see again,'' Bess said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bess relived the scene on page 86 of the May 10 issue of
Sports Illustrated, which published a photograph of two of the
three dead spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies are wrapped in white sheets, lying in a pool of
blood in the bleachers. The right leg of one of the victims sticks
out from under a sheet. The man is wearing blue jeans and brown
Rockport shoes. That man is Randy, wearing the shoes his sister,
Wendy Grigg, gave him as a present.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Parents' fears confirmed
</P>
<P>
   The telephone finally rang at the Pyatte home about an hour
after the original television bulletin. Roger Pyatte said track
officials had called his sister first, because Rodney and Chuck
were in too much shock to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, Rodney called his uncle, but he couldn't
talk when Roger answered the telephone. A chaplain took the phone
and told Roger that his son had been hit and that he and Vickie
needed to come to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were holding out hope the whole way there,'' Roger said.
``We even took an extra set of clothes with us because we thought
he was coming back with us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Pyattes arrived at Northeast Medical Center in
Charlotte, however, the chaplain delivered the devastating news:
Their only son was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``How in the world are you expected to get back to a normal
life?'' Vickie said. ``My son wasn't supposed to die watching a
race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pyattes buried their son on May 5, following a visitation
that lasted four hours and included more than 1,600 mourners.
Lowe's Motor Speedway president Humpy Wheeler attended the funeral.
So did George and several other IRL officials. The owners of
Synthetics Finishing came all the way from Philadelphia to pay
their respects.
</P>
<P>
   Roger left his son's funeral in an ambulance, after relatives
worried he might suffer another heart attack, like the one he had
18 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought, 'Well, I'll leave this world first, and
Randy will still be here to take care of his mother,''' Roger said.
``I never would have thought I'd be picking out a casket for my own
son's funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of that tragic night at Lowe's Motor Speedway never
will go away fully. Rodney said he often is afraid to go to sleep
at night, but counseling has helped him deal with his friends'
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Roger and Vickie have had trouble sleeping and are under a
doctor's care.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie tried to return to her job as a waitress on May 18, but
she left after only a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: A lawsuit in the making
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with today's Indianapolis 500, the IRL will require
all cars to use wheel tethers, devices designed to keep wheels and
suspension parts attached to the cars during accidents. Formula One
and CART already require the safety measures. Earlier this month,
SMI announced that it would raise fences to 21 feet at its tracks
that host IRL events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against the cars running,'' Roger said, ``but if the
tracks aren't designed to hold them, then they don't need to be on
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger said he is considering legal action against the IRL and
SMI. ``It's like every day you get angrier and angrier. You want to
know why they didn't do anything before this happened. If I'd known
the dangers, I wouldn't have let my son go. There isn't any amount
of money in the world that will bring my son back.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night, Roger stood in front of a congregation of
about 60 people at the Icard Church of God and thanked them for
their support and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not questioning God about this matter,'' he told
them, ``but I would kind of like to know why things like this
happen. When my son was living, after he'd broken up with his
fiance, he told me, `Daddy, if she would just tell me how she
feels, I really think I could deal with it and go on with my life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If God would give me some sort of sign, maybe it would help me
heal my heart. We're in a lost world. People don't understand what
we're going through.''
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, Vickie and Roger Pyatte said, they
received their sign from God.
</P>
<P>
   While Vickie slept in their bedroom in the front of the house,
she said, she saw her son in a dream. She saw angels flying in a
blue sky and she asked them if they'd seen her son. She called out
his name, but he never answered. Finally, she saw her son standing
next to a stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my son, and he looked like he was so happy,'' she said.
``I kept saying, `Randy, I'm here!' But he just looked like he was
so happy, and it was so beautiful down there. If you could have
seen the expression on his face, he just looked like he was so
happy and peaceful. It was comforting. We feel like it's some kind
of answer.''

   &UR; HOW TO LIVE LIKE A CELEBRITY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Profiles in the latest issue of Harper's Bazaar reveal that:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Kate Capshaw  &LR; _ producer and star of ``The Love Letter,''
wife of  &UR; Steven Spielberg &LR;  _ makes challah every Friday night and
isn't shy about touting her chest (``A lot of designers don't
design for breasts'') or her husband (``I live with a genius'').
</P>
<P>
   - Actor  &UR; Anthony Hopkins &LR;  can't be bothered with dinner parties
but will reluctantly meet friends in restaurants (``if you meet
someone in a restaurant you can eat very fast, pay and then go'').
</P>
<P>
   - Modernist clothing designer  &UR; Yohji Yamamoto &LR; , who doesn't own
paintings (``It hurts his eyes to look at art unless it's in a
museum,'' says his assistant), told his architect to design him a
house that looked like a prison (``because it's a very easy way to
live'') but drives a Rolls-Royce (``I do have one weakness, and
it's for British cars'').
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The chic bathroom fixture _ ``like having a Sub-Zero in the
kitchen,'' one decorator told the New York Times _ is the home
urinal. The Times lists a number of celebrities who are
urinal-compliant, including restaurateur  &UR; Keith McNally &LR; , filmmaker
 &UR; Ethan Coen &LR;  and director  &UR; Barry Sonnenfeld &LR; .  &UR; Tom Hanks &LR;  is still
waiting for installation.
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Metro makes a modern residential version of this
convenience, which,  &UR; Lisa Ryan &LR;  points out, bears a stylish
similarity to steel prison urinals, which just goes to prove
Yamamoto's cutting-edge sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EVERY PROBLEM SOLVED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So what's bothering you?  &UR; Clayton Barbeau  &LR; received a mailing
advertising a book _ which shall go unnamed herein _ available for
order from Henderson, Nev., promising the following little things:
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of physical appearances, you will be having sex
with beautiful women of your choice''; ``You will be such a
superior lover, those women will fall in love with you''; ``You
will be making thousands of dollars each week''; ``You will get rid
of your recurring illnesses''; ``You will lose all your fat'';
``Everyone will become interested in you''; ``Beautiful women and
powerful men will almost beg to be your friends''; ``You will get
an instant promotion''; ``You will become very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   This last may mean you will realize the value of every promise
that came before it.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Oh, one more problem you may have missed worrying about:
 &UR; Jim Bakker &LR; , born-again born-again, cq &LR; is predicting that an
asteroid is going to crash into the Earth. ``Y2K is going to be a
Sunday picnic compared to what else is going to happen,'' he said
in a recent sermon. ``All I say is don't fall in love with this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Cher &LR;  told Ladies' Home Journal she's been celibate for six
years. In related news, Entertainment Weekly reports that a pair of
 &UR; Pamela Anderson Lee &LR; 's panties sold for $400 on eBay, but
 &UR; Elizabeth Berkley &LR; 's panties went for only $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   - Teen magazine provides answers to questions you never asked:
an ounce of cheese is the same size as a lipstick; 2 &LR; two
tablespoons of peanut butter equal a golf ball; and two to three
ounces of meat are the same size as a tape cassette.
</P>
<P>
   - When she visited a Macedonian clothing factory a few weeks
ago,  &UR; Hillary Rodham Clinton  &LR; was told of workers' fears of being
laid off because Liz Claiborne Inc. had been cutting orders there.
When she returned to Washington, the first lady called Liz
Claiborne executives to discuss the cuts. The Washington Post
reports on the success of her call: Claiborne has issued a
long-term order for 4,000 units of clothing a week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Lisa Rogak &LR; , author of a forthcoming novel she says is based
on her own experiences as the straight wife of a man who came
``roaring out of the closet,'' has proclaimed June Straight Spouse
Awareness Month.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Geraldine Ferraro &LR; , whose Senate aspirations came to naught,
is joining Weber McGinn, an Arlington, Va., public relations firm,
to advise clients on women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   - In response to the angry New York restaurateur who sought
revenge on a New York Times reporter by giving out his home phone
number as the reservation line,  &UR; Mark Talbot  &LR; suggests that if he
had been the reporter, ``I would have cheerfully accepted the
reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough affluence in Southern California that they can
say you have to have both the BMW and the breast implants.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Robert Joas &LR; ,  &LR;  anesthesiologist and president of the Medical
Board of California, in a Los Angeles Times story about teenagers
getting breast implants, often as high school graduation presents.

 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Older Americans were once among the most loyal of
Democratic voters in congressional elections, reliably returning
the party of Roosevelt and Truman to power on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Deal generation of older Americans is passing _
World War II veterans are dying at a rate of more than 1,000 a day,
by one government estimate _ and their successors are more likely
to have Ronald Reagan as a reference point than Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys of voters leaving the polls, Republicans
carried the 60-and-over vote in House races in the last three
elections, a source of considerable soul-searching among Democrats.
The power of older voters is magnified because of a simple fact:
They turn out at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   And strategists in both parties now see older Americans as a
critical swing vote in elections next year, a factor that could
determine control of the House of Representatives, where
Republicans hold a scant 222-211 majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to take back the House or win the
presidency without taking back seniors,'' said Celinda Lake, a
Democratic pollster. ``That makes them the key battleground, and
both parties know it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some Democratic analysts think that their party would
control the House today had it not lost the older vote so
decisively last November, by 55 percent to 45 percent, while
winning or breaking even with every other age group.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened competition for the 60-plus vote affects the
policy agenda in a variety of ways, strategists say. It helps
explain why the gaps in Medicare benefits, like prescription drug
coverage and long-term care, are getting more attention on Capitol
Hill these days. As Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, puts it,
``We're having a policy debate over a prescription drug benefit
instead of what do we do about the uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   This competition also makes it harder, in the short term, to
reach bipartisan consensus on the financial difficulties of Social
Security and Medicare, which both need shoring up before the baby
boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each party is trying to one-up the other,'' said Rep. Thomas
Davis III, R-Va., chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, while adding that he was ultimately optimistic about a
solution. ``It's difficult now because everybody wants the other
guy to go first and take a shot at their proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is quite sure why the older vote has shifted, but
demographics are clearly part of it. Many analysts note that as a
group, older Americans are substantially more affluent today than
they were 30 years ago. The poverty rate for Americans 65 and older
dropped to 10.5 percent in 1997 from 35 percent in 1959, according
to the Census Bureau. Their median income, in constant 1992
dollars, more than doubled between 1957 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more affluent, more educated, more mobile, healthier,
wealthier, and I'd go a step further and say more positively
disposed to the private sector,'' said Susan MacManus, a political
science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa,
speaking of people who are just now joining the ranks of older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, their political allegiances were formed in a different
era. ``Many of the elderly today were in the prime of their working
lives during the Reagan era,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.
``They were Reagan Democrats. So ideologically, they're probably
more centrist and to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Teeter, a pollster who long worked in Republican
politics, noted that such generational shifts have occurred before.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Teeter said, older Americans were
considered reliably Republican voters. By the 1970s, he recalled,
``you'd sit through all kinds of meetings'' with Republicans trying
to figure out why they were losing that vote. The voter surveys
showed Democrats carrying the 60-and-older vote in House races from
1980 through 1992, with one exception: the Reagan landslide year of
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Binstock, a professor of aging, health and society at
Case Western Reserve University, has argued for many years against
the notion that older Americans are a monolithic group voting
solely on the basis of their age and their benefit programs. Other
factors, like economic status and gender, affect their voting
behavior, just as they do with every other age group, Binstock
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are significant differences between older women
and older men. Republicans began winning the 60-and-over male vote
in 1994; they did not carry older women until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts argue that older women are much less
economically secure than older men, and therefore more open to
Democratic appeals based on protecting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from demographics, there are also short-term explanations
for the shifting allegiances of older Americans. Strategists in
both parties say the scandal leading to President Clinton's
impeachment probably played a role in the size of the Democrats'
loss among the 60-and-over vote last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors are somewhat more sensitive to the values issues,''
said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, ``and we have not always
presented our strongest face on those issues in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   The voter surveys support this analysis: Social Security was the
top issue on the minds of 60-and-over voters last November, but
moral and ethical standards ranked No. 2; and 89 percent of those
who said the moral issues were the determining factor in their vote
selected a Republican candidate for the House.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists and candidates have also gotten better at
campaigning for the votes of older Americans, strategists in both
parties say. For years, Republicans were on the defensive, battered
by Democratic campaigns accusing them of plotting to cut Social
Security or Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., remembers one particularly rough
election in 1982, after the intense maneuvering around Social
Security of the early Reagan administration, including a Senate
Republican plan calling for $40 billion in unspecified Social
Security savings over three years. The plan quickly died, but the
issue did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have vivid memories of the bumper sticker: Save Social
Security, Vote Democratic,'' Shaw said. ``I went home and I changed
every political ad I had going, and everything was Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Republicans have learned to anticipate those
campaigns. Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said, ``Rather than
wringing our hands and waiting for the Democrats to use their scare
tactics on Social Security and Medicare, we've been getting out
there and saying, `This is our position, and don't believe the
scare tactics of the last few weeks.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the current maneuvering over the budget, Republicans have
been promoting their ``lockbox'' proposal, pledging to ``lock
away'' the Social Security surpluses. The House passed a version of
the proposal last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Social Security and Medicare are neutralized'' as issues,
Davis said, ``Republicans do very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see what the Republicans are doing as ``fuzzing up
these issues,'' in the words of Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt added, ``We have not done a good enough job pointing
out the real differences between the two parties on issues of real
importance to seniors _ i.e., the patient bill of rights, getting
prescription drugs to people on Medicare at a good price, long-term
care insurance and tax breaks for long-term care, shoring up and
keeping strong Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, chairman of the House Democratic
caucus, argued that when Democratic candidates campaign hard for
older votes on the traditional issues, they prevail. Democrats, in
short, remain convinced that their party, which pushed through the
legislation creating Social Security and Medicare, should, by all
rights, have a natural advantage with older voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Jacobs, associate professor of political science at
the University of Minnesota, and an expert on public opinion and
the elderly, argues that the differences between the two parties
are muted on some of the key issues today _ like putting more
managed care into Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   `They don't really perceive the kind of massive differences they
have in the past,'' Jacobs said of older voters.
</P>
<P>
   All of these issues are the subject of intense speculation in
both parties right now, with one fact adding urgency to it all.
Older Americans are not simply a growing population, but one that
continues to vote at a remarkable rate. They made up 28 percent of
the total House vote in 1998, but can account for a third or more
of the vote on Election Day in states like Florida and
Pennsylvania. And in recent elections, people age 65 and up were
more than twice as likely to vote as people age 18 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   So the struggle continues: A Gallup Poll released last week
showed Democrats and Republicans essentially in a dead heat among
voters 65 and up, when asked whether a Democratic- or
Republican-controlled Congress would be better for the country.

DIVORCE RATE IS HIGHER AMONG DISABLED, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ala., Tenn., Md., Pa., Neb., Va., Mass., Calif., N.Y.,
Wash.)  (lb) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As modern medicine extends the lives of people with
chronic diseases from diabetes to cystic fibrosis, the rate of
divorce among them is increasing, leaving a growing number without
income, health insurance or support at home, health analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons, they say, are the stresses on the health of
the spouse caring for a disabled partner, and the pressure on
family finances, especially if one spouse has to stop working to
stay home to tend the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``More diseases that occur in adulthood are treatable, so we
know more couples are living longer with one having a chronic
illness,'' said Dr. John Rolland, a psychiatrist and co-director of
the Center for Family Health at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Harris &AMP; Associates, which has surveyed the relationships
of people with disabilities for the National Organization on
Disability since 1984, found that 13 percent of those it surveyed
last year were divorced, up from 11 percent in 1994 and 9 percent
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The government's National Health Interview Survey of nearly
50,000 households in 1994 said 20.7 percent of the disabled adults
among those polled were divorced or separated, compared with 13.1
percent of those without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys as well as demographers, family therapists and
divorce lawyers suggest that while the divorce rate among spouses
with some health conditions, notably breast cancer and multiple
sclerosis, is about the same as that of the general population, it
is much higher for others.
</P>
<P>
   For people with spinal-cord injuries, said Dr. Michael DeVivo,
an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham,
``marriage rates are below normal, and divorce rates are above
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   When Russ Benning, a 50-year-old graphic artist from Antioch,
Tenn., was divorced last year after 15 years of marriage, he lost
not only his wife but also her income and her health insurance.
Benning had a painful blood-clotting condition in one leg when he
was married, and it developed in the other leg a year later.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot work and must use a wheelchair, and he makes do with
disability payments of $10,000 a year. ``It's not easy having the
pain, and I do my best not to show it,'' he said, ``but it's
unavoidable. It's also not easy to look at somebody in pain and not
be able to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among couples who stay together despite a disability, many say
they come close to the brink of serious depression or splitting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were high school sweethearts,'' said Barbara Fleming, 52,
of Mount Airy, Md., whose husband, Kenneth, 55, a retired
firefighter, was found to have multiple sclerosis five years ago.
``We were a boating family. We had a beach house. We fished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fleming's condition has ended the old routines. He is lucid
and clear-speaking but he is 90 percent blind and walks with a
cane. ``We struggle along, but in the end it falls on me,'' Mrs.
Fleming said. ``I've gone outside the front door and mentally
screamed. I've been in therapy, and I go back when I feel I have to
have someone to talk to who is not in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne and Steven Mintz were parents of a 5-year-old daughter
when Steven Mintz, an economist, was found to have multiple
sclerosis 25 years ago. ``It turned our lives upside down,'' Ms.
Mintz said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the diagnosis, Ms. Mintz said, ``We separated twice,
for 18 months and again for two years.'' Ms. Mintz used her
experience to establish the National Family Caregivers Association,
an advocacy group in Kensington, Md., with 3,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to talk about feelings, to have a conversation
about what was disturbing us,'' she said. ``He's in a wheelchair,
and he needs help with daily activities. But he's still working,
thank God. We've come to a better place. He has clinical MS, but we
both have MS.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, a team of researchers at Pennsylvania State
University, the University of Nebraska and Virginia Tech have been
monitoring about 2,000 couples on a variety of issues, including
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we find is that declines in health have an adverse
influence on marital quality,'' said John Edwards, professor of
sociology at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions develop because the disabled spouse carries less weight
in the household, shares in fewer activities and withdraws or
becomes moody, angry or critical, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Asch, a professor of biology, ethics and human
reproduction at Wellesley College and a past president of the
Society of Disability Studies, said: ``The data are that marriages
do break up more often when there is a disability than when there
isn't. We also know that men leave wives more often than wives
leave husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say divorce among the disabled is also influenced by
factors that have been driving up the overall rate of divorce, like
more casual public mores, less stigma attached to divorce, and more
wives who work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer considered necessary to hang in there with the
disabled spouse,'' said Ira Lurvey, a divorce and custody lawyer in
Los Angeles and former chairman of the family law section of the
American Bar Association. ``The real message we get from the icons
of society is if the marriage is too hard, you're not expected to
keep it going.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Willard DaSilva, a divorce lawyer in Garden City, N.Y., cited a
client in her 30s who had filed for divorce. The client's husband
had been struck by a car while riding a bicycle and suffered severe
brain injuries, DaSilva said, adding: ``He has difficulty walking,
cognitive problems and needs constant attention. He is no longer
the person she married.''
</P>
<P>
   The health analysts allow that sometimes, in cases of
character-transforming conditions like severe brain injury,
Alzheimer's disease, or conditions requiring the constant care of a
nursing home, separation is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Short of those extremes, however, disability can still change a
marriage's foundations, said William Pinsof, a clinical
psychologist and president of the the Family Institute at
Northwestern University, which trains marriage and family
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It impairs your ability to travel with a spouse, to
participate in social life,'' Pinsof said. ``When you lose your
social and sexual partner as a result of a disability, it has a
huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sandra Weintraub, director of an Alzheimer's clinic at
Northwestern, said: ``There's a whole psychological layer. When you
get married, it's not to be somebody's nurse, and suddenly you are
somebody's nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   For better-off couples, a hired hand can save work and relieve
tension. Dr. Weintraub said, ``There are spouses who say, `In no
way will I diaper my wife.' So you go out and have somebody else
diaper your wife. It helps to have money.''
</P>
<P>
   But money becomes a shrinking resource for couples that become
caught in the bind of a lost job and the rising cost of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully a third of adults with disabilities,'' the Harris study
reported, ``lived in a household with an annual income of less than
$15,000 in 1997, compared to only 12 percent of those without
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Mitchell LaPlante, director of the Disability
Statistics Information Service at the University of California at
San Francisco, ``Americans with disabilities spend more than four
times as much on medical care, services and equipment, on average,
as their nondisabled counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such pressures, the analysts say, disability can
take as big a toll on the care giver as it does on the patient. The
emotional state of patients with spinal-cord injuries often
improves within a year, but that of their spouses often declines,
said Scott Richards, a clinical psychologist and research director
in the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Richards said, may be that other sources of support
_ friends, family, agencies _ drift away, leaving the spouse alone
with the chores.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Teri, director of the Tornyay Center on Health Aging at
the University of Washington in Seattle, said that ``spousal care
givers have much higher levels of burden, depression, medical
illnesses'' than others. Her patients, the elderly, rarely resort
to divorce. But younger generations, she said, ``are more likely to
say it's not worth it.''

   REFORM-JUDAISM (Undated) _ More than a century ago, leaders of
Reform Judaism declared such practices as wearing skullcaps and
prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to be the dated relics
of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on social ethics and a
highly cerebral approach to the faith. But in a symbolically
resonant gesture, and with an eye on the approach of a new century,
Reform's rabbinic arm, the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
last week adopted a document that encourages the movement's members
to explore traditional rituals. By commending study of the mitzvot,
the sacred obligations that include traditional rituals that are
required in more conservative branches of Judaism, the rabbis
positively acknowledged a trend among many of the 1.5 million

   CAR-INDY _ INDIANAPOLIS _ Main news story on Indianapolis 500.

</P>
<P>
   CAR-STEWART _ INDIANAPOLIS and CONCONRD, N.C. _ It was a
logistical nightmare for NASCAR driver Tony Stewart, who raced in
the Indy 500 during the morning, then rushed by helicopter and
company plane to Charlotte for the Coke 600 that night. After
spending the day with Stewart, a forner open-wheel driver and
rookie on the NASCAR circuit, we chronicle the timeline.

   CAR-TRAGEDY _ Vickie Pyatte was watching a television show
several weeks ago when the station interrupted the telecast with a
scroll across the bottom of the screen. ``Spectators injured,
possibly killed during accident at Lowe's Motor Speedway.'' Just to
satisfy her concern, Vicki dialed the cell phone of her son, who
was attending his first race. She knew something was wrong when
there was no answer. What followed has been a nightmare for the
Pyatte family, which is trying to cope with the death of Randy,
their 21-year-old son, who was one of three killed by flying debris
after a crash of open-wheel race cars at at Lowe's. ``When you go
to the racetrack to watch a race, you're not supposed to die,''
Vickie said. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH

   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and four of his top officials have now been indicted for
war crimes in Kosovo. But by all accounts here, the person with the
most influence over him is his dreamy and complicated wife, Mirjana
Markovic, whose life-long sense of persecution will only be
intensified by this new threat to her husband and her family. By
Steven Erlanger.

   INDIA-PAKISTAN (New Delhi, India) _ Update on Indian-Pakistani
fighting over Kashmir. Two days after Pakistan offered to hold
peace talks with India about the current crisis along the
cease-fire line in Kashmir, the Indians said on Sunday that they
are still unsure whether they want to participate in any such
negotiations. By Barry Bearak.

<P>
   REFORM-JUDAISM (Undated) _ More than a century ago, leaders of
Reform Judaism declared such practices as wearing skullcaps and
prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to be the dated relics
of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on social ethics and a
highly cerebral approach to the faith. But in a symbolically
resonant gesture, and with an eye on the approach of a new century,
Reform's rabbinic arm, the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
last week adopted a document that encourages the movement's members
to explore traditional rituals. By commending study of the mitzvot,
the sacred obligations that include traditional rituals that are
required in more conservative branches of Judaism, the rabbis
positively acknowledged a trend among many of the 1.5 million
members of their movement. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-CONTROL (Seattle) _ Just as Congress is on the verge of
approving measures like background checks for gun buyers and safety
lock devices, gun-control measures that had been languishing in
many states are now advancing, from an Oregon plan to require
criminal background checks for people buying firearms at gun shows
to a bill that would make New Jersey the first state to require
that all handguns sold there have ``smart-gun'' features, allowing
a gun to be used only by its registered owner. By Sam Howe
Verhovek.

<P>
   INTERNET-WEALTH (New York) _ In a city where the well-worn paths
to success have led through the trading floor or the ranks of large
media corporations, the emergence of sudden Internet-bred wealth
holds out the promise of much quicker rewards. It is exposing New
Yorkers to the Silicon Valley culture of entrepreneurial risk. And
it is prompting resentment, envy, and a scramble to be a part of
it. By Amy Harmon.

 &HT;    Virtual Wall is a cyberspace version of the real Vietnam
memorial
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    PACKAGES WITH: MEMORIALDAY-SIDE
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His photo album from basic training in his lap, his
fingers clickety-clicking across his computer keyboard, Max Falls
punches in the names of old Army buddies on a new Internet site _
trying to find out how many didn't make it back from Vietnam as he
did, 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically entering the names of the other 170 young men in
his 1968 Ft. Benning basic training company, and other servicemen
he recalls, Falls repeatedly gets the comforting answer, ``No
matches.'' That indicates the soldier wasn't among the 58,219 slain
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not long before a name yields a ``hit,'' eliciting a
muffled groan from Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald Queen,'' he sighs. ``What a shame. He was from my neck
of the woods in north Georgia, a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the click of his mouse, another page pops up on The Vietnam
Veterans Virtual Wall web site, providing details. It turns out
Queen died from grenade wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another click invites Falls to post a remembrance under Queen's
name for anyone to see, or in a general area for reflections.
</P>
<P>
   Falls, 54, owner of Furniture Clinic of Georgia in Austell, had
just about given up trying to find out what happened to many of the
men he once knew. He's enthralled with the Virtual Wall site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered,'' says Falls. ``You hear about the people
from your home town, but now you can find out in a flash about the
others. This is a really neat thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored jointly by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund and
WinStar Communications, a telephone/Internet service provider, the
Virtual Wall web site was launched a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cyberspace version of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
Washington, listing all the names that are etched on the famous
black-granite wall. Web surfers can call up the names of those who
died in Vietnam, punch up details of their deaths, and post
tributes, including color photographs and sound recordings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 5,000 tributes have been left. Jan Scruggs, head
of the the Washington-based Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, expects
that number to mushroom as more ex-servicemen, and loved ones of
those who died, learn about the site, which is getting an
escalating number of hits weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow-burning fuse whenever you come up with a new
idea,'' he says. ``But the word is getting out, and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs says the site is meant to be an extension of the real
wall, a place people can visit without trekking to Washington. A
major purpose, he adds, is to educate America's youth about the
Vietnam War. The site provides histories, commentaries, chat rooms
and photographs that can be called up with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   A committee reviews all tributes before they are posted, usually
within about three days. Many remembrances are painfully personal.
</P>
<P>
   One, for example, was posted by a vet who identified himself as
``just a grunt'' who served with Johnny Ray Bryson of College Park,
who was killed in action Jan. 7, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was near him when he was killed and when I rushed to help
him it was clear that he was gone,'' the grunt wrote. ``He did not
suffer, and he was not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, posted for William D. Sizemore of Augusta, was penned
by his son, Gary _ only 12 when his dad was ambushed in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Dad,'' it begins. ``I just wanted to say hello. As your two
grandaughters grow into beautiful young women, it hurts me even
more that they will never know you as their grandfather. You would
be very proud of them, as they are proud of you. I love you. Your
son, Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore, contacted by phone, said he finds the virtual wall
``cathartic'' and plans to communicate more with his dad. ``I plan
to post some pictures of his grandchildren, my kids, he never got
to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many postings are from relatives searching for vets who knew
their dads. Some leave phone numbers and e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who lost our fathers in Vietnam are searching,''
says Jen Branch Denard, of Tampa, who was 2 when her dad was
killed. ``We're growing old enough to begin to ask questions that
we don't have answers to, and realizing we weren't taught about
Vietnam in school....
</P>
<P>
   ``I check my dad's name often to see if more men who knew him
have checked in.''
</P>
<P>
   George Marlow, 50, of Lawrenceville, has spent a lot of time on
the site tracking down aquaintances. ``You just lose track,'' says
Marlow, who spent a year as a grunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the site, city by city. I just found there were
guys who went to Athens High with me who died in 'Nam. I didn't
know Herman Fields was dead till I found the virtual wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighs. ``But I almost don't want to know who didn't make it.
There's still a lot of hurt there.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls, of Austell, felt better after running through many names
in his basic-training book, relieved that most survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, after all these years, now I know,'' says Falls.
</P>
<P>
   He thumbs through his album, checking more names on the
computer. It takes a while, but eventually he learns that at least
a half-dozen others from his basic training unit didn't come back:
Michael Dean Brown, Donnie Lee Hackney, Robert G. Guinn, Jimmy Lee
Castleberry, Carlton Lee Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Then he points at album pictures of men whose names didn't
``hit.'' He still keeps up with some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy Abercrombie, he made it and has a business in Atlanta,''
Falls says. ``There's Davenport. And Danny McFarland. And Ralph
Brown. Larry Everson, a real cut-up. Warren Long. Look here, here's
Mauldin, the only college graduate in my bunch. Wonder if he made
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin's name is punched in.
</P>
<P>
   He did.

RANGERS RALLY LATE TO TIE, WIN IN 10
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ A strange night for the Rangers ended on a
strange but victorious note when two wild pitches gave them their
fifth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Twins reliever Mike Trombley delivered the wild
pitches after a Ivan Rodriguez double, giving the Rangers a 4-3
victory at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez started the 10th with a double into the left-field
corner. Trombley got two strikes on Juan Gonzalez, but then bounced
two pitches in the dirt past catcher Terry Steinbach to bring home
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Rangers their longest winning streak of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed at the start for 30 minutes by rain. The
Rangers had to play without ailing pitcher Mike Morgan and
outfielder Rusty Greer (sprained shoulder) and lost shortstop Royce
Clayton in the fifth inning with a bruised shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   They still prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty good win to come from behind,'' Rodriguez
said. ``These are games we may need later in the season. We were
just happy to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers trailed 3-2 going into the eighth, but rallied to
tie the game. Rodriguez singled off Twins reliever Bob Wells and
Juan Gonzalez was hit by a pitch. Left-hander Travis Miller came in
and got Rafael Palmeiro to pop out, but Todd Zeile lined a single
to left off Trombley, scoring Rodriguez with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was 2-for-3 last night, extending his hitting streak
to 18 games. He is hitting .375 (27-72) during the streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth, but
reliever Tim Crabtree got Ron Coomer on a grounder to third to end
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings, his 15th consecutive
appearance without giving up a run. That breaks the club record he
shared with Darren Oliver, who had 14 consecutive scoreless
appearances in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett, removed from the rotation two weeks ago, was
pressed into emergency service when Morgan was scratched before the
game because of swelling and pain in his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett showed all signs of giving his best performance of the
year, allowing two hits through four scoreless innings. But he ran
into trouble in the fifth, starting when Marty Cordova and Doug
Mientkiewicz dropped a couple of soft line drives into left field
for base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Steinbach then grounded a run-scoring single through the
left side, and Denny Hocking loaded the bases with a bunt hit that
third baseman Todd Zeile couldn't come up with on the wet grass.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates decided that was enough, bringing in
reliever Mike Venafro to face Todd Walker. But, in a lefty vs.
lefty matchup, Walker lobbed another single into left field,
scoring two runs to give the Twins a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he threw the ball well,'' Oates said of Burkett.
``He was pitching ahead. He just ran out of gas. Before the game, I
was just hoping for four or five innings from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored in the first two innings but nothing more
until the eighth-inning heroics. They got one in the first when Tom
Goodwin reached on an infield single, stole second and, after
Rodriguez walked, scored on Juan Gonzalez's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers then tried to steal a run after Palmeiro flied out
to center for the second out, moving Rodriguez to third. Gonzalez,
with Todd Zeile at the plate, broke for second, got caught in a
rundown but was tagged out a split-second before Rodriguez could
cross home plate for a run.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile then started the second with a home run to center, his
ninth of the season.

LUKAS COULD BE EDGE AS CHARISMATIC GOES FOR SWEEP

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time a horse swept the Triple Crown races, little
Stevie Cauthen wasn't shaving yet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Antley was 12 years old and thought jockeys were something
you wore under your pants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was the youngest attorney general in Arkansas
history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan was still trying to get elected president _ and
few gave him a chance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last 3-year-old .MDBO/[ .MDNM/race.MDBO/].MDNM/horse to pull
off the feat was Affirmed in 1978. But on Saturday, an underdog
colt named Charismatic will attempt to capture the Belmont Stakes
and become racing's 12th Triple Crown winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History says the odds are against him. Twenty-seven horses have
won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Of those, 11 went
on to take the Belmont and secure a place in
thoroughbred.MDBO/-.MDNM/racing immortality. Since the young
Cauthen rode Affirmed to victory in his legendary battles with
rival Alydar, six horses have won the first two legs only to falter
in the Belmont. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic near-miss was last year, when Real Quiet lost
the Triple Crown by a nose to Victory Gallop's desperate surge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Charismatic has one advantage the others have lacked: D.
Wayne Lukas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most successful trainer in racing history has won four
Derbys, five Preaknesses and three Belmonts. During one incredible
run from 1994-1996, Lukas-trained horses won seven .MDBO/[
.MDNM/out.MDBO/].MDNM/of eight Triple Crown races, including six in
a row. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has won classic races with horses of all shapes, colors
and sexes. However, Charismatic, with 33-year-old Antley in the
saddle, will be the first he has brought to the Belmont with a
chance at a sweep. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one gap in my resume that I'd love to fill in,'' Lukas
said. &QL;

FINGER-POINTING CONTINUES IN WAKE OF CHINESE SPYING SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fallout from a congressional report pointing to
China's theft of U.S. nuclear secrets continued Sunday with an
administration official confirming that there will be firings and
demotions at the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another administration official charged that a key
GOP senator who has been among the most critical of the White House
policy on China was briefed about the security problems at the
Energy Department labs almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of accusations and threats of disciplinary action
came in response to last week's release of a report on Chinese
espionage by a congressional committee headed by Rep. Christopher
Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report cites security lapses at the Energy Department's
nuclear labs over several decades that allowed the Chinese to steal
U.S. weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson was asked whether there will be firings and
demotions at his agency within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Richardson. ``And I think the reason is that there
were communications breakdowns, there were incompetent acts,
security was not considered important and counterintelligence was
not considered as important as it should be, and at least under the
people in my department, there should be accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he has insisted since the report was released last week,
Richardson said that many of the security lapses have been
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it is not clear how much China has benefited from
the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very valuable report of Congressman Cox, but the
extent of the damage _ I think the jury is still out,'' Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The finger-pointing over the Chinese spying, which began as soon
as the report was issued, continued on the Sunday talk shows.
Republicans have blamed the Clinton administration for failing to
notify lawmakers of the Chinese spying and of not taking quick
action to halt the activity.
</P>
<P>
   But a former CIA officer who now works for the Energy Department
asserted that members of Congress ignored warnings given to them
several years ago about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Curran, director of counterintelligence for the Energy
Department, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week'' that in 1997 he had
provided information about problems at the Energy labs and
recommendations to remedy the security lapses at the request of
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. Shelby, the chairman of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence, has been among the most critical
of the administration's handling of the China situation.
</P>
<P>
   Curran said he never got a response from Shelby to his report,
which had 26 proposals, including a recommendation to share the
information with other oversight intelligence committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report was very alarming as to the present state of
affairs at counterintelligence,'' Curran said.
</P>
<P>
   Curran said Congress also rejected a $12 million request that he
argued was needed to help detect people breaking into computer
system at the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that in his previous role at the CIA he regularly
briefed Congress about sensitive security lapses but that neither
Shelby nor his staff bothered to attend most of those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``His staff wouldn't even accept our briefings. They got up and
walked away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on ``This Week,'' Shelby responded that Curran was
``out of bounds'' with his accusations, arguing that the Senate
Intelligence Committee did respond to the concerns in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said he did not attend all of the private briefings but
did attend the formal hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby also said he hoped that President Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, would testify before the Senate on
the issue. Some members of Congress have asserted that Berger, who
is in charge of China policy, failed to address the security
problems when he learned about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a pivotal position for a long time,'' said Shelby.
So far, Berger has declined to testify before the Senate.

TAKING A LOOK AT THE TRIPLE CROWN WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
SIR BARTON (1919) Owner: J.K.L. Ross
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trainer: H.G. Bedwell
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: John Loftus
</P>
<P>
   Notable: Believe it or not, Sir Barton had never won a race
prior to the 1919 Kentucky Derby, his first start as a 3-year-old.
The colt with sore feet and a hot temper was entered in the Derby
as a ``rabbit,'' but he led all the way and upset stablemate Billy
Kelly by five lengths. He won the Preakness the same way and added
the Belmont despite a slow start.
GALLANT FOX (1930) Owner: Belair Stud
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: ``Sunny Jim'' Fitzsimmons
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Earl Sande
</P>
<P>
   Notable: Sportswriter Charles Hatton was the first to coin the
phrase ``Triple Crown'' when he covered Gallant Fox's march through
the races. ``The Fox of Belair'' was born with a wild right eye
that was said to frighten other horses, and legendary jockey Sande
came out of retirement to ride him. Gallant Fox is the only Triple
Crown winner to capture the Preakness before the Derby and was the
first to break out of a mechanical starting gate.
OMAHA (1935) Owner: Belair Stud
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: ``Sunny Jim'' Fitzsimmons
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: William Saunders
</P>
<P>
   Notable: Omaha was a son of the first stallion crop of Gallant
Fox, making them the only father-son horse combination to take the
Triple Crown. Calumet Farm filly Nellie Flag was the Derby favorite
that year, but Omaha won all three races comfortably, although he
never was considered a great horse. He remains the only Triple
Crown winner to lose during the series: He was defeated in the
Withers Stakes as a prep for the Belmont.
WAR ADMIRAL (1937) Owner: Glen Riddle Farms
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: George Conway
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Charles Kurtsinger
</P>
<P>
   Notable: Man O' War never won the Triple Crown because he didn't
run in the Kentucky Derby. But the legendary horse made his mark on
the series, anyway, as the sire of War Admiral. Owner Samuel Riddle
almost didn't run War Admiral in the Derby, either, but after a
11/4-mile allowance prep four days before the race, the colt was
entered and won. He took the Preakness by a head and won the
Belmont despite stumbling at the break and suffering a deep cut on
his leg.
WHIRLAWAY (1941) Owner: Calumet Farm
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: Ben Jones
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Eddie Arcaro
</P>
<P>
   Notable: To put it bluntly, Whirlaway was a nut. He liked to
head for the outside rail during his races and was so unpredictable
it seemed he would never fulfill his limitless potential. But
trainer Ben Jones worked tirelessly with the horse and employed
jockey Eddie Arcaro to help. In the end, Calumet Farm's long-tailed
come-from-behinder became one of history's greatest horses. He
shattered a track record in the Kentucky Derby, swept the Triple
Crown convincingly and twice was named Horse of the Year.
COUNT FLEET (1943) Owner: Mrs. John D. Hertz
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: Don Cameron
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: John Longden
</P>
<P>
   Notable: Owned by the Hertz rent-a-car founder, Count Fleet
liked to grab the lead at the start and dare anyone to keep up his
pace. Few could. Initially believed to be a clumsy sort, he was
voted a champion as a 2-year-old, and demolished his competition so
conclusively in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness that only two
horses lined up to oppose him in the Belmont. He crushed them by 25
lengths, setting a track record, but suffered an injury to his left
front ankle during the race and never ran again. His Derby was
known as the ``Streetcar Derby,'' because travel was restricted
during World War II.
ASSAULT (1946) Owner: King Ranch
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: Max Hirsch
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Warren Mehrtens
</P>
<P>
   Notable: Almost as unlikely a Triple Crown hero as Sir Barton,
the Texas-bred Assault stepped on a surveyor's stake as a youngster
and mangled his right front foot. As a result, he walked with a
noticeable limp. But he could run. Nicknamed ``The Clubfooted
Comet,'' the King Ranch colt continued to defy expectations. He was
8-to-1 in the Derby, barely held on to win the Preakness, and again
surprised many handicappers by capturing the Belmont to earn his
place in history. Unfortunately, however, he was sterile at stud.
CITATION (1948) Owner: Calumet Farm
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: Jimmy Jones
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Eddie Arcaro
</P>
<P>
   Notable: The late Eddie Arcaro called Citation not only the best
horse he ever rode, but perhaps the best anyone ever rode. The
Calumet Farm wonder won 19 of his 20 starts as a 3-year-old, and
rolled to dominating Triple Crown victories. He even tuned up for
the Kentucky Derby by outrunning his older stablemate Armed, the
1947 horse of the year, in an allowance race. He later became
racing's first millionaire. Citation didn't lose a race for two
years and five months, and was the last Triple Crown winner for a
quarter-century.
SECRETARIAT (1973) Owner: Meadow Stable
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: Lucien Lauren
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Ron Turcotte
</P>
<P>
   Notable: By the time ``Big Red'' came around, people were
wondering if there would ever be another Triple Crown winner. But
Secretariat captivated the nation with his 3-year-old heroics, and
secured his place in history as one of the most sensational
racehorses of all time. The muscular chestnut set a track record in
the Kentucky Derby that still stands, was robbed of a Preakness
record by a misfiring teletimer, and his other-worldly 31-length
Belmont romp might be the single-best performance by any American
thoroughbred.
SEATTLE SLEW (1977) Owner: Karen Taylor
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: Billy Turner
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Jean Cruget
</P>
<P>
   Notable: An ugly duckling bought for only $17,500 as a yearling,
`Slew'' became the epitome of a professional racehorse. He won all
three of his starts as a juvenile, won three prep races to begin
his 3-year-old season, and swept through the classics to become the
only undefeated Triple Crown champion. The Slew Express was nearly
derailed by a slow start in the Kentucky Derby, but he quickly
bulled his way between horses to reach the front and refused to
turn loose of the lead.
AFFIRMED (1978) Owner: Harbor View Farm
</P>
<P>
   Trainer: Laz Barrera
</P>
<P>
   Jockey: Steve Cauthen
</P>
<P>
   Notable: The nifty chestnut had a nose for the finish line, and
at the expense of his archrival Alydar, he used it to give the
sport its first-ever back-to-back Triple Crown winners. Fueling
what became modern racing's quintessential rivalry, Affirmed
clearly outran Alydar in the Kentucky Derby, then battled him
throughout the stretch of the Preakness and Belmont. In the
Belmont, Alydar moved alongside Affirmed with six furlongs to run,
and they raced in tandem to the finish. Alydar appeared to put his
neck in front of Affirmed in midstretch, but Affirmed, under
18-year-old ``boy wonder'' Steve Cauthen, tenaciously battled back
to win by a head.

BID TO INCLUDE ALCOHOL IN ANTIDRUG CAMPAIGN MEETS RESISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Va., Ky.)  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evidence abounds that beer is more popular with adolescents than
marijuana. Yet while the government is spending $195 million this
year on its national media campaign to dissuade adolescents from
using illicit drugs, not a penny of the appropriated tax dollars
goes to warn about the dangers of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   So this month, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., introduced
an amendment allowing underage drinking to be included among the
advertising campaign's targets. Her effort has not pleased beer
wholesalers, some other members of Congress or even the White
House's Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are neither endorsing nor opposing that proposal for
inclusion of alcohol in the media campaign,'' said Robert Weiner,
the spokesman for Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of national
drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers' wider use of alcohol over drugs has been documented
in the annual survey of adolescent drug use by researchers at the
University of Michigan. In 1998, the survey reported, 74 percent of
the high school seniors sampled said they had drunk alcohol in the
previous year, and nearly one-third said they had gotten drunk
within the last month. In comparison, 38 percent of the seniors
said they had smoked marijuana during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey himself has expressed concern about alcohol use by the
young. ``It's the biggest drug abuse problem for adolescents, and
it's linked to the use of other, illegal drugs,'' he said at a news
conference on Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, McCaffrey told a House Appropriations
subcommittee that he lacked the authority to spend federal money on
anti-alcohol messages in the media campaign, which has now reached
102 cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The law passed by Congress creating the antidrug media campaign
does not define ``drug.'' But the earlier law creating the White
House national drug control office limits its authority to
combating controlled substances, thereby excluding alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roybal-Allard, a subcommittee member, said she was
sufficiently upset by McCaffrey's remarks to put forward her
amendment, which may be voted on next month. ``They're not getting
at the root of the problem, which is underage drinking,'' she said
in a telephone interview from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., joined Ms. Roybal-Allard as a
co-sponsor. ``You're finding more young people dying of
alcohol-related problems than of drugs,'' Wolf said. He said he
wanted to let McCaffrey include underage drinking in the media
campaign ``if he thinks it's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House drug control office says it does not want to
tinker with the campaign's efforts to change youth attitudes about
drugs, and possibly dilute the message about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Blanchard, the chief counsel for McCaffrey, said that
media outlets had been asked to match the federal funds they get
for running the antidrug ads by supplying additional public service
announcements or programming. He estimated that 15 percent of these
would address underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these anti-alcohol messages appear, critics say, they
would account for little more than 7 percent of the advertising
messages in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyn Nunnallee, the national president of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving, accused the White House drug office of ignoring the
problem of underage drinking. ``To say that MADD is a little upset
over Gen. McCaffrey and the direction he has chosen to take would
probably be an understatement,'' Mrs. Nunnallee said in a telephone
interview from her home in Fort Meade, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association, the American Public Health
Association, the American Society of Addiction Medicine and other
medical, church and community groups also support the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition in the House is forming around Rep. Anne Northup,
R-Ky., who promises to kill the amendment when it comes up for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody appreciates Ms. Roybal-Allard's concern,''
Mrs. Northup said. But, she added, ``there are a number of people
that believe that drugs are unique and we shouldn't confuse the
messages and diminish them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message about drugs is don't ever do it, not at any age
and type,'' Ms. Northup said. ``That is not the message about
alcohol, just like it's not the message of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   George Hacker, director of the alcohol policies project for the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit education
and advocacy organization that is rallying support for the
amendment, pointed out that Ms. Northup received more than $38,000
in donations from liquor and beer interests between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Northup said that had nothing to do with her opposition
to the amendment. ``I've seen this tactic a lot where anybody who's
against anything, the first thing people do is pull your campaign
contributions,'' she said. ``That way you don't have to have a
conversation about the quality of the discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Tyrrell, the director of public affairs for the National
Beer Wholesalers' Association, said the amendment ``is not the
proper way to solve the problem'' of underage drinking. Beer
wholesalers already spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on
alcohol awareness programs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the drug czar should be focused on illegal
drugs,'' Ms. Tyrrell said, ``and alcohol is a legal product and,
when consumed responsibly, it has even healthy benefits for certain
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a coalition of
advertising and public relations professionals that is coordinating
the antidrug media campaign, has also found itself in the awkward
position of opposing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't simply assume that the antidrug campaign can be
widened to include something as huge as underage drinking,'' said
Stephen Dnistrian, the partnership's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said the alcohol industry spends close to $3 billion a year
on marketing and promotion, a sum that dwarfs the government's $195
million appropriation for the antidrug media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concern about killing one campaign to help another
that will have virtually no impact,'' Dnistrian said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is not the first time the issue has been raised. Blanchard
said that the Office of National Drug Control Policy tried last
year to include underage drinking as part of its mandate, but the
proposal never reached the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   But Blanchard added, ``Even if we were given the authority, we
wouldn't immediately include alcohol'' because it could confuse the
antidrug campaign ``and neither message would punch through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel you could mindlessly tack it onto this
campaign,'' he said. ``It has to be done right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roybal-Allard said the solution could be as simple as
concluding each antidrug message by asking parents to ``talk to
your children about drugs _ and alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the White House's national drug strategy has as its
first goal to ``educate and enable America's youth to reject
illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco.'' The strategy also
identifies drinking as a gateway to illicit drug use. It says that
adults who started drinking as children are nearly eight times more
likely to use cocaine than adults who did not do so.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee has not yet considered the
amendment on underage drinking because some Democratic members of
Congress have attached gun-control amendments to the legislation,
which is a Treasury and general government appropriations bill. A
vote looks unlikely before mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   With enough public support, Ms. Roybal-Allard said, ``I think
we're going to win on this. I just can't imagine someone voting
against it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``The industries opposing it are very, very
powerful.''

HITCHCOCK, HARTLEY SEE PAST IS TIE THAT BINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever might be happening on the ice between their teams,
there's definitely no feud between Stars coach Ken Hitchcock and
his Colorado counterpart, Bob Hartley.
</P>
<P>
   When Hitchcock walked by Tuesday morning as the Avalanche was on
the ice practicing in Denver, Hartley pounded on the glass to get
his attention, then came out to spend five minutes talking to the
Stars coach, offering him the use of the Avalanche's offices and
video room if he needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Why so friendly? Perhaps because the two are kindred spirits,
both having climbed almost identical ladders to get to the NHL.
Hartley began coaching on the side while he was working a full-time
job in an auto factory in Ontario, installing car windshields.
Hitchcock, of course, was a sporting-goods salesman in an Edmonton
suburb when he began his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to work 40 hours and punch clocks and have two weeks
vacation,'' Hartley says of himself and Hitchcock. ``I know it's
different now. If I could handle 3,000 windshields in a day and not
break one, there would never be 17,000 fans cheering me. But then
if I broke three in a row, there wouldn't be 17,000 booing me,
either. Hitch is basically in the same situation, and that's why we
kind of have mutual respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Hitchcock: ``Our careers are perfect parallels. He's gone
the $3.49 pregame meal route. He's gone the bus route. He knows
what it's like. It's water after the game if you lose and
milkshakes if you win. The bus ride has been the same for both of
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we've talked about is how much we appreciate
where we're at. Winning and losing is part of it, but being able to
coach is the biggest part, and I don't think either one of us would
take that for granted. I think either one of us could deal with not
coaching at the NHL level, but we'd both have a problem not
coaching at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Deja Nieu
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Nieuwendyk made the cross-slot pass that Jamie
Langenbrunner fired home for the Stars' second goal in Game 3's 3-0
victory Wednesday night, it came one day short of the 10-year
anniversary of an almost identical pass he made to Calgary's Lanny
MacDonald in '89. MacDonald's goal clinched the Game 6 victory for
Calgary in the Flames' Stanley Cup triumph. ``''That pass was over
the stick \Rof the defenseman\S,'' Nieuwendyk says, ``and this pass
was under it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, both wound up in the net.
</P>
<P>
   Awed by the Cup
</P>
<P>
   In its tour of the Fort Worth-Dallas area last week, the revered
Stanley Cup _ yes, the very same one the Stars are so desperately
trying to win _ made its way to the Star-Telegram sports
department, where a crowd of 60 or so employees got a chance to
touch it, hug it and pose for photos with it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is Lord Stanley's Cup, the one from which Wayne
Gretzky, Mark Messier and many another NHL stars have sipped
victory champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Copy editor Joe Guerrini even brought his dog, Maude, up to pose
with the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't let Maude lick the cup.
</P>
<P>
   We do have some sense of protocol, you know.

<P>
   Besides its stop at the Star-Telegram and various malls, the Cup
also made it out to the Dick Bosman-Big Brothers Charity Golf
Tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends not forgotten
</P>
<P>
   If you're composing a list of pitchers the Rangers might try to
trade for by the July 31 trade deadline _ Kevin Appier, Kenny
Rogers, etc. _ don't forget old friend Darren Oliver. Oliver is
pitching well for St. Louis, but he'll be a free agent after this
season, and if the Cards are out of the race, they'll be looking to
dump him to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Rangers are already interested.
</P>
<P>
   Zim-zam man
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates continues to rave about reliever Jeff Zimmerman _
and why not? _ and his three quality pitches, making him, it would
seem, an ideal candidate to become a starting pitcher. That's not
going to happen this season, but don't rule it out for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now's not the time,'' is all Oates will say. ``It would be
like robbing Peter \Rthe bullpen\S to pay Paul \Rthe rotation\S.
What would I do without him the other four days?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Ricky?
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday through Wednesday last week, the NFL brought 32 of its
top rookies for 1999 to Disney World in Orlando, Fla., to have
photos taken for their rookie cards by Topps, Fleer, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The players were sent plane tickets and had hotel arrangements
made for them. All they had to do was show up. Only one did not.
</P>
<P>
   You guessed it _ Ricky Williams. He never phoned to say why he
wouldn't be there, either.
</P>
<P>
   Just another fumble by Williams and his agent, Master P.
</P>
<P>
   Port Where?
</P>
<P>
   Port Charlotte is apparently convinced the Rangers will leave
for either South Texas or Arizona once their current contract
expires and is already thinking about life without them. There's
talk the Rangers' training facilities might be turned into an
equestrian center or a minor-league soccer facility. It's already
used for high school cross country meets when the Rangers aren't
there.
REVO'S GRAPEVINE SAYS:
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for the Cowboys to make any announcement concerning
Deion Sanders as early as Tuesday. That's the first day they could
do something, but they're more likely to give themselves a chance
to see how his rehab is coming along before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ranger Ruben Sierra, trying to keep his fading career
alive while playing for Atlantic City in the independent Atlantic
Coast League, is basically on life support, hitting only .200
(14-for-70) in his first 20 games with no homers and four runs
batted in.

   Hard to believe that now-retired Associated Press sports editor

 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every session of the House of Representatives has
its own personality, its own emblematic types, from the comfortable
Democratic incumbents of the late 1980s to the Republican
revolutionaries of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, is a fitting symbol of the
current House _ the edgy, ever-shifting House where Republicans are
trying to govern with 222 votes out of 435, the slimmest majority
in 45 years, meaning that every vote counts. When a Greg Ganske
gets frustrated and decides to buck his leadership, as he did last
week, it matters.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske, a 50-year-old plastic and reconstructive surgeon from
Des Moines, was one of six Republicans who signed a Democratic
petition that seeks to force an early vote on campaign-finance
legislation. The Republican leadership had not scheduled a vote on
the issue until September, which proponents of the bill said
guaranteed that it would not make it out of the House soon enough
to overcome resistance in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske offered a simple enough explanation for his action. ``I
really think we need to reduce the influence of big-money donations
in this capital,'' he said, while his colleagues scattered for the
Memorial Day recess. ``I think the bill is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the cool rationale, the frustration was palpable.
Ganske said that he and some of his colleagues had urged their
leadership earlier this year to move faster on several issues,
including campaign finance and patients' rights in managed care,
which is a special cause of Ganske's. The issues had to be dealt
with sooner or later, he said, and letting them slide ``just leaves
the Senate off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to check off the inexorable calendar: the budget issues
that will cloud the fall, leading quickly into the holidays,
leading quickly into the presidential campaign. ``And then people
will use as an excuse, in the year 2000, `Why don't we wait and see
how the presidential election comes out, then we'll have a better
idea of what to do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Are we frustrated, Ganske?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I am. I mean, it's not the way I would run the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not a small thing to say no to your leadership,
even for a member with a reputation for independence and a
traditionally Democratic district that probably expects it. ``He's
not a wise guy, he's not a guy out there trying to be difficult,''
said Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., another of the gang of six. ``He
believes in his heart in these issues, as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds terribly civilized, as Ganske tells it. He had a
``civil conversation'' with Speaker Dennis Hastert about what he
planned to do. ``We don't agree on the bill,'' Ganske said. ``I
think he thinks the bill is tilted against Republicans. I think the
bill is evenly balanced.'' Then Ganske ran into Rep. Tom DeLay, the
majority whip, a k a the Hammer, and complimented DeLay on his golf
game.
</P>
<P>
   His decision was hardly unprecedented, he noted _ he broke ranks
more dramatically last year by signing on to a Democratic patients'
rights bill _ and, he argued, not all that unusual within the
Republican caucus. ``I've been an independent voice on a couple of
issues that are very important to me and that I think are important
to the country,'' he said. ``Other members have done the same thing
on different issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Ganske, who is married to a physician and still
practices surgery on periodic charitable missions abroad, agrees
that medicine is easier. ``When I'm in the operating room, I can
get a hemostat or a scalpel slapped in my palm and I can fix the
problem in a short period of time,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet he ran for Congress in 1994, he said, in part because he was
tired of sitting around all those doctors' lounges, ``hearing
everyone whine and moan and groan about this or that.'' A political
newcomer, he defeated Rep. Neal Smith, a Democrat who had served in
the House since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   One of six children, a deep-rooted Iowan who grew up working in
his father's small-town grocery store, Ganske went to Congress as a
citizen legislator with that revolutionary class of '94. But he
said he always thought the rhetoric was overblown, and in fact he
showed his independence early on. ``I didn't come to Congress to
cause a revolution,'' he said. ``I came to fix some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he worry about his party, which looked very much besieged
in the House last week, divided on a variety of issues?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I come from a Midwest Republican tradition of what I
would call progressivism, in the tradition of Bob LaFollette and
the reformers, sort of the Teddy Roosevelt branch of our party, the
trust busters,'' he said. ``And I think our party needs to
recognize that there are some populist issues that are well within
the principles of being a Republican, and that it would help us to
emphasize some of those issues.'' One of those issues, he said, is
``reforming'' the managed-care system.
</P>
<P>
   His flight to Iowa was approaching, so Ganske told one last
story, a fitting one for these difficult days in the House. Not
long after he was elected to Congress, he contracted encephalitis
while on a medical mission abroad. Quite ill, he awoke in the
hospital one day to see his family priest asking, ``Greg, would you
like to receive the Sacrament of the Sick?''
</P>
<P>
   As a former altar boy, Ganske said he realized, with some degree
of panic, that ``they used to call that Extreme Unction, last
rites.'' At which point, the priest leaned over and whispered in
his ear, ``And Greg, with your new job, I would highly recommend
it.''

FORT WORTH CAME ALIVE AS A SPORTS TOWN IN THE 1940S 
SPORTS CENTURY, THE '40S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Sobering updates of Nazi invasions, battle
casualties and global rebuilding efforts dominated front-page
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But for residents of Fort Worth, a city rapidly building a
reputation as Golf Town, USA, a welcome respite from real-world
horrors stood only a sports section away throughout the 1940s.
Southwest Conference football players dominated All-America lists.
The Fort Worth Cats returned to prominence after the war.
</P>
<P>
   And a couple of former caddies from Glen Garden Country Club
held the professional golf world by the scruff of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Through the exploits of PGA Tour standouts Byron Nelson and Ben
Hogan, a teen-ager from south Fort Worth developed a heady opinion
of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I lived in the sports capital of the world,'' said
Dan Jenkins, 69, who would go on to a career as an award-winning
sportswriter and author. ``Byron and Ben were just the latest in a
long line of athletes that made Fort Worth a great sports town. But
they were the ones who became larger-than-life figures. As much so,
if not moreso, than Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   John Payne, a longtime Colonial Country Club member who spent
World War II commanding a Navy freighter, recalled arriving at port
throughout 1945 with two objectives. First, he wanted to contact
his wife. Second, he wanted an update on Nelson's winning streak,
which would grow to a tour-record 11 consecutive triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any city that has had two players like those
boys,'' said Payne, 84. ``They made you proud to be from Fort
Worth, especially if you played golf. I think they had an influence
on the city as a whole. They put us on the map. A lot of people
learned about Fort Worth for the first time because of those two.
Being a fan of Hogan and Nelson made you feel like you belonged to
something worthwhile.'' \Nsubheds:Dominating duo At the height of
their careers, Nelson and Hogan combined to win 67 PGA Tour events
from 1944-48 (33 by Nelson, 34 by Hogan). Included were four major
championships _ three by Hogan, one by Nelson _ as well as four of
the six winningest seasons in tour history.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of either man could stop traffic in downtown Fort
Worth. Their triumphs were chronicled in banner headlines. Their
failures, in some ways, were even more newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point we were surprised when they lost,'' said
Jerre Todd, 67, who retired in January after 30 years as public
relations director for the Colonial tournament. ``That was more of
a shocker than having them pick up another trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson concluded his career with 52 victories and five major
championships. Hogan won 63 times, including nine majors. On the
tour's career-victory list, Hogan trails Sam Snead (81) and Jack
Nicklaus (70). Nelson is fifth, behind Arnold Palmer (60).
</P>
<P>
   Their names still dot the PGA Tour record book, with most of the
glory years in the 1940s. Nelson's record streak was in 1945, when
he finished with a single-season scoring average (68.33) that has
yet to be duplicated. He ended the year with 18 titles, a mark
likely to stand forever.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan responded in 1946 with 13 victories, the second-highest
total in tour history. With 10 triumphs in 1948, Hogan holds the
No. 4 spot on the season-victories list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty good mark for a couple of old caddies from
Glen Garden,'' said Nelson, 87, a Roanoke resident. ``It's
something I'm proud of, for both of us. The game came fairly easy
to me. But Ben worked harder than anybody I ever saw to become a
good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan died in 1997, 70 years after he lost to Nelson by one
stroke in the finals of the 1927 Glen Garden caddies' championship.
Neither knew it at the time, but the decade of the '40s would
provide the defining moments in both men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   For Hogan, it was a near-fatal car wreck on Feb. 2, 1949.
Doctors predicted he would not walk again after sustaining a
crushed pelvis, fractured left leg, crushed shoulder and broken
ankle, as well as severe internal bleeding. Yet Hogan walked out of
Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pa. as the 1950 U.S. Open champion
after defeating George Fazio and Lloyd Mangrum in an 18-hole
playoff. Hogan's stirring comeback made him a national hero.
\Nsubheds:A streak to remember Jenkins recalled the moment he fully
understood the depth of Hogan's single-minded pursuit of
perfection, the trait that drove him to win six of his nine majors
after the 1949 crash. The two had just completed a round at
Colonial, with Hogan firing a bogey-free 66. Jenkins attempted to
offer a compliment. Hogan cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I didn't hit one shot that turned out the way I
wanted it to. If you can play a round of golf and hit three shots
that turn out the way you want, you've had a good round of golf,'
'' Jenkins remembered Hogan saying.
</P>
<P>
   For Nelson, his record-setting 1945 season made him a poster boy
for Wheaties, the self-proclaimed ``Breakfast of Champions.''
Although he understands why others fawn over his 11 consecutive
victories, Nelson said he does not consider that his crowning
achievement as a professional golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm most proud of about my career is winning money
in 113 consecutive tournaments,'' said Nelson, who retired in 1946
with his tour-record mark for consecutive cuts survived, which
still stands. ``Most of those years, they only paid the top 20
places. Everybody wants to talk about 1945, but that 113 gets lost.
And it meant more to me. It meant my swing was repetitive. If I had
a bad day, I didn't let it upset me. I could tough it out and still
be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Nelson and Hogan proved tough enough to dominate the
local golf landscape in a decade when the city boasted its share of
top amateur players.
</P>
<P>
   Aniela Goldthwaite, four-time winner of the Texas Women's Open,
reached the semifinals of the U.S. Women's Amateur in 1941 and won
the 1940 Southern Golf Association Championship at her home course,
River Crest Country Club. In 1986, she was inducted into the Texas
Golf Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Polly Riley, a six-time Curtis Cup participant, was runner-up in
the 1947 U.S. Women's Open. In 1948, River Crest was the site of
her most historic triumph: Riley defeated Babe Didrikson Zaharias,
10 and 9, in the 36-hole finals of the Texas Women's Open, the most
lopsided defeat of Zaharias' legendary career. Riley was a 1980
inductee into the Texas Golf Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Polly and I played in a big tournament, the Star-Telegram
usually would send someone to go along with us. So people knew who
we were,'' said Goldthwaite, 87, who sailed on the maiden voyage of
the Queen Mary after one of her Curtis Cup appearances in the
1930s. ``But it was nothing like Byron and Ben. They were
celebrities. They made things exciting.'' \Nsubheds:Finished where
he started Arguably, the excitement reached its apex when Nelson
won 11 in a row, shattering the previous tour record of four.
Appropriately enough, the greatest season in professional golf
history ended where it began _ at Glen Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson won his 18th event at the 1945 Fort Worth Open, held at
the course where he once caddied. His winner's check of $2,000
boosted Nelson's season earnings to $13,085, with another $48,689
in war bonds (worth 75 percent of face value).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Nelson collected 14.5 percent of the total purses
offered at PGA Tour events in 1945. If a player won 14.5 percent of
the purses available in 1999, he would collect $19,096,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me real happy to wind things up on the course where
I started, where they made me a junior member,'' Nelson said. ``I
really got a big kick out of that. Not many players have ever won a
championship on a course where they worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many cities have ever produced the likes of Hogan and
Nelson, either. Their legacy is such that each has a bridge at
Augusta National Golf Club named in his honor. In Fort Worth,
during the 1940s, they cast considerable shadows as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you weren't a golf fan, you know who they were,'' Todd
said. ``Just like, if you live in Fort Worth, you know who Van
Cliburn is even if you don't know who Beethoven is.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, golfers and golf fans still revere the
names. Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain and a two-time
Masters champion, said they will always hold a special place in his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Texas, those two were always at the top of the
list. They had an ultra-respect,'' said Crenshaw, an Austin
resident. ``Because of what they accomplished, Fort Worth holds a
special place in the game that people still recognize today.''

<P>
   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will soar toward 100 degrees across western Texas
Monday as a wedge of hot air invades from Mexico. The hot-air
invasion will not likely trigger thunderstorms because temperatures
at an altitude of 5,000 feet will be as high as 86 degrees,
creating a warm barrier or lid aloft that will halt the ascent of
air rising from the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, where the lid will not be as warm or strong,
thunderstorms will erupt across parts of the central Plains as
humid air from the Gulf of Mexico is lifted by a jet stream
disturbance approaching from the Rockies. Storms may become severe
over parts of Kansas, Nebraska and eventually Missouri, with hail
and damaging winds posing a threat in spots where potent storms
erupt. Isolated tornadoes are also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop from
the central Gulf Coast states and the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys to
the eastern Great Lakes as humid air streaming north from the Gulf
of Mexico is lifted by a jet stream disturbance. The heaviest
storms will occur in the central Gulf Coast states, where humidity
levels will be highest.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will build across the interior Northeast as a sprawling
area of warm high pressure centered off the Atlantic coast ridges
westward to the Appalachians. High and middle clouds from the
disturbance over the Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes will
temper heat west of the Appalachians. Also, sea breezes will temper
the warm-up along parts of the New England coast. Patchy fog may
also help to delay the warm-up along the Maine coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Waterspouts
</P>
<P>
   Waterspouts were spotted near Key West Saturday evening
underneath thunderstorms that bubbled up as a weak disturbance
passed over southern Florida. Waterspouts often develop over the
warm, relatively shallow seas surrounding the Florida Keys in
summer, but many of these spouts form in the absence of
thunderstorms, spinning to life under fair-weather cumulus clouds.
Though ``fair-weather waterspouts'' seldom produce winds in excess
of 65 mph, boaters must respect these whirlwinds. On average, about
100 waterspouts are observed near the Florida Keys in each of the
three summer months.

WORLD WAR II FOCUSED ATHLETES ON FAR MORE IMPORTANT CONFLICT

<P>
   DALLAS _ Roland ``Stormy'' Goss stood on the edge of the Rhine
River on a frigid night in 1945, preparing to help move General
George Patton's army deeper into Germany, when a scratchy voice
came over his walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stormy, I'm worried about this one,'' said Vince Avalone, one
of his closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong? We've been through this before and it will be
OK,'' Goss replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's been bothering me,'' the Bronx native said.
``Eight years ago today my dad died, and it's been on my mind all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, German soldiers began shelling. Goss and another
soldier jumped into a foxhole, as did Avalone. Too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out and there were my buddy's \RAvalone\S two legs
sticking out in the air,'' Goss said. ``A shell had killed him
instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss' voice cracks at the memory of a war that took him from
SMU's football fields and put him on Europe's battlefields. Many,
such as Avalone, never returned. Others, such as Goss, had their
lives changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   From 1942-45, college football continued despite the absence of
thousands of athletes forced to abandon their dreams to serve in
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   There were adjustments. On Jan. 1, 1942, for instance, the Rose
Bowl was played in Durham, N.C., for fear the Japanese would bomb
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, after thousands joined the service, colleges
nationwide stopped fielding teams. In 1942, there were 525
four-year colleges that played football. One season later, there
were 146.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys played who were under the draft age or who had physical
problems that prevented them from being drafted, but they could
play football,'' said Pat Harmon, a retired sportswriter and a
historian for the College Football Hall of Fame. ``The quality of
play was down.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1943-44, Baylor was the lone Southwest Conference school to
cease play. Its administration felt it didn't have enough athletes,
and it wanted to support the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   With enlistment at a record high, service-academy teams thrived
with athletes who played in their spare time while training. In
1944, half of the programs ranked in the Top 20 were
service-academy teams.

   On Dec. 6, 1941, Goss, a senior lineman, played in all but one
minute of the Mustangs' 6-0 loss to Rice at Ownby Stadium. It would
be the last game of his football career.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1944, Goss had three boats under his command
stationed off Omaha Beach, where the highest casualty rates of the
Normandy invasion occurred on D-Day. They supplied engineers with
explosives to clear mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the Germans were fortified, and they were waiting for
us,'' Goss said. ``I saw boats hit mines and explode. ... It was a
horrible experience. I said a few prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, 18-year-old Frank Denius, a former punter at the
Citadel and current Austin resident, landed on Omaha Beach. As a
field observer, he was in charge of locating enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit the ground running and you kept your eyes open and you
prayed, but not necessarily in that order,'' Denius said. ``We were
too scared to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, both men returned to Texas. Goss went into
business and became a SWC football official for 27 years. Denius
practiced law in Austin for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Denius has returned to several of the places where so much of
the fighting occurred _ and where so many of his friends died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parts there I still know like back of my hand,''
Denius said. ``Going to the cemetery in Normandy or looking at
those beaches is very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss keeps in touch with the eight living members of the
original 15 men under his command and plans to attend a reunion in
June.
</P>
<P>
   He also kept a tie to the ones who didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I named my oldest son after Vincent Avalone.''

A NEW WAY TO PREVENT DRUNK DRIVING  
 YOUR PEARLY WHITES SMILING BACK AT YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif)  (rk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way to cut down on drunk driving is to keep a car from
starting if its driver has been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, a number of states have allowed courts
to order convicted drunk drivers to install electronic
ignition-lock devices in their cars. Each time a driver wants to
start a car, he or she must blow into a breath analyzer that is
connected to the ignition. If alcohol is detected, the car will not
start.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to cheat, especially if the drinking driver
is accompanied by a sober friend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three Tucson, Ariz., inventors believe they have a
solution. They have patented a laser-based device that can
continuously detect alcohol fumes inside a car _ even one with its
windows open _ and cut off the car's ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say their design improves upon existing breath
analyzers by using a laser that operates nonstop, detecting alcohol
in air samples much smaller than needed for conventional analyzers,
and eliminating the need for a driver's cooperation with the test.
All a driver has to do is breathe while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the device can transmit data about a drunk driver to
the police.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say their laser device is faster and more
sensitive than conventional ignition-lock devices, and has the
additional advantage of operating continuously.
</P>
<P>
   George Atkinson, one of the inventors, acknowledges that the
invention could err if a nondrinking driver was chauffeuring a
carload of heavy drinkers, or if an open container of liquor was in
the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly would detect the total concentration in the
car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the object, he added, is to reduce the number of drinking
drivers. ``Do you want to err on the side of stopping a driver and
testing him, or having that person continue to drive?''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson is a professor of chemistry and optical science at the
University of Arizona, as well as founder and president of the
company that owns the patent, the Innovative Lasers Corp. He
patented the device along with Markus Wolperdinger and Jeffrey
Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   The device won a patent because it uses a sensor called an
intracavity laser spectroscopy; the inventors prefer solid-state
lasers because they are small and require little power. The housing
contains a mirror and a lens to concentrate the laser, and has a
port on one side to draw in air. The laser operates continuously,
and can measure alcohol because molecules absorb light.
</P>
<P>
   ``A laser is basically a device that allows competition between
the production of light, called the gain, and the loss of light,''
Atkinson said. Loss is created when alcohol molecules absorb light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Molecules have a distinct signature,'' Atkinson continued.
``At certain wavelengths they absorb light, at others they don't.
There is a clear signature for water, alcohol, CO2. The intensity
of the absorption, or how much light is absorbed by the molecules
at a particular wavelength, is used to measure the concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasers are so sensitive that ``you don't need too many molecules
of alcohol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say that because the sensor can register changes
in alcohol levels within seconds, it not only can detect alcohol in
parked or moving cars, but it can also tell whether a driver is
consuming alcohol while on the road. They say their sensor is so
sensitive it can even pick up alcohol vapors in the vicinity of a
driver when car windows are open.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are clever enough, they can defeat it,'' Atkinson
acknowledged. For example, a driver might disconnect the device or
allow a strong wind to blow through the car. But Atkinson thought
those problems could be overcome. ``Perhaps you wouldn't be able to
start the car if this device wasn't functioning,'' he said. ``Or
maybe it should be interlocked to the windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Once alcohol fumes are detected, the system can respond in a
number of ways. Cars can be programmed not to start if the alcohol
level registers above a minimum level. The information can be
conveyed to the driver so he or she could let someone else drive.
Or it could be transmitted outside the car _ either generally with
flashing headlights, or specifically to police in nearby patrol
cars via satellite. Finally, the system might generate a signal
that could be picked up by roadside police.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say the laser they use poses no danger to the
health of people inside a car, since radiation is contained in the
sensor's housing.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have tested aspects of the invention, Atkinson said
they have not built a prototype unit to install in cars. He said
his company would consider manufacturing the device, ``depending on
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson, Wolperdinger and Pilgrim received patent 5,907,407.
</P>
<P>
   Your Pearly Whites Smiling Back at You
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to a video near you _ your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   A newly patented system enables dentists to make videos of
dental X-rays, so both they and their patients can see pictures of
teeth more clearly than possible with those tiny negative X-ray
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Technology exists for digitizing dental X-rays and transferring
them to video. It involves using an expensive sensor card instead
of X-ray film. Like film, the card is placed behind the teeth to be
photographed, and an X-ray head shoots radiation through the teeth
and onto the card. The card is connected to a computer, and
transmits the image to be stored on a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But because the cards are expensive, cannot be washed between
patients, and create a fuzzy image, Stephen Blume, of Laguna Hills,
Calif., looked for a way to make video from conventional X-ray
film.
</P>
<P>
   His invention uses a film development tank with a window in one
side, connected to a video camera and a computer. The camera
captures the image on the X-ray film in what Blume calls the
``opaque stage,'' which he says occurs when the first chemical is
added to the reaction tank.
</P>
<P>
   This developer solution causes an opaque image of teeth to form
on the film, similar to a black-and-white photo. Later, water and
other chemicals cause the film to turn into the ``negative'' image
of familiar dental X-rays. Blume believes these negative images are
harder to see.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing the ``opaque'' image, the camera transfers it to
the computer to be stored, edited or transmitted in turn to another
computer, a printer or a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Blume received patent 5,870,172.

ATHLETE OF THE '40S: DOAK WALKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America had fought a war and was settling down to raise families
and rebuild a nation still shaking off the effects of the Great
Depression. Doak Walker was the right kind of hero for the age:
handsome, friendly, photogenic and above all, humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess `I' was the least-used word in his vocabulary,'' SMU
teammate Kyle Rote of Walker.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time All-America selection (1947-49), Walker was popular
enough to draw overflow crowds at SMU. During the 1948 season, SMU
moved its games from Ownby Stadium (seating 23,000) to the Cotton
Bowl, which could handle double the capacity. Before season's end,
another 20,000 seats were added to the Cotton Bowl, thereafter
known as ``The House that Doak Built.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that all this happened because a little blue-eyed boy
could run with a football,'' said Emma Walker, his mother.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Life'' magazine cover boy, member of the college and Pro
Football Halls of Fame and a Heisman Trophy winner, Walker
exemplified the best that his generation had to give to America.
</P>
<P>
   His name lives on with the Doak Walker Award, given annually to
the nation's top running back. RUNNERS-UP
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson: Best single season in golf history in 1945, with
18 victories, including 11 in a row, and the single-season scoring
record (68.33 stroke average).
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan: Won three majors in the 1940s and 34 PGA tour events
in a five-year span (1944-48). Had 13 victories in 1946,
second-most in history to Nelson's 18 in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams: Red Sox outfielder won two Triple Crowns (1942,
1947) but didn't get voted MVP in either year. Won MVP honors in
1946 and 1949. Lost three years in his prime to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio: Yankees center fielder had 56-game hitting streak
in 1941. Won MVP award in 1941 and 1947 during decade that the
Yankees won four World Series.

   When Elmer Layden, one of Notre Dame's famed ``Four Horseman,''
resigned as Irish coach to become NFL commissioner in 1941, few
could have known that a diminutive former Boston College coach
named Frank Leahy was going to add even more luster to the Golden
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   His first decade in South Bend produced four national
championships (1943, 1946, 1947, 1949), three Heisman Trophy
winners, two Outland Trophy winners and 18 All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame finished 8-0-1 in Leahy's first season, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, the 9-1 Irish won their first national championship of
the decade, as voted on by The Associated Press media panel after
the conclusion of the regular season. Quarterback Angelo Bertelli
won the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two seasons _ when Army won its two titles _ Notre

   ``I only played for two coaches in college and in pro ball,
Frank Leahy and George Halas,'' said John Lujack, the 1947 Heisman

thought Leahy was the all-time greatest coach who came down the
pike.''

Two legendary baseball rivals, Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio, made
1941 a memorable year for sports fans. Williams hit .406, going
6-for-8 in a doubleheader on the final day of the season when he
could have take the day off and still been credited with a batting
average of .400. No player since has hit .400 or better.

   Williams' spectacular season included a game-winning home run in
the All-Star game. His feats were overshadowed, however, by
DiMaggio, the New York Yankees center fielder who hit in 56
consecutive games, a record that has not been seriously challenged.

<P>
   Remembrance by Victor Tunnel, now of Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the same platoon as Calvin Clifford Hudson. We were
being overrun, however, through Calvin's last efforts, some of us
were saved that day. I remember him every day of my life and I
would like to meet anyone else that knew him. Love, Vic 'Tex'
Tunnell.''

<P>
   Veteran: Johnny Ray Bryson, of College Park, killed in action
Jan. 7, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Remembrance by Dick Miller, who was in Bryson's unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever saw him without a smile, and whenever there was
need for a boost in morale, he always provided it. I was near him
when he was killed and when I rushed to help him it was clear that
he was gone. He did not suffer and he was not alone Thanks Bryson.
You made better men of all of us. Forever.''

<P>
   Remembrance by Steve Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc, I remember that day like it was yesterday even though it
has been over 30 years ago. We were pinned down and you and I were
next to each other when the round hit you. I saw the look in your
eyes as if to say help me and then you were dead. I wonder why God
chose you that day and spared me? I have gone on with family and
life but Vietnam still haunts me.''

WHAT'S NO LONGER ON THE WALLS OFFERS CLUES TO MUSEUM'S PHILOSOPHY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When ``Museum as Muse: Artists Reflect'' closes at
the Museum of Modern Art on Tuesday, nearly all the 188 works in
the show will be crated and shipped to the exhibition's next stops,
in San Diego and then Madrid. But one will stay behind, in the
homes of various visitors to the exhibition and also in the
museum's bookstore: a slim 15-page publication with a bright red
cover titled ``Painting and Sculpture From the Museum of Modern
Art: Catalog of Deaccessions, 1929 Through 1998.'' It is the work
of Michael Asher, a 55-year-old Conceptual artist from California.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Museum as Muse'' the very concept of the museum is sliced
and diced to a fare-thee-well. Among the show's mostly contemporary
artworks, some mimic the museum's habits of accumulation and
classification; others examine its role as a repository of cultural
memory, and still others criticize it as elitist or colonial.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing gets as close to the heart of the matter as quietly
and cleanly as Asher's catalog. Compiled with the Modern's
permission and cooperation, it simply lists every work of painting
and sculpture known to have been sold or traded from the Modern's
collection since its founding in 1929. Throughout the run of the
show, several copies of it have been available for study in the
side pocket of a heavy wood bench near the end of the exhibition,
just beneath a discreet wall label.
</P>
<P>
   With this work, Asher reveals one of an art museum's most
private and sometimes controversial practices: the shedding, not
the accumulation, of artworks. And not just any museum is under
scrutiny. The Modern's history and its renowned collection are
virtually inseparable from the history of modernism: each has
played a major role in shaping our understanding of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other museums, the Modern is relatively open about
its deaccessioning; still, this information has never been
assembled before. To have an overview of how the Modern has shaped
its own vaunted collection _ and thus its version of modernism _ is
something of a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The names and numbers alone, even though they do not tell the
whole story, are keenly interesting if not titillating: among them,
21 Picassos, eight Cezannes, four de Chiricos, three Stuart Davises
and on and on. Altogether, a group that many museums would be happy
to own. One might almost expect the catalog to come in a plain
brown wrapper, not a red cover, and it seems singularly appropriate
that it can be taken home for careful examination in private.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Museum as Muse'' opened, the catalog has been available
in the the museum's bookstore, free to anyone with a Museum of
Modern Art ticket stub. ( Asher settled on a method of distribution
that required a bit of initiative because he wanted only people who
were genuinely interested to have access to the catalog.)
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,000 copies of a print run of 5,000 have been given out.
And the catalog will continue to be available in the bookstore at
least until July 6, the closing date of Claes Oldenburg's ``Mouse
Museum,'' which is not traveling with the show because of its
physical complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Asher's piece will not travel has nothing to do with
physical properties. Like most of his works, this one barely exists
_ it is part of a strain of invisible art that has coursed through
Conceptual Art since its inception. But it is so site-specific that
it would be meaningless in the galleries of any other museum.
</P>
<P>
   Asher is one of several artists of the early 1970's who helped
raise site specificity to, well, an art form. You could also say
that absence itself is one of his favorite materials. He is
especially known for simply rearranging or removing, in order to
make more visible, certain aspects of a particular spatial or
institutional setting, presaging the efforts of younger artists
like Reinhard Mucha and Rirkrit Tiravanija.
</P>
<P>
   Asher once created a fantastically beautiful installation piece
simply by removing the windows and casements from a large square
gallery at the Clocktower in TriBeCa, transforming the space with a
dramatically different sense of light, sky and wind.
</P>
<P>
   So what does his list of removed artworks reveal about the
Modern and its past? All kinds of things, even if you extrapolate
exclusively from the information in the catalog and don't call the
museum's press department with questions, as I was able to do.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the ground rules. The Modern's deaccession policy,
restated by Kirk Varnedoe, chief curator of painting and sculpture,
in the catalog's brief essay, is simple. Like all museums
accredited by the American Association of Museum Directors _ which
means all major and most smaller museums in the country _ the
Modern sells or exchanges works of art only to purchase or acquire
other works of art.
</P>
<P>
   In addition it may sell or exchange a work by living artists
only to acquire another by the same artist, a rule that many but
not all museums adhere to. ( Asher's catalog indicates artists who
have been traded up, as this process is sometimes called, include
Larry Bell, Donald Judd, Loren MacIver, Jules Olitski, Sol LeWitt
and Jack Youngerman.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all these transactions occurred during the artists'
lifetimes. An Andy Warhol ``Campbell's Soup'' (1965) left the
collection in 1996, a decade after his death, when the Modern
acquired the entire set of Warhol's first series of ``Campbell's
Soup Cans,'' done a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In all 360 works by 177 artists are listed alphabetically
according to artist, with title, date, material, dimensions and
acquisition number, which includes the year the work entered the
collection. In addition, the Modern has deaccessioned 32 works by
unknown American folk artists and eight African masks and utensils.
</P>
<P>
   As with any other work of Conceptual Art, Asher's latest one
exists mostly in the mind's eye. As the names roll by, one tries to
conjure the works, to mass them together into their own salon de
refuses. On paper, it reads a bit like a who's who of modernism and
proto-modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Nine out of 10 names are famous, well known or at least vaguely
familiar. It is a fabulously motley crew: the Modern has rid itself
of works by Renoir, Monet, Daumier, Degas, van Gogh and Gauguin,
but also Edward Hicks and John Frederick Peto. The most frequently
deaccessioned artists are those who loom largest in its modernist
pantheon: Miro (seven), Matisse (nine) and Leger (13) as well as
the eight Cezannes and the 21 works by Picasso, the high scorer.
</P>
<P>
   But the same numbers have different meanings for different
artists. That the Modern has deaccessioned six works by Charles
Despiau, the French sculptor who began his career as Rodin's
assistant, probably does not indicate that it values Despiau almost
as much as Miro. The museum owns 11 works by Despiau, a not
insignificant number, but 33 by Miro.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the low numbers reflect low productivity. The work
of Juan Gris, who died young and left a relatively small body of
work, has been subjected only four times to deaccessioning at the
Modern.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the museum's holdings in Georges Braque, Picasso's
partner in the invention of Cubism, who did not die young, have had
only five deaccessions. Does this mean that the Modern's Braques
have all withstood the test of time exceptionally well, or that the
museum's interest in his work lagged? Numbers appear to bear out
the latter theory: the Modern owns 84 paintings and sculptures by
Picasso and 8 by Braque. (In other words, fewer than Despiau.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the museum acts stem from an embarrassment of riches,
as when the museum accepts a gift of several works of art among
which one closely duplicates a work it already owns. For example
the recent bequest of the architect Gordon Bunshaft included a
second cast of Miro's ``Moonbird,'' a large bronze sculpture from
1956. The museum accepted it with the intention of comparing the
two casts and keeping the superior one, which turned out to be the
Bunshaft version.
</P>
<P>
   But low numbers may or may not reflect relatively low interest.
The number of deaccessions of American works made between 1900 and
1939 is roughly one-third of the total of European ones from the
same period. That is not surprising; the museum was not deeply
interested in American art at that time.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to artists working after World War II,
deaccessions drop off across the board, which may reflect rising
prices, the expansion of the art market or perhaps institutional
uncertainty. For whatever reason, there are fewer than 40 from the
Abstract Expressionist generation and fewer than 15 from younger
postwar American artists; the figures are roughly similar for the
Europeans. Certain historically central artists, like Jasper Johns
and Joseph Beuys, have never been deaccessioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern's relatively heavy trade in the modern masters belies
the misconception that museums routinely dump the work of forgotten
artists. There is something comforting about this: The museum
probably owns hundreds of works by artists virtually unknown today,
artists who play little or no role in its well cultivated version
of modernism. But their works remain in place for the very reason
that they lack market or historical currency. This also preserves
and protects them for possible rediscovery by future curators and
historians.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the Modern's judgments remain shrouded in a mystery
that could be lifted only by seeing the works it let go next to
those by the same artist that it kept. But taken as a whole,
Asher's catalog stands as itemized evidence of institutional
consciousness, of the museum's desire continually to improve and
reshape itself. It is a quest both admirable and awful, since its
pursuit destroys part of its past.
</P>
<P>
   But questions large and small fill the mind. If this collection
of rejected works were reassembled today, how many would the
museum's current curators wish were still on hand? Why did the
Modern get rid of that little painting by Julian Levi? Two works by
Henri Rousseau? What did they look like? What was gained by getting
rid of something as quirky as Eugene Speicher's painting of
Katharine Cornell as Candida, from 1925-26, or Ernest Leonard
Blumenschein's ``Jury for Trial of a Sheepherder for Murder''? The
title's parting rhyme alone might have qualified it for permanent
residency.
</P>
<P>
   Asher's catalog could have gone further. It would have been
interesting to list the year of deacquisition. (The museum said
that Asher wanted to include such information, but that there was
not time to assemble it.) Of equal interest would have been each
work's method of entry into the Modern's collection in the first
place: whether by purchase or gift, and if a gift, from whom. But
this might be getting a little too personal.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the catalog is most valuable as an exhibition that
will never happen and as an act of remembering, mourning and
gratitude. These absent paintings and sculptures are the ghosts in
the machine that is the Museum of Modern Art. Today the museum may
be without them, yet paradoxically it would not be what it is today
without them. Despite their absence, they are almost as much a part
of its history as the works that remain.

   KUKES, Albania _ They had no choice but to spend the night
outside a warehouse off the highway in Korisa, Haxhere Palushi said
Sunday. There were 700 Albanian refugees like her, and Serb
soldiers herded them all inside the building's iron outer gates,
promising they would be allowed to leave Kosovo the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, one soldier clicked the gate shut with a
padlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``One young guy said, `Why did they lock us in? Something is
happening,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, just before midnight on May 13, NATO planes
again bombed the village, in southern Kosovo, killing what Serb
officials and survivors say was more than 80 Albanian refugees.
Mrs. Palushi sat in a field all night watching her 4-year-old
daughter, Diana, bleed from shrapnel wounds in her left leg and
then, at dawn, die.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Korisa killed perhaps more Albanian civilians than
any other in the two-month NATO air campaign, which has been
criticized for its fatal mistakes. At the time, Serb authorities,
claiming that the refugees had merely stopped at Korisa for the
night, said the incident showed why NATO should stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But three Albanian survivors _ women interviewed here Sunday for
some of the few eyewitness accounts of the bombing _ said they had
no doubt they were put there intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used us as human shields,'' Mrs. Palushi said. ``It was
all planned.''
</P>
<P>
   While the accounts could be independently confirmed, they
appeared to give weight to similar allegations by the Pentagon and
NATO that Serb forces have placed civilians near sites, like
bridges or military installations, that could be vulnerable to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no way to tell from these accounts how widely or
systematically such a strategy might be used. Nor are they likely
to quiet critics who say that NATO targeting procedures are not
adequate on a battlefield where civilians are mixed with military
targets.
</P>
<P>
   But these accounts suggest that in Korisa, at least, the
refugees had been calculatingly placed in harm's way, if not to
deter a NATO attack then to create the kind of civilian casualties
that the Serbs hope could erode support for the air campaign. NATO
officials said the planes specifically targeted the building among
other military sites in the town without knowing that civilians
were there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Palushi described the bombing in one of the refugee camps
here, at the door-flap of a tent that now sleeps 19 people, 10 of
whom survived the attack. The survivors arrived in Albania on
Saturday, and many of them still show signs of their wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Palushi's older son, Driton, 10, pulled up his shirt to
show a scar that runs from his navel to his sternum, from an
operation to remove a piece of shrapnel that pierced his back and
wedged near one lung. His cousin, Genci Ahmetaj, 4, still has a
bandage on his right foot covering his own shrapnel wound.
</P>
<P>
   Purple scars mark the face of Genci's mother, Zyrafete, 30, and,
no doubt, there are emotional wounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the attack, Mrs. Ahmetaj said she was sleeping
under the tractor wagon that sheltered her two children, along with
six other children and two adults. Huge explosions erupted. Tents
caught fire. Bits of the tractors blasted through the compound.
Children were shrieking, including hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was happening,'' she said. ``It was like I
was crazy. I saw my mother and I touched her but she was dead. My
father, blood was all over his face.''
</P>
<P>
   She heard the voice of her 10-year-old son, Agon, from inside
the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was screaming, `Look what they did to my legs,''' she
said. ``He started screaming, `Mommy, my legs! Why don't you come
get me?' He was only 10 years old. I could only take the little
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go back and get him,'' she said. ``But the other
people wouldn't let me go back and take my son. The Serbs were
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know I left him,'' she said. ``He was there, and he was
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she heard later that Agon died at 7 a.m., next to an
old man who had found him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying, `Give me some water,''' Mrs. Ahmetaj said.
</P>
<P>
   She wept. ``I am worried that no one could give him water.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others said that Serb forces opened fire on the refugees
as they fled from the burning compound. Those who escaped made
their way to Prizren after the attack, where some received
treatment for wounds. Saturday, they were bused out of Kosovo by
the Serbs, apparently the first batch of survivors from the Korisa
attack to get to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They were among thousands of Albanian refugees fleeing the
burning houses and looting by Serb policemen and paramilitary
soldiers near the city of Prizren. Mrs. Ahmetaj's sister, Sahadete
Ahmetaj, 26, said hundreds of refugees had been living in the hills
near Korisa for two months, waiting to go to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Weary, on May 13, after some in the group approached Serb police
officers, the refugees were promised that they could leave safely
the next day. They took some 700 people to a field for an hour,
then moved them to a warehouse surrounded on three-sides by a
chest-high concrete wall and a fence with an iron door. There they
took everyone's name and birth date, Mrs. Ahmetaj said, saying they
could move on the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But they had to spend that night outside at the courtyard of the
warehouse, she said. The Serb soldiers did not indicate that they
were being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we could only stay in that place,'' Mrs. Ahmetaj
said. ``We were not allowed to go anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The police officers then locked the refugees in and left the
compound, the survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight, four American F-16s dropped what officials
said later was one 500-pound laser-guided bomb and seven other
bombs. The women said that 84 refugees were killed, many of them
burned beyond recognition. A NATO official, who spoke on the
condition anonymity, said that despite reports that all the police
had left, some police guards appeared to be among the dead.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group
fighting the Yugoslav army in Kosovo, said Sunday that the general
area around the warehouse was used to store tanks and ammunition,
though they had no information about that particular building. The
survivors said it appeared to be empty. The NATO official said
intelligence reports before the bombing identified it as a command
post, though he said it might have been vacated before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ahmetaj sisters said they did not blame NATO for the attack,
even if it was NATO bombs that killed their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are guilty,'' said Sahadete Ahmetaj. ``NATO didn't
know they attacked us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Palushi, whose daughter was killed, said she did not blame
NATO either, though she said she exploded in anger when she took
her son to a hospital in Prizren and a Serb doctor told her: ``You
wanted NATO to help you. Look what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset, I was very nervous,'' she said. ``I said, `I
didn't want NATO. I don't want you. I don't want the KLA. I only
want peace.'''

MILOSEVIC'S WIFE MAY INFLUENCE OUTCOME OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and four of his top officials have now been indicted for
war crimes in Kosovo. But by all accounts here, the person with the
most influence over him is his dreamy and complicated wife, Mirjana
Markovic, whose lifelong sense of persecution will only be
intensified by this new threat to her husband and her family.
</P>
<P>
   The entire point of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, now more
than 2 months old, has been to bomb Milosevic into changing his
mind about Kosovo. If that is to succeed, current and past friends
of the couple suggest, then Ms. Markovic, who shrilly denounced
NATO before the bombing even began, will have to change her mind
too.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his wife are inseparable and indissoluble. They
were lonely children of unhappy families who met in high school and
created their own, singular world, which they have proceeded to
defend at any cost to ideology, to friendship or even to their own
people.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, say those who claim to know them still, Milosevic
is calm and deliberate, willing to negotiate over Kosovo but
confident that the Serbs will resist a NATO invasion and occupation
``from behind every blade of grass,'' as they resisted the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those who have known the couple, and those who have
been dropped or discarded, believe that Ms. Markovic will feel
cornered, judging that the indictment has made this war intensely
personal. Some say they fear that she will drive her husband, using
what they consider to be her malign and absolute influence over
him, to take the entire country over the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West should either settle on good terms or go after him
now, hard,'' said one such person, who like everyone when asked
about the ruling couple here, in wartime, asked for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, this indictment is a goad to final war,'' the
person continued. ``He doesn't want a ground war, because it
threatens him, but his maneuvering space has been reduced. But they
won't surrender. They'll defend themselves. Even in chess, the
pawns die before the king and queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Others consider this picture of a weak, beholden husband and an
evil, scheming wife, a Balkan Lady Macbeth, to be an insulting
caricature that underestimates Milosevic's own fearlessness and
decisiveness, which have given him unrivaled power here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Markovic, now 57, herself believes that she has both
formed her husband and driven him to his current office, even as
she has bemoaned his boyhood decision to study law. According to
her official biography and articles she wrote in the Belgrade
weekly Duga, she wanted him to take on ``the more beautiful and
romantic occupation'' of an architect.
</P>
<P>
   She blames him for letting her study sociology and become a
university professor rather than pushing her toward literature,
which she says is her real love.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Markovic, wrote her hagiographer and friend Ljiljana
Habjanovic-Djurovic, ``always openly and boldly claimed that he
would have been quite different without her, worse in every
respect, and that everything good about him came from her and that
everything that is not good is where her influence didn't reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Their bond was forged in loneliness and family tragedy. His
mother was a teacher who divorced his father, a priest, and was
ambitious for her son in the new Communist world. Both of his
parents committed suicide. His mother disliked the young Mirjana
Markovic, and after her death Milosevic is said to have told a
friend: ``She never forgave me for Mira.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Markovic's mother, a Partisan fighter in World War II, was
reviled for confessing under Gestapo torture and revealing the
names of key Communist officials, including an undercover agent.
She abandoned her wartime baby, and was executed when her daughter
was 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ms. Markovic has fiercely defended her
mother's reputation, and when Milosevic rose in the 1980s to the
top of the Communist Party in Serbia, all the documents about the
case disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Markovic, her life marked by tragedy, is full of
contradictions. She claims to detest nationalism and feels no
responsibility for the nationalist wars that broke up Yugoslavia;
she is the founder and chief ideologist for the modern Marxist
party called the Yugoslav United Left, yet has allowed it to become
a form of mafia, that distributes favors and concessions to rich
and well-connected businessmen; she demands complete loyalty from
her circle but says she detests flattery and discards acolytes at
will; she describes herself as a dreamy romantic, yet she is
universally described as ruthless.
</P>

   ``It's like fire,'' said another person who knew her, and saw
his own political relationship with Milosevic destroyed in a day.
``If you're too close you'll burn. She's a great consumer of
people. She wants maximum obedience. She's good at provoking
people, and then assesses and judges later, in private, with him.
You can say everything to him and he'll support it and praise it,
but already the next morning everything is different. It will be
the way he agreed with Mira in the night.''

   An advocate of democracy, Ms. Markovic returned from an Indian
book tour in 1996 to put spine into her husband after the
opposition won local elections. When she heard Danica Draskovic,
the similarly influential wife of one protest leader, Vuk
Draskovic, call for a march on their neighborhood, Ms. Markovic
told Milosevic that the threat was personal to them and their
family, persuading him to overturn the results and ride out the
months of street protests, according to people familiar with events
at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Like her husband, Ms. Markovic largely shuns the public eye. But
she has written extensively, including a bizarre and closely
watched diary published throughout the 1990s in a Belgrade weekly.
Through her writings, Ms. Markovic has opened herself to an unusual
degree of judgment and ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks that the moon is a planet, and that it protects her,
so she wears a moonstone. She spends hours combing her hair, which
she wears as she did in high school, with bangs, and resents anyone
interrupting her combing, her writings suggest. She used to wear a
flower in her hair _ plastic when she was poor, real later _ but
she stopped when it became a major topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   She says she cannot live without mirrors, and she works for a
month to plan the music for the couple's New Year's Eve
celebrations, which she regards as a mystical moment for starting
anew. She says she hates flattery but insists on complete loyalty.
Those who cross her are dropped. Four former associates of the
Milosevic family have been shot dead, mafia style, in circumstances
never explained.
</P>
<P>
   According to her biographer, Ms. Markovic sees herself as
``paralyzed by small fears but motivated by great ones.''
</P>
<P>
   She loves her husband, who is believed never to have slept with
another woman. After she met him, her biographer writes, she was
``no longer afraid of the winter, nor darkness, nor mosquitoes, nor
the beginning of the school year, nor a possible C in math.'' She
says that he was always on her side, whether she was right or
wrong. ``What every woman instinctively seeks through her whole
life and few have, she had,'' Ms. Habjanovic-Djurovic wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They talk many times a day. She praises him ``as a man who does
not miss anything that is important to her.'' She says he remembers
to wake her up at 2 a.m. to wish her a happy first day of spring.
</P>
<P>
   But her memoirs also patronize him as limited and dull. ``He was
a simple and pragmatic boy who never showed any inclination for
long coffee bar conversations and meditations aloud,'' so unlike
her own attraction to the intellectuals of the little town of
Pozarevac, where they met and fell in love. She devoured Sartre
novels and ``Last Year in Marienbad'' and wore black, still her
favorite color, because it seemed to her refined.
</P>
<P>
   She formed his tastes in literature. In quiet evenings she would
recite her favorite lines, which he remembered. ``To this day he
utters her thoughts and assessments as his own, unaware of where
she ends and he begins,'' wrote Ms. Habjanovic-Djurovic in her
lengthy article, published in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But her sense of herself as a much misunderstood and much
maligned romantic, appalled by the corruptions of power, is matched
by a powerful sense of persecution and retribution that stems from
her remarkable history.
</P>
<P>
   Mirjana Markovic was born in the woods in July 1942, the
offspring of two Partisan fighters who were famous and later
infamous in their own right. Her father, Moma Markovic, became an
important Communist official after the war, but had little to do,
then or later, with his revolutionary love child.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Vera Miletic, used the nom de guerre ``Mira,'' short
for Mirjana, which is how Mrs. Markovic still signs her name. But
Ms. Miletic spent only one day with her daughter before returning
to the fight against the Nazis, and she was arrested nine months
later. It is believed she never saw the little girl again before
she was executed in September 1944, just a few weeks before the
victorious Partisans marched into Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Markovic still keeps what her mother knitted for her in
prison, including the needlework red star of the Communist faith,
woolen booties and a heart with her own name inscribed, according
to her biographer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markovic's earliest memories are of being hidden in a
firewood-storage cabinet, unable to utter a word, while
anti-Communist Chetniks, fierce Serbian nationalists, searched for
the daughter of the famous Partisan fighter.
</P>
<P>
   It is these searing memories, combined with a sense of
defensiveness and historical injustice, that formed Mrs. Markovic.
After she went to live with her grandparents in Pozarevac, her
favorite book was ``Antigone,'' the Greek tragedy that describes
the effort of a young woman to vindicate the memory and restore the
reputation of her beloved brother, who had defied the tyrant Creon.
</P>
<P>
   And it was in the library, as she sought solace once again in
``Antigone'' after getting a C in history, that she first met
Slobodan Milosevic. She was 16; he was 17. ``Her sorrow attracted
her to him,'' Ms. Habjanovic-Djurovic wrote. ``He felt the need to
relieve her pain, to protect and cherish her.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But these fierce family tragedies also help explain Mrs.
Markovic's devotion to her daughter, Marija, now 33, and especially
to her 25-year-old son, Marko.
</P>
<P>
   She was pregnant with Marija when she married Milosevic in 1965,
and hoped her daughter would be the writer she never was, naming
her after the Partisan heroine Marija Bursac.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Markovic, according to the biography, describes her
daughter in harsh terms, calling her ``less ambitious, less
disciplined and less sensitive'' than herself, ``and not romantic
at all.'' Her daughter married young and went to live in Japan in
1984, the year Milosevic left banking and entered Communist
politics in a serious and fateful way.
</P>
<P>
   Although she currently runs a popular station, Radio and
Television Kosava, Marija is rarely pictured with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Markovic is besotted with her son, who flunked out of
high school and became a race-car driver, famous for the price of
the vehicles he has crashed. Marko still lives in Pozarevac, where
he is described by locals as behaving like a ``little lord,''
abusing people and running a discotheque called ``Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange article in November 1996, Mrs. Markovic, with her
ideological bent, tried to reconcile Serbia's traditional values
with her own. She described ``three images of time'' that hang on
her wall, three heroes who personify the Serbian spirit. Her
choices were St. Nikola, the patron saint of her mother's family;
her mother, as an 18-year-old high school senior from a rich family
who chose instead to join the Communist youth organization; and her
son, Marko, at the wheel of his BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Each personified the age, she said: Byzantine, Partisan and the
modern era of computers. ``In my value system,'' she wrote, ``these
three images are eminently compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, she reacts fiercely if her son is criticized, and
sees it as an attack on the nation. In one of the odder documents
of this war, she published an angry response to the British foreign
secretary, Robin Cook, who said that she and her children were not
in Yugoslavia under the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanted to send a message to the world public that my
children and I are dishonest and fearful,'' she wrote. ``To your
regret and to our fortune, you will not succeed in your intentions
_ not when my country nor my family is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   All remain in the country, she said. ``My children have highly
developed patriotic sentiments; they are indeed courageous, rather
smart and extremely beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Marko, she said, ``is in uniform and cares about his small new
family,'' and indeed, he has been shown on television wandering
through Pozarevac in a militarylike uniform, carrying a
Kalashnikov, although he is not believed to be in the army.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly furious, Mrs. Markovic ended her letter, ``very
disrespectfully yours.'' And there was a P.S.: ``I just remembered
_ you said we had five villas abroad. We do not have any, of
course.'' Partly for financial reasons, she said. ``But why should
we, even if we could? Our country is so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   With her husband now under indictment as a war criminal, he is
liable to be arrested wherever he goes abroad, so her fierce pride
in Yugoslavia's beauty is fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in her musings to Ms. Habjanovic-Djurovic, Mrs. Markovic
imagined a different future. When she turns 60 in 2002, she wants
Milosevic to be finished with politics and on vacation with her,
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sees the two of them in Lugano eating ice cream. She wears
a white dress and a flower in her hair, and from that distant,
cold, windy Pozarevac street, a melancholy girl asks her with
seriousness, `How much can a human being really decide about one's
life?'''

CRIES OF CHECKBOOK JOURNALISM AFTER ABC PAYS A SOURCE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC News paid a friend of one of the teen-age gunmen
in the Columbine High School shootings $16,000 for the exclusive
broadcast rights to home videos and other materials containing
details about the killers. Then last Monday, the network presented
what it called an exclusive interview with the 18-year-old, Nathan
Dykeman, on its news program, ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   The network did not disclose on the air that it had paid
Dykeman, saying only that it had ``recently obtained the rights to
his home video,'' and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News executives said that the payment and the interview were
not connected. But critics and executives from competing news
organizations said ABC's action at least approached a line that has
long been considered uncrossable for network news organizations:
paying a subject for an interview, a practice that could encourage
news sources to embellish stories.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said the decision to pay for the material was
consistent with its editorial policies. It was the latest example
of what several network news executives called a growing trend: the
willingness of network news divisions, all of which have policies
forbidding payment for interviews, to pay for material like videos
and photographs that are related to news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of the NBC news magazine
``Dateline,'' said that while paying for the use of video was
considered an acceptable practice, it must be unrelated to an
interview subject. He said his program would never buy material
from someone it intended to interview. ABC said in this case the
material needed the context of the interview to be understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Morning America,'' was the second news outlet to pay a
fee for such material supplied by Dykeman, a Columbine senior.
Dykeman has been widely sought for in-depth interviews by numerous
news organizations because of his friendship with Dylan Klebold,
one of the two gunmen. Dykeman had previously received $10,000 from
a tabloid newspaper, The National Enquirer, for much of the same
material and had turned down other interviews while he said he was
under contract to that newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   News executives from competing networks also criticized ABC's
decision to pay Dykeman on the grounds that it was helping someone
tangentially connected to the case make a profit from a tragedy,
and for the sheer amount of money ABC paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is gross on some level to profit off this tragedy,'' said
Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of NBC's show ``Today'' when
informed of ABC's actions. ``It's a clear example of buying a story
and it's an unseemly thing for ABC to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bode, the dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism, said: ``I think it's both exploitative and completely
improper. One of the things that distinguishes these network news
organizations from exploitative infotainment shows like `Hard Copy'
and `Inside Edition' is that they demand second sources, they don't
do re-creations of events and they don't pay for interviews. This
is out of bounds. I think the people of Littleton have earned the
right to be left alone by the media. They deserve a little
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Goldstein, the dean of Columbia University's Graduate
School of Journalism, said, ``I find the whole notion of checkbook
journalism very complicated. Some of the greatest photographs ever
taken were by passersby or participants. It makes us uneasy that
somebody is profiting from the misfortune of others, but that's
what a lot of journalism is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein did say that ABC was wrong for not telling viewers it
had entered into a deal to pay Dykeman. ``It would certainly be
better if they had said they paid for it. A lot can be cured by
disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior executive with another news magazine show, who
acknowledged paying for video material on some stories, said the
price seemed unusually high. Even one ABC news executive expressed
surprise at how much the network agreed to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Another ABC executive, Shelley Ross, the executive producer of
``Good Morning America,'' said the program decided to buy the
materials because it believed they significantly advanced the
story. ``We are still trying to learn every nugget about who these
kids were and what leads to teen violence,'' she said. She added,
``I know what the journalism purists say. But we don't do checkbook
journalism. This was not checkbook journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross also said, ``There was competitive network bidding on
this,'' although she refused to identify the other bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Phone messages left at the homes of Dykeman's father and
stepfather were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   For its money, ABC received a home video showing Dykeman driving
to school with Klebold, in which the latter makes a passing,
apparently joking reference to sending torpedoes toward the school,
as well as a music video, in which Klebold, wearing a black trench
coat, pours lighter fluid on the school football field.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also received access to Dykeman's yearbook, which contained
some messages filled with hate and murder threats from both Klebold
and the other killer, Eric Harris. Finally, Dykeman gave the
network a copy of the videogame Doom, which had been customized by
Harris to include especially violent images of death and gore. ABC
used the materials, along with the interview with Dykeman, on the
opening segment of ``Good Morning America'' last Monday. The
program labeled the segment on Dykeman a ``Good Morning America
exclusive.'' The network promoted it throughout the previous
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ABC can re-use the material anytime it chooses because it bought
the rights ``in perpetuity,'' according to Eileen Murphy, a
spokeswoman for ABC News. Ms. Ross said she planned to use some of
it again for a segment this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine story has been a particularly competitive one for
news outlets with many of the school's students and parents
aggressively pursued for interviews. (The New York Times has also
sought to interview Dykeman.)
</P>
<P>
   For television news operations the Columbine story has taken on
some of the same elements that turned previous national news
events, like the O.J. Simpson trial, the Jon Benet Ramsey murder
case and the Clinton sex scandal, into the big story that generates
continuing viewer interest _ and reliable ratings. In such stories,
program producers seek to plumb every conceivable angle to keep
fresh elements on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The contention over the Columbine story is taking place at the
same time that the morning news shows have become the most
important area of competition among the network news divisions
because advertisers are pouring so much money into that time of
day. ``Today'' dominates the ratings in the morning hours, and in
recent months ABC has attempted to revive the sagging ``Good
Morning America'' by bringing in two of its most prominent news
anchors, Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson. Ms. Ross joined the
program at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   She said the program first interviewed Dykeman on April 30 but
felt it had only got part of his story. ``He was on our radar,''
she said. ``We felt there was more to get from him and we were so
hungry for any information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross said she did not find it unusual that Dykeman asked to
be paid. ``It was all business as usual,'' she said. ``I wouldn't
call it unusual.'' But one other morning news show producer said
that the purchase of material related to a news story was not
common at the morning programs, although it had become prevalent at
the prime-time news magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross, who had previously worked as a producer for ABC's
prime-time magazines ``Prime Time Live'' and ``20/20,'' said she
had purchased items like videos from sources in news cases on
numerous occasions, mainly, she said, when she was in charge of
much of ABC's coverage of the Simpson murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things came with rights fees a lot during that case,'' she
said. One example she cited: ABC bought some video scenes of Brian
``Kato'' Kaelin, one of the witnesses in the case, acting in what
she called ``a B-movie.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shapiro, the executive producer of ``Dateline NBC,'' said
buying material like this, though acceptable, is not routine.
Shapiro said the only routine purchase of video material would be
in the case of amateur video of events like tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an executive with CBS News suggested that news magazine
programs do frequently buy photographs, letters and other materials
to illustrate certain stories. This executive said ABC's purchase
might be justified if the material was truly new and valuable in
adding to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker of the ``Today'' show openly questioned the propriety of
the decision. He said, ``I can assure you we would never pay anyone
for anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that as far as every member of his staff could recall,
``Today'' had never paid an interview subject for related story
material.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross dismissed Zucker's criticism as the product of the
increasingly nasty competitiveness among the morning shows. ``I
think you can see what's going on with comments like that,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also dismissed the charge that ABC should not have permitted
Dykeman to profit from his participation in the story. ``I'm not
judgmental,'' she said. ``Some people want money. It's a fact of
life.''

MANDELA'S PARTY DWARFS THE OPPOSITION AS ELECTION NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa _ A political cartoon in South Africa shows
the front-running presidential candidate, Thabo Mbeki, dressed as
Snow White looming with an unconcerned smile over seven miserable
dwarfs who represent the opposition parties _ labeled Grumpy,
Shorty, Whiny, Crazy, Bully, Murky and Choppy.
</P>
<P>
   They are a colorful lot. ``Grumpy'' depicts the
often-cantankerous Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi;
``Crazy'' is Gen. Constand Viljoen, still pining for an Afrikaner
homeland; ``Bully'' is Louis Luyt, a fertilizer magnate turned
rugby czar who has been fighting with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choppy'' is the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, a Methodist bishop who
has advocated chopping off the hands _ and other body parts _ of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But all seven together may not collect one-third of the vote in
South Africa's second post-apartheid national elections on
Wednesday. Black South Africans _ more than 75 percent of the
population _ have largely remained loyal to President Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress, which has, in a snappish
election season, repeatedly reminded voters that it was their
liberator.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the National Party call themselves new?'' Mbeki,
Mandela's heir-apparent, recently said about the party that created
apartheid, but now calls itself multiracial. ``Some of the members
of the NNP have got gray hair, some have got bald heads, some of
them have big stomachs, some carry walking sticks, but they call
themselves new.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the governing party held its final campaign rally here
Sunday _ five years after South Africa's first all-race election _
the struggle for freedom was still the dominant theme. Riding
together into the stadium here in a white golf cart, Mandela and
Mbeki, his deputy president, reminded the more than 80,000 black
South Africans in attendance that it would still take time to erase
the harm caused by the past.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the ``long, hard path to arrive here,'' Mandela urged
them to vote ``to continue the struggle to overcome 300 years of
white domination.'' He drew tumultuous cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Though polls indicate that black South Africans are very
concerned about growing unemployment and a crime rate that is among
the highest in the world, they also indicate that the majority of
blacks have decided to give the governing party at least another
five years to address those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even the retirement of the 80-year-old _ and still much beloved
_ Mandela does not faze the party's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mandela or Mbeki, it is the same,'' said Gail Bokaba, 31, who
attended the rally Sunday. ``The ANC is an investment in our
future. It is for our children. They will make things right. They
need more time.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the party's campaign has combined emphasizing
accomplishments with admitting some failures. Audiences have heard
over and over about the number of new houses, electric lines,
telephone poles, water taps, health clinics and school feeding
programs put in place in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of you can challenge the statement that whites have been
in this country for more than three centuries, and no government
has ever achieved the progress this government has achieved,''
Mandela often says.
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki and Mandela have admitted _ and deplored _ corruption
in the new government, acknowledged huge unmet needs and promised
speedier change in the future. The polls indicate that their
strategy has worked.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, the party _ which won 62.5 percent of
the vote in 1994 _ was getting ratings of about 53 percent. By last
week, the polls indicated the party is still gaining votes and
could well get 67 percent of the vote _ enough even to change the
constitution, though Mbeki has said he has no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has a parliamentary system in which the voters
select a party rather than individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition parties, which in some cases have attacked each
other as much as the governing party, have essentially only
redivided their slice of the pie. The big loser appears to be the
National Party, which won about 20 percent of the vote in 1994,
getting the bulk of the white and mixed-race vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not expected to get more than 10 percent this time and
it may be locked in a battle for the official opposition spot with
the once-tiny, liberal, always anti-apartheid Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   When former President F.W. de Klerk retired from the National
Party in 1997, the party elected Martinus van Schalkwyk to be its
leader. But at age 37 and nicknamed ``short pants'' by his enemies,
he lacks charisma and de Klerk's stature. He has tried to sell his
party as the one that knows how to run things. But the party,
inexperienced in opposition politics, has hardly been a force in
the last five years _ and polls indicate its support is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its votes seem to be going to the Democratic Party,
which has the pugnacious slogan ``The Guts to Fight Back,'' and a
rapier-tongued leader, Tony Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate Leon is gaining support from conservative
Afrikaners. Some of them have apparently come to believe that the
party's support of federalism and vocal criticism of government _
even though it holds only seven of the 400 seats in Parliament _
may be their best protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Zulu nationalist party, the Inkatha Freedom Party, won about
8 percent of the vote in 1994, after fighting a long and bloody
civil war against the African National Congress in the
KwaZulu/Natal province. The party leader, Buthelezi, has since been
wooed by the African National Congress and allowed to stand in as
president when both Mandela and Mbeki are out of the country. He
has not seemed to show much enthusiasm for campaigning this time
around, and polls indicate his party might get only 4 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The upstart United Democratic Movement appears likely to get 3
to 5 percent of the vote. It was started by Bantu Holomisa, a
former governing party official thrown out of the party for
insubordination, and Roelf Meyer, a former National Party official
who was pushed out for advocating more change than the party's old
guard wanted to hear about.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the African National Congress' most blistering attacks
have been aimed at this party, which has cut into the governing
party's support _ particularly in the Eastern Cape province, where
Mandela and Mbeki were born. Holomisa is a former leader of an
apartheid-era homeland _ an area marked out for blacks _ and he
used to offer governing party leaders shelter there.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Mandela has been warning supporters to beware of
``former employees of the apartheid regime.'' Both men have spent
the last few weeks shoring up their support in that province.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the dwarfs are not expected to get more than a
percentage point each.

FIRST WIN SINCE '96 SWEET FOR BORBON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stadium is different, but the city is the same and
some of Pedro Borbon's old Atlanta teammates are still with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon, the left-hander the Los Angeles Dodgers signed quietly
during the offseason, is their most consistent pitcher in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   And after two years of grueling rehab work _ and two months in
the Dodgers' bullpen _ Borbon won again. He pitched two perfect
innings of relief in the Dodgers' 5-4 win against Atlanta on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Borbon's first win since Aug. 21, 1996, when he pitched
for the Braves. The next day he suffered an elbow injury that
resulted in reconstructive surgery. He didn't pitch in '97 and
toiled in the Braves' minor-league system last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic it would come against my old team,'' said Borbon,
who went to spring training as a non-roster invitee. ``What's even
more weird is I hurt my arm pitching against Bret Boone, and I look
and see him out there and I said, `Oh, my God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Borbon (1-1) retired Boone like he did nearly everyone else. In
addition to the two perfect innings Sunday, Borbon pitched
two-thirds of an inning in Saturday's 2-1 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great (to pitch at Turner Field), but it felt
strange,'' Borbon said. ``I was trying to throw even harder than I
usually throw (Saturday). I was real emotional. I was as emotional
as when I pitched for them. I had a lot of adrenaline and I was
throwing harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Borbon, 31, also has the confidence of manager Davey Johnson.
After hesitating to use him on back-to-back days for most of the
season, Borbon has pitched four times in the past five games. He
also is second among National League relievers with 1.31 ERA, and
his 23 appearances ties closer Jeff Shaw for best on the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with everything, especially my arm,'' said Borbon,
who spent 10 years in the Braves organization before signing with
the Dodgers as a free agent in January. ``It's good that I'm
putting up the numbers, but I'm happy with my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding situations: The Dodgers have gone through the
starting rotation once since Claude Osteen was appointed pitching
coach, and the starter in which Osteen had the most to say about
was Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed four runs (three earned) on five hits in five
innings in a loss to Atlanta on Friday. He walked five and struck
out five.
</P>
<P>
   But Osteen said Dreifort needs to do a better job of
understanding the situation. Osteen pointed to the fourth inning in
which the Braves had the bases loaded with none out and Gerald
Williams up with pitcher Odalis Perez on deck. Williams and Perez
each had RBI ground outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the kind of stuff and ability, if he recognizes the
situation in front of him, he can get out of the inning without
them scoring,'' Osteen said. ``They scored two runs without the
ball going out of the infield. If they (Dreifort and catcher Todd
Hundley) set up Gerald Williams right, they could have struck him
out with the pitcher up next. But I thought he pitched very well.''
</P>
<P>
   This and that: Johnson said it's unlikely outfielder Todd
Hollandsworth, bothered by a strained rib cage, would play during
the three-game series in Pittsburgh. ``I'd be tickled to death if
he's available for the Anaheim series (beginning Friday),'' Johnson
said.... When Chipper Jones struck out in the second and Keith
Lockhart was thrown out trying to steal second by catcher Todd
Hundley, it marked the Dodgers' first double play in such a
manner.... Mark Grudzielanek's error on Jones' sixth-inning hard
grounder Saturday was changed to a base hit, meaning starter Carlos
Perez yielded three hits in five-plus innings. Grudzielanek has
made two errors this season.... Atlanta announced it will activate
John Smoltz (inflamed right elbow) from the disabled list and he'll
start Tuesday against Colorado.... The game drew 47,166, pushing
the Braves attendance to 1,022,659.

A SMALL BOOKSTORE NOT BOUND BY ITS WALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GAYLE FELDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was Sebastian Junger, best-selling author of ``The Perfect
Storm,'' doing in a high school gymnasium in Greenwich, Conn.,
filled with 500 children?
</P>
<P>
   First, feeling ``nervous,'' since he had not been near that many
teen-agers since he was one himself. Second, sharing a podium with
Linda Greenlaw, a fishing boat captain featured in his book, whose
own memoir, ``Hungry Ocean,'' has just been published.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, he was being party to the kind of creative
marketing that an independent bookstore must mount if it is to
survive in a business increasingly dominated by discount stores,
warehouse clubs, chains and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A report to be published Tuesday by the Book Industry Study
Group, a nonprofit research organization, shows that in 1998,
independents represented only 16.6 percent of outlets where books
are sold, down from 21.6 percent in 1994, and falling.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Junger and Ms. Greenlaw to the students of
Brunswick Academy and its sister school, Greenwich Academy _ and
their speaking engagement before 200 adults later that day at the
Indian Harbor Yacht Club down the road _ had been arranged by an
independent bookseller, Warren Cassell. His quid pro quo was to
have already sold each of those 500 children a copy of Junger's
book as enrichment reading. Although Ms. Greenlaw's book was
published too late for that, by day's end it had sold 135 copies.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all. Cassell has arranged with Brunswick to
provide speakers and books on a continuing basis. The school
benefits because it gets top-of-the-line speakers for free. Cassell
benefits because he will sell at least 500 copies of each book.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Just Books, Cassell's store in tony Greenwich,
seems an unlikely font for marketing wisdom. It is a hole in the
wall without armchairs, with cramped, poorly lighted aisles and
water-damaged ceilings and walls. The kind of comfortable,
coffee-selling bookstore people have come to take for granted in
the 1990s it definitely is not.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with annual sales running about $850,000 for 600 square feet
of selling space, Cassell is doing something right. This is
recognized by the major publishers, who are clamoring to feed him
their best authors for events. What Cassell and thriving
independent retailers like him have succeeded in doing
``brilliantly,'' said the president of Time Warner Inc.'s trade
publishing operation, Maureen Egen, is ``to take the store out to
the public and cater to their tastes and interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine times a year, Cassell organizes literary breakfasts at a
nearby hotel. On May 27, almost 800 people paid $18 each to hear
George Stephanopoulos, John Feinstein and Dan Rather while downing
their coffee.
</P>
<P>
   They also bought 425 books. In September, the best-selling
authors Frank McCourt and Dava Sobel will have their hot buttered
toast alongside their hot-off-the-press books; in October, it will
be George Bush's turn. Not every author is so A-list: If Cassell
really believes in a book, he has been known to sneak an unknown
author onto a panel.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Brockett, publicity director at Junger's hard-cover
publisher, W.W. Norton, and Jennifer Landers, her equivalent at Ms.
Greenlaw's publisher, Hyperion, a unit of Walt Disney, point to
other variations on the theme. For example, when a customer buys a
ticket to a literary lunch or breakfast organized by Elaine
Petrocelli, owner of Book Passage in Corte Madera, Calif., the
ticket price includes a signed copy of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, meanwhile, who says he has lost 15 to 20 percent of his
total business to the Internet the last 18 months, is busy making
it up on that front as well. The store's Web site, which is updated
every two weeks, and a monthly newsletter, mailed to 7,000
customers, keep the breakfasts humming to capacity, along with
events at the Garden Education Center, a yacht club and a
synagogue. He also does a brisk Internet business in signed copies,
collectibles and out-of-print searches.
</P>
<P>
   How does he keep costs down? Cassell has four computers, but
only 3,500 books in his store. ``We consider the wholesalers our
inventory,'' he said, as his phone rang on a recent Friday with
customers requesting titles.
</P>
<P>
   They would get them the following Monday.

HONORARY DEGREES GRANTED FOR DIVERSE REASONS TO DIVERSE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Calif., Fla., Ill., Ga., Md., Mass., N.Y., Pa., Texas,
Va.) (rk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson had strong opinions about what a university
ought and ought not to do. One was that it should not grant
honorary degrees. Founder of the University of Virginia, Jefferson
feared that its board might get carried away with political or
religious enthusiasms rather than choose a recipient based on
scholarly considerations. To this day, the University of Virginia
gives no honorary degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia is unusual. To receive their highest award, many
colleges and universities line up a stage full of high achievers at
commencement day _ actors, authors, government officials, business
executives and, to be sure, scholars.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this commencement season, Elizabeth Dole will have
received 40 honorary degrees. By his library's last count, December
1996, President Bush had been given 30; his son, the Texas
governor, has but four. Quincy Jones, the music impresario who
received honors this month from the University of Miami, New York
University and Tuskegee University, has 15. Historian Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. received his 27th on Friday, from the City
University of New York Graduate Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby, one of the all-time favorite honorary degree
recipient, doesn't even know how many he has, said his spokesman,
David Brokaw, who guessed more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honorary doctorate _ that's lovely, he enjoys getting
them,'' said Brokaw, noting that Cosby had actually earned a
doctorate in education from the University of Massachusetts. ``But
what's important to him is getting the podium so he can say
something profound and funny to the students and their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   To the university, the honorary degree is a way to recognize
achievements of people respected within the institution as well to
add glitter to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they are used to reward donors who have given money;
sometimes they are used to draw celebrities to make the graduation
special,'' said Arthur E. Levine, president of Teachers College at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the university secured its usual well-calculated mix:
Muhammad Ali, Noam Chomsky, Tito Puente and Julie Taymor, along
with two scientists, an engineer and a historian whose names are
less well known on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always viewed it as a last lesson a college can teach, by
showing examples of people who most represent the values the
institution stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   The honorary degree is also a useful way to enhance a
relationship with someone who can benefit the university. This
month Georgia State University honored J. Mack Robinson, who last
fall gave $10 million to its College of Business. Chapman
University in Orange, Calif., awarded an honorary degree to author
John Fowles after he agreed to let them create a writing center and
literary festival in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the only condition is that the recipient show up, don a
robe and sit on a platform for a few hours _ and sometimes the
university will waive even that requirement. Last September,
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa became one of only three
people to receive an honorary degree from Harvard University at a
time other than commencement. The other two were George Washington
and Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Honorary doctorates, in categories from letters to law to fine
arts, have little function other than being, well, an honor. But
the custom of bestowing them is centuries old, one that American
colleges borrowed from their English forbears.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Oxford, the ceremony at which they are granted is known as
the ``encaenia,'' a Greek word meaning festival of renewal, and
calls for the honorees to be introduced in Latin. American
ceremonies are less formal and citations more chatty _ and usually
in English.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1753, Benjamin Franklin was big, receiving honorary
degrees from both Harvard and Yale, according to John S. Brubacher
and Willis Rudy, authors of ``Higher Education in Transition''
(Transaction Publishers, 1997). They wrote that nearly 200
different kinds of honorary degrees were granted between 1870 and
1939, including the DFF _ a doctor of fortitude and faith.
</P>
<P>
   When William Barton Rogers, a former University of Virginia
faculty member, founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1861, he brought with him the opposition to honorary degrees
inherited from Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Institute honored Winston Churchill in 1949, James
R. Killian, MIT's president designate, invited him to be ``an
honorary member of the company of scholars which is MIT,'' since he
could not give him an honorary degree.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Chicago ran into a similar problem when Edward
H. Levi, then dean of the law school, invited the Queen of England
to receive an honorary degree. But when he presented the idea to
the faculty, it asked to review her scholarly accomplishments and
turned her down.
</P>
<P>
   Levi had to withdraw the invitation, but years later, he laughed
about it, saying proudly that Chicago never gave honorary degrees
to ``businessmen or famous personalities as a way of currying
favor,'' only to people who had made contributions to knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Salinger, an alumnus of Ursinus College in Collegeville,
Pa., is one recipient who turned down an invitation. He did write
back, said John Strassburger, president of Ursinus. He was
flattered but it violated his principles.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, however, are happy to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very complimentary, especially for someone who majored in
cafeteria in high school,'' said Larry Gelbart, who wrote the
television series ``MASH'' and the Broadway musical ``A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart never went to college but received an honorary degree
from Hofstra University on Long Island this year _ his second.
``It's awfully good for the ego,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Catharine R. Stimpson, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and
Science at New York University, who is receiving her 12th honorary
degree next month, from Santa Clara University, says she still
feels thrilled every time she receives an invitation. But she also
views it as recognition of the fields she works in, including
women's studies and gender studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always aware of that fact that this is not just Catharine
R. Stimpson who is receiving an award,'' she said, ``but that I am
a symbolic figure and it represents the work of many other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also perks. ``You get the hood, which is very cool,''
said Bill Nye, host of PBS's ``Science Guy,'' who received honorary
doctorates from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Goucher
College in Baltimore this commencement season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John E. Brooks, president emeritus of Holy Cross
University, recalls how in 1983 Joe DiMaggio was so moved by the
honor that he broke down in tears and asked if he could keep the
rented gown he had worn at Holy Cross' commencement.
</P>
<P>
   But if most recipients relish the degrees, the same cannot be
said of the college officials who have to line them up _ especially
at less well-known institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for small colleges,'' said Levine, who recalled
that as president of Bradford College, a small liberal arts college
in Massachusetts, he had to be creative. One year, the college
honored people in the local community. ``The day after
commencement, you start trying to line up the ones for next year,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., has already started
thinking ahead. Its recipient for May 6, 2000, is Fred McFeely
Rogers, the children's television show host. For Mister Rogers, the
honor will be No. 36.

   NEW YORK _ There was something about the wave of unrepentant
jubilance sweeping through iVillage downtown Manhattan offices the
day the 31/2-year-old Internet company went public that made Susan
Weaver uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   As employees who had been allowed to buy stock for as little as
$6 per share watched it climb to $103 in its first afternoon of
public trading, Ms. Weaver _ at 46, an elder in a company whose
average hire is 31 _ addressed a cigar-wielding group gathered in
the hall. ``I just want everyone to realize this is Disneyland,''
she remembers saying that day in March.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weaver, iVillage's vice president for programming and a
former NBC producer, later explained: ``I didn't want them to feel
that they were entitled to what was happening to them. This doesn't
happen all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, it didn't used to. Particularly not in New York, where
the cluster of new-media companies known as Silicon Alley has
always been viewed by its Western namesake as an also-ran in
innovation and wealth creation.
</P>
<P>
   But since March, with Wall Street's valuing infant Internet
companies that have never made a profit in the same range as
automakers and airlines, Silicon Alley has witnessed initial public
offerings at the rate of one a week. And as investor fervor for
Internet companies threatens to fade, the sprint for IPOs, as the
offerings are known, has only picked up speed.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Internet stocks faltered last week _ iVillage, for
example, lost almost 10 percent of its value in one day _ three New
York-based companies launched themselves on the public market to a
respectable reception. And shares of StarMedia Networks, the most
highly anticipated of last week's offerings, closed 74 percent
above its initial offering price of $15 per share on Wednesday, its
first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable, it's surreal _ it's good, I guess, would be
the sound bite,'' said Fernando Espeula, 32, who three years ago
created StarMedia, which provides Internet access in Latin America.
The IPO, he said, has made him worth $162 million on paper. ``Wow,
that's the first time I've said it out loud. It's kind of weird.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom has created as many as a thousand paper
millionaires among the founders and executives of Silicon Alley
companies, said Uri Kaufthal, the president of AST StockPlan, which
administers the stock benefit packages for several of them. Many
junior employees among Silicon Alley's more than 100,000 workers
have collected enough to pay off student loans or consider buying
an apartment, maybe even in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where the well-worn paths to success have led through
the trading floor or the ranks of large media corporations, the
emergence of sudden Internet-bred wealth holds out the promise of
much quicker rewards. It is exposing New Yorkers to the Silicon
Valley culture of entrepreneurial risk. And it is prompting
resentment, envy and a scramble to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us had friends on Wall Street who always made so damn
much money,'' said Sunny Bates, an executive recruiter for New
York-based Internet firms. ``Now you can make a lot of money and
you don't have to be an investment banker. Everybody wants to get
on the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Silicon Alley is not embracing the IPO lifestyle without
a healthy dose of apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the seeming arbitrariness of who is getting rich
and exactly how rich they are getting can be disconcerting, even
for those who are now buying BMWs to go with their Palm Pilots.
Those at start-ups that have yet to issue a prospectus wonder
whether their chance will come before it is too late. Workers in
the Internet divisions of traditional media companies yearn for
their operations to be spun off and taken public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, veterans of other industries worry that a generation
is emerging with the expectation that working late nights for a
couple of years at the right company should make them set for
retirement. And among some early denizens of the Alley, many of
whom started out with the conviction that technology could
democratize society and create new modes of expression, there is a
sense of loss as talk turns from changing the world to when their
options vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a sense that we were on the cusp of a
significant change that was at once economic and cultural,'' said
Jason Chervokas, the editor of (at)NewYork, an industry newsletter
that was recently bought by MecklerMedia. ``But the original idea,
which was, hey, let's build a medium with a new hip, gender-neutral
image, has fallen by the wayside, and I regret that, I really do.
The sense that you're allowed to experiment has been replaced by
pressure for quarterly results.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alley veterans and newcomers alike, it can be hard getting
used to running into 20-year-old millionaires at parties in
downtown lofts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around this kind of gargantuan `monetizing' day in, day
out _ it warps your mind,'' Marisa Bowe, the editor of the online
magazine Word, wrote in a recent essay in The New York Observer
about watching her Silicon Alley friends cash in. ``Just a few
years ago, we were dance or literature majors, actors with day
jobs. Now we live in a strange world where it seems as if every
10th person has won the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But for bystanders, the logic of IPO winnings is somehow harder
to swallow than the luck of the lottery. Paul Debraccio, who spent
15 years selling advertising at the magazine publisher Conde Nast
before doing the same at a lower salary for an Internet firm,
Tripod Inc., says some of his former colleagues have a hard time
understanding how he has come to be bidding on real estate in the
Hamptons this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person just can't conceive that in two or three
years you can become a millionaire without having started your own
company,'' said Debraccio, whose options in Tripod were converted
to stock worth over $1.5 million when the company was sold to New
York-based Lycos Inc. last year. ``The ones who do understand it
call me looking for jobs or advice. At Conde Nast, the most you
could make is $500,000 a year, and that's if you were a
publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Debraccio is now the senior vice president for advertising at
Uproar, an Internet games company in New York that trades on the
Vienna exchange but may soon offer shares in the United States. As
is typical for Internet company employees, he accepted a lower
salary in exchange for stock options. ``Part of it is about riding
the money wave,'' he said. ``This is probably going to turn out
good as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kansas, the editor of the online financial news service
thestreet.com, is less sanguine about his paper wealth, which
hovers around $9 million and has in recent days served as a
somewhat obsessive topic of conversation in The Wall Street
Journal's newsroom, where he used to be a reporter. (On May 11, the
day his company went public, Kansas received several e-mail
messages from former colleagues along these lines: ``Dave, I was
just going to lunch, but I'm a little short today. Do you think ...
'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sacrificed a lot over the last three years,'' said
Kansas, 32. ``Can I value it at $9 million? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even the biggest evangelists of the Internet wealth
culture wax insecure about its scale _ and its future. That is in
part because federal regulations require that institutional
investors and senior executives hold onto their stock for six
months after the initial public offering. (Junior employees are not
subject to those restrictions.) Moreover, stock options that are
granted to employees typically vest over a four-year period, so
just how rich somebody is depends on how many options he actually
owns and whether the stock price holds up until he can exercise
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Monopoly money. I don't count it,'' said Fred Wilson, a
co-founder of Flatiron Partners, the New York venture capital firm
that has financed several of the most successful Internet companies
to go public lately, including thestreet.com, theglobe.com and
StarMedia. ``You can watch your value go up and down millions a day
and you can't do anything about it. It's surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The giddy tone at many of the city's cyber-celebrations and the
frequency with which new-media employees check the company stock
price underscores the anxiety that their net worth is housed within
a speculative bubble that is destined to pop. It is a fear that
plagues the industry well beyond New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, to make a gazillion dollars in the computer
business you had to have a good product, and there was pretty clear
evidence about what made it good _ i.e., people bought it,'' said
Jonathan Weber, the editor of the Industry Standard, a trade
publication that follows the Internet economy. ``The Internet boom
and the IPO phenomenon is so speculative that what separates
certain companies from the pack is not always that obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many who have benefited even modestly from the boom
remember when their friends and families scoffed at their choice to
forsake more traditional careers for this strange thing known as
the Internet. They do not quite see why the risk of their own
opportunities should be deemed less worthy of reward than the
risks, say, that investment bankers take with other people's money.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kate Hanley's starting salary at iVillage in 1996
was $15,000 less than the book editing job she was offered at
Fairchild Communications. But as one of the first 30 employees of
the company, a provider of online information and discussion forums
for women, she was granted 333 stock options at $6 per share.
(iVillage's shares closed Friday at $47.875 _ less than half the
price attained on the day it went public but still a healthy
premium for Ms. Hanley's options, three-quarters of which have
vested. She has not cashed them in.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanley was also given ``friends and family'' options, which
allow employees and others designated by the management team to buy
stock at the initial offering price. The proceeds from that stock,
which Ms. Hanley bought at $24 and sold at the opening price of
$95, netting her about $25,000, served as a down payment for the
Chelsea apartment that she moved into this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``People act as though I found this money in a bag on the
street,'' said Ms. Hanley, 29, a producer for iVillage's computing
site. ``It's like, where were you when I was working for the last
three years till 9 or 10 at night and on weekends?''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Hanley's friend Annie Rhodes, 28, who works at
ToggleThis, another Internet company three blocks away, the
iVillage public offering was bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they went public, I was sort of kicking myself,' '' said
Ms. Rhodes, who left iVillage two years ago and missed out on
cashing in. ``But it's also exciting. Until you know people who
have hit it big with options, it doesn't really seem real. Now it
seems like ... it's not a joke. This could happen to us.''

</P>
<P>
   Filled with that sense of promise, business school students who
used to head straight to the finance courses that would get them to
Goldman Sachs are packing into the electronic commerce class at
Columbia and oversubscribing the entrepreneurial course at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Those with MBA's are not the only ones to be drawn by the
prospect of entrepreneurial freedom and fabulous wealth. Ken
Perlin, a professor of computer science and the director of the
Media Research Laboratory at New York University, said the Internet
boom had changed the orientation of his students, particularly
since Yahoo bought Webcal, the Web calendar that one of the
laboratory students developed, for $12 million in stock last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people in this field think they should be millionaires,
and that's a new phenomenon,'' Perlin said. ``The concern is that
it's deceptive. I know a number of students who tried to make a go
of it and it didn't work. And it wasn't fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is angst or self-loathing among some of those who
have tried their hands in Silicon Alley, Jeff Dachis, a co-founder
of Razorfish, an Internet services company that went public April
27, does not share it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be lumped in with the hucksters of the world,
because we have the real deal,'' said Dachis, 32, who bought a BMW
5-series as an IPO gift to himself. ``I feel completely and utterly
entitled to whatever success comes our way. Not everybody's good,
not everybody has the winning idea, not every idea deserves to be
funded or to be public. I'm sorry, but there are sheep and there
are shepherds, and I fancy myself to be the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zolli, the vice president of the interactive division of
the advertising firm Siegal &AMP; Gale, said he spent a week of
sleepless nights pondering his past and future after watching
friends and former colleagues at Razorfish make millions this
month. Finally, though, he came to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job, and ultimately I believe this is still the most
important medium of the next half century, and our ultimate judge
is not the size of our bank accounts,'' said Zolli, 28. ``When this
insanity passes, what will matter is who had the really good ideas
and good work. I really believe that.''  &QL;

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 TOP COUNSEL AT MORGAN STANLEY REPORTEDLY WAS AWARE OF PAYMENT TO
INFORMANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The general counsel of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
learned of an in-house lawyer's decision to pay $10,000 to an
informant involved in the arrest of a former employee shortly
before the payment was made, according to people close to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Christine A. Edwards, the general counsel, was told about the
payment to Charles Joseph Luethke, the informant, just hours before
a wire transfer was completed. She did not try to stop it, this
person said, largely because she had only fragmentary knowledge of
Luethke and his role in the police sting operation against the
former employee, Christian L. Curry, last August.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Morgan Stanley called the payment a ``mistake in
judgment'' and suspended with pay Monroe R. Sonnenborn, a managing
director, and Carol Bernheim, an experienced litigator, pending the
completion of an internal investigation. Both are senior officials
in the firm's legal department who had extensive dealings with
Luethke during July and August last year. Both report to Ms.
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Luethke was cooperating with Morgan Stanley and the
New York Police Department to catch Curry conspiring to plant
racist e-mail messages on the firm's computer system to buttress a
discrimination suit against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney is conducting a criminal
investigation of Morgan Stanley's payment to Luethke. The district
attorney's office is examining why the firm did not notify
prosecutors of the payment to an informant who had an important
role in the Curry arrest. Luethke is also under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Records of communications within Morgan Stanley provide ``rock
solid'' evidence that Ms. Edwards was told about the payment to
Luethke only a short time before the wire transfer was sent on Aug.
26, 1998, said the person, who agreed to speak only if he was not
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards had earlier received a telephone message from
Luethke, whom she did not know, demanding payment for the services
he provided the firm in connection with the Curry arrest. She made
inquiries about Luethke and found out that Sonnenborn had already
committed Morgan Stanley to pay him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not saying that Edwards could not have stopped the
payment. But she learned of it only after the commitment had been
made. Monty made the commitment, and he does not dispute that,''
the person said, referring to Sonnenborn.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenborn did not return phone calls seeking comment. Ms.
Edwards could not be reached for comment over the long holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's decision late last week to punish Sonnenborn
and Ms. Bernheim for the payment rankled some fellow executives at
the firm. People close to Sonnenborn say he is furious about being
singled out for blame.
</P>
<P>
   A managing director who has been at Morgan Stanley for about 15
years, Sonnenborn was clearly the point man in dealing with
Luethke, people close to the firm said. But he was also cautious.
</P>
<P>
   For example, just before paying $10,000 to Luethke, Sonnenborn
sought legal advice from one of Morgan Stanley's outside law firms,
Davis, Polk &AMP; Wardwell, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   The advice did not dissuade him from making the payment. The
interaction indicates that Sonnenborn did not cavalierly commit the
firm to pay Luethke.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very unhappy about this being hung on Monty,'' one
Morgan Stanley executive who did not have a personal role in the
Luethke payment said. ``He's not a cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards has been general counsel for Morgan Stanley since
1997, when the white-shoe investment bank merged with Dean Witter,
the mass-market retail brokerage house. Ms. Edwards had served as
Dean Witter's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley has not officially identified Sonnenborn and Ms.
Bernstein as the two suspended legal officers. Nor has the firm
stated why the two were singled out for suspension. Asked whether
any other executives knew about the firm's relationship with
Luethke or about the $10,000 payment, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm has clearly drawn the line of responsibility
outside the doors of the executive suite. Philip J. Purcell,
chairman and chief executive, and John J. Mack, the president,
issued a statement Thursday disavowing knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either of us had known about Luethke's request for money,
no payment would ever have been made,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke disputes Morgan Stanley's version of its relationship
with him. In an interview, he insisted that top Morgan Stanley
executives were aware of negotiations with him both before and
after Curry's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke, a 29-year-old native of Haworth, N.J., who is not now
employed full-time, said the firm dangled the prospect of full-time
employment and consulting and money-management arrangements to
induce him to cooperate with the police sting operation against
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke had known Curry since 1993, when they were both
attending Columbia University. It was Luethke who first brought to
Morgan Stanley's attention what he described as Curry's plan to
plant fake e-mail on the firm's computers. He later played a role
in the elaborate police undercover operation against the former
employee.
</P>
<P>
   After Curry's arrest, Luethke made a series of phone calls to
top executives at the firm. Luethke said those calls were to
discuss the terms of a business contract with the firm. People
close to Morgan Stanley said Luethke repeatedly demanded the
$10,000 payment for services he provided.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the $10,000 payment was wired, Luethke made
phone calls to the direct lines of Purcell, Ms. Edwards, Sonnenborn
and Ms. Bernheim, telephone records show. The records show
completed calls from Luethke's home telephone, but do not reveal
the length of the calls. Luethke declined to say whether he spoke
to the executives in question or only left messages for them.
</P>
<P>
   But the person close to Morgan Stanley said Luethke's account of
his communications with the firm was distorted. This person
acknowledges that Ms. Edwards received a vague message ``from
someone named Luethke wanting his money.'' But she had no idea at
the time who Luethke was. The person said Purcell also had no
knowledge of Luethke and never received messages or other
communications from him.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Ms. Edwards followed up by asking Sonnenborn
about Luethke's demand for payment that she learned of the
commitment that Sonnenborn had made to pay the informant for his
services. At that point, this person said, it was not considered
prudent to renege on a commitment the firm had made.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke has played a cat-and-mouse game with the firm ever since
the payment was made. He says he never withdrew the $10,000 from
the third-party account to which it was wired, and that he offered
to return it. He insisted in a letter he sent to Morgan Stanley,
addressed to Purcell, that without the full business contract he
sought, the payment for services in the Curry arrest might be
illegal. The letter is dated Sept. 29, 1998, a month after the
$10,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Morgan Stanley said they now believed that
Luethke intended to use the $10,000 payment as leverage to get a
great deal more money from the firm.

MICROSOFT AND DELL INVEST IN DIGITAL NETWORK FOR YOUTH
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dell Computer Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have
invested in Digital Entertainment Network, a startup company
developing youth-oriented television programming for delivery over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The investments are part of $26 million in venture capital set
to be announced this week. Other investors are Cassandra Chase
Entertainment Partners, Chase Capital Partners and senior
executives of Lazard Freres &AMP; Company, according to Digital
Entertainment Network, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif. The
size of each investment was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Entertainment Network, which goes by the acronym DEN,
offers six programs on its Web site (www.den.net), which began
operating earlier this month. They include ``Frat Ratz'' about an
``Animal House'' type of fraternity, ``Tales From the East Side,''
a drama about Hispanic youth, and ``Limozeno,'' in which a
celebrity is interviewed in the back of a stretch limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Television programming for the Web has not fared well in the
past. A Web-based soap opera called ``The Spot'' generated
considerable attention a few years ago but was ultimately
abandoned. One problem is that with conventional modems, video
comes out grainy and jerky and is usually displayed in a tiny box
on the screen. In addition, many personal computer users want to
interact, rather than passively watch television on their screens.
</P>
<P>
   H. James Ritts III, chief executive of DEN, contends that the
company can succeed, even before higher-speed Internet connections
come into widespread use, by designing its programming specifically
for the Web. ``Most other video has been produced for other media
and is re-purposed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DEN's episodes are short _ six minutes on average _ and shot on
a shoestring budget. Episodes come with interactive features, such
as allowing a viewer to click on an advertiser's product that is
placed within the program to get more information.
</P>
<P>
   DEN is not alone. Other companies trying to provide video for
the Internet include Pseudo Programs Inc. of New York and The Sync
Inc. of Laurel Md. Broadcast.com transmits such programming as
sporting events that often come from television. Hollywood
entertainment companies are edging into the market as well.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Dell will own only small stakes in DEN, which is
expected to file for a public stock offering soon. Gary Share,
product manager for Windows Media at Microsoft, said the company
invests in numerous startups that can help make the personal
computer a ``digital entertainment platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which also began making investments in small companies
recently, wants to keep up better with the young consumers _ the
same ones DEN is seeking _ and is exploring new businesses beyond
personal computers, a Dell spokesman, T.R. Reid, said.
</P>
<P>
   DEN was founded by Marc Collins-Rector and Chad Shackley, who
had previously founded Concentric Networks, an early Internet
service provider, and by Brock Pierce, an actor and producer.
Ritts, the chief executive, was a co-founder of Channel One, the
television network for high schools, and more recently the
commissioner of the Ladies Professional Golf Association. David
Neuman, the company's president, is former president of Walt Disney
Television.

 &HT;    Virtual Wall is a cyberspace version of the real Vietnam
memorial
 &HT;    (EDS: WITH PHOTOS; PACKAGES WITH: MEMORIALDAY-SIDE.)
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His photo album from basic training in his lap, his
fingers clickety-clicking across his computer keyboard, Max Falls
punches in the names of old Army buddies on a new Internet site _
trying to find out how many didn't make it back from Vietnam as he
did, 29 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically entering the names of the other 170 young men in
his 1968 Ft. Benning basic training company, and other servicemen
he recalls, Falls repeatedly gets the comforting answer, ``No
matches.'' That indicates the soldier wasn't among the 58,219 slain
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not long before a name yields a ``hit,'' eliciting a
muffled groan from Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald Queen,'' he sighs. ``What a shame. He was from my neck
of the woods in north Georgia, a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the click of his mouse, another page pops up on The Vietnam
Veterans Virtual Wall web site, providing details. It turns out
Queen died from grenade wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another click invites Falls to post a remembrance under Queen's
name for anyone to see, or in a general area for reflections.
</P>
<P>
   Falls, 54, had just about given up trying to find out what
happened to many of the men he once knew. He's enthralled with the
Virtual Wall site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered,'' says Falls. ``You hear about the people
from your home town, but now you can find out in a flash about the
others. This is a really neat thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored jointly by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund and
WinStar Communications, a telephone/Internet service provider, the
Virtual Wall web site was launched a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cyberspace version of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in
Washington, listing all the names that are etched on the famous
black-granite wall. Web surfers can call up the names of those who
died in Vietnam, punch up details of their deaths, and post
tributes, including color photographs and sound recordings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 5,000 tributes have been left. Jan Scruggs, head
of the the Washington-based Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, expects
that number to mushroom as more ex-servicemen, and loved ones of
those who died, learn about the site, which is getting an
escalating number of hits weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow-burning fuse whenever you come up with a new
idea,'' he says. ``But the word is getting out, and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs says the site is meant to be an extension of the real
wall, a place people can visit without trekking to Washington. A
major purpose, he adds, is to educate America's youth about the
Vietnam War. The site provides histories, commentaries, chat rooms
and photographs that can be called up with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   A committee reviews all tributes before they are posted, usually
within about three days. Many remembrances are painfully personal.
</P>
<P>
   One, for example, was posted by a vet who identified himself as
``just a grunt'' who served with Johnny Ray Bryson, who was killed
in action Jan. 7, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was near him when he was killed and when I rushed to help
him it was clear that he was gone,'' the grunt wrote. ``He did not
suffer, and he was not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, posted for William D. Sizemore, was penned by his son,
Gary _ only 12 when his dad was ambushed in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi Dad,'' it begins. ``I just wanted to say hello. As your two
grandaughters grow into beautiful young women, it hurts me even
more that they will never know you as their grandfather. You would
be very proud of them, as they are proud of you. I love you. Your
son, Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore, contacted by phone, said he finds the virtual wall
``cathartic'' and plans to communicate more with his dad. ``I plan
to post some pictures of his grandchildren, my kids, he never got
to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many postings are from relatives searching for vets who knew
their dads. Some leave phone numbers and e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who lost our fathers in Vietnam are searching,''
says Jen Branch Denard, of Tampa, Fla., who was 2 when her dad was
killed. ``We're growing old enough to begin to ask questions that
we don't have answers to, and realizing we weren't taught about
Vietnam in school....
</P>
<P>
   ``I check my dad's name often to see if more men who knew him
have checked in.''
</P>
<P>
   George Marlow, 50, has spent a lot of time on the site tracking
down aquaintances. ``You just lose track,'' says Marlow, who spent
a year as a grunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the site, city by city. I just found there were
guys who went to (high school) with me who died in 'Nam. I didn't
know Herman Fields was dead till I found the virtual wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighs. ``But I almost don't want to know who didn't make it.
There's still a lot of hurt there.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls felt better after running through many names in his
basic-training book, relieved that most survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, after all these years, now I know,'' says Falls.
</P>
<P>
   He thumbs through his album, checking more names on the
computer. It takes a while, but eventually he learns that at least
a half-dozen others from his basic training unit didn't come back:
Michael Dean Brown, Donnie Lee Hackney, Robert G. Guinn, Jimmy Lee
Castleberry, Carlton Lee Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Then he points at album pictures of men whose names didn't
``hit.'' He still keeps up with some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy Abercrombie, he made it and has a business in Atlanta,''
Falls says. ``There's Davenport. And Danny McFarland. And Ralph
Brown. Larry Everson, a real cut-up. Warren Long. Look here, here's
Mauldin, the only college graduate in my bunch. Wonder if he made
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin's name is punched in.
</P>
<P>
   He did.

ACROSS THE U.S., LAWMAKERS RALLY BEHIND GUN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just as the school shooting in Colorado last month has
spurred Congress to the verge of approving measures like background
checks for gun buyers and safety-lock devices for firearms, many
state legislatures are passing gun-control laws as well, in some
cases taking up measures that had long been considered unlikely
ever to pass.
</P>
<P>
   When the California Assembly gathered late last month to debate
a bill limiting handgun sales to one per person per month, a
measure that had languished in past years, Assemblyman Dick Floyd
rose to speak and the chamber grew hushed. The crusty lawmaker, an
Army sergeant in the Korean War, is known among his colleagues as a
wisecracker, but he was dead serious this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over 20 years around here,'' said Floyd, a 68-year-old
Democrat, ``I never spoke one time on any issue relating to guns.
In fact, I was a nonparticipant. I never voted for one of these
bills.'' But the school killings in Littleton, Colo., he said, had
brought back images of the combat he faced nearly half a century
ago. He described the ``horrible smell'' of it all, and then he had
an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer going to be a nonparticipant,'' Floyd said. ``I
am willing not only to vote for everything, I'll co-author every
gun bill that comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed, and other measures restricting gun ownership
are moving forward in Sacramento, with promises that Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat inaugurated in January, will sign them. And while
Floyd's conversion may have been especially dramatic, it is a
powerful symbol of the changing dynamics of the gun-control debate
in state legislatures since the April 20 massacre at Columbine High
School in Littleton, in which two students killed 12 classmates and
a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control measures moving forward now include an Oregon
plan to require criminal background checks for people buying
firearms at gun shows and a bill that would make New Jersey the
first state to require that within five years all handguns sold
there have ``smart-gun'' features, allowing a gun to be used only
by its registered owner. That bill has been voted out of a Senate
committee.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, lawmakers are supporting a measure that would
allow the police to get a warrant to enter a residence and take the
guns of a person who might injure himself or others.
</P>
<P>
   Just as striking, gun-rights proponents in other states have
pulled back legislation they were hoping to get passed this year.
Perhaps most notably, right after the Littleton shooting, Colorado
lawmakers quickly abandoned their push for new laws to expand the
right to carry concealed weapons and to prevent local governments
from passing gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the sponsor withdrew legislation that would have
pre-empted cities and counties from filing lawsuits against gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think this is like a big volcano that's suddenly
erupted, sort of the Mount St. Helen's of the gun tragedy in
America,'' said Pamela Eakes, the founder and president of Mothers
Against Violence in America, a 5-year-old group based in Seattle
that has 60 chapters around the country. ``Littleton has sparked
something, a permanent response. People are just saying, `Enough,'
and legislators are clearly responding to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gun-control measures in the states include an Illinois
bill, passed by the Legislature late last month and endorsed by
Gov. George Ryan, requiring gun owners to keep their firearms
locked away from children, with a possible prison term for the
owner if a youth uses the adult's gun in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, shaken recently by two highly publicized shootings by
people with mental illness in downtown Salt Lake City, in addition
to the tragedy in neighboring Colorado, the Legislature is
considering a special session to deal with gun-control issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona last month, Gov. Jane Dee Hull, a Republican, vetoed
a bill that would have barred cities and counties from enacting a
range of local gun-control ordinances. And in Ohio, Gov. Bob Taft,
also a Republican, announced just days after the Littleton shooting
that he would oppose a bill allowing the state's citizens to carry
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the relatively few instances since Littleton in which the gun
advocates have scored successes, they have been met with a
blistering counterattack. In Michigan, a battle is raging over
separate measures passed in recent weeks by the two legislative
houses that would make it easier to carry concealed weapons. The
bills need to be reconciled before they can become law.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have already started a campaign to get a statewide
referendum on the ballot that would overturn such a law. This week
they got the Major League Baseball Players Association to issue a
statement condemning the gun measures, saying such laws would let
people take weapons to ballparks and ``would present unwarranted
risks for fans and players.''
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear at this point is whether the shift in the
legislative terrain on gun issues is a lasting one, or simply a
short-term response to the Colorado tragedy whose force will
dissipate in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates and many state lawmakers who support their
cause said in interviews last week that the public outcry was far
more intense than it had been after other school shootings in
recent years, partly because of the number of students killed and
partly because of the cumulative effect of all of the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the gun-control measures, and pro-gun lawmakers
who said they pulled back on their proposals only because of the
political climate and not because of any lack of merit, said most
of the new laws were an emotional fix that would do virtually
nothing to prevent the kind of violence that occurred in Littleton.
And some were particularly adamant that Littleton showed the need
for more guns, not fewer.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, state Rep. Mike Green, a Republican sponsor of the
bill that would make it easier for people to obtain permits to
carry concealed weapons, described the Littleton shooting as a
``sad commentary on people being unable to defend themselves'' and
said that his measure would make schools safer.

</P>
<P>
   ``When we make gun-free zones like we do in the schools, we're
really creating vacuums in those places, where anyone who wants to
do harm knows there's no one there to stop them, other than hitting
them with a stick or throwing a rock at them,'' Green, who is from
Mayville, in central Michigan, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in our schools there ought to be somebody, somewhere
with a gun that could defend these kids, but everybody says, `Oh My
God, we couldn't do that, no guns in the schools.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Littleton school did have an armed sheriff's deputy assigned
to it. He exchanged gunfire briefly with one of the suspects after
the attack began, but was unable to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan measure, which would take discretion on permits
away from county gun boards and basically create a right to carry
concealed weapons as long as an applicant meets a series of
requirements, was part of the campaign platform of many Republicans
who ran for office last fall. The party took control of both
legislative houses in that election.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats said that public sentiment had definitely
shifted against the concept, and they said they were dumbfounded
that Republican party leaders were so intent on getting the measure
approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly beyond me, for all my years in politics, as to
why they are doing this,'' said Gilda Jacobs, a Democratic state
representative from suburban Detroit, who said she and many of her
colleagues had been flooded with calls from angry constituents
about the bills. ``You'd think that, just politically, they would
say this doesn't make any sense to go through with this. Their
timing couldn't be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue represents a dilemma for Gov. John Engler, also a
Republican and a potential vice presidential candidate. He
indicated through a spokesman two weeks ago that he was inclined to
sign the bills, but in recent days he seems to have backed off.
This week he told supporters of the concealed-weapons measure that
now might not be the best time to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could certainly say the timing is open to
misinterpretation,'' he said on Wednesday. ``Some people will play
politics with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green said he hoped the bills would be reconciled soon and
turned into law, so that people could have at least a year to see
that the idea works before he and his colleagues head into the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the setbacks encountered by gun-rights advocates
began well before the Littleton shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 elections, when Republicans took control of
Congress and many state legislatures, those advocates scored some
of their most striking victories, including persuading 10
legislatures to establish or expand the right to carry concealed
weapons. But such efforts have failed in at least eight other
states in the past two years, and many states were already moving
forward this year with restrictive measures.
</P>
<P>
   In California, with Davis' strong support, the Legislature
clearly seemed headed even before April 20 to impose a new ban on
assault weapons and require child safety locks on guns. But the
reaction after the Littleton shooting, including Floyd's emotional
conversion to anti-gun causes, has clearly given new force to that
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen in the past is state legislators have often
responded to the gun lobby'' even if public-opinion polls favored
gun control, said Joe Sudbay, director of state legislation for
Handgun Control, an advocacy group based in Washington. ``What's
changed is that the public is now paying very, very close attention
to what legislators are doing on gun issues. People really do think
there's just far too much access to guns, and their lawmakers are
hearing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-rights groups concede that there has been a public outcry
since Littleton and the recent school shooting in suburban Atlanta,
though they say that many of the gun-curbing proposals offered
since then are misguided efforts to deal with a cultural problem
not caused by guns.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Rifle Association said that despite the
attention focused on the gun-control measures now moving through
Congress and the statehouses, it had achieved success in blocking
many of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   It has defeated one-gun-a-month proposals in Pennsylvania and
Illinois, the group said, and advanced on legislation pre-empting
the rights of cities and counties to file lawsuits against the
firearms industry.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the rifle association said, such measures have
been signed into law in seven states (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,
Georgia, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming), are awaiting a
governor's signature in four states (Maine, Nevada, Texas and
Tennessee) and are pending before legislatures in at least nine
states.

 &HT;    Suit filed against IRL, track
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attorneys representing the estate of a man killed
during an open-wheel automobile race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in
Concord, N.C., filed a lawsuit Friday against the track's owners,
the Indy Racing League and Lowe's president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Mobley, 41, an electrician from Statesville, N.C., and a
native of Albany, was one of three spectators killed at Lowe's on
May 1 when a wheel and other debris flew into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The accident came less than a year after three fans were killed
during a CART race at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to the attorneys in Michigan and we've agreed to
put the whole industry on trial,'' said Robert Beauchamp, an
attorney representing Mobley's three children, who live in Cairo,
Ga. ``Between Michigan and the VisionAire 500, why didn't they do
anything to improve safety? Six people shouldn't have to die to
change something.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports Inc. owns Lowe's and three other tracks
that stage IRL races, including Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that the defendants contributed to the deaths
by allowing Indy cars to race on the high-banked, 1.5-mile oval,
and by failing to erect higher catch fences around the track. Since
the accident, SMI has decided to raise fences to 21 feet from 15
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that SMI and the IRL are negligent for
failing to require the wheels and suspension parts to be tethered
or secured to the car bodies. Officials also said this week that
the IRL would begin to require tethers. The suit also claims that
SMI, the IRL and Wheeler failed to notify fans of the ``potential
lethal risks'' associated with flying debris.

COMCAST PUTS UP $3.75 MILLION FOR CULTUREFINDER.COM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Comcast Corp., a cable giant with diverse holdings
that include stakes in the television and online versions of the
QVC shopping channel and E Entertainment Television, has added a
more highbrow investment to its portfolio: Culturefinder.com.
</P>
<P>
   Culturefinder is a Web site that lists arts events and sells
tickets to exhibits, operas, symphonies, dance and theatrical
performances around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For Julian A. Brodsky, vice chairman of Comcast and chairman of
the six-month-old fund, Comcast Interactive Capital Group, that
announced the $3.75 million investment two weeks ago, the move was
part of his company's effort to ``leverage our involvement with the
Internet and create an investment hedge against the changing
relative values of content, commerce and distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   For Eugene Carr, the founder and chief executive of
Culturefinder.com, the investment by Comcast, which is based in
Philadelphia, represented even more: further validation of a
business that has enabled Carr to combine his entrepreneurial
impulses with a lifelong affinity for the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a cellist who studied at the Juilliard School of Music
while still in high school, earned an MBA at Columbia University.
He was the executive director of the New York-based American
Symphony Orchestra when he started Culturefinder.com in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I perceived that the Internet would be big, and so would
massive sites that collected around specific interests,'' he said
in an interview in Culturefinder's crowded offices, which are
situated, appropriately, near Carnegie Hall. ``I knew that someone
would do an arts site, and I thought it would be an incredible
opportunity to do it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After polling administrators of 50 arts groups to see if they
would support a site that listed their programs, Carr invested
$50,000 of his own to start Culturefinder.com. He also got $300,000
from America Online to participate in its Greenhouse project _ an
effort, since dropped, that backed content providers in their
infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Web publishers, like the Sidewalk operation of
Microsoft Corp., list concerts and other performance arts. And
some, like Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc., sell tickets. But
Culturefinder.com is the only national online directory of arts
events and seller of electronic tickets for more than 2,200
organizations in some 1,300 cities. The institutions, which vary
from the New Century Chamber Orchestra in Mill Valley, Calif., to
the New York Philharmonic, do not pay Culturefinder to be included
in the listings. Instead, much of Culturefinder's revenue comes
from the fees _ ranging from $2 to $4.50 _ it charges for each
ticket sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations like Ticketmaster Online compete with
Culturefinder only on high-profile events,'' said James McQuivey,
senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
``Focusing on art and culture gives Culturefinder an extra market
Ticketmaster is not in.''
</P>
<P>
   In partnerships with the online retailers Amazon.com, CD Now,
Image Exchange and Reel, Culturefinder also peddles compact disks,
arts posters and videos. For patrons who might want to venture far
afield in search of a good scherzo, it has an alliance with
Microsoft's Expedia online travel agency. The site also offers
various articles, program notes and primers about the arts aimed at
its estimated 250,000 different visitors each month, an audience
that surveys indicate is two-thirds female, largely urban, highly
educated and, on average, 36 years old. That gives Culturefinder a
desirable demographic for its online advertisers, the largest of
which is Baldwin Piano and Organ Co.
</P>
<P>
   Carr and his staff of 14 ``bring passion, experience and an
intense focus on arts consumers and arts organizations,'' said
Brodsky, the Comcast executive. ``This, combined with superb
technology and the dramatically quick adoption of e-commerce among
upscale consumers, bodes well for Culturefinder's future.''
</P>
<P>
   To stimulate sales, Culturefinder.com recently reached ticket
sales-referral agreements with three other Web sites: the search
portal Lycos.com, America Online's city guide service
Digitalcity.com, and Ovationtv.com, the site of the arts-oriented
cable television network.
</P>
<P>
   As a privately held company, Culturefinder.com does not report
its financial results. But Carr said he expected revenue this year
of about $1.5 million and a loss that he declined to quantify. He
predicted that the company would become profitable as soon as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that institutions in the United States like those
represented by Culturefinder sell close to $3 billion worth of
tickets annually. But he said those organizations typically sell
only 70 percent of their available tickets _ representing an
opportunity for companies like his to help fill lots of empty
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Besides America Online and Comcast, a number of prominent
individual investors have put a total of $1.75 million in Carr's
venture. They include Arthur Zankel, a partner in First Manhattan,
a New York-based investment advisory firm, and a member of the
board of Carnegie Hall; Robert H. Lessin, whose privately held Wit
Capital Group specializes in Internet-related investments; Thomas
G. Stemberg, chairman and chief executive of Staples Inc.; Stuart
G. Moldaw, chairman of Gymboree, and David Horowitz, former chief
executive and president of MTV Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him money for the American Symphony Orchestra and had a
high opinion of what he accomplished with it,'' Zankel said. ``I
have great admiration for Gene's marketing skills and imagination,
and I haven't been disappointed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   David Kitto, director of marketing and ticket operations for
Carnegie Hall, said Culturefinder could help arts organizations of
all sizes expand their audiences, whether or not the arts groups
have their own Web sites. ``All of us are looking for ways to
connect with the audience,'' Kitto said. ``Culturefinder is not
competing with us; they're providing an alternate means to purchase
tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kitto's view, the biggest challenge Culturefinder now faces
is creating identity and brand awareness. ``They need to work to
become the place arts consumers go to to find out about ticket
availability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Carr wants Culturefinder.com to expand to include
arts listings outside the United States. And to generate new
commission income, he intends to begin offering special tour
packages late this year, like an individually tailored Broadway
weekend in New York with hotel accommodations, theater tickets,
meals and museum admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Internet start-ups at this stage of business,
Culturefinder is not now destined to be sold or to issue stock in
an initial public offering, Carr said, though he does not rule this
out in the longer term. ``We've been very focused on raising the
venture capital round,'' he said, referring to the Comcast
infusion. ``At the appropriate moment, to raise additional funds,
every financing option will be considered _ including an IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, the Comcast money will help Culturefinder promote its
brand more actively, Carr said. ``I'm trying to be Mr. Arts in
cyberspace,'' he added, ``to be front and center so when
opportunities present themselves, I'm first in line.''

   MEDIA WEB UNITS POSITIONED TO RIDE THE INTERNET WAVE
</P>
<P>
   Just as investor enthusiasm seemed to dampen for Internet
stocks, three media companies _ Tribune Co., The New York Times Co.
and the publishing company IDG, with an investment from CNN _ said
they would consolidate their Web businesses into Internet units,
complete with spinoff potential.
</P>
<P>
   How, when and whether these online divisions go public is
uncertain. But the prospect of getting high stock valuations for
such properties is obviously attractive, in part because
high-flying stocks can be used as currency in other deals. And the
reputation of well-known newspapers might help these new units
catch up and compete in an area where they trail broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE START-UP DRAWS INVESTORS
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer and Microsoft have invested in Digital
Entertainment Network, a start-up company developing youth-oriented
television programming for delivery over the Internet, as part of a
$26 million round of venture capital being announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   COMCAST ADDS CULTURE TO PORTFOLIO
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, the cable giant with diverse holdings that include
stakes in the television and online versions of the QVC shopping
channel and E Entertainment Television, has added a more highbrow
investment to its portfolio: Culturefinder.com, a Web site that
lists arts events and sells tickets to exhibits, operas,
symphonies, dance and theatrical performances. For Eugene Carr, the
founder and chief executive of Culturefinder, the $3.75 million
investment is further validation of a business that has enabled him
to combine his entrepreneurial impulses with a lifelong affinity
for the performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANCE SALES STRONG FOR TV ADS
</P>
<P>
   The sale of commercial time by the broadcast television networks
in advance for the fall season is ending on an even stronger note
than optimistic forecasts had predicted. Based on current
estimates, the six broadcast networks will sell $7 billion to $7.2
billion worth of commercial time during the prime-time programs in
the 1999-2000 season, about 9 percent higher than the $6.4 billion
sold ahead of the 1998-99 prime-time season.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKSHOPS COMPETE CREATIVELY
</P>
<P>
   To compete with the giant book-selling chains and Internet
retailers, independent bookstores like Just Books in Greenwich,
Conn., are marketing themselves creatively through events like
speeches by authors at local schools and literary breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD OF DISCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   As e-commerce sites sell goods at a loss to attract customers
and build a brand name, it is no surprise that consumers expect the
Web to be an around-the-clock fire sale. But that sense of consumer
entitlement could come back to haunt companies that rely too
heavily on discount pricing. Analysts and executives say that
unless Web retailers find other sources of revenue, such as
advertising, there is simply no way to sustain a viable business
without building a profit margin into most sales.
</P>
<P>
   HUGHES `BIOGRAPHY' FINALLY IN PRINT
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Irving, who was imprisoned for 17 months in connection
with his creation of a bogus biography of Howard Hughes in 1972, is
selling a newly edited version of that rejected manuscript, now
billed as an ``imaginative biography,'' through a start-up Internet
publisher called Terrificbooks.com. The company, based in Santa Fe,
N.M., sells books directly to customers online.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. MARKETS CLOSED
</P>
<P>
   All financial markets and banks in the United States are closed
Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Most markets overseas,
however, are open.

NATO PLANES HIT MAJOR BRIDGE; CIVILIAN DEATHS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Pa.)  (Eds: See also KOSOVO-BRIDGE) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four NATO warplanes bombed a major bridge in
southern Serbia Sunday, as the alliance seized on clear skies to
intensify daytime bombing raids across Yugoslavia, allied officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said that at least nine people
were killed and 28 wounded in the attack on the bridge in Varvarin,
110 miles south of Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. Four NATO planes
apparently struck the bridge once, and then struck it again.
Reports from the scene said civilians had gathered at the bridge
between the attacks to help others who had been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials said that pilots saw no civilians and that
they could not confirm any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a major line of communication for the Serb army and
was a legitimate military target,'' a NATO official in Brussels,
Belgium, said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the nine-week air war, a NATO fighter-bomber
destroyed a passenger train crossing a bridge when the pilot
spotted the moving train too late to break off the attack. In a
second incident earlier this month, NATO said one of its missiles
accidentally hit a bus in Kosovo but insisted the bridge it was
crossing was a legitimate military target.
</P>
<P>
   These and other bombing mishaps that killed civilians forced
NATO to tighten the rules of engagement for its pilots. ``If
there's any question in the pilots' minds, they won't strike the
bridge,'' the NATO official said. ``They did not see any civilians
when they executed this strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the bridge followed a third consecutive night in
which NATO warplanes took advantage of good weather to fly more
than 300 attack missions. Overnight, allied jets flew 309 bombing
runs against tanks, mortars, anti-aircraft radars and airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon Sunday in Varvarin, four allied fighter-bombers
attacked the bridge, dropping precision-guided bombs in two passes
in a six-minute raid, the NATO official said. According to one
report, the official said, bystanders came onto the bridge after
the first attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no way a guy flying at X-thousand feet, at a
pretty good clip, will be able to pick out individuals or warn
them,'' the NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing attacks on civilian infrastructure, like electric
power grids that operate hospitals and water-pumping stations, as
well as civilian casualties, have prompted some NATO allies like
Italy and Greece to call for a moratorium in the air campaign, as
an incentive for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to meet
NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, on Sunday
strongly opposed that approach. ``I don't think it's either a
bombing pause or diplomacy,'' Clark said on CNN's ``Late Edition.''
``I think it's the opposite. I think it's the bombing that is
impelling the diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark continued, ``Any bombing pause now will give the Serbs a
chance to continue their campaign against some 500,000-plus Kosovar
Albanians that are still inside Kosovo. It will give them a chance
to reconstitute and refit their forces. It will raise the risk to
our NATO pilots when we resume operations over Kosovo. So from a
military perspective it's a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NATO's political body authorized Clark to expand the
bombing to attack telephone networks as a way of bedeviling
Yugoslav military computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NATO's claims that the bombing is wearing down
Milosevic's forces, especially in Kosovo, allied commanders
acknowledged again Sunday that there were no signs of surrender
from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO conceded that the Yugoslav military continues to
repair damaged runways and replace troops and equipment destroyed
by the bombing. A NATO spokesman said Sunday that the 203rd
battalion operating northwest of Nis had replaced some of its
damaged artillery units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the Serb forces are trying to replace the losses,''
Clark said. ``It's not surprising. They are taking a real pounding,
and they are trying to scramble back and keep their forces in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In what he suggested was a sign of Serb desperation, Clark said
that Yugoslav forces had seized houses belonging to ethnic
Albanians, and forced their occupants to live inside the homes with
them as ``live-in human shields.''
</P>
<P>
   As the military campaign moved into its 68th day, hopes for a
diplomatic settlement seemed clouded. The Yugoslav government last
Thursday said it accepted the principles for a settlement issued
two weeks ago by the Group of Seven industrial nations and Russia.
But Western leaders want more concrete evidence that Milosevic is
coming around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wait and see what that means in terms of the
details,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Sunday. ``One could
interpret those conditions in different ways and we want to make
sure that Milosevic interprets those in the way that we interpret
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have left Capitol Hill for a week-long holiday recess,
but the debate over strategy carried on. Attacking civilian
targets, like the power grids, plays into Milosevic's hands, some
legislators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives Milosevic more support, and it begins to undercut our
own moral claim,'' Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said on ``Fox News
Sunday.'' ``I would put my emphasis on diplomacy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers say the air campaign needs to intensify and
run its course. ``The diplomacy is getting nowhere,'' Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., said on the same program. ``The only thing
Milosevic understands is real force.''

INTERACTIVE HOOP DREAMS COME TRUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Card collecting has just jumped into the 21st
Century with a technological achievement from Upper Deck. Now let's
hope those in charge of selling them don't abuse the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   UD has created the PowerDeck 32-megabyte CD-ROM card, an
interactive collectible that for now is limited to seven current
NBA players _ including Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal _ plus
retired stars Michael Jordan and Julius Erving.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, these are upper-deck shots.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the shape. Some first tried CD-ROM cards, using the
5-by-5{ inch large plastic cases that hold, well, a standard
CD-ROM. Then others like Donruss tried to put out a standard-sized
2{-by-3\-inch version that fit into the CD tray but made so much
whizzing noise it wasn't worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   PowerDecks maintain the standard card shape but eliminate the
substandard annoyances. They pop up quickly, even if you need to
install Quicktime software (supplied on the card) for either
Windows or Mac and adjust the screen setting.
</P>
<P>
   On each card are six areas to click on, but the highlight is the
30-second video stream that makes the card come alive. Player bios
and stats are updated only through games of March 29 from the
just-completed abbreviated season, plus there's the player's Upper
Deck catalog to look at and a hyperlink to the Upper Deck Web site
and to NBA.com.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of selling these gems separately, PowerDeck cards are
randomly inserted into Upper Deck's '98-99 Encore Basketball
series, which hit the stores soon and will run about $3 for 10-card
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a positive for the industry,'' Rob Veres, owner
of the nationally respected Burbank Sportscards, said of the card
insertion vs. individual sale. ``The thing that really floors me
about these cards is the fact they fit right into a regular pack of
trading cards and can't be noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   One out of every 47 packs will have a PowerDeck card, which
means in theory it could cost about $150 before you strike paydirt.
Even then, there's no guarantee of the player.
</P>
<P>
   You've also got to keep in mind some less-than-reputable dealers
will pull out the postal scale and try to figure out how much a
regular pack weighs vs. one with the CD-ROM card and possibly pull
them from the sales racks for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when something so neat rejuvenates the hobby, let's
keep some faith it won't be ruined by greed.

NEWSPAPER COMPANIES SETTING UP WEB UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tables were turned at the newspaper publishers' annual
meeting last month: Instead of being grilled by Wall Street
analysts seeking to poke holes in glowing corporate presentations,
the publishers questioned three leading analysts.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the publishers said, you tell us where to find the money for
the Internet investments (which you say will push our stock prices
up) without hurting our quarterly earnings (which you know will
push our stock prices down).
</P>
<P>
   The three analysts offered versions of the same answer: tap into
the irrationally brimming rivers of capital flowing through
Internet land.
</P>
<P>
   But that was last month. Last week there was a lot less water
coursing through those streams. Online media upstarts like
TheStreet.com and Marketwatch.com saw their valuations fall to half
of what they had been at the peaks reached shortly after their
initial public offerings earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And a couple of new Internet offerings, like Juno Online
Services Inc. and Edgar Online Inc. actually saw their stock prices
fall on the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Still, just in time for the sudden dampening of investor
enthusiasm, three media companies have made announcements showing
that they agreed with the analysts' earlier advice. Consolidated
Internet divisions, all with spinoff potential, were rolled out
with full-dress news releases and conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   In military terms, Tribune Co., Time Warner's CNN and The New
York Times Co., have assembled Web troops for basic training.
</P>
<P>
   How, when and whether they will go into online, stand-alone
stock combat is unclear. And, given the current volatile investment
climate, they very likely would not know the size of their
financial arsenal until they are already on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co., owner of The Chicago Tribune newspaper and 17
television stations, moved on May 18 to create Tribune Interactive,
a business unit which combines the Web sites of all of its media
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a focused management strategy,'' explained Jeff R.
Scherb, the chief executive of the new entity. ``And it is focused
much more clearly on building a business that may end up being
independent'' of Tribune Co., he added. The words ``initial public
offering'' were not spoken, but implicitly hovered around the word
``independent.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Martin A. Nisenholtz, president of Times Company
Digital, the new division announced last Monday by The New York
Times Co., stopped well short of such a suggestion. The assets of
Times Company Digital will be its nearly 50 Web sites, which
include The New York Times on the Web (www.nytimes.com), The Boston
Globe's Boston.com and the California-based Winetoday.com.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Nisenholtz said, is to ``reach critical mass'' in the
online world by achieving the maximum possible reach into the 30
percent of American households that have Internet access,
particularly those that would be a natural audience for The New
York Times Co.'s publications. ``This is the first step in
achieving that goal,'' he said. ``Stay tuned for more. We're not
saying we've decided to do an IPO, because we haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Times Co. took a 7.5 percent stake in
TheStreet.com, which translated into $105 million immediately after
the Internet company's stock offering two weeks ago _ but had
eroded to $62.85 million by last Friday, after investors started
winnowing their online portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, some media executives see an opportunity in this moment
of ``dot-com'' disillusionment. Larry Kramer, chief executive of
Marketwatch.com, the online financial news site that is now a CBS
partner, theorized: ``The Internet investor is tired. The Internet
concept is still strong in terms of the multiples, but it's going
to be harder to slap a dot-com on and go public.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``What makes a blue-chip Internet stock has a lot to
do with pedigree. It goes to deep pockets, it goes to the knowledge
base and the talent base you possess. A proven media company should
do a better job in the media business.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Kramer argued, newspaper companies have been slow to invest
in online properties, compared with broadcasters. ``The irony here
is that the newspaper companies have been left in the dust,'' he
said. ``The broadcasters beat them to it. CBS, NBC, ABC, have
substantial Internet holding and have gotten the public to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, with Marketwatch.com and Sportsline.com, NBC, with Snap and
Xoom, among others, and ABC, with ESPN Sportzone, Infoseek and the
Go Network, have all staked their claim to the Web. And, Kramer
said, the broadcasters have been able to make their investments at
least partly in the form of on-air promotions, which can help build
brand-name recognition that helps sites stand out amid the clutter
of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CNN upped its Internet ante by announcing a $50
million deal with IDG, the magazine and book publishing company
that specializes in technology titles like PC World. As a result of
the agreement, IDG's editorial material can be used by CNN-owned
Web sites, IDG will buy advertising on the cable news channel, and
a weekly consumer-technology CNN program will be broadcast this
fall, with both groups contributing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, taking steps along the same path as Tribune Co. and
Times Co., IDG said it would consolidate its 240 Web sites into one
unit _ while CNN agreed to invest about $18 million in the IDG
venture.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of getting high stock valuations for such
properties is obviously attractive, in part because high-flying
stocks themselves can be used as currency in other deals. And at
least one analyst, Lauren Rich Fine, a media analyst with Merrill
Lynch, thinks that the reputation of well-known newspapers is
likely to help them compete.
</P>
<P>
   As she told the publishers in San Diego: ``Look at the three
national brands that exist today _ USA Today.com, Wall Street
Journal.com, New York Times.com _ that have been able to command
traffic levels, revenue levels, something that would be of
interest. You know, in my heart of hearts I really want to see
those entities go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Would investors care? Scherb of Tribune Co. contends that they
might. ``I don't believe the last great business on the Internet
has been created _ that there are no more good ideas, and that
Amazon.com and Ebay.com got it all,'' he said. ``The market's
always going to reward a great growth idea.''

SHATTERING THE CALM OF TRINITY SUNDAY IN IDYLLIC RIVERFRONT TOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: See related KOSOVO-NATO) 
(jw) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VARVARIN, Yugoslavia _ Sunday afternoon began peacefully in this
small Serbian town. Two boys were down by the water's edge fishing.
Sanja Milenkovic, 17, a top mathematics pupil at a Belgrade high
school, was walking home across the bridge. The local Orthodox
priest, Father Milivoje Ciric, was celebrating Trinity Sunday
inside his small white church perched above the river.
</P>
<P>
   It was just before 1 p.m. when NATO planes roared in low to
shatter the calm. It bombed the bridge over the Juznaja Morava
River, a sturdy concrete and steel structure, striking it in the
first run and then returning minutes later to hit it again.
</P>
<P>
   A fisherman standing on the river bank downstream said he
watched in horror as people and cars toppled into the river.
``There were a lot of people and cars on the bridge,'' he said,
refusing to give his name to a Western journalist. ``It was market
day, a few thousand people were here. It was absolute panic. We
were terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   At least nine people were killed and 28 wounded. People who had
gathered earlier for the church service were setting off for home
across the bridge, on foot and in cars, when the bomb hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Milenkovic, the mathematics student, had just crossed the
bridge and was on the far bank just a mile from home when the plane
struck. She was wounded so gravely by shrapnel that she died on the
way to hospital, said Dragoljub Stanojevic, her former teacher and
a friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   After the first strike, people rushed from the nearby market to
help those injured on the bridge. Then the planes came back and
struck again, unleashing two bombs that smashed the sturdy bridge
off its concrete supports and sent lethal shrapnel flying up the
street into the marketplace, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Ciric, the priest, had come out of the chapel when he heard the
first blast and was standing in the courtyard of the church, just
100 yards from the bridge. Shrapnel caught him full in the head,
killing him instantly and injuring another priest, a police officer
said. On the edge of the church compound, one of the trees was
severed by shrapnel too, leaving a raw yellow stump sticking up in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   In all, seven men and two women have been identified so far as
having been killed, all civilians. Townspeople said that, in
addition to Ciric and Ms. Milenkovic, one victim was named a
33-year-old factory worker named Zoran. The chief investigator for
the town said that 30 were injured, 17 critically.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, blood and remains of human flesh marked the road
where some of the victims had died. A blood-covered bicycle was
flung in the grass at the side, a piece of flesh tangled into the
spokes of the back wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Divers stood in their wetsuits beside the edge of the bridge,
where it ended abruptly in front of the broad river. The nearest
section of the bridge had completely been swept away under the
swiftly flowing muddy waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know how many people found a grave in the Morava
river and how many victims there are in the hospital remains to be
seen,'' said Dragan Cavnic, Varvarin's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The fisherman said he feared for the lives of two young boys who
had been fishing close to the bridge. The blast cast up huge waves
of water, and he thought they had been swept away.
</P>
<P>
   One woman's body had been retrieved from the water but it was
not clear how many people had died in the water, the chief
investigator, Janko Milenkovic, said at the morgue. ``We know there
is something down there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight bodies were lying on stretchers in the morgue at the
entrance to the town cemetery. Ciric stood out in his black suit
trousers and city shoes. The other men were in cheap workers'
clothing. Their bodies were mangled horribly. The woman whose body
was found in the river, in her stocking feet, alone appeared calm
in death. Ms. Milenkovic's body was still at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a catastrophe for us,'' said a local police officer
named Dragan. ``We are just a small town. There is nothing around
here but agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until Sunday, Varvarin was something of a beauty spot.
A town of only 4,000 people about 95 miles south of the capital,
Belgrade, it is in an idyllic setting with thick green foliage
flanking the broad river.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are full of bitterness,'' Stanojevic, the teacher at
the local school, said, curling his fist into a ball against his
heart. ``We are not scared. They will never scare us. But this is
making them bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to be a realist. Maybe a bridge is a military
target, but if it is a military target, why did they not bomb it at
night when there are no people? It is well known that Sunday is
market day here and people are lined all along the street down to
the bridge selling things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragan, the police officer, said he suspected that NATO pilots
had aimed at the bridge after they spotted the commotion from
people and cars. ``They flew very low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said that four aircraft attacked the bridge at about 1
p.m., and that it was a legitimate and designated target. The
alliance said it was unable to confirm reports of casualties, but
it has said repeatedly that civilian casualties in airstrikes are
unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time their town had been hit since the bombing
began more than two months ago, the men here said. They were
pessimistic that the bombing would stop soon. ``It does not depend
on us _ if it depended on us it would not have started,''
Stanojevic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this will end soon, but not because we are afraid. We
are just defending our country and we have always supported a
peaceful deal. But Serbs will not accept an ultimatum from NATO _
never.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should make a deal,'' he added, speaking of his leaders
and NATO, ``but not an ultimatum, with humiliation, not like
that.''

   My dearest Eli:
</P>
<P>
   Got your letter the other day. Broad-sided me, actually. Pun
intended.
</P>
<P>
   So, you wanna go halves on this L.A. football thing? Great idea.
Why didn't I think of it?
</P>
<P>
   'Cause I did.
</P>
<P>
   But, ya know, even a self-serving, PR-motivated,
court-of-public-opinion-conscious charlatan like myself figured out
that everyone would see right through a flimsy proposal like yours
_ which somehow got released to the media before I even saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't flatter yourself anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, we could be partners in crime here. We both know L.A. is
about as apathetic for pro ball as you are pathetic in trying to
unite our evil resources. But I've got my own M.O. (which happen to
be my initials, not incidentally). It doesn't include you.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: I have the match, you have the oily rag,
but only one of us is going to get to light a fire under L.A. fans.
Who's gonna get burned?
</P>
<P>
   I've got my pretty watercolor drawing of the Coliseum. I hear
they could use yours in Houston.

you gotta change the formula. If anything, the old lefty Osteen

Carlos Perez (see: Saturday, in Atlanta, vs. Tom Glavine) ....
</P>
<P>
   _For what it's worth: Frisco Examiner columnist Ray Ratto wasted
newsprint the other day lamenting about how the semi-dreadful
Dodgers are no longer worthy of rooting against by Giants fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the Dodgers Giant fans paid for when we grew up
watching baseball,'' Ratto rattled on. ``They need the Dodgers as
big and as bad and as snotty as can be, or if that isn't possible,
they need them to be habitual, even record-shattering losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinda like the Giants ....
</P>
<P>
   _Hey, it's less than a month before ESPN's X-Games are set to go
in San Fran, but city honchos are trying to raise private cash so
taxpayers don't end up bankrolling the made-for-TV event. Go
bungee-jump off the bridge of your choice and think about how
dreadful that would be ....
</P>
<P>
   _And then you've got the Oakland Tribune and Joe Morgan elbowing

`SEA' AND `WIND': DAREDEVIL RACERS AGAINST LIFE-THREATENING OCEANS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men will do the maddest things, and women, too.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they will sail in boat races like the Vendee
Globe, a single-handed regatta through the most dangerous waters in
the world under the most challenging circumstances. As Derek Lundy
sums up the bare facts of the race in his eloquent ``Godforsaken
Sea: Racing the World's Most Dangerous Waters,'' ``27,000 miles,
three and a half to five months alone at sea, chilling casualty
rates, the unrelenting strain of handling 60-foot boats day and
night, the absolute certainty of weather and waves that could
destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailing nonstop and unassisted, competitors in the Vendee Globe
start out from the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne on the Vendee coast
of France, make their way south through the Bay of Biscay and down
the Atlantic Ocean, swinging southeast around the Cape of Good Hope
and farther south into the high latitudes of 40 and 60 degrees, the
formidable Southern Ocean, one of the wildest and most isolated
places on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boats then begin the long dash for Cape Horn, keeping well
south of Australia and New Zealand,'' Lundy explains. ``In effect,
the route is a circumnavigation of Antarctica. But sailors usually
describe it as going `south of the three stormy capes' _ Good Hope,
Leeuwin and Horn. Once around Cape Horn, the boats retrace their
route north through the Atlantic and back to France.''
</P>
<P>
   Using as his model the third Vendee Globe _ which began on Nov.
3, 1996, with 16 competitors (among them two women) and ended on
March 24, 1997, with only six official finishers _ Lundy explores
how and why humans feel drawn to the extreme risks and almost
inevitable disasters that single-handedly sailing the Southern
Ocean entails.
</P>
<P>
   The race provided him plenty of material. Almost from the start
equipment kept breaking down. The battering seas tore away keels,
knocked down masts and tossed up chunks of ice and flotsam that
sheared off rudders and smashed in hulls. The breadth and flatness
of the theoretically best designed boats _ ``ocean-going
surfboards,'' Lundy calls them _ led to their inability to right
themselves when knocked over by killer waves. As a result, three
boats capsized and stayed upside-down in the Southern Ocean,
exposing the skippers to deadly conditions until rescued. (One
racer was so nearly frozen that when his finger was chopped off by
a closing hatch, he scarcely noticed the pain.)
</P>
<P>
   Out of these incidents, Lundy not only makes stirring narrative
drama but also draws the lineaments of an archetypal hero, a human
driven by fear, addicted to adrenaline, in need of the edge.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback to the story is that Lundy, a lawyer, writer
and amateur sailor, views events from afar, depending on pre- and
post-race interviews, reports on the Internet and his own sailing
experience to piece the narrative together. A result is that the
action seems relatively remote, the exhilaration of the race is
missing, and it is hard to keep the various participants straight.
</P>
<P>
   These shortcomings seem all the more apparent in ``Close to the
Wind,'' by Pete Goss, who was one of two Englishmen to compete in
the '96-'97 Vendee Globe and who figured in one of the central
incidents recounted in Lundy's book.
</P>
<P>
   In a relaxed, colloquial style Goss describes how he fell in
love with sailing; how he raised money and helped to build the Aqua
Quorum, which because of limited funds had to be only 50 feet long,
or 10 feet shorter than the rest of the boats, and how he at last
found himself in the thick of battle. You are there; you feel the
excitement and dread.
</P>
<P>
   Then, planing along in the stormy Southern Ocean, he received a
Mayday call from a stricken fellow racer, Raphael Dinelli. He was
asked by race directors to go to the rescue; he turned back and
against all odds he beat his way to Dinelli's sinking craft and
pulled the near-dead man aboard in the nick of time. After reviving
Dinelli and delivering him to Hobart, Tasmania, he got back into
the race, only to suffer an infected elbow that pained him so
severely that he eventually had to cut it open and drain it,
following the faxed instructions of a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Goss' tale is everything Lundy's is not: tense, fast-moving and
illustrated with color photographs that put you in the middle of
the action. Yet the grandeur that Lundy conveys is somehow missing.
While Goss is capable of deep emotion, like the depression and
frustration he felt when he realized he would not compete with the
race's leaders, his attitude toward his own heroism is
matter-of-fact. This may hint at an answer to Lundy's question
about what forms such heroes: the attributes are simply built into
some people.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why these two books should be read consecutively,
Lundy's for its overview, Goss' for its close-ups. Together they
make more comprehensible why some people fling themselves into the
jaws of death. Together they offer a taste of the experience, while
permitting you throughout to stay warm and dry.

ADVERTISERS SPEND EAGERLY FOR TV TIME IN FALL SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sale of commercial time by the broadcast television networks
in advance for the fall season, known as the up-front market, is
ending on an even stronger note this year than the optimistic
forecasts in recent weeks had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is even more demand than we had expected,'' said Jamie
Kellner, president of the WB Network in Burbank, Calif., which is
owned by Time Warner Inc. and Tribune Co. ``We were in a position
to increase rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on current estimates, the six broadcast networks will sell
$7 billion to $7.2 billion worth of commercial time during the
prime-time programs in the 1999-2000 season. Though negotiations
are not entirely wrapped up _ some dickering is to continue this
week and into June _ the estimates are about 9 percent higher than
the approximately $6.4 billion worth of commercial time sold ahead
of the 1998-99 prime-time season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was amazing speed and earliness'' to the demand, said
Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media newsletter, who
tracks the annual performance of the up-front market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day parts were pretty strong, too,'' he added,
referring to sales of commercial time during morning, news and
late-night programs. ``It all speaks to the underlying strength of
the media economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The robust results came despite continued declines in ratings
for most of the prime-time programs on the broadcast networks
during the 1998-99 season, which ended last week. But even as
viewership continues to erode, those six networks _ ABC, CBS, Fox
Broadcasting Co., NBC, UPN and the WB _ still offer marketers the
chance to pitch products before large audiences.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the networks focusing their programs on the younger
consumers most coveted by advertisers performed particularly well.
WB, for example, which seeks viewers ages 12 to 34, sold about $450
million worth of commercial time in the up-front market, compared
with $300 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone looking for young eyeballs was showing up,'' Kellner
said. ``There were a lot of new advertisers, and then incumbent
advertisers were asking for more inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the unit of News Corp. that aims its programs at viewers
ranging in age from 18 to 34 and 18 to 49, sold more than $1.3
billion worth of commercial time, compared with about $1.15 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Demand was consistent among advertisers for many categories of
goods and services, Mandese said, with retail and
telecommunications advertisers especially eager to make
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and so-called dot.com marketers were ``not a big factor
so far,'' he added, but should be later, when the networks sell
commercial time during the season in what is called the scatter
market.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for broadcast commercial time augurs well for the
cable networks, which conduct their up-front market after that of
their broadcast counterparts. Ratings for many cable programs rose
during the 1998-99 season as viewers sought alternatives to
broadcast fare.

 &HT;    Spoleto brings `Mamba' home to Charleston after 60 years
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Well before William Faulkner and Carson
McCullers, DuBose Heyward (1885-1940) broke the color barrier of
Southern fiction. Though a descendent of Carolina rice planters, he
was able to put Southern white privilege aside in two novels that
explore, without a trace of condescension, the lives of poor blacks
whose labor supports the illusions of this elegant city.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Porgy'' (1925), which became the American folk opera
``Porgy and Bess.'' The other is ``Mamba's Daughters''(1929), about
the entwined black and white Wentworth family.
</P>
<P>
   The stage drama, adapted for theater by Heyward and his
playwright wife, Dorothy, made a household name of Ethel Waters
when it played on Broadway in 1939. But it took ``Mamba's
Daughters'' 60 years to come home to Charleston, where it is being
performed as a headline event of the 1999 Spoleto Festival.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be here at all if not for Target Margin Theater, an
8-year-old New York company that specializes in ``neglected works
of literary and historic significance.'' It is Target Margins' Obie
Award-winning 1998 production that plays through June 13th at the
Dock Street Theater, a beautiful, intimate house more than a
century old _ and therefore off-limits to black audiences for most
of its life _ in the downtown historic district. There is nice
irony in that.
</P>
<P>
   In rethinking the novel for the stage, the Heywards focused
almost wholly on the black Wentworths; three generations of gutsy
women led by Mamba, (the first syllable is pronounced `ma'am'). She
has only one daughter, the ``big slow brute'' Hagar, a laundress.
But she becomes mother to Hagar's child, the angelic Lissa, when
Hagar is sentenced to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Director David Herskovits wants his production to live in two
worlds; Charleston of the '20s and contemporary America, with its
primal burden as a country built on slave labor. So ``Mamba'' is
set on a stage of Southern screen doors, where a fly drones lazily
across the testimony in a judge's chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the costumes mix lowcountry (as Charlestonians spell it)
cotton and '90s sass. Grown-up Lissa carries one of those
itty-bitty backpacks over a filmy white slip dress, and we can see
why Hagar, in her shapeless ``bes' dress'' marvels at the swan she
has hatched.
</P>
<P>
   All the costumes have a strip of adhesive fabric across the
shoulder blades, exactly where the stenciled name and ID number on
a prison work shirt would go _ symbolizing, I think, the
imprisoning social system in which all the characters play out
their roles.
</P>
<P>
   And all the actors have a dab of blue paint on one earlobe and
under the lips. This color, called ``haint blue'' among the Gullah,
is used as a protective device; for Mamba and her daughters, it
marks the safe passage of song and story from one generation to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the title, this play is clearly the story of Hagar _ the
role Waters played in 1939. Heather Gillespie, who won an Obie for
her Hagar, is elfin-slim, so the production coarsens her with
platform shoes, ugly clothes and braids tied with twine. She towers
above everyone, a hulk of a woman. There is a suggestion, too, that
Hagar is simple-minded; but her words, child-like and guileless,
become a poetry of direct passion; a determined woman, a protective
mother, an avenging spirt.
</P>
<P>
   Besides this indelible earth woman, Melody Cooper's Mamba barely
registers and the Lissa of Billie James is best forgotten. The rest
of the company, thought, is a Greek chorus of quirky individuals,
from a feisty grandmother to a sleazy pimp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamba's Daughters'' feels like a dramatized novel and not
really a play. It meanders more than it strides, and despite
extensive cutting, it feels long. But the woman whom I overheard
call it ``a loser'' is selling it short. Hagar is an incandescent
character _ all the more so because she was created by a white man
looking from the outside on a culture he realized he could never
really know.

 &HT;    Spoleto brings `Mamba' home to Charleston after 60 years
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Well before William Faulkner and Carson
McCullers, DuBose Heyward (1885-1940) broke the color barrier of
Southern fiction. Though a descendent of Carolina rice planters, he
was able to put Southern white privilege aside in two novels that
explore, without a trace of condescension, the lives of poor blacks
whose labor supports the illusions of this elegant city.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Porgy'' (1925), which became the American folk opera
``Porgy and Bess.'' The other is ``Mamba's Daughters''(1929), about
the entwined black and white Wentworth family.
</P>
<P>
   The stage drama, adapted for theater by Heyward and his
playwright wife, Dorothy, made a household name of Ethel Waters
when it played on Broadway in 1939. But it took ``Mamba's
Daughters'' 60 years to come home to Charleston, where it is being
performed as a headline event of the 1999 Spoleto Festival.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be here at all if not for Target Margin Theater, an
8-year-old New York company that specializes in ``neglected works
of literary and historic significance.'' It is Target Margins' Obie
Award-winning 1998 production that plays through June 13th at the
Dock Street Theater, a beautiful, intimate house more than a
century old _ and therefore off-limits to black audiences for most
of its life _ in the downtown historic district. There is nice
irony in that.
</P>

   In rethinking the novel for the stage, the Heywards focused

STRUGGLING FOR DOMINANCE, DENVER'S 2 DAILIES KEEP READERS IN MIND
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DENVER _ In the frenzied first hours of the Columbine High
School shootings last month, an editor of The Denver Rocky Mountain
News slipped away from the fray and called newspapers in towns that
had endured similar events: Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their readers had wanted newspapers to show the importance of
the people who were killed and injured _ the killers were the
aberration,'' recalled John Temple, The News' top editor. Flipping
through back issues from that maelstrom, he said: ``So that's how
we did it in our pages _ the victims first, then the suspects. Not
the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   At The Denver Post, the editor, Dennis A. Britton, reflected,
``We were able to deal with 13 grieving families, and the families
of the wounded, without getting anything substantially wrong or
them angry at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many in the national news media took a hit-and-run
approach to Columbine, the two newspapers here knew that showing
insensitivity to a wounded community could be a costly misstep in a
fiercely contested newspaper war, possibly the toughest in the
country these days.
</P>
<P>
   Fought with street vendors hawking extra editions, two-year
subscriptions going for a penny a paper and advertising discounts
that produce some of the world's fattest newspapers, the flagship
papers of two big newspaper empires are locked in combat here.
While most American cities are one-newspaper towns, Denver has a
war that pits The Post, a broadsheet owned by Media News Group, the
nation's seventh-largest newspaper chain, against The News, a
tabloid owned by E.W. Scripps Co., the eighth-largest chain.
</P>
<P>
   While newspaper circulation stagnates around the nation, trucks
in Denver deliver 360,000 more newspapers each week than they did
at this time last year. Based on a 10.4 percent year-over-year
circulation jump for the first quarter, The News now describes
itself as ``the fastest-growing major daily newspaper in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekday circulation race is a virtual dead heat, with The
News reporting 359,068, and the Post reporting 370,423. In the
Sunday race, The Post has a wider margin, selling 523,324, compared
with 461,000 for The News.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reversing eight years of circulation declines,
The News is also creating the editorial buzz in town. Repositioning
itself as an upscale tabloid, it is generously using color,
publishing new sections and showing that it can turn on a dime to
respond to breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we asked focus groups to compare our newspaper to a
car, and they said we were a pickup,'' said Linda Sease, The News'
vice president for marketing. ``Two years later, they said, `a
sports utility vehicle.' Hey, I'll be an SUV any day _ they are
hip, trendy, young, expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   For a paper that did not have a separate business section four
years ago, The News now wins praise for its Sunday section, Wall
Street West. Dean Rotbart, the editor here of TJFR, a national
newsletter critiquing business reporting, said, ``A lot of
companies here have told me that the Rocky does a better job with
its business coverage than The Post does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's counterattack has been to open nine bureaus around
the state, giving Denver readers news from areas they love to visit
when off work. But after seven changes of editors in 14 years, The
Post has been hurt by low newsroom morale. The leadership of
Britton, the current editor, has produced such unhappiness that
dissidents maintain a ``Dennis Britton Go Home!'' Web page. Britton
said, ``It has been pretty hurtful.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood began soon after Britton took over three years
ago, when he encouraged the departure of about 30 experienced
reporters and editors. Many reporters called his style abrasive.
``The inmates were running the asylum,'' he said. ``I am not
namby-pamby. I believe in discipline. I believe in order.''
</P>
<P>
   But, although The Post has almost 20 percent more reporters than
The News, it seems to have lost its journalistic edge, at least by
one measure. Recently, the Colorado chapter of the Society of
Professional Journalists announced that The News had won 47 awards,
including 19 first-place awards. In contrast, The Post won six,
including one first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awards don't mean much,'' said William Dean Singleton, who is
president of Media News and chairman of The Post. ``We are playing
to our readers, not to our peers.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Columbine coverage, both papers occasionally tripped.
On April 24, The News printed an Internet ``message from the
grave,'' purportedly written by Eric Harris, one of the killers.
The note threatened new violence for April 26. The next day, a
police spokesman called the note a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Though Post editors shied away from the Internet message, one of
their front-page headlines that day said, ``Investigators Close In
on 3rd Suspect.'' Five weeks later, no one has been arrested for
helping Harris and Dylan Klebold plot and carry out the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Both papers say they make a profit. But Singleton's Media News
is privately held, and he is parsimonious with details. Scripps Co.
declines to give after-tax earnings for individual papers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, analysts got a peek into Post finances when
one of the paper's investors, Media General Inc., filed a report
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Comparing the first
quarter of this year with the corresponding period last year,
earnings from Media General's investment in The Post ``decreased
from income of $616,000 to a loss of $514,000 in the first quarter
of 1999.'' A few days later, the company announced plans to sell
its stock in Denver Newspapers Inc., The Post's parent company, to
Media News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been trying to buy them out for a long time,''
Singleton said. With the purchase, he said, his company's ownership
of The Post will rise to 80 percent from 60 percent, allowing him
to cut administrative costs. He said he was investing heavily in
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The News also benefits from big investments by Scripps, which is
based in Cincinnati. Scripps owns six papers in Denver's northern
suburbs: The Boulder Daily Camera and five weeklies. In a
circulation strategy, The News has dropped expensive statewide
delivery and concentrated on Denver and five surrounding counties,
home to 56 percent of the state's population and 60 percent of its
retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of expansion, there may be room for two newspapers.
Over the last decade, the population of greater Denver has
ballooned by almost one-quarter, hitting 2.3 million people today.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Dubroff, editor of The Denver Business Journal, notes
that in the last six months, the four largest companies with
headquarters in Colorado have merged with outside companies.
Dubroff, a Post veteran, said, ``There is nothing to prevent
Scripps and Media News from going into the proverbial smoke-filled
room and coming out with a single company, the Denver Post-News.''

monotone-voiced representatives, Muzak and interminable time on

products and billing, seek links to related sites and provide a
personal profile for future orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an epiphany while waiting for someone on Dell's site to
help me configure a PC,'' said Robert LoCascio, president and CEO
of LivePerson.com in New York. ``If you can buy goods instantly
online, why not be able to talk to the same company instantly?''
</P>
<P>
   LoCascio, whose company is expected to receive financial backing

that the hands-on approach will jolt not only e-commerce sales, but
reduce telephone charges for online merchants.

 &UR; ALL IN THE FAMILY &LR; : ``The Dickers'' sounds like it could be a TV
dramedy. Driven father strikes it rich in the cutthroat business
world. Equally ambitious son duplicates his success straight out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday, a Hollywood producer will fashion a script based
on the real-life exploits of Tom and Russell Dicker, the father-son
tandem that may be the Net's first multigeneration success story.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet saga is all true. Its story line is developing
into a high-tech version of ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom, who will only admit that he is ``north of 50,'' last week
ended a furious five-year run at Netscape Communications as senior
director of the professional services group. He joined the Internet
pioneer in fall 1994, when it was called Mosaic Communications.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest son, Russell, 23, is a software-development engineer
at Amazon.com. He joined the online retailer in July 1998, shortly
after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Today, both are millionaires, based on ``dot com'' stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Dicker grew up in Palo Alto, where he attended high
school with one of William Hewlett's sons. ``Growing up with HP and
Intel around you, you can't avoid getting into it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tech bug bit Dicker  &LR; pere,  &LR; who was an executive at Grid
Systems and NeXT Computer before joining Netscape. ``I lived and
breathed this stuff at home,'' he said. ``The boys couldn't avoid
it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Youngest son, George, 18, recently was accepted at Stanford
University, where he will major in computer science.)
</P>
<P>
   Russell remembers banging away at personal computers ``shortly
after I started walking.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``My dad would bring Grid PCs from work, and I would play
football games on them. When I wasn't doing that, I would go to
work with him on weekends,'' he said. &UR;  &LR; As a teenager, the younger
Dicker met Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and former StarWave
President Mike Slade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite being raised in the heart of Silicon Valley, Russell
said, ``There was no active pressure on me to do this; I was just
always interested in computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom, meanwhile, is taking a rest after ``going full blast'' for
five years at Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to recharge the batteries and enjoy things before
joining another startup _ probably next year,'' the elder Dicker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a possibility that the startup might include other
members of the Dicker clan?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opportunity were right, sure,'' Russell said, before
hastily adding, ``Although my dad is pretty busy helping friends
with some early stage companies.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AT BAY &LR; : Customers of eBay's popular online auction service may
have noticed a change in the bidding format this month.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, users entered their bid, screen name and password
all on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, only bids are registered on one page. Screen names
and passwords are logged on a separate page to eliminate password
theft.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose company tightened security after a Canadian user
warned that sellers theoretically could trace the bids of
individuals to their accounts and steal passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Kevin Pursglove said no password pilfering was
reported but that eBay decided to take no chances.

A distant cousin to the New Beetle's color-coordinated vase, iVase
costs $8.95, plus $3 for shipping and handling.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; A NOVEL IDEA &LR; : Longtime Chronicle staffer Leslie Guttman took a
novel approach with her first book, ``Message Pending''
( &LR; www.messagepending.com &LR; ), a love story told through exchanges of
e-mail. It's part of a rapidly growing trend: Novels published
entirely online.
</P>
<P>
   Likened by readers to an online version of ``Tales of the
City,'' it's about the ``power and intimacy of e-mail, the problem
of pesticides, and the blanderization of media,'' according to
Guttman.
</P>
<P>
   It also is for a good cause. Half of the net proceeds from the
$14.95 novel go to the nonprofit Pesticide Action Network
( &LR; www.panna.org &LR;   &LR; /panna &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WHAT'S IN A NAME &LR; ?: At least one Internet expert isn't thrilled
with the choice of ExciteAtHome as the newly minted moniker for the
merged AtHome and Excite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yech! Sounds like an online vendor of marital aids (or
variously, aids for lonely hearts),'' David Simons, managing
director at New York-based Digital Video Investments, said in an
e-mail message. ``I'll stop at the double entendre of `buzz' and

 HP to Sell Printers, PCs Direct Via Web  &HT;       
 By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In another move to catch up with the Internet wave, Hewlett-Packard
soon will begin selling personal computers and printers directly to
business customers via the World Wide Web.
<P>
   The new distribution scheme is the latest in a flurry of recent
changes at the Palo Alto company, which is trying to boost its
growth rate and shed its reputation as a slow-moving behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   In March, HP announced plans to spin off its measurement
business and seek a new leader to replace chief executive Lew
Platt, who plans to retire. Last month, it proclaimed an updated
corporate vision, focused on providing hardware and software for a
new generation of sophisticated ``e-services.''
</P>
<P>
   The new online selling site, to be called the HP Business Store,
will be announced tomorrow and is scheduled to open for business
June 8. It will carry the company's complete line of business
desktop and notebook PCs, its popular LaserJet and OfficeJet
printers and other products such as scanners, CD-ROM drives and
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, HP announced a separate plan to expand online
sales of products geared to home users.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at the new business store, according to HP officials,
generally will match retail ``street prices,'' which typically are
well below list prices.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Zitzner, president and chief executive of HP's Computer
Products group, predicted that ``more than a third'' of HP's PC
sales will be transacted electronically within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy will put HP into head-to-head competition with
younger companies such as Dell and Gateway, which have grabbed
market share by focusing exclusively on direct sales to customers
by phone and over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   HP said it hopes to win over customers in part by making it
easier to order equipment from its Web site than from competitors'
sites. Among the innovations it's promising are easy access to
information about availability, and instant price updates when
customers change the configuration of products they're ordering.
Most online stores currently require users to click on a button to
see a new price when they specify extra memory or a higher-capacity
hard drive, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most of HP's sales have been indirect, through retail
outlets and ``value-added resellers'' that provide hardware and
services to businesses. By cutting out the middleman, the
direct-business model helps manufacturers keep prices low and their
own margins high.
</P>
<P>
   Several other computer-makers, notably Compaq, have stumbled
badly when they tried to combine the direct and indirect models.
The risk is that the manufacturer will alienate its dealers by
undermining their prices and stealing away their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Zitzner said he's confident that HP won't experience the same
problems Compaq has. ``We don't intend to undersell our
resellers,'' he said. The new Web site, he said, simply will give
customers more choices about how they want to buy HP products.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kim Tchang, an HP sales and marketing exec who
focuses on small-business customers, the online store is aimed
mainly at ``buy now'' customers, who generally purchase in low
volumes, know in advance what they want and demand fast answers and
immediate fulfillment. It's hard for dealers to make money off such
customers anyway, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Spang, an analyst at Technology Business Research in
Hampton, N.H., said she thinks that HP may have better luck with
its new hybrid distribution approach than Compaq has had. ``One of
the things HP has always been good at is keeping its dealers well
informed and up to date,'' she said. ``As long as they're up front
about what they're doing and dealers understand what role they
still have, I think it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   HP expects, according to Tchang, that only about 15 percent of
its small-business customers will fall into the ``buy now''
category. The other 85 percent need the kind of consulting and
support that local dealers can provide, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site will include features to help customers locate
nearby dealers, plus case studies and other information about the
services they offer.
</P>
<P>
   By providing an array of tools and tips on the site, HP aims to
encourage ``e-intimacy'' between the company and its customers,
Tchang said.
</P>
<P>
   HP also will announce that it's beefing up support for large
corporate customers who contract to have HP meet all their
computing needs. One feature of the new program, called HP Prime,
will be Web sites customized specifically for such customers. That
concept was pioneered by Dell, which has used it to strengthen its
position in the corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has reacted favorably to HP's recent initiatives.
Its stock, which closed on Friday at $94.31, has more than doubled
since October.

 Column: Biochip Might Hasten Rip Van Winkle Pace for
Drug  Approval  By Tom Abate  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Investors rap biotech because it takes a decade to produce a hit
drug whereas the computer world can churn out two or three new
industries in the same amount of time.
<P>
   But at a small biotech conclave last week in Napa, I got a
glimpse of what might happen as biological advances in DNA
screening get mated to the rapid product-improvement cycles of
silicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if you could do a person's genetic sequence in as much
time as it takes to scan a grocery item,'' posited Mitch Eggers,
chief executive of Genometrix Inc. in Woodlands, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Genometrix is one of an emerging class of firms that produce
biochips, sometimes called labs-on-a-chip. Several similar firms
shared the biochip stage at last week's conference in Napa. They
include Aclara BioSciences Inc. of Hayward, Caliper Technologies
Corp. of Mountain View and Orchid Biocomputer of Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers explained what all these firms aspire to do: miniaturize
the electrochemical tests that extract the genetic code from DNA.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, DNA tests were exotic. Now, we can do them on
PC-sized devices. Eggers and his ilk are trying to pack these tests
onto chips. They already have working chips with canals the
diameter of a human hair. Inside, fluid samples flow past
electrochemical charges that decode the DNA as it passes.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers suggested that biochips could improve at the rate
predicted by Moore's Law, which states that silicon chips double in
power every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the most powerful biotech tools are focused on getting
one complete readout of the human genome. It still remains just
beyond our grasp. But what will happen in a decade or two when the
power to do walk-by genetic scans can be packed into a Palm Pilot,
Eggers asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of what to do with this information will be facing
us in the next generation,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the investors who dominated the audience at Napa
probably were more interested in what biochips can do in the next
few quarters. But even if these firms still are in the red-ink, R&AMP;D
phase, at least biochip-makers don't face the safety concerns that
put drug-discovery companies on a Rip Van Winkle time line.
</P>
<P>
   Other devices caught my eye in Napa. Russell Kerschmann and Paul
Gotcher of Advanced Pathology Systems in San Francisco were there
to talk about a new system for producing microscopic, 3-D images of
tissue samples. So what, you say.
</P>
<P>
   But think about how doctors do biopsies for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they extract a sliver of suspect tissue. A lab worker
cuts a few slices from the biopsy and mounts each slice on a slide.
The doctor examines the slides under a microscope. This examination
may reveal the telltale signs of cancer, or perhaps the lab worker
missed the slice with the first sign of cancer. Kerschmann thinks
that he's invented a better way.
</P>
<P>
   His automated system cuts razor-thin slices of the biopsy
sample, like a butcher slices bologna. A digital camera takes a
high-resolution image of each slice. When the slicing-imaging
process is done, the system reassembles the images, allowing the
viewer to see detailed, 3-D images of the entire bologna _ I mean,
biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Kerschmann, who has been supporting his tiny company on research
grants, thinks that the 3-D system will provide better diagnosis
than any 2-D slide. ``We're going to obsolete the microscope,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; NOSE FOR BUSINESS: &LR;  Steven Sunshine of Cyrano Services in Pasadena
was getting attention for his company's electronic nose. The device
detects the minute electrical changes that result when different
types of gas vapors hit a special polymer inside the sniffer unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine said the device will be aimed at all the jobs no boss
could pay your nose enough to do _ such as sniffing chemical
tankers at a rail yard to make sure they're carrying the right
load.
</P>
<P>
   Among other potential tasks, Sunshine suggested that the e-nose
might be handy to detect the ovulation cycles of cows. Now, I
thought bulls would have it pretty well figured out by now when
it's snorting-and-pawing season.
</P>
<P>
   But in case they have lost the knack, the species isn't doomed.
Sunshine said that later this year, Hewlett-Packard Co. will help
Cyrano come out with a handheld, industrial e-nose.
</P>
<P>
   Can't wait till that gets into Radio Shack!
</P>

 New Test Can Sniff Out Viral Infection in Blood Donations  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
With 14 million pints of blood collected from U.S. donors each
year, screening out blood-borne diseases is a daunting task. Each
pint is tested within 24 hours for HIV and other viruses.
<P>
   Right now, the tests theoretically miss just 1.5 HIV and 10
hepatitis C viruses in every million pints, but safety regulators
say that isn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   In response, U.S. blood banks launched a new genetic test this
spring that promises to make the slim odds of infection even
slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   This new technique, called nucleic acid testing, or NAT, is
supposed to be sensitive enough to detect the earliest traces of
HIV or hepatitis C viruses that can slip through current blood
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Although current tests already have made infection from donated
blood exceedingly rare, NAT could reduce the risk 80 to 90 percent
for hepatitis and somewhat less for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new test is a dramatic improvement in the safety of the
blood supply,'' says professor Pearl Toy, who heads the blood bank
at the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But some experts have questioned whether the cost of the new
test _ it could add 5 percent to the overall cost of a pint of
blood _ is worth the slim improvement in safety margins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Jim AuBuchon, a pathology professor at Dartmouth Medical
Center in New Hampshire, says NAT should reduce the statistical
probability of transfusion-caused HIV from 24 cases a year at
present to 16 &LR;   &LR; a year. But he notes that there hasn't been a
single real case of HIV-infected blood reported in five years _
which makes him wonder whether there actually would be an increased
safety margin for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the least cost-effective medical procedure I have ever
seen,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But with safety regulators requiring NAT tests by July 1, it
seems that cost may be no object when it comes to the public's
perception of the safety of the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``To add a new technology that might increase the cost by
several percent might be regarded as onerous by the blood banks
that operate on a slim cash flow,'' says Rajen Dalal, president of
the blood test division at Chiron Corp. in Emeryville. ``But I, for
one, find it hard to say that is too high a price for the societal
good.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Chiron is one of two Bay Area corporations vying for the
potential $200 million business of selling the equipment and
chemicals to do NAT tests. Its rival is Roche Molecular Systems in
Pleasanton.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies already are players in the huge, global business
of testing or manufacturing blood products _ most importantly, the
clear liquid component of blood called plasma, which accounted for
$5 billion in medical byproducts last year.
</P>
<P>
   The safety push is coming from European regulators, who issued
the July 1 deadline. ``About 80 percent of the plasma collected by
the American Red Cross or independent blood banks is made into
products, and many of these products are sold in Europe,'' said Jim
MacPherson, executive director of America's Blood Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is the trade association of independent blood banks, which
collect half the nation's blood supply. The Red Cross collects most
of the rest. Because any viral infection in donated blood
potentially could get into the plasma-manufacturing pipeline,
protecting the purity of this clear liquid is a global priority.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has supported the European initiative by allowing Roche
and Chiron to install NAT systems in blood testing and production
facilities. These NAT systems are running in experimental mode, but
all parties expect the FDA to approve the commercial use of NAT
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The blood-safety push on both sides of the Atlantic results from
lessons learned during the early 1980s, when less-sophisticated
tests, designed mainly to detect syphilis, allowed HIV and new
strains of hepatitis to infiltrate the world blood supply and
infect thousands of people who received transfusions or plasma
byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way in terms of blood safety since then,''
said Mike Fulwider, spokesman for the American Red Cross. ``The
very sophisticated tests we see today all ensued after the AIDS
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The first HIV blood test went into effect in the mid 1980s.
Since then, blood banks have added other tests. Today, each donated
pint of blood is given seven tests to look for HIV or other
blood-born viruses. Any pint that tests positive is withdrawn
before it can pollute the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Each pint must be screened within a day or two at most, lest
short-lived blood components like platelets _ which are good only
for five days _ get wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Although current tests seem to have virtually eliminated
blood-borne HIV infections, they have proven less effective at
detecting hepatitis. MacPherson, the ABC executive, explained the
shortcomings in current tests and how NAT should increase blood
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Current tests mainly look for the antibodies that our immune
systems produce to fight off viruses. But there is a lag between
infection and immune response. The time varies for each disease.
For hepatitis, it can be more than 45 days. If a person donates
blood during the lag time before antibodies are present, current
tests won't find the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Blood banks, which will continue doing the seven current tests
indefinitely, will add NAT as an eighth check for hepatitis C and
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   NAT involves two basic steps, MacPherson explained. First, NAT
employs genetic techniques to find any viral particles in the
sample and to replicate them millions of times over. At that point,
standard chemical tests can detect any infection that might be
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antibody test can't detect hepatitis C until about 45 days
after infection,'' says Dartmouth's AuBuchon. ``With NAT, we can
cut that down to 25 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortening this blind spot should mean that instead of the 160
hepatitis C infections a year, we might expect to slip through
current tests, we're more likely to see just 32 misses per year in
the United States, AuBuchon says.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roche and Chiron both use a two-step technique _
replication then testing _ their NAT technologies differ, according
to Mike Busch, research director at Blood Centers of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Roche uses a replication technique called polymerase chain
reaction to grow the tiny viral particles. During PCR, a sample
must be heated and cooled 35 to 40 times, a process that is
cumbersome and time-consuming compared with Chiron's replication
technology, Busch said. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chiron's NAT grows viruses using a process called transcription
mediated amplification, which operates at a constant temperature
and grows viral samples more quickly, Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron didn't develop TMA, but licensed the technique from San
Diego's Gen-Probe Inc., its partner in the battle to conquer the
NAT niche. Douglas Lind, a Morgan Stanley analyst who follows the
testing market, thinks Chiron and Gen-Probe have the only NAT
system fast enough to process the 40,000 donations that flow
through blood banks each day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a speed advantage, Lind believes that Chiron
eventually will beat Roche in their patent wars.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron, which discovered hepatitis C in 1987, has used its
patents on the virus to control the sale of tests for the bug. But
Roche has been selling tests for hepatitis C in defiance of
Chiron's patents. Roche argues that it purchased the technology to
do hepatitis C tests in 1991, when it bought certain patent rights
from Cetus, a now-defunct biotech firm.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron bought the rest of Cetus at the same time, and ever
since, Roche and Chiron have been fighting in court over who got
what from Cetus' carcass. Lawyers for the two firms actually
sparred over this patent issue Friday before Oakland Federal Judge
Claudia Wilken.
</P>
<P>
   Lind considers the hepatitis C test the most important function
for NAT test. He thinks the courts eventually will stop Roche from
selling NAT systems that screen for hepatitis C, leading him to
say, ``Without the ability to test for hepatitis C, Roche's NAT
system could not be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Madaus, vice president for Roche's blood-screening
business unit in Pleasanton, calls the patent dispute ``a business
risk for us but not an unsurmountable issue.'' He maintains that
one manufacturer has never been allowed to control a vital process
``when the nation's blood supply is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch, the San Francisco blood expert, is glad Roche is in the
NAT race. ``During the initial period, Chiron was talking about
charging $10 a sample to screen for HCV,'' says Busch, adding that
Roche's competition already has brought the projected cost down to
$6 or $7 per NAT test.
</P>
<P>
   Even a $7 charge makes blood banks wince. It costs $150 to
acquire a pint of donated blood. Less than $25 of that amount
covers all seven current tests.
</P>
<P>
   So far, blood banks haven't experienced the full cost of NAT.
During the experimental phase, FDA rules only let Roche and Chiron
recover actual costs. But once they gain commercial approval, they
can charge ``whatever the market will bear,'' Busch says.
</P>
<P>
   Blood banks aren't yet testing each pint of blood using NAT.
Instead, they're pooling about 20 samples for one test _ and one
charge. Part of the issue is that current NAT systems can't handle
the 40,000 pints that are donated every day. But FDA officials have
signalled that as soon as the equipment can handle the load, they
want each pint individually NAT tested.
</P>
<P>
   Multiply the 14 million pints of blood collected annually in the
United States by whatever the final price per test and it becomes
clear that NAT safety comes at a cost.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the price, the medical system eventually will have to
pay it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to do whatever it takes to make the blood supply
as safe as it can possibly be,'' said the Red Cross' Fulwider.

RIVAL'S SUIT SAYS MICROSOFT BARRED ACCESS TO CRUCIAL DATA
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the trial in the government's antitrust case against
Microsoft Corp. resumes Tuesday in Washington, evidence in a
separate trial set to open this week in Connecticut seems to offer
tantalizing support for an assertion that the company's rivals have
made for years _ that Microsoft wields its industry-standard
Windows operating system as a club to control the software
business.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the Connecticut case is an issue that has been raised
peripherally by several government witnesses in the Washington case
_ how Microsoft controls its competitors' understanding of
application program interfaces, or APIs.
</P>
<P>
   APIs are the paths into and out of the operating system that
programmers must follow for their software _ spreadsheets, Internet
browsers, picture editing and so on _ to run efficiently. Rivals
have long said that Microsoft gives them only rudimentary maps of
the Windows APIs, making it impossible to compete with the designs
of Microsoft's own applications programmers, who enjoy a detailed
road map of Windows, complete with little backroads and alleys that
can be used as shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismisses such contentions as whining by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But in an internal e-mail memo to several senior Microsoft
executives on Feb. 28, 1996, Mark Ryland, a company manager,
observed matter-of-factly, ``Microsoft learned long ago that to
control the APIs is to control the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That memo is among thousands of internal Microsoft documents
filed in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., as part of a
private antitrust suit scheduled to go to trial on Wednesday. Among
other things, they show a spirited debate inside Microsoft over how
much of its software should run ``cross-platform'' _ that is, on
competing operating systems like Unix, the platform for many large
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the e-mail offers vivid glimpses of Microsoft's
winner-take-all style of competition. In one internal memo, a
Microsoft manager discusses a proposal to enable some of its data
base technology to work on Unix. This was a topic previously raised
with data base companies like Sybase Inc. and Oracle Corp., which
compete with Microsoft in data base software but also develop
products that run on Windows as well as on Unix.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, 1996, James Allchin, a Microsoft senior vice
president, wrote: ``Please give me one good reason why we should
even consider this. (Hint: any good answer needs to include making
more money and helping kill Unix, Sybase or Oracle.)''
</P>
<P>
   The suit in Connecticut is not directly related to the
government's sweeping antitrust case. But the justice department
and the 19 states suing Microsoft are eagerly awaiting the evidence
in the Connecticut case because it focuses squarely on the issue of
technology access.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Bristol Technology Inc., a small software maker
in Danbury, Conn., charges that Microsoft illegally cut off its
access to Windows technology after three years of cooperation and
says that Microsoft had a ``duty to deal'' with it.
</P>
<P>
   The government's more traditional antitrust suit charges that
Microsoft used its Windows monopoly to stifle competition from
Internet software. The Justice Department left the issue of
technology access to be addressed in the remedy phase of the trial
if it wins, and it is a crucial subject in continuing settlement
talks with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   One justice department official observed, ``I think we should
put a sign up in the war room here, `It's the APIs, stupid''' _ a
play on the slogan in President Clinton's 1992 campaign stressing
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that reading too much into a few e-mail messages
is unfair. The company, its lawyers note, is unapologetically
filled with highly competitive people with a passion for the
software business _ a passion reflected in their e-mail. ``And a
lot of the e-mail that Bristol has filed as evidence has nothing to
do with this case,'' said Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate
lawyer for Microsoft. ``There are discussions about cross-platform
strategies all the time within Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bristol is not going to win its antitrust suit against
Microsoft merely with piles of inflammatory e-mail that raise
important industry issues. It must produce convincing evidence that
Microsoft violated the antitrust laws, and legal experts say that
is a stiff challenge.  &QL;

 UNDATED: challenge. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristol has assembled a legal team led by two veteran antitrust
experts known for defending the International Business Machines
Corp., Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, and Anthony
L. Clapes, a former IBM assistant general counsel. But legal
experts say that ``duty-to-deal'' cases are hard to win outside
industries with traditions of regulation, like telecommunications,
or businesses involving natural assets, like ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are very reluctant to say that dominant firms have
a duty to deal, because that takes you down a regulatory path,''
William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University
Law School, said. ``It also reduces incentives to innovate if a
dominant firm is forced to share its hard-won assets _ like
intellectual property in the software business _ with other
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol charges that Microsoft used it as a tool in a cynical
campaign to gain a foothold in the market for heavy-duty corporate
computing and then tried to shift those customers over to using
Microsoft's most advanced operating system, Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Windows NT has gradually improved over the years, but after it
was first shipped in 1992, it struggled to compete against Unix in
the market for big corporate systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's main advantage was the popularity of the many
software applications _ an estimated 100,000 _ written to run on
Windows. For example, a scientist using a powerful Unix work
station for research might want to use Microsoft Word to write
memos or an Excel spreadsheet for doing budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol developed a product that solved that problem. Its Wind/U
software enabled programs written for Windows to run on Unix work
stations, or hub computers called servers, that send data to
workers' desktop machines. That opened mainstream corporate
business to the legions of Windows software developers.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bristol's translation software to work, the company
needed access to Microsoft's technology. In 1994, Bristol signed a
three-year contract with Microsoft giving Bristol virtually open
access to all Windows APIs. Lifted by its partnership with
Microsoft, Bristol thrived. In 1997, Inc. magazine ranked Bristol
140th among the 500 fastest-growing companies in the nation, with a
payroll of 70 people and estimated revenue of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was the high point for Bristol. It began negotiating
with Microsoft on a contract for access to the newer versions of
Microsoft's operating-system technology. After the two sides failed
to reach an agreement, Bristol sued last August contending that
Microsoft's offer _ a fourfold increase in price and much-reduced
access to Windows technology _ was an ``apple core,'' as a
Microsoft e-mail message described it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bristol, the changed terms were no mystery. Windows
NT has made real strides in the corporate market against Unix.
Cripple the cross-platform software provided by Bristol, and many
customers that have become dependent on Windows applications thanks
to Bristol's software would move from Unix to Windows.
``Microsoft's dealings with Bristol are a classic
bait-and-switch,'' Lynch, Bristol's lead trial lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that Bristol has no legal grounds for its case
and has embarked on litigation as a business tactic. It points out
that the 1994 contract covered access only to Windows NT 3.0,
Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, and it contained no language about
future versions of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   True, says Keith Blackwell, the president of Bristol. But he
points to the many public statements Microsoft made about its
commitment to the cross-platform program, called the Windows
Interface Source Environment, or WISE. One document posted on the
Web in 1995 stated, ``Microsoft is committed to providing WISE
licensees'' _ like Bristol _ ``with future versions of Windows
family source code.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said, ``Microsoft repeatedly and publicly made all
these representations that the WISE program was a safe way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies also had conflicts with Microsoft over access to
Windows technology, including AT&AMP;T, the inventor of Unix, which
eventually settled a contract suit seeking access to Windows NT 5.0
programming code.
</P>
<P>
   But a Bristol rival, Mainsoft Inc., did reach an agreement with
Microsoft last year. And Bristol, according to Microsoft, rejected
the same contract terms that Mainsoft found acceptable. The
negotiations with Microsoft were lengthy and difficult, William
McCarthy, Mainsoft's vice president for business development, said.
``But there's nothing we can't do that we want to do under the new
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol's duty-to-deal case falls apart because ``Microsoft has
not refused to deal with Bristol _ it was offered the same terms as
Mainsoft,'' its lawyer, Aeschbacher, said. ``Just because someone
is not happy with the terms of a deal they are offered, that is not
an antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol replies that Mainsoft was struggling and willing to take
whatever Microsoft offered to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   An internal e-mail message certainly suggests, at least, that
Microsoft found Mainsoft easier to deal with. On May 18, 1998, Dan
Neault, a WISE program manager, wrote: ``Mainsoft is in our pocket.
Bristol is rattling sabres hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol contends that the offer Mainsoft accepted is a hobbled
version of the original cross-platform promise of the WISE program,
and thus Microsoft has used its market power to undermine
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Microsoft will seek to portray Bristol as a company
bent on litigation, trying to win a huge financial judgment against
a deep-pocketed defendant.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, 1998, a month before negotiations finally broke off,
Bristol received a ``strategic communications game plan'' from
Fleishman-Hillard, a New York public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   The document, entitled ``David vs. Goliath,'' recommended:
``Position David as a reluctant, yet courageous plaintiff defending
its small, successful and growing entrepreneurial company and
Goliath as a predatory, deep-pocketed, unethical behemoth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol says it would have been foolish to take on Microsoft
without some preparation. And it insists that if anyone was
negotiating in bad faith, it was Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message titled ``Co-opting Unix,'' Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, listed as part of the company's strategy,
``Picking Mainsoft as our partner for Windows APIs on Unix and
revving up their activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates wrote the message on Sept. 28, 1997, about 11 months
before negotiations between Microsoft and Bristol ended.

Millennium Jet Founder Has Sky-High Ambitions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By Benny Evangelista
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Millennium Jet Inc. founder Mike Moshier is chasing two dreams that
humans have pursued almost since the dawn of time.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to fly like a bird.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to make money.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping that his invention, the SoloTrek Exo-Skelitor Flying
Vehicle, takes off and makes both dreams come true. And right now,
Moshier's not worried that the idea sounds as improbable as if he
were trying to fly by flapping the mythical wax wings of Daedelus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so different than anything else that exists today,''
the former Navy jet combat pilot said of his one-person flying
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pumped a million dollars into this thing, and if I
thought it were not doable, I know I could find better uses for
that million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, secretly working out of a Santa Clara
office-warehouse, Moshier, 51, and partner Robert Bulaga, 47, an
aerospace engineer, have developed the SoloTrek XFV with money that
Moshier made from other successful Silicon Valley ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Now Millennium Jet is about three months away from the first
test flight of the SoloTrek, an eight-foot-tall contraption
designed to let a single passenger/pilot fly as fast as 80 mph, for
as long as 90 minutes and as high as 10,000 feet, all on a single
tank of regular 87-octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder, 130-horsepower engine spins a set of two
injection-molded rotor blades positioned above the pilot's head
like wings. The blades provide the thrust for vertical takeoffs and
landings and for forward motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can land anywhere the size of a dining room table,''
Moshier said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot is strapped into the SoloTrek in a standing position
and tilts the rotors to go up, down or forward using two
hand-controlled joysticks. The craft employs a high-tech retinal
eye-scan system to prevent untrained pilots from taking off. It has
sensors that adjust the craft to the pilot's weight and experience
and that can warn of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Moshier says it's different than the rocket belt, the Buck
Rogers-style fuel-burning jet pack used in the opening ceremonies
of the 1984 Olympics _ also familiar from movies like ``The
Rocketeer'' and the James Bond series. Rocket belts exist and
actually fly _ but only for about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, single-person flying machines have come and
gone, from Renaissance inventor-artist Leonardo da Vinci's 15th
century ``Orthinocopter'' to Hiller Aircraft's ``Flying Platform''
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never gone anywhere because they've never been
practical,'' Moshier said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Silicon Valley entrepreneur believes the SoloTrek
will go where no other flying machine has gone before. Imagine, he
said, being able to soar high above the maddening rush-hour traffic
on the Bay Bridge or the Sunol Grade.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, he said, immigration agents in SoloTreks flying patrol
over the country's borders, or search and rescue workers swooping
down to help an injured hiker deep in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Jet's detailed Web site, at  &LR; www.solotrek.com, &LR;  even
imagines ``journalists who use SoloTrek XFV as a vehicle for their
reporting assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshier hesitated to say what he thought each SoloTrek might
cost though he guessed that it one day could sell for the price of
``a very expensive car.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Moshier and Bulaga, the company's only two employees,
believe that Millennium Jet's first customers will be the military
or government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Bulaga, who has 25 years of experience as an aeronautical
engineer, imagines ``it would be a cool thing to see'' a phalanx of
400 flying Marines headed for a beach invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Millennium Jet still has to prove that the SoloTrek actually
can fly before the company can get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And even then, Bay Area industrialist and air historian Stanley
Hiller said the company faces a long and costly road trying to get
clearance from stringent aviation and government safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish them every success, but I have seen nothing new
technically to think that it's a practical machine,'' said Hiller,
who knows more than a few things about inventing newfangled flying
machines.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager in the 1940s, Hiller designed the first helicopter
to fly on the West Coast. His XH-44 ``Hiller-copter'' laid the
foundation for his Hiller Aircraft Co. of Palo Alto, one of four
companies that started the helicopter industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Hiller Aircraft designed and flew the Flying
Platform, a single-person craft that used similar ``ducted fan''
technology as the SoloTrek. The company also produced a one-person
rescue aircraft for use in the Korean War, but the conflict ended
before the aircraft could be mass produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every back yard tinkerer has an idea for a vertical takeoff
machine,'' said Hiller, who helped found the Hiller Aviation Museum
that opened last year at the San Carlos Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a single-seat rocket belt or rotor system
(aircraft) comes and goes like a wave,'' Hiller said. ``Hundreds of
people per year try and take a dream of an everyman's and
everywoman's aircraft, make it safe and sound and quiet and easy to
fly. And that has never been accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum had a panel of 20 highly regarded university
professors and aerospace engineers look into the future of aviation
and ``they did not see a practical market for small one-man
aircraft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dream but an impractical dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moshier, though, said he is confident that he will make SoloTrek
a reality. He has made enough money from his earlier ventures
though he would welcome ``strategic partners.''
</P>
<P>
   He sold his previous venture, Talus Corp., a precision
sheet-metal fabrication company in Santa Clara, in 1997. Before
that, he was co-owner of MOPAR LLC, a Silicon Valley real estate
development company. He also had owned a company that made
workstations used for silicon wafer fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the concept of building a solo flying machine
remained ``my lifetime passion,'' he said. In a way, he already has
achieved one of his goals with the Millennium Jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is defined by doing what you like to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moshier, however, won't be trying to copy the Wright brothers
and be the first to fly the SoloTrek. He will hire a test pilot for
the experimental flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife made me promise I won't fly any higher than I am
willing to fall,'' Moshier said.

 &HT;    Dodgers beat Braves on error again
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a disturbing pattern, the Braves lost to Los
Angeles Sunday for the second time in less than 24 hours on an
unearned run which was set up by a first baseman's error.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko's inarticulate glove-work led to a second straight
loss and a blown 1-2 series with the Dodgers. As for the real
significance of the 11th-inning 5-4 loss, starter Greg Maddux
pegged it at: ``None. Zero. None.''
</P>
<P>
   But the frustration was palpable in the Atlanta clubhouse over
another game fumbled away. Saturday night, a grounder through Brian
Hunter's legs led the way to two Dodger runs, both scoring on bases
loaded walks in a 2-1 loss. On Sunday, Klesko got away with a
throwing error in the third, but his failure to catch Chipper
Jones' high throw on Mark Grudzielanek's roller allowed the winning
run to score from second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always hurts when you lose on a play you feel should be
made,'' said Jones. ``Anytime that happens, it's particularly hard
to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown has never lost at Turner Field and was leading 4-1
in the eighth. Maddux's second homer of the year in the third had
been Atlanta's only run until Jones, Brian Jordan and Klesko all
doubled on three successive pitches to tie it and knock Brown out.
</P>
<P>
   It came apart after Eric Karros's one-out double off Mike
Remlinger in the 11th. After Adrian Beltre was intentionally walked
to set up the force out, Grudzielanek barely got a bat on an 0-2
pitch that rolled to the left side. Jones barehanded the ball and
made a rising throw to the dugout side of first. Klesko tried to
hold the bag and lost the ball off the tip of his glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I come off the bag, you've got bases loaded and one out,''
Klesko said. ``I just took the chance there. When he throws from
down there, the ball of course is going to rise on you. I guess the
best thing I should have done was maybe come off the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Klesko and Hunter, first basemen have already committed
eight errors in 402 total chances. The absent Andres Galarraga
committed 11 errors in 1,310 chances last year while the Braves led
the league in defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have any arm left,'' Klesko said.
</P>
<P>

   Opponent: Colorado Rockies.
</P>

 &HT;    SMOLTZ TO PITCH TUESDAY AGAINST ROCKIES
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz will pitch Tuesday against Colorado and
the Braves were so anxious to make it happen that they've juggled
the rotation in Smoltz's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz will face the Rockies' Bobby Jones on the first day he is
eligible to come off the 15-day disabled list. Kevin Millwood,
whose usual turn would come up Tuesday, has been moved up to pitch
the series opener tonight. Rookie Bruce Chen, who made two starts
in Smoltz's place, was scratched from working tonight but will be
available for relief work before being optioned back to Class AAA
Richmond Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Odalis Perez, who was in jeopardy of being passed over,
will pitched Wednesday in his regular turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only thing we can do,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
``You've got to keep Odalis in there and I know Chen is throwing
good but Smoltz is ready to come off. He's worked hard to get back
and he's ready to go. He's been pointing to that date for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood will work on three days rest for the first time in his
career. The Braves would only contemplate moving Millwood up one
day due to his 85 pitch-count in his last start Thursday in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good (Saturday) throwing on the side,''
Millwood. ``I don't see it being any kind of problem at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anything, the moves convinces Perez his place
in the rotation is secure. He has stated his fears that he is only
one bad start or two from losing his job to Chen and after he
brought the issue up again after Perez's masterful job in Friday's
4-2 win over Los Angeles, the club shot down the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about it,'' Cox said. ``It hasn't crossed my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: The lineup
</P>
<P>
   Cox picked Kevin Brown's day to pitch to give starts to left
fielder Otis Nixon (his first in a week) and second baseman Keith
Lockhart (his first in a month). They were a combined 1-for-7.
Though Cox had planned on playing Lockhart anyway, Bret Boone was
used to pinch-hit in the ninth but otherwise used the day off to
loosen up his left knee, which was struck by a Carlos Perez pitch
the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was fine lying there,'' said Boone, who initially
collapsed in the batter's box but was able finish the game. ``But
it's like somebody hits your funny bone and you need a minute. I
always go into antic when I get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen was making his fourth straight start for Walt Weiss, who
is nursing a tender right quadriceps. Weiss is expected to return
to action tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: A change in heart
</P>
<P>
   Official scorer Mark Fredricksen changed a ruling from Saturday
night's game, after initially charging L.A. shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek with an error on a ball hit by Chipper Jones. Though
Grudzielanek was in pefect position to field the ball on one hop,
it was hit too hard to get a glove on it. When Fredricksen visited
the Braves clubhouse to inform the team of the change, he
encountered batting coach Don Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him Ozzie Smith is retired,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Synder, the team's director of scouting and player
development, is among the newest inductees to the South Atlantic
League Hall of Fame announced over the weekend. . . . The club went
over the 1 million attendance mark with Sunday's crowd of 47,166.
It took 26 home dates to draw the first million. Last season, it
took 28 dates. . . . The Braves were not sad to see L.A.'s Raul
Mondesi leave town. He was 6-for-12 (.500) for the series with two
doubles and a homer. He is hitting .435 against Atlanta this season
and .340 lifetime.

2 SENATORS SEEK LIMITS ON FCC

   2 SENATORS SEEK LIMITS ON FCC
</P>
<P>
   Firing their latest shot at the Federal Communications
Commission, Senate leaders have introduced legislation that would
eliminate the agency's authority to review most mergers in the
industries it regulates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who heads the commerce committee,
announced the legislation Wednesday, the same day his committee
held a politically charged oversight hearing on the FCC's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   During that hearing and in an earlier statement on the Senate
floor, McCain took William Kennard, chairman of the five-member
commission, to task for his office's handling of the pending merger
of the regional Bell companies SBC and Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, the FCC's already faltering merger process hit
rock bottom when a staff member and ostensible antitrust expert
heading up the FCC's review of the SBC-Ameritech merger _ which the
Department of Justice has already approved _ publicly proclaimed
that unless the FCC imposed major conditions, the proposed
transaction `flunks the public interest test,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine either the Federal Trade Commission or DOJ
countenancing such happenings during the course of their merger
review processes?'' McCain asked, referring to the Department of
Justice. ``I think not. This appalling unprofessional behavior by
the FCC staff drove the value of SBC and Ameritech stock down over
$4 billion, and it confirmed that if this is what passes for FCC
merger review expertise, the FCC has no business being in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill by McCain and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of
the judiciary committee, would end the FCC's authority to
investigate telecommunications mergers except when the Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission declined to review
them. In those cases, the FCC's oversight would be limited to 60
days.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the telecommunications industry was the only
industry subject to multiple reviews.
</P>
<P>
   At the FCC, Kennard defended his agency's role in the process,
saying that the FCC's review goes beyond that of the Department of
Justice by looking at the impact such mergers have on consumers.

<P>
   The online mortgage business is heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's Quicken Mortgage is planning to introduce an updated
World Wide Web site on Wednesday that will include offers of home
equity loans and loans to people with spotty credit histories.
Meanwhile, the industry leader in online mortgages, E-Loan, is
awaiting final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission
for an initial offering of stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 1 percent of all home mortgages were arranged
online last year, the business is gaining momentum. Quicken
Mortgage, whose users took out $600 million in loans in 1998,
arranged $400 million in loans in the first three months of 1999,
said Alison Berkley Wagonfeld, an Intuit group product manager.

   The culture of khaki joined the colorful world of the iMac
computer last week, when Millard S. Drexler, president and chief
executive of Gap Inc., joined the board of Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from an Apple news release noting Drexler's
``expertise in marketing and retail,'' the companies did not seem
to have much to say about the move, which adds a seventh director
to an Apple board that already included Larry Ellison, chief
executive of the Oracle Corp., and Jerry York, former chief
financial officer of IBM and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler, formerly the chief executive of the fashion designer
Ann Taylor and now also overseer of the Gap brands Banana Republic
and Old Navy, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   He ``is pleased to join the board; that much can be assumed,''
said a Gap spokesman, Alan L. Marks. ``Beyond that, there's really
nothing else to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the presumed synergies between the two hip San
Francisco Bay Area companies? Or maybe combining Gap's toned-down
palette with the iMac's fruit-candy color options? ``You'll have to
ask Apple that,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A khaki-colored iMac?'' said a deadpan Greg Jones, an Apple
spokesman. ``I'm not going to speculate on that at the moment.'' &QL;

   CLIFFORD IRVING GETS THE LAST LAUGH VIA THE NET
</P>
<P>
   It has taken 27 years, but one man's fabled literary hoax is
finally a hardcover book _ bound, printed, packaged and sold
exclusively over the Internet as an ``imaginative biography'' of
Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Irving, who was imprisoned for 17 months in connection
with his creation of a bogus biography of Hughes, the eccentric
billionaire, is selling a newly edited version of that rejected
manuscript through a start-up Internet publisher called
Terrificbooks.com.
</P>
<P>
   The first copies of the gold-embossed book, ``The Autobiography
of Howard Hughes,'' arrived at Irving's temporary home in Santa Fe,
N.M., last week. ``It's like an abandoned child _ I've found this
child after 27 years,'' said Irving, 68. ``I put one copy on my
bookshelf with all my other books. It was like it had come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Hughes hoax in 1972, Irving repaid his original
publisher, McGraw-Hill Book Co., his $765,000 advance and tried
unsuccessfully to persuade mainstream companies, including McGraw,
to publish the book as fiction. ``I had always gotten a cold
shoulder,'' Irving said. ``I think there was a view that the whole
thing had bloodied the nose of publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving has published more than nine books since the Hughes
incident, but he didn't find a publisher for this ``biography''
until after he became an investor and part-owner of
Terrificbooks.com. The company, also based in Santa Fe, sells books
directly to customers online. The Hughes book is its first
offering.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since the hoax drove him to prison, Irving said
it had been hard to feel much emotion about the entire incident.
``I probably did it because I was bored and it was a challenge and
it was an adventure and I was stupid,'' he said. ``It's hard to
regret something from so long ago. I was on a talk show and
somebody asked me are you the Clifford Irving who perpetrated the
Howard Hughes hoax, and I said no. I said that because I'm not that
same person anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Irving was outraged when ``60 Minutes II''
broadcast an interview with him in May that revisited the hoax and
labeled him a ``World Class Con Man'' on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grossly unfair to label me a con man,'' Irving said. ``I
use the analogy of a man who gets drunk and is then arrested, but
for 27 years doesn't touch a drop. And then they still call him a
drunkard.''

   JOURNALISTS COMING HOME FROM THE WAR
</P>
<P>
   The misery of Kosovar refugees has tugged on heartstrings across
America. But it tugs a little less frequently now, with the crisis
two months old and American television networks showing fewer
pictures of the camps.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS and NBC have all scaled back the number of
correspondents they have stationed in Albania and Macedonia and
have reduced the number of reports filed from the refugee camps to
an average of one a week, per network, for the last four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., on April 20,
television coverage of the entire Yugoslavia conflict has declined,
and coverage of the refugees' situation has declined even faster.
Refugee stories made up about 30 percent of the overall coverage in
the first month after the refugee exodus began, and they make up
less than 10 percent now, according to the Tyndall Report, which
tracks subjects covered by ABC, CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Although the networks still have correspondents covering the
combat inside Yugoslavia, NBC now has only one correspondent
covering the refugees (from a peak of five); ABC has one (from
three), although Peter Jennings, the anchor of ``World News
Tonight,'' plans to go to the camps this week, and CBS has none.
CNN has five, a cutback by one correspondent, and Fox News Channel
brought home its own crews and relies now on its partner B Sky B
for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Two main reasons are given for the cuts: The refugee outpouring
has tapered off, and the shootings in Littleton diverted attention
and resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the refugee crisis has eased, we've been airing fewer
reports from the camps, but we've kept enough resources in the area
to cover any developments,'' said Bill Wheatley, vice president of
NBC News, which also feeds the MSNBC cable network. ``Now you see
occasional flurries of refugees coming across, maybe 5,000 or so in
a day, but not comparable to what was happening in the early days
of the war,'' when the tide often reached 30,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Major newspapers have also cut back slightly on correspondents
in Albania and Macedonia. The Washington Post and The New York
Times have each shifted one reporter out recently, going from four
apiece to three.

   SHARING A LAWYER RAISES QUESTION OF ETHICS
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, anybody who is anybody knows everybody. But does
that mean that any journalist can write about anybody?
</P>
<P>
   It might. In its July issue, Vanity Fair is planning to publish
an article by Kim Masters about Jeffrey Katzenberg's case against
Walt Disney Co. _ even though Ms. Masters and Katzenberg share the
same lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Though most writers do not usually require legal services, right
now Ms. Masters does: Last week, Broadway Books, a division of
Random House, announced that it had canceled her book about Michael
Eisner, the chairman of Disney, and his ascension to Hollywood
power. Random House said the book was unpublishable; Ms. Masters'
lawyer _ the well-known Hollywood litigator Bertram Fields _ said
Eisner had exerted his powerful influence to have the book killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Masters _ who is known for juicy Hollywood reporting and is
a co-author of the best-selling book ``Hit and Run: How Jon Peters
and Peter Guber Took Sony for a Ride in Hollywood'' _ hired Fields
when Broadway first suggested that it would not publish her book
earlier this year, while she was reporting her article for Vanity
Fair. At the time, Fields was representing Katzenberg, the former
Disney studio chief, in a fraud and breach-of-contract suit against
Disney, and he continues to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Masters has been sitting in on hearings on the Katzenberg
lawsuit. Disney executives are complaining, saying that Ms. Masters
cannot write fairly about a trial overseen, quite publicly, by her
own lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Masters said that before she hired Fields, she discussed the
matter with her editors at Vanity Fair, who approved the decision
as long as she disclosed the conflict in the article.
</P>
<P>
   One critic said that disclosure was not enough. Marshall Loeb,
the editor of The Columbia Journalism Review, said, ``You don't
write a story about a situation prominently involving your own
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Schieffer, a spokeswoman for Vanity Fair, said it was the
magazine's policy not to comment on articles in coming issues.
Graydon Carter, the magazine's editor, did not return phone calls
seeking comment.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Alarmed by 11th-hour moves by the departing Israeli
government to expand Jewish settlements, Palestinian officials
warned Israel's prime minister-elect, Ehud Barak, Sunday that they
would not resume peace negotiations without a halt to settlement
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings, at a conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
were coupled with a call for a ``day of Palestinian rage'' against
settlements on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The actions reflected worries that Barak, who is trying to form
a broad governing coalition, might not move firmly to curb
settlement building despite his pledge to revive dormant peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian concerns were heightened on Friday when it was
disclosed that the outgoing defense minister, Moshe Arens, had
recently approved a master plan extending the boundaries of the
biggest West Bank settlement, Maale Adumim, to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would double the size of Maale Adumim, a town with a
population of 25,000, to an area larger than Tel Aviv, taking land
from five Arab villages.
</P>
<P>
   It would create a swath of land for Israeli construction
extending from the West Bank to East Jerusalem, isolating
Palestinian communities from the city. Palestinians view East
Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department called the move ``a provocative act by an
outgoing government'' that would ``not only sour the environment,
it would unquestionably complicate negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also recently allowed
groundbreaking work for a new Jewish housing complex in the Arab
neighborhood of Ras al-Amud in East Jerusalem, and for building at
Har Homa, another East Jerusalem site known in Arabic as Jebel Abu
Ghneim.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who soundly defeated Netanyahu on May 17, has said
nothing about the recent settlement moves, avoiding policy
statements as he negotiates with parties on the right and the left
to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak is called upon to break his
silence and to take steps that will prevent the government of
Benjamin Netanyahu from continuing to make decisions that destroy
the peace process,'' said Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior aide to the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Rahim spoke on behalf of Arafat at the Ramallah gathering,
which was called ``The National Conference to Confront
Settlement.'' The meeting had been planned before the actions on
Thursday but took on a new urgency in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``No peace with settlements,'' Abdel Rahim said. ``The next
Israeli government must halt settlements immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Khoury, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative
council, said further talks with Israel should be made conditional
on a cessation of settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not undertake any negotiations or conclude any
agreements before we hear loud and clear from the new Israeli
government and the prime minister-elect that he has decided to stop
settlement,'' said Khoury, who is better known as Abu Alaa.
</P>
<P>
   A final statement issued by the conference echoed his remarks,
declaring, ``Completion of the peace process by the Palestinian
side is conditional on immediate nullification of settlement
decisions and measures taken by the Netanyahu government.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he takes office, Barak will have the authority to suspend
settlement building and, Arens has said, even reverse the decision
to expand Maale Adumim. Barak has said he wants to keep most Jewish
settlers under Israeli sovereignty in large settlement blocs,
presumably in West Bank areas close to Israel proper, like Maale
Adumim.
</P>
<P>
   He has also pledged to maintain Israeli control over all of
Jerusalem, ruling out a withdrawal to Israel's boundaries before
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

COMMENTARY: `WE NEVER SLEEP'
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARPERS FERRY, W.Va. _ When Allan Pinkerton, Lincoln's bumbling
Secret Service chief, set up a private detective agency after the
Civil War, he adopted as his logo an open eye and the slogan ``We
Never Sleep.'' That spawned the phrase ``private eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the eyes have it. Privacy has fled. The latest intrusion
is the ``black box,'' the sensing and diagnostic module that GM has
been secretly slipping into 6 million cars in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   You can call your new model a Cadillac or a Camaro, but what
you're driving is the 1999 GM ``Snitch.'' Next year you will have
the chance to buy an SUV called the Ford ``Big Brother,'' or the
Volkswagen ``Bugged Bug.'' Well-intended to research the causes of
crashes and thereby improve auto safety, the hidden spying device
records what you may have been doing wrong before a collision _
which could have an impact on insurance or criminal liability.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want a car that rats on me. Down that slippery slope of
secret surveillance is a car that constantly records my speed, or
sneakily tapes my private profanity at the guy who cuts in front of
me, or reports me to the FCC for failure to install a cell phone.
At the very least, I demand a commercial Miranda warning, as
airline pilots have.
</P>
<P>
   Secret surveillance is but one manifestation of a larger
abomination: hypercommunication. Detroit's lust for contact is
matched by Wall Street, coming at it from the other end: the
exchanges will soon make it possible for customers to make trades
at any hour of the day or night. The brokers' motto is the
Pinkertonian ``We Never Sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock trading _ profit-taking pillow talk _ will
be explained as a necessary adjustment to international market
efficiency, not to mention meeting the competition of the Internet.
All that investment for insomniacs time-zones me out.
</P>
<P>
   Like the spy box in your car and the pager on your hip,
all-securities-all-the-time is a manifestation of the headlong rush
into the abyss of universal contact.
</P>
<P>
   What's so hot about being totally reachable? Where is it
written, Thou Shalt Never Be Out of Touch? Doesn't anybody long to
be alone anymore? One of these days I'd like to turn on a TV set at
an odd hour and see a test pattern. An entire TV generation has
never experienced the peaceful patience of a test pattern. Or a
message from station management saying simply, ``We're resting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hypercommunication is a throwback to the treadmill and we are
its new oxen. Too many of us, getting and spending, have bought the
notion that solitary contemplation is anti-social. A century ago,
when William Jennings Bryan made 16 campaign speeches in a day, an
opponent asked, ``When does he think?''
</P>
<P>
   I was offered use of one of the first pagers. At the 1972 Moscow
summit, President Nixon wanted immediate access to his traveling
staff. When I objected to this electronic leash, Bob Haldeman said
privacy was no excuse, so I told him that the sudden beep at
belt-level brought on a urinary urgency; he said, ``Oh, you have a
medical excuse,'' and I alone am escaped to tell thee.
</P>
<P>
   The desperately in-touch deride as Luddite any reverence for
working hours. They insist their own round-the-clock reachability
is reversible: ``We can always turn off the pager, or the cell
phone on safari, or the all-night brokerage; we can disable the car
bug.'' They delude themselves. Once hooked up, they are hooked
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because once a person sinks into an always-reachable state,
all fellow-reachables resent any turning-off. Colleagues consider
it aggressive rejection; global bosses call it malingering; spouses
label it temporary desertion. When you are out of pocket, the world
is out of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus conscience _ that sense of letting down the always-on side
_ makes cowards of us all. If powering down does not make us feel
impotent, it makes us feel guilty. And that fin-de-milleniare guilt
at being even momentarily unplugged steals our supposed ``right to
turn off.''
</P>
<P>
   I say: Resist the 168-hour week. Buy unbugged cars and drive
incommunicado. Trade during business hours. On vacation, vacate; on
the Sabbath, sabb; on Memorial Day, remember. Treasure those
out-of-touch moments. Become a member of the Great Unreached.

<P>
   What was Sebastian Junger, best-selling author of ``The Perfect
Storm,'' doing in a high school gymnasium in Greenwich, Conn.,
filled with 500 children? First, feeling ``nervous,'' since he had
not been near that many teen-agers since he was one himself.
Second, sharing a podium with Linda Greenlaw, a fishing boat
captain featured in his book, whose own memoir, ``Hungry Ocean,''
has just been published.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, he was being party to the kind of creative
marketing that an independent bookstore must mount if it is to
survive in a business increasingly dominated by discount stores,
warehouse clubs, chains and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A report to be published Tuesday by the Book Industry Study
Group, a nonprofit research organization, shows that in 1998,
independents represented only 16.6 percent of outlets where books
are sold, down from 21.6 percent in 1994, and falling.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Junger and Ms. Greenlaw to the students of
Brunswick Academy and its sister school, Greenwich Academy _ and
their speaking engagement before 200 adults later that day at the
Indian Harbor Yacht Club down the road _ had been arranged by an
independent bookseller, Warren Cassell. His quid pro quo was to
have already sold each of those 500 children a copy of Junger's
book as enrichment reading. Although Ms. Greenlaw's book was
published too late for that, by day's end it had sold 135 copies.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not all. Cassell has arranged with Brunswick to
provide speakers and books on a continuing basis. The school
benefits because it gets top-of-the-line speakers for free. Cassell
benefits because he will sell at least 500 copies of each book.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: USING DISCOUNTS TO BUILD A CLIENT BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a business environment in which e-commerce sites often sell
goods at a loss in order to attract customers and build a brand
name, it is no surprise that consumers expect the Web to be an
around-the-clock fire sale, with the next bargain just a click
away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to a recent survey conducted by Esearch, an
Internet research firm based in Los Angeles, more than half of
online shoppers expect a 20 percent to 30 percent discount from the
standard retail price when buying an item that would normally be
priced between $30 and $500.
</P>
<P>
   It is an understandable expectation, given that deep discount is
a virtual battle cry for some of the Internet's best-known
retailers. But that sense of consumer entitlement could return to
haunt companies that have come to rely too heavily on discount
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and executives say that unless Web retailers find
healthy sources of revenue from attendant activities like
advertising or data mining, there is simply no way to sustain a
viable business without building a sustainable profit margin into
most sales.
</P>
<P>
   Computer electronics sites were the Web's price-cutting pioneers
and are still among the most aggressive retailers pursuing this
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Buy.com, a computer and electronics retailer,
have made a name for themselves by guaranteeing prices 10 percent
lower than their top three online competitors. Meanwhile On Sale
Inc., another Internet computer retailer, says it sells goods at
cost _ plus ``payment and transaction processing fees.''
</P>
<P>
   This loss-leader approach has since spread to other product
categories, with Web sites selling certain items at a loss, hoping
to make up the difference from sales of other, more expensive items
or from future business from customers who initially came for a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com helped build a following this way last fall, offering
the ``Titanic'' video for $9.99, nearly $20 less than the list
price. The move generated over 300,000 sales, the company said, and
helped solidify the site as a leader in its category.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, meanwhile, started a price war among online
booksellers two weeks ago by offering 50 percent discounts on books
appearing on The New York Times best-seller list.
Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com quickly followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   While Amazon.com declined to comment on the effect on sales, Ben
Boyd, a Barnesandnoble.com spokesman, said the price cuts had
resulted in an unspecified ``incremental'' sales gain as a result
of increased traffic to his company's site.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers with less established followings, traffic is
everything. ``There is a strategy out there that says `I'm going to
loss-leader my entire store to get you to know me, then I'll worry
about evolving the model into a profitable one,'' said Ken Orton,
former chief executive of the online company Preview Travel, and
now chief strategist for Cognitiative, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Orton, who also sits on the board of On Sale and the Internet
wine retailer Virtual Vineyards, said the more conventional
approach was to offer low prices on only certain items. ``I bought
a Palm V on the Web recently and got a great price,'' he said,
referring to the popular personal digital organizer. ``But you can
bet they won't discount all the other things that go with it,'' he
said. ``If you look at it from the standpoint of building a
business, it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It may make sense during the current customer acquisition
frenzy. But it is not sustainable over the long run, said Gary
Echhorn, chief executive of Open Market, an e-commerce software
company. ``At some point, the world will have to figure out the
need to actually make a profit to stay in business, so the price
wars will be mitigated by that,'' he said. ``You can only suspend
the laws of business for so long.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The good news for Internet retailers is that despite consumers'
professed interest in finding bargains online, research suggests
that they are a bit lazy about seeking them out, preferring to use
reliable merchants with well-known names. A recent McKinsey &AMP; Co.
survey found that more than 80 percent of online shoppers do not
compare prices before buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very counterintuitive, but so far the trend among
customers has been not to compare prices,'' said John Hagel, who
leads the e-commerce practice for McKinsey, a management consulting
firm. ``Customers, once they come online, tend to settle quickly on
one site in a given category,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Hagel said, is that the most popular items
now selling on the Web are low-ticket goods like books and CDs,
which provide little financial reward for price comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, he said, is that the technology that allows
consumers to compare prices for a particular product from different
merchants is still somewhat unsophisticated. These ``shopping
bots,'' as they are known, are offered by portals like Excite, as
well as niche sites like Cnet's Shopper.com service. While they
sometimes turn up a good deal, the results can be inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   A search on Excite's shopping service for ``Nike Air Jordans,''
for example, turned up nothing on one day, despite repeated
attempts, but did yield results the next day. Meanwhile, an
all-categories search on Amazon.com's Shop the Web service yielded
no results for the term ``Levi's jeans,'' even though Levi Strauss
pays to be listed in the service. (An Amazon spokesman could not
account for the problem.)
</P>
<P>
   If price comparison services improve _ and include ratings for
merchants on factors like customer service, product availability
and shipping charges _ retailers could face more price pressure as
shoppers show more proclivity to stray. But for now, Hagel said,
consumers seem to be showing some loyalty. ``Once people learn how
to get around a site and have a positive experience, they tend to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if some consumers change their behavior and begin to
comparison-shop more aggressively, some industry executives expect
that retailers that do not play the discount game will still find
customers online, if they seem to provide superior service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be customers who look for price, and
there's always going to be customers who look for service, just
like some people shop at Saks and some shop at Wal-Mart,'' said Eli
Katz, president of e-commerce for Fragrance Counter.com and
Cosmetics Counter.com, which do not discount. ``That will hold true
on the Web as well.''

RANGERS CLAIM SIXTH VICTORY IN A ROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ A bizarre statistical twist transpired yesterday
in Tom Hicks' sports empire. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars scored five goals in an NHL playoff game and lost. The
Rangers scored three runs in an American League game and won. Who
would have thought Rangers pitcher Mark Clark would out-perform
Stars goalie Eddie Belfour? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He did and the Rangers enjoyed a significant victory when they
beat the Minnesota Twins, 3-2, at The Ballpark in Arlington. For
the first time this season, the Rangers scored fewer than four runs
in a game and won. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very important,'' outfielder Roberto Kelly said.
``Eventually we're going to run into a team with good pitching and
they won't let us score seven or eight runs. We've got to find
little ways to score.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, in a 2-2 game, did that in the eighth inning.
Rafael Palmeiro and Juan Gonzalez started the inning with singles,
Todd Zeile moved the runners up with a sacrifice bunt, and Lee
Stevens blooped a single to center to drive home the winning run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, coming off a 4-3 victory the night before, will
need more of that in the weeks to come. The Minnesota Twins are in
their rearview mirror. So are the Baltimore Orioles and the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers open a three-game series tonight against the Kansas
City Royals, who were second in the American League in pitching
going into yesterday's game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the Royals comes a road trip against the pitching-rich
Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers. Later in June the
Rangers face the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, two other
teams with formidable pitching. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers more than likely will have to win a few games
against those teams scoring fewer than four runs. They were 0-11 in
those games before yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In tight games, the pitching has to step up and the defense
has to step up,'' Stevens said. ``They did today. It's nice to win
a close game. It will help down the line in crunch time, knowing
you have the confidence to pull these kind of games out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In doing so yesterday, the Rangers won their sixth consecutive
game, a winning streak that has come about with the resurgence of
their starting pitching. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark did the job yesterday with his best outing of the
season, holding the Twins to two runs on four hits in seven
innings. He didn't walk a batter and struck out four. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went out there, kept the ball down, threw strikes and
got ahead of hitters,'' Clark said. ``These are the kind of games
we have to win. It's easy to go out there and win when you score 10
or 12 runs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers haven't had to do that during the winning streak.
Their starters have a 4.84 earned-run average during the streak, a
significant improvement considering they were giving a seven runs
an outing before the streak started. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You look over the last six days, I'm very pleased with the
pitching staff,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``I thought it would
only be a matter of time before they got it together. Our staff has
a much better track record than that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has a 0.46 ERA in the past six games. Jeff Zimmerman
pitched a scoreless eighth yesterday for the victory and John
Wetteland worked the ninth for his major-league leading 16th save.
He has converted 10 consecutive save opportunities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All our pitching was outstanding today,'' Oates said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars only wish their guy could have been as good. &QL;

DODGERS GET BREAK ON MISTAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Los Angeles Dodgers got one clutch hit Sunday,
which was one more than they had the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Neither day, in the short term, did it matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 in 11 innings at Turner
Field to win their second straight series. And they won two of
three against the NL East's first-place Braves despite getting one
hit in 32 at-bats with a runner in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   They won because they didn't make the big mistake. The Braves
did. It came when first baseman Ryan Klesko didn't catch the ball
on third baseman Chipper Jones' throw in the 11th inning. It
allowed Eric Karros to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to return the favor when they whipped us two of
three at our ballpark,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``They
broke, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but the Dodgers' strongest piece of armor was dented.
Right-hander Kevin Brown had a 4-1 lead entering the eighth inning
but tired in the heat, humidity and from the Braves' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   After dominating the Braves for much of the afternoon, Brown
gave up a single to Keith Lockhart and consecutive doubles to
Chipper Jones, Brian Jordan and Klesko as the Braves tied it 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   With the way things have gone for the Dodgers (26-23) so far,
that's usually disaster because then everything begins falling
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jones hit that ball to left I thought, `Oh, no, the worm
has turned for the Braves,' because he wasn't on (Brown) at all,''
Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said. ``(Jones) was talking about how
nasty it was to hit against him and bang, a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And with it the three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, pitching in his home state and in front of friends and
family, admitted he was fatigued after throwing 116 pitches in 71/3
innings. The four earned runs were the most Brown yielded since he
allowed six to Philadelphia on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days it's not the number of pitches,'' said Brown, who
had given up one earned run in each of his past four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran out of gas. It wasn't a day where it was really
easy body-wise. It was constant work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like that for the Dodgers' offense all series.
</P>
<P>
   When third baseman Adrian Beltre hit a three-run homer off
Atlanta's Greg Maddux in the fourth inning, he became the only
Dodger in the series to get a hit with a runner in scoring
position. They went 1 for 16 against Maddux and four relievers, but
the Braves blinked in the 11th. Eric Karros doubled with one out,
and Beltre was intentionally walked by Mike Remlinger. Mark
Grudzielanek grounded to third, Jones threw to Klesko, who dropped
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger (2-1) took the loss. Former Braves reliever Pedro
Borbon (1-1) got his first win in nearly three years and Jeff Shaw
recorded his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is you find a way to win instead of lose,''
Dodgers hitting coach Rick Down said. ``We're not where we should
be offensively, but we're winning ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .301 with runners in scoring position in May, the
Dodgers went hitless in their first 22 such at-bats against the
Braves. They also failed in their final nine at-bats with runners
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, including the series finale in Cincinnati, the Dodgers
went 24 hitless at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   And if not for Atlanta starter Tom Glavine's wildness in
Saturday's Dodgers win _ he walked in two runs _ the Dodgers would
be heading to Pittsburgh wondering what's going on. They were 0 for
15 with runners in scoring position and, in the series, failed to
score four times after leadoff doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a tough one (to lose), because we had our
ace in there and we're going into the eighth inning ahead,'' said
second baseman Eric Young, who made a diving stop on Ozzie
Guillen's grounder to end the game. ``It would have been a quiet
trip to Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers go to Pittsburgh in search of their first
three-game winning streak since April turned into May.

   SHOOTING-AFTERMATH (SHORELINE, Wash.) _ His eyes red and
stinging Sunday from the tear gas fumes that still lingered in his
house, Fred Westphal pointed to the blood-soaked sheets crumpled on
one of his sons' beds. It was on the bed that 21-year-old Lonnie
Davis stood gasping for breath through a shattered window as he
made his last furious stand before a police sniper killed him with
a bullet to the head, after Davis' bloody rampage through two
Seattle suburbs on Friday. Westphal returned Sunday to the
four-bedroom home he's rented the past 11 years _ and for the first
time witnessed the ghoulish spectacle that took his breath away.

   Guess what Bill Gates served media giant Martha Stewart, the top
executives of Ford and Alcoa, and the other guests the first night
of the Microsoft CEO summit last Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   Halibut and asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what my wife and I had for dinner last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, halibut and asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   No, there were no e-mail messages passing between our kitchen
and a somewhat more elaborate one at the Gates' mansion in Medina,
Wash. But I can tell you how we both chose the same menu. Sometime
Monday morning, Bill or Melinda Gates heeded the newspaper ads and
headed for the supermarket to pick up some first-of-the-season
Copper River salmon. So did we. Obviously, we had the identical
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   At exactly the same moment we were all hollering at the top of
our lungs, ``Twelve ninety-nine a pound!!!???''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Gates' relationship with Netscape, Yahoo or the
attorney generals of 19 renegade states.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new national scandal on display at your neighborhood
seafood counter.
</P>
<P>
   What have they been feeding those fish: high-octane Winnebago
juice? Or are some Western tribes trying to run up the price of
whale blubber?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates and I aren't going to take it anymore. We opted for
halibut. If brokers drive up the price of halibut, we are prepared
to fall back and form a new defensive line adjacent to the sardine
and anchovy display at our favorite supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   To the barriers! Don't shoot until you see the white of their
tartar sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, halibut is just about my favorite seafood meal and I'm
not just saying that because I'm cheap. Even though that happens to
be the case.
</P>
<P>
   My mother prepared halibut steaks like this and I've never been
able to improve upon her simple recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Mom's Halibut
</P>
<P>
   2 halibut steaks
</P>
<P>
   10 or 12 saltine-style crackers
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs or equivalent of egg substitute
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Butter or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Paprika
</P>
<P>
   Bust up the crackers with a rolling pin. Don't use a food
processor or you'll have cracker dust, not crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the eggs and add a tablespoon or two of water. Mix again.
</P>
<P>
   Add salt and pepper to the crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Heat enough butter or oil to coat the bottom of a skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Dip each steak in egg, press into the cracker crumbs, then
repeat on other side.
</P>
<P>
   The steaks should produce a slight sizzle when you put them in
the pan. Lift up with a spatula after a couple of minutes. When the
cracker crumbs are golden brown, turn the halibut and cook the
other side. When steaks are golden brown outside, the halibut
should be perfectly cooked inside.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with poached asparagus and boiled new potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   If his company's stock drops to $35, Gates may have to rethink
the menu before next year's CEO summit. He could use lingcod or
some other inexpensive fish fillets to create this spicy meal,
which might have been brought back to Seattle after one of
Microsoft's recruiting trips to Bombay Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   Bombay Fish
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half pounds fish cut into 4 fillets
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   one-half teaspoon ground turmeric
</P>
<P>
   one-half teaspoon red chili flakes
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half tablespoons ketchup
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup water
</P>
<P>
   Chopped cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper the fish fillets and dust lightly with flour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the fish fillets for 1
minute on each side or slightly longer for thick portions. Remove
to a warm plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add the onion and garlic to the pan and saute over medium heat
until soft, adding more oil if needed. Add to the pan the
coriander, cumin, turmeric and chili flakes and cook 30 seconds.
Add the ketchup and water and moosh everything around with a carved
wooden (or uncarved plastic) back scratcher. In the event you have
not acquired any souvenirs from the last business trip to Bombay,
you could use a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   When ingredients of the pan have been mooshed, return the fish
fillets and cook 1 minute on each side or until done.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon the pan sauces over the fillets and scatter cilantro over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   This will serve Stewart, Janet Reno and two corporate CEOs. But
keep an eye on those two industrial moguls. I've heard unconfirmed
reports that they sent out last Wednesday night for pizzas.

RIVAL'S SUIT SAYS MICROSOFT BARRED ACCESS TO CRUCIAL DATA
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the trial in the government's antitrust case against
Microsoft Corp. resumes Tuesday in Washington, evidence in a
separate trial set to open this week in Connecticut seems to offer
tantalizing support for an assertion that the company's rivals have
made for years _ that Microsoft wields its industry-standard
Windows operating system as a club to control the software
business.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the Connecticut case is an issue that has been raised
peripherally by several government witnesses in the Washington case
_ how Microsoft controls its competitors' understanding of
application program interfaces, or APIs.
</P>
<P>
   APIs are the paths into and out of the operating system that
programmers must follow for their software _ spreadsheets, Internet
browsers, picture editing and so on _ to run efficiently. Rivals
have long said that Microsoft gives them only rudimentary maps of
the Windows APIs, making it impossible to compete with the designs
of Microsoft's own applications programmers, who enjoy a detailed
road map of Windows, complete with little backroads and alleys that
can be used as shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismisses such contentions as whining by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But in an internal e-mail memo to several senior Microsoft
executives on Feb. 28, 1996, Mark Ryland, a company manager,
observed matter-of-factly, ``Microsoft learned long ago that to
control the APIs is to control the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That memo is among thousands of internal Microsoft documents
filed in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., as part of a
private antitrust suit scheduled to go to trial on Wednesday. Among
other things, they show a spirited debate inside Microsoft over how
much of its software should run ``cross-platform'' _ that is, on
competing operating systems like Unix, the platform for many large
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   The suit in Connecticut is not directly related to the
government's sweeping antitrust case. But the Justice Department
and the 19 states suing Microsoft are eagerly awaiting the evidence
in the Connecticut case because it focuses squarely on the issue of
technology access.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Bristol Technology Inc., a small software maker
in Danbury, charges that Microsoft illegally cut off its access to
Windows technology after three years of cooperation and says that
Microsoft had a ``duty to deal'' with it.

   WALLINGFORD, Conn. _ Cathy Smittner has spent the past eight
months coaching her 3-year-old grandson, Lenny Smittner, on the
fine points of firing a pellet rifle at silhouettes and clay
pigeons in the back yard, starting with the rule that he doesn't
put his finger on the trigger unless he is ready to squeeze it.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Smittner, 49, a secretary who is a competition bulls-eye
shooter, the lessons are all about safety, discipline and
sportsmanship. But she said one of her neighbors finds the whole
idea of giving a 3-year-old a real gun wacky and even terrifying,
and she fears that he is about to get another kind of weapon to use
against her, courtesy of the Connecticut Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a wave of gun restrictions that is surging through
the nation's legislatures since the April massacre in Littleton,
Colo., lawmakers in Connecticut are supporting a measure that would
allow police to get warrants to enter the residence and seize the
firearms of a citizen who ``poses a risk of imminent personal
injury to himself or herself or to other individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors that a judge would consider before issuing
such a warrant are whether the person has made threats, brandished
a firearm, engaged in ``recent acts of cruelty to animals''or
behaved erratically. Within two weeks after the guns are picked up,
a court must hold a hearing to determine whether the firearms
should be returned or ``held by the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-rights activists contend that the proposal validates their
worst fears: This time, they say, the state really is coming to get
their guns. These gun owners say they fear that neighbors will
report them to police as being erratic simply for acts that the
neighbors dislike or find strange.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has drawn close attention by both sides in the national
gun-control debate, because Connecticut already is one of the five
toughest states on guns, and the warrant approach is seen as a
possible new frontier for firearms restrictions when legislatures
reconvene next winter just before the congressional and
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ricker, the executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, the lobbying group for firearms manufacturers,
called the provision ``absolutely a nightmare'' that could
legitimize retaliation in everything from custody disputes to spats
about barking dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Sudbay, the director of state legislation for Handgun
Control Inc., said he sees clippings all the time about people who
kill with guns after giving off warning signs. ``One of the
recurring themes after these incidents is that people knew there
was a danger but were at a loss for what to do,'' he said.
``Connecticut is trying to at least provide a forum to address that
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the warrant bill, which has passed two legislative
committees and is headed for consideration by the state House and
Senate in the next two weeks, say it will allow the authorities to
prevent tragedies when there are warning signs like the ones some
parents and classmates said were obvious before the shooting at
Columbine High School in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, however, has dubbed it the
``Turn in Your Neighbor'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smacks of some sort of totalitarian regime, where kids are
urged to report their parents to the party,'' said Robert Crook,
the executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen,
the state's biggest hunting group. ``If I walk out of my house with
a gun, that's one of the criteria. If I have an animal-rights
person next to me and I'm shooting in my yard and he thinks my dog
doesn't like it, he's got me.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. George Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford who is the
majority leader, replied that if people wanted to make up stories
about their neighbors, they could do that now by accusing them of
assault or some other crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deals with very concrete situations where a guy is
clearly going off the wall while legally in possession of
weapons,'' Jepsen said. ``Tragically, it's utterly predictable that
sooner or later, somebody is going to kill people in Connecticut,
and it will have been perfectly clear to people around the shooter
that he should not have had the guns he legally possessed.''
</P>
<P>
   That is little consolation to the beleaguered
Second-Amendment-first crowd, which now may be cornered. At the
snack bar of the Blue Trail Range and Gun Shop here in Wallingford
during a recent lunch hour, the talk included not just the usual
excuses for a poor round at the range (``the world was turning''),
but bitter and somewhat resigned griping about the upper hand
apparently held by gun-control supporters, who are racing to use as
leverage the fears of guns that have been stirred up among suburban
voters since the Littleton and other school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't catch the criminals, but they can find us,'' said
Al Jacobs, 62, a retired electronics worker. ``We're an easy
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't taking mine away,'' Arthur Rasmussen, a
57-year-old veterinarian, said with mock menace, drawing laughs
from his buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the range later, Timothy Srenaski helped his 13-year-old
son, Andrew, use a .22-caliber rifle to blast tight circles into a
target pinned 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Littleton was a terrible tragedy, but it would be an equally
large tragedy for legislators to overreact,'' said Srenaski, 42, a
building contractor. ``Those kids had bombs and propane tanks, too.
Why go after the guns?''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators point out that they had proposed the warrant measure
even before the shootings in Colorado, although they say this
spring's wave of school violence _ and the political fear and
opportunism that have followed _ have given the bill a much better
chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland, a Republican who seems to become more
moderate by the month, said he has not made a decision about which
of several gun-control proposals he would sign, but said, ``If
there's some reasonable way to make it safer out there, I'll always
support that.''
</P>
<P>
   The warrant provision was written by state Rep. Michael Lawlor,
a Democrat from East Haven and the co-chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, who said he thought of it after a fatal shooting rampage
by an employee at the state lottery headquarters last year.

 (Editors: Restores credit line)   Millennium Jet Founder Has Sky-High Ambitions 
 &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Millennium Jet Inc. founder Mike Moshier is chasing two dreams that
humans have pursued almost since the dawn of time.
<P>
   He wants to fly like a bird.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to make money.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping that his invention, the SoloTrek Exo-Skelitor Flying
Vehicle, takes off and makes both dreams come true. And right now,
Moshier's not worried that the idea sounds as improbable as if he
were trying to fly by flapping the mythical wax wings of Daedelus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so different than anything else that exists today,''
the former Navy jet combat pilot said of his one-person flying
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pumped a million dollars into this thing, and if I
thought it were not doable, I know I could find better uses for
that million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, secretly working out of a Santa Clara
office-warehouse, Moshier, 51, and partner Robert Bulaga, 47, an
aerospace engineer, have developed the SoloTrek XFV with money that
Moshier made from other successful Silicon Valley ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Now Millennium Jet is about three months away from the first
test flight of the SoloTrek, an eight-foot-tall contraption
designed to let a single passenger/pilot fly as fast as 80 mph, for
as long as 90 minutes and as high as 10,000 feet, all on a single
tank of regular 87-octane gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder, 130-horsepower engine spins a set of two
injection-molded rotor blades positioned above the pilot's head
like wings. The blades provide the thrust for vertical takeoffs and
landings and for forward motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can land anywhere the size of a dining room table,''
Moshier said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot is strapped into the SoloTrek in a standing position
and tilts the rotors to go up, down or forward using two
hand-controlled joysticks. The craft employs a high-tech retinal
eye-scan system to prevent untrained pilots from taking off. It has
sensors that adjust the craft to the pilot's weight and experience
and that can warn of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Moshier says it's different than the rocket belt, the Buck
Rogers-style fuel-burning jet pack used in the opening ceremonies
of the 1984 Olympics _ also familiar from movies like ``The
Rocketeer'' and the James Bond series. Rocket belts exist and
actually fly _ but only for about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, single-person flying machines have come and
gone, from Renaissance inventor-artist Leonardo da Vinci's 15th
century ``Orthinocopter'' to Hiller Aircraft's ``Flying Platform''
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never gone anywhere because they've never been
practical,'' Moshier said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Silicon Valley entrepreneur believes the SoloTrek
will go where no other flying machine has gone before. Imagine, he
said, being able to soar high above the maddening rush-hour traffic
on the Bay Bridge or the Sunol Grade.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, he said, immigration agents in SoloTreks flying patrol
over the country's borders, or search and rescue workers swooping
down to help an injured hiker deep in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Jet's detailed Web site, at www.solotrek.com, even
imagines ``journalists who use SoloTrek XFV as a vehicle for their
reporting assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshier hesitated to say what he thought each SoloTrek might
cost though he guessed that it one day could sell for the price of
``a very expensive car.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Moshier and Bulaga, the company's only two employees,
believe that Millennium Jet's first customers will be the military
or government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Bulaga, who has 25 years of experience as an aeronautical
engineer, imagines ``it would be a cool thing to see'' a phalanx of
400 flying Marines headed for a beach invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Millennium Jet still has to prove that the SoloTrek actually
can fly before the company can get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And even then, Bay Area industrialist and air historian Stanley
Hiller said the company faces a long and costly road trying to get
clearance from stringent aviation and government safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish them every success, but I have seen nothing new
technically to think that it's a practical machine,'' said Hiller,
who knows more than a few things about inventing newfangled flying
machines.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager in the 1940s, Hiller designed the first helicopter
to fly on the West Coast. His XH-44 ``Hiller-copter'' laid the
foundation for his Hiller Aircraft Co. of Palo Alto, one of four
companies that started the helicopter industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Hiller Aircraft designed and flew the Flying
Platform, a single-person craft that used similar ``ducted fan''
technology as the SoloTrek. The company also produced a one-person
rescue aircraft for use in the Korean War, but the conflict ended
before the aircraft could be mass produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every back yard tinkerer has an idea for a vertical takeoff
machine,'' said Hiller, who helped found the Hiller Aviation Museum
that opened last year at the San Carlos Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a single-seat rocket belt or rotor system
(aircraft) comes and goes like a wave,'' Hiller said. ``Hundreds of
people per year try and take a dream of an everyman's and
everywoman's aircraft, make it safe and sound and quiet and easy to
fly. And that has never been accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum had a panel of 20 highly regarded university
professors and aerospace engineers look into the future of aviation
and ``they did not see a practical market for small one-man
aircraft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dream but an impractical dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moshier, though, said he is confident that he will make SoloTrek
a reality. He has made enough money from his earlier ventures
though he would welcome ``strategic partners.''
</P>
<P>
   He sold his previous venture, Talus Corp., a precision
sheet-metal fabrication company in Santa Clara, in 1997. Before
that, he was co-owner of MOPAR LLC, a Silicon Valley real estate
development company. He also had owned a company that made
workstations used for silicon wafer fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the concept of building a solo flying machine
remained ``my lifetime passion,'' he said. In a way, he already has
achieved one of his goals with the Millennium Jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is defined by doing what you like to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moshier, however, won't be trying to copy the Wright brothers
and be the first to fly the SoloTrek. He will hire a test pilot for
the experimental flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife made me promise I won't fly any higher than I am
willing to fall,'' Moshier said.

DISPUTE OVER BRADLEY'S ENDORSEMENT OVERSHADOWS CITY COUNCIL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The battle over the legacy of former Mayor Tom
Bradley, who died last year, is looming large in a tight Los
Angeles City Council race, centering on a disputed campaign letter
asserting that just before his death, Bradley endorsed the
incumbent councilman.
</P>
<P>
   The councilman, Nate Holden, a three-decade veteran of Los
Angeles politics who ran against Bradley for mayor in 1989, issued
the mailing days before the April 13 primary. It consisted of a
letter, written by Bill Elkins, a longtime associate and confidant
of Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins wrote that Bradley had met with Holden several times not
long before his death and at the last meeting ``made a commitment
to ask the residents of the 10th District to support Councilman
Nate Holden.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden finished first in the four-candidate primary, but he did
not garner enough votes to win outright and now faces a runoff with
the second-place candidate, Madison Shockley, a pastor and
community advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement letter outraged Shockley's camp, as well as
Bradley's friends, aides and daughter Lorraine Bradley. They have
all come forward as the June 8 runoff election approaches to
express anger and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   They say that there had long been hostility between Bradley and
Holden and that after a heart attack and a stroke, Bradley had been
unable to speak for the last two years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no Mayor Bradley endorsement,'' said David Cunningham,
whom Bradley had backed to succeed him in the 10th District when he
was elected mayor. Holden succeeded Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really wanted to see this man get animated,''
Cunningham said, ``all you had to do was mention Nate Holden's
name.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Holden said he had reconciled with Bradley in
recent years. He said he had led an effort to name the top floor of
Los Angeles City Hall after Bradley and to commission a $13,000
bust of him to be placed there. Holden said the doubters were
political and personal enemies, and he recounted the meeting in
which he said Bradley gave him his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go out and meet him in the district, and he'd point at
things he wanted me to do _ planting trees, pulling weeds, stuff
like that,'' Holden said, adding that Bradley could communicate
with a few words and the thumbs-up sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, you know, I'm running for re-election,'''
Holden said. ``And he'd say, `good, good, good,' thumbs up. And I'd
say, `Can I count on your endorsement?'''
</P>
<P>
   Holden said Bradley had nodded yes and given him a thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins, who wrote the letter describing Bradley's endorsement,
did not return several phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said Bradley had continued to express his dislike for
Holden until three weeks before his death. City Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who represents the neighboring Crenshaw District,
accused Holden of deceitful politics and said the endorsement claim
had been met with disbelief and derision by council members.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th District, among the most densely populated in Los
Angeles, covers parts of Koreatown, South Central and the mid-city
area. The district has seen rapid shifts in its demographics in the
last 30 years, going from a majority white district in the early
1960s, to a majority black district in the late 1970s to a majority
Hispanic district today, as it retains pockets of Asian and
non-Hispanic white residents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who had a reputation as a builder of coalitions across
racial lines, got his political start in the 10th District, serving
as the district's councilman in the 1960s before becoming mayor in
1973. The value of his endorsement is incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   Holden's assertion has turned what was otherwise a heated
election over municipal issues into a considerable controversy in
Los Angeles politics.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mailing, Shockley, a pastor at the 265-member
Congregational Church of Christian Fellowship and advocate of
changes in the police department and improvement in race relations,
had campaigned on plans to develop more parks and open space, bring
in more business development and give voters more opportunity for
civic participation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shockley has sent out his own mailing, in which Lorraine
Bradley remarks: ``It is impossible for me to say whether or not my
father wished to endorse Nate Holden. I do know for a fact that my
father consistently refused to support Councilman Nate Holden on
numerous occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden counters: ``No. 1, if Bill Elkins said the mayor did it,
he did it. No. 2, I was there when he did it. They can put that in
their pipe and smoke it.''

STRUGGLING FOR DOMINANCE, DENVER'S 2 DAILIES KEEP READERS IN MIND
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With street vendors hawking extra editions, two-year
subscriptions going for a penny a paper and advertising discounts
that produce some of the world's fattest newspapers, the flagship
papers of two big newspaper empires are locked in combat here.
While most American cities are one-newspaper towns, Denver has a
war that pits The Denver Post, a broadsheet owned by Media News
Group, the nation's seventh-largest newspaper chain, against The
Denver Rocky Mountain News, a tabloid owned by E.W. Scripps Co.,
the eighth-largest chain.
</P>
<P>
   While newspaper circulation stagnates around the nation, trucks
in Denver deliver 360,000 more newspapers each week than they did
at this time last year. Based on a 10.4 percent year-over-year
circulation jump for the first quarter, The News now describes
itself as ``the fastest-growing major daily newspaper in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekday circulation race is a virtual dead heat, with The
News reporting 359,068, and the Post reporting 370,423. In the
Sunday race, The Post has a wider margin, selling 523,324, compared
with 461,000 for The News.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reversing eight years of circulation declines,
The News is also creating the editorial buzz in town. Repositioning
itself as an upscale tabloid similar to Newsday, the Long Island
daily, it is generously using color, publishing new sections and
showing that it can turn on a dime to respond to breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, we asked focus groups to compare our newspaper to a
car, and they said we were a pickup,'' said Linda Sease, The News'
vice president for marketing. ``Two years later, they said, `a
sports utility vehicle.' Hey, I'll be an SUV any day _ they are
hip, trendy, young, expensive.''

QUINN BROTHERS LEARN FROM EACH OTHER IN MAKING `THIS IS MY
FATHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The eyes are the giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know Aidan and Paul Quinn were even related if you
hadn't gazed into their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They're steely blue, intense and kind.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers are visiting Seattle for the second time to promote
their film, ``This Is My Father.'' They were here last June, along
with big brother Declan, when their movie concluded the Seattle
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Aidan, of course, is a movie star. He's made two films a year
since his big-screen debut in 1984's ``Reckless.'' He's since acted
with the likes of Annette Bening in ``In Dreams,'' Madonna in
``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' Sandra Bullock in ``Practical
Magic'' and Brad Pitt in ``Legends of the Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   He's worked on such high-profile projects as Kenneth Branagh's
``Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,'' Barry Levinson's ``Avalon,''
Roland Joffe's ``The Mission,'' Neil Jordan's ``Michael Collins,''
Jeremiah Chechik's ``Benny and Joon'' and Al Pacino's ``Looking for
Richard.'' He's been in more than 30 films.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, on the other hand, began as an actor in the theater,
working with John Cusack and Tim Robbins (Cusack has a small role
in the film) before turning to filmmaking. ``This Is My Father'' is
his directorial debut.
</P>
<P>
   Declan provided the brooding look. The cinematographer, who
worked on such visually distinguished films as ``Leaving Las
Vegas'' and ``Kama Sutra,'' creates the mood for this poignant,
fragile film, which follows the journey to Ireland of Chicago
high-school teacher Kieran Johnson, played by James Caan.
</P>
<P>
   With his mother ailing, Johnson, accompanied by his nephew,
travels to Galway in an effort to unravel the mystery of his
long-gone father. Through the stories of an old traveler, he's
transported back to 1939. Kieran learns the story of the
star-crossed love affair between his mother and father _ also named
Kieran.
</P>
<P>
   He discovers his dad, a quiet, religious farmer, fell in love
with his mom, the 17-year-old daughter of the small town's rich
widow and landowner. Their unlikely romance brought intermittent
joy _ and ultimate tragedy _ to the couple. But it also held a
future.
</P>
<P>
   Paul says he originally wrote the script as a 1939 period piece
but struggled with it and wondered why he was telling the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading some screenplay writing notes from a class
taught by Robert McKee and he asks, `What do you want to tell a
modern audience when you're writing a period piece?' I couldn't
answer the question so I came up with the idea of a teacher and
that gave it a context and then I easily could put the generations
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Aidan says he gained quite a bit of weight to play the elder
Kieran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't hard with all the Guinness and fries, sausages and
eggs you get for breakfast over there. I had false teeth too. We
worked very hard against making the character good looking. We
wanted him to be a little on the outs in society. He's a farmer. I
felt like I knew this man; they're in my own family: shy, awkward,
simple men who speak with their bodies, not words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is My Father'' had an even more personal investment for
the Quinns. Paul says he entered into the project ``with a certain
amount of fear'' at working with his family but acknowledges it
became a blessing because they had already ``left a ton of baggage
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a shorthand with Declan and Aidan,'' he said. ``I knew
their aesthetics. If I had worked with other actors or a different
cinematographer, it would have taken weeks to learn their
sensibilities. And we didn't have time for that sort of
education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is My Father'' is, as the 39-year-old director and writer
insists, not about the Quinn clan's own professor father, but a
spin on a childhood story their mother told them. It co-stars a
shining bunch of Irish talent _ Brendan Gleeson, Stephen Rea, Donal
Donnelly and Colm Meaney.
</P>
<P>
   The cast worked for scale and Paul's vision impressed everyone
involved with the film. Aidan _ who says the best directors ``allow
all the departments to contribute; they aren't auteurs'' and the
way to go is to ``hire creative people and actors and let them do
their jobs'' _ says his younger brother is a natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best films I've been in and possibly the
best part I've ever played. I've played Hamlet, though, and,'' he
says, laughing, ``I can't quite compare it to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this film has spoiled me in a way and spurred me on to get
involved with creating my own work. I'm really frustrated with the
lack of good parts that come my way from the studios. There are
those top five guys and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to work with my brothers and sister again but
it's a matter of logistics. Our sister Marian has just written a
beautiful script that we may do in December. I'll have a small role
and Declan will shoot it, so once again, three of us will be
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Aidan says part of his enthusiasm for creating his own work
stems from the fact that he turned 40 in March. And while Hollywood
is known for being rough on its leading ladies, Quinn, who just
finished ``50 Violins'' with Meryl Streep, says he's ``going
through a complete crisis right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I read this report that came out that says actors turning 40
face a significant drop in roles. Of course it's worse for women,
but I'm definitely concerned about it. So again, I have to create
my own options, get things produced and buy little novels to
develop for film.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, he sheepishly acknowledges that he could go on ``ad
nauseum'' about Streep.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's remarkable,'' he gushes. ``I've never met anyone as
graceful; she has a sense of humor, she's very funny, down to earth
and a great mom. And she loved our film,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   But Aidan isn't as generous about the up-and-coming troop of
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet a lot of actors who ask for advice and when I query
them and look into their eyes and say `What do you want?' you
realize what they really want is to be famous. They aren't drawn
into the craft for the love of it. That's a dangerous way to
approach it. Certain people can do it, but not many. Most fall into
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really been scared of obscurity before,'' he
laments, ``but now I am because of the age factor. And obscurity
happened to me once. I did `Reckless' and made 15, 20 thousand
dollars. I remember thinking there was no way I could spend all
that money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I partied and took everybody I knew out to eat. And I ran out
of cash. I took a job waiting tables. I was so embarrassed because
I'd meet all these actors from the theater and they'd sit in my
section and say, `Hey Aidan, how ya' doin'? Didn't you just make a
movie. What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   With his salad days behind him, could he depend upon his family
for a juicy role?
</P>
<P>
   Paul says he never thought of Aidan to play Kieran when he wrote
his script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew that,'' says Aidan. ``I thought you wrote it with
me in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think of anyone when I was writing the script,'' Paul
responds. ``After I finished I thought, `How stupid. Why didn't I
tailor this for Aidan?' In retrospect I'm glad I didn't. He became
more soulful and touching than I imagined because he came from the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Paul admits he learned a valuable lesson from his
first foray into mainstream filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how much an image can tell a story. You don't need
many words. But I had to learn the lesson by going through the
process.''

CASAMAYOR BOXING AS MUCH FOR HIS FUTURE AS PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya won the United States' only
boxing gold medal in the 1992 Olympics. In the same Games, Joel
Casamayor captured one of the seven golds won by Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   To say that they have taken divergent paths since then is a
gross understatement: De La Hoya has parlayed his triumph into fame
and riches, while Casamayor, one of the great amateurs of his time,
has largely faded from memory outside his Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   Until now?
</P>
<P>
   Casamayor, 27, defected from his communist homeland three years
ago and, working with trainer Joe Goossen in Van Nuys, could become
the first Cuban of his generation to win a professional world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   He faces Antonio Hernandez on June 19 in Miami for the right to
challenge WBA junior lightweight champion Takanori Hatakeyama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get the belt,'' he said through his co-manager
Leonardo Edgar, who heads Miami-based Team Freedom, which is
composed of a dozen Cuban defectors and other Latin American
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I'll decide what I'm going to do with my life.
Right now, that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, life wasn't so bad in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Casamayor, who grew up in Guantanamo, where as a child he'd
watch in awe as American jet fighters flew to and from the U.S.
military base, is close to his family. He treasures his 5-year-old
daughter, with whom he said he was inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   And he was a star, at least by Cuban standards. Wherever he
went, people knew him and treated him like the gold of his medal.
He was poor but he was special
</P>
<P>
   His success in the ring also allowed him unique privileges, the
most cherished being travel. He had the opportunity to compete
around the world, while the vast majority of his countrymen were
trapped within Cuba's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in sports, in any sport, are definitely treated
differently,'' Casamayor said.
</P>
<P>
   They're also treated poorly, which was one reason he ultimately
fled.
</P>
<P>
   Casamayor had trained diligently and intended to compete in the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta. However, by the time he and the Cuban
boxing team traveled to Guadalajara, Mexico, to train in the months
before the Games, he had made a decision: He had accepted an offer
while still in Cuba from someone who would help him and teammate
Ramon Garbey defect in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He agonized over the decision.
</P>
<P>
   He would have to leave his family for an indefinite period of
time, perhaps forever. He couldn't even tell them about it
beforehand. He trusted no one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the risk of being caught. If the plan failed, he
could say goodbye to his privileged life and any hopes of gaining
what he coveted most _ freedom and the opportunity to fight
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought of the suffocating pressure applied to him and
his teammates by Cuban boxing authorities _ which, to him, was
symbolic of the country's oppressive society _ and he knew what he
had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had doubts (in Guadalajara), I thought of the pressure
they put on me to make 119 pounds,'' he said. ``It was very, very
difficult to make that weight but they threatened me: `If you don't
make weight, we'll send you back to Cuba.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That stayed in my head; that made me strong.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, he told his chaperone that he was going to walk down
the street to buy a bottle of water and would be right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still waiting there for me I think,'' he said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment wasn't easy in the United States, even in his new
home of Miami, which has a large Cuban population.
</P>
<P>
   One, he was no longer a star.
</P>
<P>
   He would be recognized occasionally. For example, he attended an
autograph session in Miami with close friend and fellow defector
Livian ``El Duque'' Hernandez of the Florida Marlins, and a few
people of Cuban heritage asked for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   However, that was the exception. In fact, he had become just
another promising fighter who dreamed of a world championship and
the money that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, he pined for his family _ particularly his little
girl, who he had with a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He cried as he lay in bed many nights in the beginning, he said.
And, even now, he misses his mother, siblings and daughter
terribly, particularly because Cuban authorities pressured his
mother to sever ties with him and he hasn't spoken to anyone back
home in four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter, that's the toughest thing,'' he said. ``It's
very, very painful. In Cuba, I used to be with her all the time. I
even took her to my fights. I'm sure she misses me a lot, I'm sure
it's frustrating for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is more important than anything, believe me. But,
here, I'm able to help them. I always find a way to get them money,
and my dream is to bring them here. That's my biggest dream.''
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Casamayor (17-0, with 11 knockouts) must win
a world championship before the money rolls in.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, who took over Casamayor's training about a year ago
largely because of distractions in Miami, described the left-handed
fighter as a cross between Pernell Whitaker and Michael Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his boxing skills, honed in Cuba's remarkable amateur
system, are impeccable. Sparring partner Carlos Hernandez, a
contender himself, described Casamayor as ``sooooo smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he has had to adjust to the professional style of
boxing. That includes adding power to his punches and the ability
and willingness to exchange blows inside.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has learned a great deal under Goossen. And Goossen
likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won everything there is to win as an amateur,'' Goossen
said. ``The Pan Am Games, the Olympic Festival, the Olympics,
everything. He's a winner. He wins no matter the difficulties along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see him falling short of winning this title,
especially because Joel made the commitment to leave Florida and
his old trainer and come out here. Even after his last two fights
he went home for one, two weeks and then came right back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's giving me 100 percent. That makes me work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as Casamayor said, ``I want to be a star
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Add Casamayor: The Casamayor-Hernandez fight is for the
``interim'' WBA title, according to the fight organizers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the winner must face Hatakeyama to become the true
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Felix and Oscar: Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad did what he had to do
Saturday. He whipped relative unknown Hugo Pineda of Colombia in
four rounds to set up the tentative Sept. 18 bout against Oscar De
La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the fight, Trinidad said he expects a deal to
be reached very soon. His father, Felix Sr., the biggest obstacle
to the agreement, wouldn't go as far as his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can reach an agreement, especially after this
demonstration that Tito just gave,'' he told a Puerto Rican
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, machine-like, looked spectacular Saturday. However,
such a victory over a no-name like Pineda means very little. De La
Hoya has rendered such opponents _ Patrick Charpentier, for example
_ just as helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Weighty issue: Trinidad reportedly had to shed 18 pounds in two
months to make the 147-pound limit for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He could be in trouble if he has difficulty getting down to
welterweight for the De La Hoya fight. That kind of weight loss,
while not unusual, tends to sap energy.
</P>
<P>
   Another walkover?: Light heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr.
(39-1, 33 KOs) will face one of his biggest challenges when he
climbs into the ring with Reggie Johnson (39-5-1, 24 KOs) on
Saturday in Biloxi, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   However, that doesn't mean it's a !ital!significant!off!
challenge. The fact is no one in or near his weight class is
capable of giving him serious trouble. That includes Johnson, who
will lose a one-sided fight.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will be the only fighter in the world to have a
unified title. Jones holds the WBC and WBA belts while Johnson is
the IBF champ.
</P>
<P>
   Also on that card, which will be televised by HBO, Robert Garcia
(32-0, 24 KOs) of Oxnard will defend his IBF junior lightweight
belt against Derrick Gainer (27-4, 17).
</P>
<P>
   Garcia had trouble against the slick Gainer before winning a
close decision the first time the two fought. It probably won't be
any easier this time.
</P>
<P>
   And Vassili Jirov (20-0, 18 KOs), who fights capable Arthur
Williams (30-4-1, 22 KOs), remains intriguing.

IN STUNNING REVERSALS, VENUS WILLIAMS IS UPSET AND AGASSI
ADVANCES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A pair of disparate underdogs _ one an obscure Austrian
with a penchant for literature and power tennis, the other the most
charismatic showman to enliven the men's game _ divested the French
Open of Venus Williams, a favorite to claim the women's title, and
Carlos Moya of Spain, the defending champion Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Williams, who had predicted that Paris would
play host to her first-ever Grand Slam championship, instead
discovered herself a Round of 16 casualty after 125th-ranked
Barbara Schwartz, a qualifier, ambushed her, 2-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, at age 29 on the rebound at the only Grand Slam
event he has never won, dethroned the fourth-seeded Moya, 4-6, 7-5,
7-5, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen her before,'' Williams said of Schwartz,
admitting that she hadn't done any scouting on her opponent.
Williams assumed that it was Schwartz who needed to worry about her
game. But the reverse proved true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when I lose a match, I really beat myself, but this
time I really think she came out and played,'' Williams said after
being repeatedly punished, and caught out of position, by
Schwartz's highly disguised one-handed backhand slice.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, 20, who was busy graduating from school at this time
last year, now faces top-seeded Martina Hingis, a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5)
winner against Ruxandra Dragomir. Hingis said she wouldn't
underestimate Schwartz the way Williams did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take everybody serious from now on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who didn't hide her delight that both Williams sisters
had been extricated from her side of the draw before she had to
worry about meeting them, added, ``I think you're only stupid
yourself if you don't take the player serious.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams joined her 10th-seeded sister, Serena, on the
sideline after falling victim to the most significant upset on the
women's side since 94th-ranked Anna Smashnova ousted fifth-seeded
Jana Novotna in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Moya was bewildered by his loss to Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Agassi plays well, you get crazy,'' said Moya, who didn't
take it well when the Center Court crowd began to chant Agassi's
name like a mantra after he lost the first set, then performed the
wave on his behalf after he held serve for a 6-5 lead in the second
set. Spurred on by the gallery's gyrations, Agassi sprinted off
toward his changeover chair like a hound on a scent, and once play
resumed, he promptly broke Moya to even the match at a set apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had been absorbing a 6-4, 4-1 beating from Moya, who
appeared to be operating his forehand topspin drives and drop shots
by remote control, when he bestirred himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hurting me, just giving me a beating,'' said Agassi a
runner-up here in 1990, when he lost to Andres Gomez, and again in
1991, when Jim Courier outgunned him. ``At 6-4, 4-1, I decided that
if I'm going to lose this, I needed to lose it executing to the
level that I can hit my shots, just start playing bigger, and once
I got the offense, I actually believed I could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had been apprehensive about facing Moya, whom he had
never played before and who had briefly held the No. 1 ranking
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a huge obstacle in my way; I felt good not just
about winning, but about how I won,'' said Agassi, who bedeviled
Moya's game, especially his suspect backhand wing, in the process
of beefing up his own artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who reduced the forlorn Moya to rubble with a backhand
lob at match point, added: ``I felt like a quality first serve and
a quality first shot was putting him in a world of trouble _ I was
quite confident that the match had turned my way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moya couldn't quite run Agassi's lob down and had to fire off
his reply with his back to the net and his racquet between his
legs, a trick shot Agassi had converted with aplomb in his
third-round match against Chris Woodruff. But Moya, who confessed
to entertaining visions of Agassi's straight-set demise once he had
gone up, 6-4, 4-1, dribbled his trick shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinals, Agassi faces another, albeit older,
clay-court war horse in 31-year-old Marcelo Filippini, the ailing
(he has a stomach strain and a virus) Uruguayan qualifier.
Filippini upended the ailing (he has a sore toe) Greg Rusedski, the
No. 12-seeded player from Britain, 7-6 (10-8), 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi hasn't reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal since the 1996
U.S. Open; Filippini has never reached one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that I never played,'' Agassi said. ``I'm kind of
dealing with the same situation that I had today, as well as Venus
had. But I've been watching him, and Brad will give me two earfuls
about it.'' He was referring to his voluble coach, Brad Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who hadn't lost this early in a Grand Slam event since
making a first-round exit from Wimbledon in 1997, held and
surrendered three match points when Schwartz served at 5-6 of the
second set. Williams couldn't protect a 5-4 lead in the tie
breaker, and dragged herself through the final set as if her
sneakers had sprouted roots in the clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know who exactly I was playing,'' Williams
said. ``I just have to do my best in the next Grand Slam. This one
is not mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will it belong to Jennifer Capriati, whose eight-match
undefeated streak, her best showing in six years, was ended Sunday
in the Round of 16 by second-ranked Lindsay Davenport, 6-2, 6-3.
Davenport faces sixth-seeded Steffi Graf in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got halfway through, had a great run, and I'm very
optimistic about the future and other tournaments; this is just a
starting point for me,'' said Capriati, who vowed to let her
racquet do the talking from now on.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Rios, seeded ninth, didn't let a two-sets-to-none
deficit interfere with his designs on a Grand Slam breakthrough
here. He defeated Alberto Berasategui, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, and
next plays Dominik Hrbaty. Monica Seles, seeded third, defeated the
local favorite, Julie Halard-Decugis, 6-1, 7-5, and will face
unseeded Conchita Martinez in the quarterfinals. The defending
women's champion, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, advanced without hitting
a ball when Mary Joe Fernandez, the veteran who upset Serena
Williams, withdrew because of a groin strain. Sanchez Vicario's
next opponent is Sunday's other Austrian upset artist, 34th-ranked
Silvia Plischke, who ousted fourth-seeded Jana Novotna, 6-3, 7-6
(7-5).

 &HT;    How Swede it is for Indy 500 winner
 &HT;    By Ron Ware
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Nobody waves the red, white and blue, especially
on Memorial Day weekend in the heartland, quite like Anthony Joseph
Foyt, who till his dying breath will insist the grittiest race car
drivers are those who learn their trade on the dusty, backwater
dirt tracks.
</P>
<P>
   With maybe a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brack, a slightly built 33-year-old from Karlstad, Sweden,
ended more than two decades of frustration for Gasoline Alley's
leading denizen with a stunning victory in Sunday's 83rd
Indianapolis 500, taking the lead with just over a lap to go when
Robby Gordon lost a gamble trying to stretch his fuel.
</P>
<P>
   For the 64-year-old Foyt, how Swede it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody laughed when I got a foreigner,'' said a grinning
Foyt, who scored the last of his four victories here as a driver in
1977 and has competed solely as a team owner since 1993. ``But I
changed his papers and moved him to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't too bad, is it?'' he asked, turning to his protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little hot,'' Brack politely responded. He didn't
specify whether he was talking about the weather or his owner's
legendary temper.
</P>
<P>
   But Foyt, a twinkle in his eyes, was all smiles after Brack led
a 1-3-6 finish for his three-car team, with red-blooded Americans
Billy Boat and Robbie Buhl following him across the line. He
finished 6.5 seconds ahead of Jeff Ward, with Gordon salvaging
fourth place, the last driver on the lead lap. Rookie Robby McGehee
- whose crew chief, Steve Fried, was critically injured in a
pit-road accident - completed the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring two-time champion Arie Luyendyk and brash Greg Ray were
considered the men to beat, but each took himself out in crashes
just five laps apart after combining to lead 91 of the first 120
trips around the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door for Brack - whose name is pronounced
``Breck'' - but Gordon rolled the dice and pitted for fuel under
caution with 35 laps to go while the other contenders remained out.
When Brack and the others came in during another yellow six laps
later, Gordon moved to the head of the pack - seemingly in command,
provided his fuel supply lasted.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Brack, driving an Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara,
was conceding anything. He sliced what had been a 3.5-second
deficit with five laps to go to just 1.5 seconds with two laps
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   And then Gordon, the only CART regular competing in the Indy
Racing League event, veered onto pit road, his tank nearly dry,
eliciting a roar from the crowd of 330,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to take second,'' Brack said, insisting he
would have caught Gordon, anyway. ``That's why I was running so
hard at the end. I took a few chances, really. Being second in a
race like that isn't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, alternately nicknamed Flash Gordon and Crash Gordon for
his full-throttle style, was devastated. One of Foyt's many former
drivers, he was trying to provide billionaire John Menard his first
victory at Indy in a drought nearly as long as Foyt's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very frustrated,'' Gordon said. ``We just made one
mistake - it didn't pick up the last two gallons (of fuel) or we
didn't get the last two gallons in the car. One mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also all it took to sideline Luyendyk, who crashed on lap
115 trying to get past 20th-place Tyce Carlson, and Ray, who pulled
into the path of Mark Dismore exiting his pit five laps later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving with so much confidence,'' said Luyendyk, who
announced last year he would retire following the race. ``Maybe the
confidence bit me. Maybe I should have waited longer to pass the
yellow car (Carlson). I thought he moved to the right, then he
moved back (down) on me. I had to slow down, and that upset the
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carlson: ``I gave him all the room in the world. I don't
know why everybody's asking me all these questions.''
</P>
<P>
   One mistake also was all it took to produce the day's only
serious injury. With spectator safety at the forefront following

AT-BAT BY AT-BAT, JETER'S STAR IS ASCENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ As he waits his turn to bat from the on-deck circle,
Derek Jeter glances curiously at the fans sitting in box seats
nearby, like a playful seal checking for youngsters outside his pen
at the zoo. If somebody engages him, Jeter will answer with a grin.
Sometimes he sees a child and asks, ``Think I should swing at the
first pitch?''
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, dozens of fans can say they chatted with Jeter
in 1999, the season he evolved from a star to perhaps the American
League's best player. With three more hits in the Yankees' 8-3 easy
victory Sunday over David Wells and the Blue Jays, Jeter improved
his batting average to .374. He has reached base in each of the
Yankees' 48 games this season, and it is as if he is getting better
and better every day.
</P>
<P>
   How good is Jeter now? ``If he makes an out,'' Scott Brosius
said, ``then you know he's due for a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu threw five and one-third innings effectively _ good
enough, said Manager Joe Torre, to keep his spot in the rotation,
and good enough to push the Yankees' string of victories to five.
As the Yankees begin a homestand Monday against the Cleveland
Indians, they have won eight of their past 10 games and are playing
exceptional baseball once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees beat on Wells, who did a great impression of a
pitcher who is hurt or distracted. Wells recently complained of a
bad back, and the left-hander _ who usually has impeccable control
_ threw a ball on the first pitch to eight of the first 10 batters
he faced, generally struggling to bend forward and finish his
delivery. He walked Chuck Knoblauch to start the game, the eighth
time Wells has walked a leadoff hitter this year; he walked a
leadoff hitter only three times last year. He allowed 29 walks in
1998, and he has surrendered 27 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wells had hoped to sign a three-year contract extension with the
Blue Jays, but Toronto officials slowed negotiations, and Wells is
apparently not happy about it. After he gave up eight runs in five
and two-thirds innings and saw his earned run average increase to
6.30 Sunday, Wells did not hang around to discuss his impressions
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wells might be the best postseason pitcher of this era and was
the Yankees' best pitcher during their remarkable 1998 season, but
all the doubt that swirls around Wells _ about his physical
condition, about his attention to detail throughout the regular
season _ is why the Yankees rushed to trade him for Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of innings,'' Toronto Manager Jim Fregosi
said, ``he threw 50 pitches. Then he had some easy innings and then
he just lost it. He started huffing and puffing a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had three hits against Wells _ a hit-and-run single in the
first inning, a two-run single in the second inning and a
run-scoring single in the sixth inning. He went 8-for-12 in the
three-game series and leads the league in hits with 70. Before
Sunday's game, Jeter ranked in the league's top 10 in batting
average, runs, total bases, triples, on-base percentage and
slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is on track to compile 236 hits, the most for a Yankee
since Don Mattingly had 238 hits in 1986. He is on a pace to score
138 runs and drive in 112. A .374 average over a full season would
be the highest since Joe DiMaggio batted .381 in 1939, when he was
24. Jeter turns 25 next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't paused a bit to look in the mirror and say, `How
good I am,''' Torre said.``He's just concentrating on getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter used to chase pitches out of the strike zone, particularly
when he was behind in the count, but his final at-bat against Wells
is as good example as any of how he has improved. He fell behind,
no balls and two strikes, and fouled off a low curveball, effective
defense against the strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Wells tried to get Jeter to swing at an inside fastball, but he
did not; then, when Wells threw another inside fastball, Jeter
fought off the pitch with his inside-out swing, punching the ball
to right field. ``He's made great adjustments from last spring to
where we are now,'' Torre said. ``His approach at the plate is much
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   His two-run single gave the Yankees a 4-1 edge, but the Blue
Jays rebounded in the third inning, scoring two runs. Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, went to the mound and
encouraged Irabu to stop being so tentative, to throw his pitches
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Joe Girardi began calling for Irabu's curveball, over
and over, and time and again Irabu used this to get ahead in the
count, before finishing off hitters with his fastball and forkball,
as well as his new pitch _ a cut fastball he used only against
right-handed batters. Irabu settled down, and while walking off the
field one inning, Jeter came by and encouraged him.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that is what Irabu thinks Jeter was saying. ``I put
on a face like I understood him,'' Irabu said through his
interpreter, George Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Irabu can tell his grandchildren that Jeter said
something to him in 1999, the year Jeter evolved from a star into
perhaps his league's best player.

BUSH GETS `CORE AGENDA' DONE IN TEXAS LEGISLATURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Analysis logo needed) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ So much attention has been focused during the
76th Legislature on Gov. George W. Bush's presidential aspirations
that one lobbyist recently quipped that Texas lawmakers were
wrapping up their ``New Hampshire session.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has had some rough moments during this biannual session,
which ends its regular run Monday. And until he was forced to
personally try to salvage a significant part of his tax cut
package, his leadership was usually so low-key as to be invisible.
</P>
<P>
   But if he does as well in next winter's New Hampshire primary as
his program did overall during the past five months in Austin, he
will face an early test of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor's biggest legislative defeat was the
rejection of a pilot program to allow some students to use
tax-backed vouchers to attend private schools. He didn't get the
tough welfare sanctions he proposed during his re-election
campaign, and his tax cuts went down to the wire in the session's
closing hours.
</P>
<P>
   But his wins outnumbered his losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he basically got his core agenda. He was successful,''
said Texas Republican Chairwoman Susan Weddington.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, who battled Bush, at least
indirectly, on the session's most emotional issue, a hate-crimes
bill that died during a nasty partisan fight in the Senate, also
said the governor ``came out well.''
</P>
<P>
   But some detractors questioned Bush's leadership capabilities
and how much credit he personally deserved for the successes on his
score card.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said that if Bush
looks good, it's because of the hard work of Democratic lawmakers.
``He has not showed any leadership. He's been there to say, `Me,
too,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the session's major accomplishments, Bush can list a bill
requiring parents to be notified before their minor daughters can
have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most significant piece of abortion-control legislation
to be passed by the Texas Legislature since the U.S. Supreme Court
legalized abortions 26 years ago. And it could boost Bush's support
among critical conservative voters in Republican primaries
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real test of his ability and the ability of
Republican legislators,'' Weddington said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.7 billion tax cut compromise being debated late Sunday
was about $1 billion less than Bush proposed during his re-election
campaign. Democratic legislators insisted that more of the state's
budgetary surplus be spent on teacher pay raises and other
education issues than the governor had advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Although lower than the governor's goal, the tax cut is enough
for Bush to describe as ``substantial'' and claim victory, much as
he did two years ago when the Legislature approved a $1 billion
property tax break for homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of tax reductions would vary widely among taxpayers,
and some people would hardly notice any relief. But legislators,
governors _ and presidential candidates _ use collective figures
when they talk about tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be viewed as a good, strong legislative
session,'' predicted Bush, who, nevertheless, had vowed to call
lawmakers back into special session if the tax-cut and education
package failed.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bush-supported proposals that will become law include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lowering the drunken driving limit from .10 to .08 blood
alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deregulation of the electric industry to encourage
competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Automatic detention for juveniles caught illegally carrying
guns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restricting lawsuits over the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restricting social promotions in the public schools, although
the Legislature softened the governor's original proposal that
promotions be based solely on whether students pass the state's
standardized achievement tests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funding for 380 new caseworkers for abused children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the state school bond guarantee for classroom
construction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Additional funding for reading programs in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) is coming out on all cylinders. I can't imagine a
better program to do something with,'' said veteran Austin
political consultant George Christian, a Democratic supporter of
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Christian, a former press secretary for President
Lyndon B. Johnson, said that the legislative session's potential
effects on a Bush run for the presidency were overrated _ partly
because of the governor's popularity in Texas and around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is he could have had a disastrous session and done
all right because that's not what people are going to be looking
at,'' Christian said. ``People who are for Bush are for Bush for
other reasons than his legislative program. To them, it's his
style, personality, outreach, the same things that carried him this
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Christian added, he faces a ``weak'' field of opponents
for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not exactly running against King Kong out there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Malcolm, the state Democratic Party leader,
said it will take more than personality to get Bush to the White
House. ``He's going to have to prove to me that he's more than a
smile, a handshake and a how-do-you-do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's admirers and detractors alike agreed that his budding
presidential campaign overshadowed much of the session's work and
often made lawmakers question the governor's _ and each other's _
motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cafeteria talk from the beginning of the session has been
that this is far more about what's good for New Hampshire than
Texas. This is the New Hampshire session,'' said one anti-voucher
lobbyist, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it (the presidential race) was dominant, but
it was always there,'' added Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Many Capitol insiders suspected Bush's insistence on tax cuts
was to impress conservative Republican voters in New Hampshire and
other states as much as to help out Texans.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic legislators who fought the governor for a better
deal for teachers and consumers also raised questions in the
supercharged atmosphere of presidential politics. Were their
differences with the governor strictly philosophical, or were they
trying to embarrass Bush before a national audience?
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said presidential politics was the main reason that
Democrats made a strong push for a hate-crimes bill that protected
homosexuals as well as racial and religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, he believes, was to put Bush on the spot on an issue
that has drawn international attention in the wake of a black man's
dragging death last year in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, the Democrat who sponsored the hate-crimes bill, which
was named for the dragging victim, James Byrd Jr., called Fraser's
theory ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've carried that bill for five sessions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said the Republicans, if anybody, were playing politics
with that proposal. Although Bush never publicly endorsed or
opposed the bill, he made it clear that he opposed special
protections for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said that Bush, fearing a negative reaction from
conservative Republican voters, ``twisted the arms of senators to
make sure he never had to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his interest in the presidency was an easy scapegoat.
``There's going to be people who figure out ways if something
doesn't go their way or something's not perfect, they all blame
presidential politics,'' he said during a rare visit to the Senate
less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He received unfavorable national publicity on another volatile
issue when, in the wake of the Colorado school shootings, he
endorsed a bill to require criminal background checks of people
buying guns from unlicensed dealers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   His endorsement, however, came after a House committee had
already killed a gun show bill, which the governor had made no
effort to push. He said the issue should be addressed in federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday how other Americans may view his record this
session, Bush replied: ``I do what I think is right. What we did in
this session is good for Texas, and that's what matters to me the
most.''

`DASH AND LILLY': THE HELLMAN-HAMMETT ROMANCE, HEAVY ON THE
CLICHES
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(jw) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a delicious escapist quality to mythic romances in
which the characters' rough edges are smoothed away and every
quarrel reflects the lovers' incendiary charm. The decades-long
affair of Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett certainly lends
itself to that treatment, and if ``Dash and Lilly'' had merely
given their legend a romantic gloss, the film might have been
enjoyable pap.
</P>
<P>
   But this trite movie does worse things than clean up Hellman and
Hammett's messy affair. It wastes a perfectly cast Sam Shepard and
a fiercely energetic Judy Davis on an unspeakable script, directed
by Kathy Bates, the actress, with an unfailing adherence to
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The first shot is so stale it should have been banned years ago:
a typewriter, and a hand stubbing out a cigarette in an ashtray.
Soon the camera moves up the long legs of a glamorous blonde who
turns out to be, amazingly, Hellman. As Kitty Carlisle Hart so
delicately puts it in an American Masters profile of Hellman
(coming next month), ``She was no, what we used to call, oil
painting.'' As that documentary makes clear, Hellman was a
conventionally unattractive woman who believed herself to be sexual
catnip to men. Such fascinating paradoxes have no place here. Ms.
Davis brings so much Hollywood elan to the role that it makes Jane
Fonda's airbrushed portrayal of Hellman in the film ``Julia'' seem
tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dash and Lilly'' begins in 1952, with Hellman about to be
called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. She
flashes back to 1930, and suddenly she is an even more glamorous
redhead in a red dress. She and Hammett take one look at each other
in a nightclub, and they're off. They drink, they throw glasses,
they cheat, they throw bottles, he writes ``The Thin Man,'' she
writes ``The Children's Hour,'' she becomes famous, he writes
nothing, and then they drink some more.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's Hammett is handsomely craggy and gray haired, his
gentle soul apparent beneath his drunken furies. It is an appealing
performance. Since he and Ms. Davis are asked to play icons rather
than people, that is the best anyone can hope for.
</P>
<P>
   The film doesn't ignore the Red Scare politics of the 1950s.
Hammett becomes a trustee of a bail fund for accused Communists and
is imprisoned for refusing to give the government names of the
fund's contributors (names he didn't even know). Ms. Davis delivers
Hellman's famous statement to the House committee, ``I cannot and
will not cut my conscience to fit this year's fashions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film exists so the characters can float through pretty
period settings of the '30s, airily dropping names: Hellman goes to
an opening night party on Broadway and asks Dorothy Parker (Bebe
Neuwirth, another waste of talent), ``Oh, Dotty, have you seen
Dash?'' This script has managed at least one improbable feat; its
Dorothy Parker is utterly humorless.

RUPERT LONSDALE, BRITISH WARSHIP CAPTAIN, DIES AT 93
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cmdr. Rupert Lonsdale, who became the only British captain to
surrender a warship on the high seas during World War II when he
gave up his crippled submarine to save the lives of its 59 crewmen,
died April 25 in Bournemouth, England. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning of May 4, 1940, Lonsdale took his
submarine, the Seal, into the Kattegat, the strait between Denmark
and Sweden, and placed 50 mines in German shipping lanes.
</P>
<P>
   While the submarine remained submerged that evening, a German
mine exploded, flooding much of the boat and sending it to the
bottom, a depth of 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lonsdale oversaw two efforts to free the Seal, which was mired
in mud at an angle, but each attempt failed. With oxygen supplies
and battery power dwindling, the skipper called upon the crew to
recite the Lord's Prayer. Soon afterward the sailors applied
maximum power again, and this time the submarine popped loose,
resurfacing 23 hours after it dived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our faith was answered in a way that to many of us seemed
miraculous,'' Lonsdale said later.
</P>
<P>
   But when first light arrived at 2:30 a.m. on May 5, an hour
after the submarine had been refloated, it was spotted by German
aircraft, which bombed it and riddled it with machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Seal's steering was inoperable, it had lost the ability to
dive, its sailors were exhausted and ill from their prolonged
period under high pressure, its guns jammed, it was on the verge of
sinking and it lacked explosives for scuttling.
</P>
<P>
   Lonsdale's officers implored him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the wardroom tablecloth passed to me, please,'' he
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The captain fashioned a white flag and attached it to the
conning tower. When a German seaplane put down nearby, he swam to
it upon orders of its pilot and was taken captive.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 35th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Lonsdale was flown to a German naval base, followed by his
crewmen, who were taken there aboard the trawler that towed their
submarine. The sailors had smashed the Seal's top-secret equipment
before surrendering, but the Germans were later able to improve
their torpedoes by adapting the superior British detonating devices
_ called contact pistols _ from the Seal's torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Seal was refitted as a U-boat at the German naval yard in
Kiel, but it never proved seaworthy enough to hunt British
submarines and languished as a training vessel. It was later sunk
in an Allied bombing raid at Kiel.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from two coastal craft that the Germans later captured and
several vessels at foreign bases abandoned by the British, the Seal
was the only British warship to fall into enemy hands during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Lonsdale and his crewmen remained prisoners for the duration of
the war, the skipper awaiting an inevitable court-martial for
surrendering his boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man's modesty was such that he had not begun to realize
that there was even the slightest possibility of his being
considered not a coward, but a hero,'' C.E.T. Warren and James
Benson wrote in ``Will Not We Fear'' (William Sloan Associates,
1962), an account of the Seal's surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Lonsdale might have felt different had he known that after he
informed submarine headquarters of his plight upon resurfacing, it
had radioed back that ``safety of personnel should be your first
consideration'' after destruction of highly sensitive equipment.
That message had never been heard by the Seal because its receiving
apparatus was disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1946, Lonsdale was tried at a court-martial in
Portsmouth, England, on charges that he had not attacked enemy
aircraft and had failed to assure the sinking of the Seal when it
appeared she might fall into enemy hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This act is one I have ever afterwards deeply regretted, but
at the time it seemed the only thing to do,'' the skipper told the
court of five naval captains in recounting his surrender.
</P>
<P>
   They heard testimony recalling Lonsdale's bravery and devotion
to his men, and after 45 minutes of deliberation, the president of
the panel returned the skipper's sword to him. Lonsdale had been
acquitted with honor. His former crewmen crowded around and shook
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Philip Lonsdale was born in Dublin, Ireland, and joined
the British Navy as a teen-age cadet. After serving aboard a
cruiser and a battleship, he entered the submarine service in 1927.
He retired from the Navy a few months after the court-martial and
began a second career in the clergy. After studying at Ridley Hall
theological college in Cambridge, he became a priest in the Church
of England in 1949. He retired as a canon emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ethne Irwin, and a son, John.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the court-martial that cleared him, Lonsdale's
courage had been recognized by his superiors. Four days after he
surrendered, his fate not yet known to British authorities, he was
formally cited for his previous submarine patrols under hazardous
conditions off the Norwegian coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Navy hailed him ``for daring, endurance and resource
against the enemy.''

   COBB: Marietta taking up annexation plea
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's Planning Commission on Tuesday will consider annexing
50 acres next to Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield National Park so a
developer can put up 142 houses. The developer, Wilmont Williams,
says he wants a density level of 2.8 houses on each acre. The
county land plan permits 2.5 houses an acre for the land at the
intersection of Barrett Parkway and Stilesboro Road. Meanwhile, the
city planning and zoning department is trying to determine whether
Williams ignored flood plains and wetlands in his calculations.
John Moore, an attorney for Williams, says none of the land
qualifies as flood plain. The subdivision to the northwest of the
park, a Williams development called Parkview at Barrett Greene, is
zoned for 3.5 houses an acre, and townhouses are scheduled to go up
on property across Barrett Parkway. The proposed development also
would adjoin Hardage Farm, a subdivision where residents have
complained about the density of Williams' proposal. After the
planning board makes its recommendation, the City Council could
make a decision at its June 9 meeting.

   Tire retailer heads for two locations

<P>
   Competitors might call it ``Tire Wars: The Radial Menace.''
Clearwater, Fla.-based Morgan Tires is bringing its Don Olson
stores to metro Atlanta in a small wave that could swell. Two sites
for the tire retailer are under review in Cobb, and another five
are on the drawing boards for metro Atlanta. The two in Cobb are
headed for the intersection of Wade Green and Wooten roads and at
Johnson Ferry and Lower Roswell roads. The company operates 83
locations in Florida.

   COWETA: Horse farm tracts are being developed
</P>
<P>
   Several horse farm developments, with lots 10 acres and larger,
are being carved from some of the bigger undeveloped tracts in
south Coweta County. County officials and developers say the
projects are working because Coweta allows up to three residents to
share a driveway as long as the lots are at least 10 acres each.
That allows the developer to put in a relatively inexpensive gravel
drive instead of the more costly asphalt street with concrete curbs
and gutters. Other counties, like Fayette, don't allow shared
drives unless the street meets county subdivision standards.
Fayette officials say the private drives are often poorly
maintained and hard to find, creating problems for rescue personnel
during emergencies. Developer Sam Bowers and his father, Lisle
Bowers, are developing some of their relatives' property on Bexton
Road into horse farms, and Ed Moor is doing the same thing across
Bexton from the Bowers place. Sam Bowers says lots, which went on
sale last week, will range in size from 10 to 16 acres and will be
priced from $5,000 to $7,000 per acre.

   DEKALB: Two commissioners to battle motel plan
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County Commissioners William Brown and Porter Sanford are
waiting until next week to decide how to fight a controversial
motel project on Covington Highway, hoping to find a magic bullet
to kill the development before a scheduled vote next month. First
the project was to be a Super 8 Motel, then a Days Inn and later,
back to a Super 8. The already-permitted project has been through
three owners, and Sanford has pointed out that could be the
developer's fatal flaw. Not so, insist zoning officials, who say
that changes of ownership during the permitting process are OK, as
long as the permitee lets the county know of the changes. South
DeKalb residents are afraid the motel will be a magnet for crime _
as are some nearby motels, police say. ``It's very difficult to
deny the owners of property their right to develop their
property,'' says Commissioner Gale Walldorff, who says the motel is
properly zoned in the C-1 classification. ``It may be legal but
it's morally wrong,'' says Brown. FAYETTE: Two commercial tracts
being cleared
</P>
<P>
   Earthmovers are quickly clearing and leveling two tracts being
developed by JDN on Ga. 85 north of Fayetteville. A tract north of
Banks Road and south of Fayette Pavilion will be filled by a Lowe's
and several outparcels. Another tract, near the intersection of Ga.
314 and Ga. 85, is being cleared for an Eckerd Drug store, an
Applebee's restaurant and two other restaurants.FULTON: Sandy
Springs fights 'cut-through' traffic
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Springs residents are devising plans to fight
``cut-through'' traffic. River Valley Road is the latest area
targeted for ``traffic calming'' measures. Sandy Springs
Revitalization will host a community meeting Wednesday to discuss a
master plan being developed by consultants for the River
Valley-Amberidge neighborhood. A network of sidewalks and bike
paths and other proposals will be discussed in what organizers hope
will be a demonstration project for the region. The meeting is at 7
p.m. at Riverwood High School at 5900 Heards Drive.

 &HT;    CARL WARE: COKE'S ACTION MAN
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, Carl Ware takes an assignment, a big one.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Chairman M. Douglas Ivester last week designated Ware,
his chief of the Africa group, to co-chair a Diversity Advisory
Council and help defuse a controversy regarding fairness in company
employment.
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that could help the company show it treats
African-Americans and other minorities equally. That could deflate
allegations of unfairness, cement good feelings between Atlanta's
black community and the company, and prevent a tarnishing of Coke's
progressive reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, a 25-year veteran of Coca-Cola, discussed his new
assignment and his career in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to talk about the class-action lawsuit against the
company, but he spoke of ways he believes corporations like
Coca-Cola can help the careers of African-Amercans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself am a good example, a proof that glass walls do not
exist at the Coca-Cola Co.,'' Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   Ware's special assignment is to chair the new council with
Senior Vice President Jack Stahl. They'll advise Ivester on
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Ware has been there before. Back in the early 1980s, with
controversy raging around the explosive demands for American
businesses to get out of South Africa, President Donald Keough
asked him to go Johannesburg, study the issues and advise the
company on what policy to pursue. Ware advised the company to
divest its holdings to support the anti-apartheid movement, and the
company did so in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, when Jesse Jackson and Operation Push came calling,
threatening to boycott the company if it did not spend more money
with African-American vendors and business partners, Ware helped to
defuse the explosive impasse that could have been a public
relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Things died down when Chairman Roberto Goizueta announced, with
a drum roll, a $50 million ``plan'' to spend money with black
businesses. Actually the company was already doing business at that
level, though privately, company sources say.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1995, Ivester asked Ware to suggest ways to encourage and
cultivate upward movement in the company by African-American
employees. He did, and in the coming months, as a pending lawsuit
makes its way through the courts, we may learn whether that has
worked.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Ware's primary job is running the Africa group,
which tries to increase Coca-Cola's businesses in 50 countries, he
will spend some time in his original role as an internal advocate
for better race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Ware comes to his job prepared and experienced. He was president
of the Atlanta City Council in 1974 when tapped by Coca-Cola as
external affairs director. He knew politics and the art of
persuasion, and he knew how to accomplish his purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and foes alike acknowledge those skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy you want on your side, in war or peace,''
said one former Coke insider.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a man of both practical and symbolic accomplishments
in race relations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it was Carl Ware who became the first black member
of the venerable Capital City Club in the early '90s, heading off a
threat by the city to take the liquor license of any club with
restrictions against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, who grew up poor on a Newnan-area farm, considers himself
to be an example of what can happen under good employment policies.
</P>
<P>
   In the hourlong interview in his North Avenue office, shortly
before he was to fly to Nigeria, he recalled how various executives
guided a career that has made him one of the top six officers at
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ware was hired personally by J. Paul Austin, company chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the early 1980s, he was tutored and given star
assignments by Keough, president and chief executive of Coca-Cola.
Ware still recalls a day in 1991 when Keough called him into his
office and made Ware's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been pretty good about spending the company's money.
How about going out and earning some money for the company?''
Keough asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   With that Ware went to Harvard, boned up on fundamentals and
took off for London six months later for on-the-job training to run
the Africa Group. Two years later he became president of that
group.
</P>
<P>
   He heads an enormous operation that will spend hundreds of
millions of dollars in various African countries setting up
bottling and other operations and contributing to African
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has overall charge of those operations, a major
portion of Ware's time is spent cultivating African governments and
bridging cultural hurdles so the company can do business, often in
partnership with the local governments.
</P>
<P>
   When Ware took his first job at Coke, he said, he occupied an
office the size of a linen closet, at $12,000 a year. That was in
January 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Ware's portfolio of Coca-Cola shares now totals $16 million,
according to recent insider trading reports.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any other senior African-American executives at
Coca-Cola?
</P>
<P>
   Ware cited a number of younger people working for him in the
Africa business, including Paul Graves, vice president for human
resources for that group, and others.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans include Juan D. Johnson, vice president and
director of learning and knowledge management; Ingrid Saunders
Jones, vice president and director of external affairs; Quinton
Martin, group manager for national accounts with independent
bottlers; Darryl Cobbin, an acknowledged whiz at brand management,
who did good work on Sprite; and Thomas Peters, vice president for
international treasury services.
</P>
<P>
   Ware and other insiders say no one outshines Carolyn H. Baldwin.
Baldwin has been controller of Europe as well as South America.
She's now president of Coca-Cola Financial Corp. and could be on a
track to be the top financial officer of the huge company.
</P>
<P>
   Ware disputes the idea that staff people such as human resources
and community relations executives are secondary to the operations
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business you either sell Coca-Cola or you support
somebody who does ....
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it in that context, there are no positions here
that are soft, and others that are cost-centers and therefore more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, he supports efforts to make sure anybody,
regardless of race or background, has a choice between staff jobs
or ``profit-and-loss centers.'' Said he:
</P>
<P>
   ``What we should be about is to make sure there is no
discrimination against anyone on the basis of color or sex or
cultural origin in access to all kinds of businesses within our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   It is already clear that the lawsuit, whatever its merits, has
already stirred more thought than ever before about employment
policies on North Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though all the talk now is about African-American
advancement, employment opportunities in the global company, with
major projected growth in Africa, South America and Asia, may also
be enhanced for many minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clearest of all, however, is that Carl Ware seems sure to be
right in the middle of any changes that occur.

   Projects planned along Northern Arc(backslash)
</P>
<P>
   The development possibilities spun off by construction of the
proposed Northern Arc will be reduced if the road is built with
interchanges only at expressways. But the Atlanta Regional
Commission's vote last week for a limited version of the
controversial road could still give momentum to some big plans at
the scheduled six exits. Here's a quick inventory of the planned
interchanges and possible projects along the 59-mile, four-lane
road: At I-75 in Bartow, the Rollins family plans a mixed-use
project on 1,673 acres and Anheuser-Busch owns about 3,000 acres
with no specific plans; at I-575 in Cherokee, developers plan a
regional mall; at Ga. 400 in Forsyth County, plans call for
regional retailing; at I-85 and I-985 in Gwinnett, the Mall of
Georgia is under way; and at Ga. 316 in Gwinnett, the area is
planned as business and industrial parks.

   Inn, golf resort opening near Barnsley Gardens
</P>
<P>
   A swank inn and golf resort will open Tuesday next to the
historic Barnsley Gardens in Bartow County. The resort in
Adairsville is adjacent to the gardens and the ruins of the Godfrey
Barnsley home, which is more than 150 years old. The 1,300-acre
resort with 33 one-, two- and four-bedroom cottages has 70 suites.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield will hold a board meeting at the inn
this week.The gardens will be open to the public from 10 a.m. to 3
p.m. Sundays. A restaurant opens Tuesday, and the spa opens June
15. German Prince Hubertus Fugger is a partner in the company that
owns the resort, about 65 miles northwest of Atlanta. A banking and
timber baron, Fugger bought the property in 1988 for $1.5 million
and poured another $3.5 million into it.

   Barnes keynote speaker at mass transit meeting
</P>
<P>
   A collection of mass transit supporters will gather at Georgia
State University next Monday and Tuesday for a two-day symposium on
riding the rails around metro Atlanta. The keynoter is Gov. Roy
Barnes, whose Georgia Regional Transportation Authority will have a
lot to say about where future rail lines will extend through the
region. Speakers include MARTA representatives, academics and
business executives. They'll take on topics about safety on mass
transit and development around rail stations. The symposium will be
held at Georgia State's Student Center For more information call

   Henry-Butts water fight is heading to court
</P>
<P>
   Henry County's attempts to gather water for future growth is
getting the once over by a judge. The county's water authority will
be in Butts County Superior Court on Wednesday to fight a motion by
Butts County to intervene in the condemnation of Butts property for
Henry County's planned Tussahaw Creek Reservoir. About 952 of the
1,500 acres to be flooded for the Tussahaw Creek Reservoir are in
Butts, according to the lawsuit. Butts officials are challenging
Henry's authority to condemn land in another county without
permission from that jurisdiction; they are asking the court to
void the Henry water authority's condemnation of 20 Butts parcels
for the reservoir. The counties negotiated for four years over use
of the reservoir's water but wound up in court when Butts filed
suit in April.

 &HT;    Execs buying at InfoCure
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insider buying remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``No less impressive than the insider buying is the sustained,
relative decrease in insider selling,'' says Bob Gabele of First
Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be sure, much of the recent accumulation has occurred in
the small- to mid-cap stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabele particularly likes the renewed insider purchases _ at
higher prices _ at Atlanta-based InfoCure, a provider of health
care practice management software products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, four insiders bought a total of 30,000 shares.
``Their timing certainly paid off, as the stock climbed from $15 a
share up to $35,'' Gabele notes.
</P>
<P>
   The buying trailed off as the stock rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently, however, insiders appear to be taking advantage of a
dip in the stock and acquiring shares,'' Gabele says. ``On May 3,
three executives purchased 15,000 shares at $26.82 a share.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Frederick L. Fine, president and chief
executive; Richard Perlman, chairman and treasurer; and James K.
Price, executive vice president. Each bought 5,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through these acquisitions, insiders certainly appear
confident, particularly given the significantly higher share
prices,'' Gabele says.
</P>
<P>
   InfoCure's shares finished Friday at $36.87 1/2, up $3.87 1/2,
on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Among other Georgia companies
</P>
<P>
   At PAB Bankshares, R. Bradford Burnette, president, bought 2,050
shares on April 1 at $16 each, totaling $32,800. He now holds
184,110 shares directly and indirectly, worth $2,750,143 at
Friday's price of $14.93 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission requires insiders
(officers, directors, persons with policy-making roles) to report
their transactions within 10 days after the month in which they
took place. Beneficial owners, or those owning 10 percent or more
of any publicly held company, also must report.

 &HT;    Market dips, but always up in long term
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock market investors can't get to their morning papers fast
enough each day to see what happened to their stocks or mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But it never seems to matter which way the price moves _ it's a
stressful situation.
</P>
<P>
   If the price goes up, the investor worries whether it's near the
top and if he or she should sell.
</P>
<P>
   If it goes down, he or she wonders how big the loss will be, how
far the price will fall, and why did I buy that dog anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The investor's mental health might be helped by looking at stock
prices only once a month.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1990s are any guide, that means investors would have two
good months out of every three.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average posted an increase in 77 of the
113 months since Dec. 31, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That's 68 percent of the time, which means that in only 32
months did an investor suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the decade were there three consecutive down months
for the Dow. That was August through October of 1990 _ the last
bona-fide bear market _ when the Dow fell 16.6 percent from the
beginning to the end of that period.
</P>
<P>
   The next worst decline occurred last year, when the Dow fell
15.9 percent from the start of July to the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the Dow was up 15 percent so far this year,
although it will post a May loss of about 2 percent _ following the
April gain of more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since investors will never buy once-a-month price readings for
their stocks and funds, they might adopt another way of looking at
market trends. They can anticipate what to worry about by what
month it is.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, corporate profit growth is the single most
important engine that drives stock prices higher. But companies
publish their earnings only four times a year _ typically in
January, April, July and October.
</P>
<P>
   In those months, and during several weeks in advance, Wall
Street analysts talk mostly about what impact a company's earnings
will have on its share price or how earnings generally will affect
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Between months when earnings are released, investors can turn
their attention to interest rates and inflation, as we are doing
now.
</P>
<P>
   With no immediate profit trends to focus on, we worry about how
long the economy will continue to grow and whether the long era of
weak inflation is coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Bond investors, who command the heights as world-class worriers,
have been so worried about inflation they have driven bond yields
higher by their trading.
</P>
<P>
   This has given stockholders something else to worry about, since
rising yields make bonds very attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is also worrying about inflation again,
adding to the investor's menu of things to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, about the only thing that looks reassuring is the
stock market's long, steady climb to where it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's been down from time to time. It took a
quarter-century to recoup the losses from the 1929 crash. But the
market has never stayed down.
</P>
<P>
   It has had its bubbles, and its bubbles have always burst _
after which it started the next bubble.
</P>
<P>
   The market has risen slowly, and it has risen rapidly. But over
time, it has always risen.

   MEDFORD, N.Y. _ They could have been selling Amway, or Avon.
Wearing light makeup and casual clothes, Arlene Lieberman and
Arlene Reingold sought clients at the mall, served coffee and
doughnuts at meet-and-greet sessions, and often invited prospects
to their split-level homes, which are three doors apart on a shady
street here on Long Island.

threw a ``God bless you'' or two into most conversations. Mrs.
Lieberman kept the books on a computer in her son's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The two women said they were adoption consultants. Now federal
prosecutors say that they were baby sellers, bringing children from
Mexico to New York for couples so desperate for children that they
overlooked or ignored signs of trouble, including the delivery of a
baby to adoptive parents in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven store. No
immigration papers were provided in some cases, leaving parents
terrified that their children could be deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying, `You're the nicest couple we've ever met,'''
said Rosalie Liberto of Miller Place, a Suffolk County village, who
along with her husband, John, the owner of a Carvel ice &UR;  &LR; cream
store, adopted three Mexican children with the women's help. ``They
must have thought we were the biggest suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the two women, known to their clients as the
Arlenes, were arrested at their homes here in Suffolk County and
charged with conspiring to violate immigration laws and to commit
mail and wire fraud. The authorities also arrested a lawyer, Mario
Reyes, who practiced in Mexico and Arizona. He is said to have paid
Mexican women to pose as the mothers of infants being sent to the
United States so that the children would be allowed across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has
said the parents may keep the children while efforts are made to
naturalize them, several parents said they feared losing the
children, who lack visas or passports and in some cases have forged
birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto said that the day after they had picked up one of
their adoptive children at the airport in Islip and made a
celebratory stop at McDonald's, she started looking through the
folder of papers she had been given by the two women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Johnny, there's no visa in here. Let me call the
Arlenes _ maybe they just forgot it,''' Mrs. Liberto recalled. She
said Mrs. Lieberman told her, ``The laws have changed _ you get the
visa when the adoption is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did some of the babies lack proper paperwork, but some
also had serious health problems. A boy who was said to have a rash
turned out to have a rare skin disease that can be fatal. One girl,
who had been described as cute but shy, had a distended stomach,
and kept licking the walls. According to the adoptive parents,
Arlene Lieberman said the girl just needed ``a little love and good
food.'' A doctor later determined that she was mentally retarded
and probably had been sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents who were interviewed over the weekend said that
they at first had regarded Mrs. Lieberman, 48, and Mrs. Reingold,
46, as friendly homemakers who had an interesting sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they were adoptive mothers themselves and because
they had been burned, they wanted to do this so other people would
not get hurt,'' said Sara Kruchkow, 48, of Flushing, Queens, who
along with her husband, David, adopted Shelly, now 3, through the
women.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruchkows said the women reminded them of the sort of
neighbor they might ask to take care of their cat during a
vacation. Mrs. Kruchkow said that after one placement fell through,
Mrs. Lieberman ``offered to meet me halfway for coffee, to console
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that when the women started their business,
the adoptions they helped arrange were legal. Incorporation papers
for one of their businesses said the purpose was to ``offer support
and assistance to adoption agencies.'' The Arlenes did not have
state approval to arrange adoptions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The women founded a nonprofit organization called Stork
International Inc. in 1989, and in 1993 hired an advertising and
public relations firm in Port Jefferson, N.Y., to help promote it.
They dissolved Stork after the State Department of Social Services
ordered them to stop placing children.
</P>
<P>
   According to state and federal law enforcement officials, the
women repeated the pattern with Adoption Choice Inc., which they
started in 1992. In 1995, according to state officials, the State
Department of Social Services denied the women's application to
authorize Adoption Choice to place children.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1996, the women operated as International Adoption
Consultants Inc., from an office building here in Medford, where
the main thoroughfare has dueling dinette dealers, and one motel
asks customers whether they want a single, double or water bed.
</P>
<P>
   The Arlenes stayed busy. According to a prosecution affidavit,
they assisted in 500 international adoptions during the last nine
years, operating under names that included Stork International Inc.
and Adoption Choice Inc. At least 17 of those infants were brought
illegally from Mexico, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The women are free on bond and have returned to their homes on
Black Pine Drive, in a maze of middle-class homes. This weekend,
Mrs. Lieberman was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, as she came to the
door of her home, which has a white plastic bench out front. ``I'm
fine,'' she said, curtly referring further questions to a lawyer,
Peter Mayer, who could not be reached by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   At Mrs. Reingold's house, where the shutters are festooned with
American eagles, several family members were outside, enjoying the
sunshine and the spray from a sprinkler. They ordered a visitor to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Some former clients said they believed that even though the
women apparently lived modestly, their motivation seemed to be
money. Many parents paid $20,000 or more for their services and the
authorities in New York and Mexico did little to intervene, even
though some adoption groups said they had been steering people away
from the women because they required cash in advance, which is not
customary in adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting one couple at his office in Mexico, according to
federal prosecutors, Reyes gave them a ride back to Arizona,
``waving at a border official as they crossed,'' and turned to the
parents and said, ``See how easy that was.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, several of the parents say they should have seen
signs of trouble. Why would adoptive parents accept a baby from the
two women in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven on Long Island, or from
Reyes at a gas station on the Arizona side of the border?
</P>
<P>
   Why would the adoptive parents believe a claim that Mexican law
allowed a parent to pick up the baby first and take care of the
paperwork later? Why would prospective parents pay thousands of
dollars for surprise charges that kept cropping up after agreeing
to a much lower fee that was supposed to take care of everything?
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto said she thought she knew why.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have to do is show you a picture, and you feel like
it's yours,'' she said. ``You want children. They don't even have
to convince you.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Britvan, a lawyer in Woodbury, N.Y., who is representing
six couples who adopted babies through Mrs. Lieberman and Mrs.
Reingold, said that one of his clients became skeptical after a
demand for $6,000 in cash and $14,000 by check. Britvan, chairman
of the adoption committee of the New York State Bar Association,
said at least one of his clients was charged $3,500 for a
consultation, which consisted of looking at pictures of children.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto, who has adopted two other daughters, said that at
times, Mrs. Reingold played good cop and Mrs. Lieberman played bad
cop.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto said that when she was meeting with the women after
one promised adoption fell through, Mrs. Lieberman all of a sudden
said, ``Should we tell her?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's tell her,'' she says Mrs. Reingold replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, maybe we shouldn't,'' she says Mrs. Lieberman teased.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that they had a 9-year-old girl available and
wondered whether Mrs. Liberto might want her, even though she was
older than a child in which Mrs. Liberto had expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertos took in the girl, but she asked to go back to
Mexico. The couple wound up with Gabriella, now 5, who goes by
Gabby and is taking dance, swimming and gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   The Kruchkows said that another of the women's strategies was to
play a husband off against a wife. The couple had been promised two
girls who never arrived, leaving them devastated after spending
months fixing up a baby room and marveling over the children's
photos on their refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had burned us twice, and I didn't think we should give
them a third strike,'' Kruchkow said. But his wife pleaded to work
with the Arlenes once again. ``I finally decided to try to have
peace in my marriage. I knew if I put my foot down and we ended up
not going to someone else, Sara would regret it for the rest of her
life, and maybe resent me for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamble worked. They are having a delightful time with
Shelly, a mischievous toddler who still throws a few Spanish words
into her chatter. She loves to hide something in one hand and then
hold them both out as she asks, ``Esta? Esta?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kruchkow, now scrambling to make sure her daughter can stay
here legally, said that losing her now would be like a death in the
family. ``She can sense that something is wrong,'' the mother said.
``She has started telling us a hundred times a day that she loves
us.''

 &HT;    Mustang keeps building on its history of success
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps no vehicle, other than the original Volkswagen Beetle,
represents the baby boomer generation more than the Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustang came to the automotive scene with a fever that has
never been equaled. Unlike many of Detroit's nameplates, the
Mustang not only endures but thrives.
</P>
<P>
   To put the phenomenon of Mustang mania into perspective, more
than 6.9 million Mustangs have been sold in the 35 years since the
distinctive little rear-wheel-drive's introduction. The 1 millionth
Mustang was sold in March 1966. By comparison, the other
most-recognized American car, the Chevrolet Corvette, passed the 1
million mark in 1993, some 40 years after its launch.
</P>
<P>
   Like most success stories, the Mustang is built on a solid

 &HT;    Protege worthy of critics' praise
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a name that suggests it's still on an upward learning
curve, the '99 Mazda Protege is a fully realized little sedan.
</P>
<P>
   A redesign has given the subcompact Protege, which seems larger
than that classification, big-sedan styling with crisp lines,
mildly wrapped-around headlamps and an overall appearance that
suggests it's from Europe, not Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Protege falls into that woeful category of
things, people and places that are critically acclaimed but
overlooked by the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, the Protege has always stood out,'' says
Automobile magazine, which usually focuses on upscale cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matches the class leaders in nearly every respect,'' says
Consumer Guide.
</P>
<P>
   As the test Protege ES demonstrated, both the praise and the
mild warning that it may lag behind Ford Escorts, Honda Civics and
other competitors in a couple of areas are deserved. The most
easily noticed shortcomings are lack of initial acceleration and
rear doors that fail to facilitate entry and exit by adults because
the rear wheel wells limit their bottom width.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those areas, it's difficult to fault Mazda for anything
but a propensity _ shared with many manufacturers _ for creating
capitalized phrases to praise its product. The Protege has an
OptiSpace design, Triple-H construction and a Twin-Trapezoidal Link
rear suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares how it's hyped as long as the Protege seems roomy
(front and rear headroom are notably good; rear legroom is limited)
and will actually seat four adults. Too, the method of construction
does produce a car that feels solid, and the ride and handling
characteristics are commendable.
</P>
<P>
   Power is another matter. The base DX ($11,790) and LX ($13,130)
make do with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder rated at 105 horsepower,
while the sportier ES carries a 1.8 four-cylinder that yields 122
hp. The five-speed test Protege ES did move out smartly if pushed
near its redline maximum of 6,500 rpm but didn't do so without
wailing about the effort involved.
</P>
<P>
   A four-speed automatic is offered ($800), and while the
convenience it brings to stop-and-go commuting and highway cruising
is obvious, so, too, is the way it nibbles away power for pulling
off and passing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a stronger engine that gives up only about one
mpg in fuel economy, the ES has suspension changes that are
trade-offs. The 15-inch wheels look better than the standard
14-inchers and improve driveability but do nothing to soften the
ride. Body roll is negligible in all models, thanks to front and
rear stabilizer bars.
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising is that anti-lock brakes are not standard. The
Protege redesign also didn't include side air bags. Both come only
in an optional package that includes a power moonroof ($1,350).
</P>
<P>
   The interior boasts easily read instrumentation, easily reached
stereo/climate controls and handy storage spaces. The seats are
firmly supportive and the interior trim, while mostly gray, does
include patterned cloth door inserts. Seat adjustability is good,
with the driver's featuring an adjustment for the angle of the seat
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Protege ES, clearly, is a leader in its class, with
reasonable pricing, plenty of standard equipment and a fun-to-drive
nature that doesn't preclude utility. Its no-frills design isn't
going to become dated anytime soon.

BUSH SET TO SIGN COMPROMISE BILL ON GRANDFATHERED INDUSTRIAL
PLANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By BILL DAWSON 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State legislators passed a compromise bill
Sunday to create a new program advocated by Gov. George W. Bush for
older, grandfathered industrial plants to reduce their air
pollution voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he intends to sign the measure, which was approved on
a 22-6 vote by the Senate and later by the House on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, addressing one of the state's most hotly debated
environmental issues, was pieced together in last-minute
negotiations Saturday night by a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   The version that emerged from the committee omitted a crucial
amendment _ promoted by environmentalists and added by the House _
that would have ended grandfathered plants' pollution exemption in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Although plants that were operating or under construction in
1971 are subject to some rules to protect air quality, legislators
that year granted them an exemption from having state emission
permits and the stricter pollution controls they generally require.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been calling for a voluntary program to reduce these
older plants' emissions since 1997, when it was disclosed that they
still accounted for a large share of the state's industrial
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives had said when lawmakers first approved
the exemption almost 30 years ago that these plants' air pollution
would rapidly decline as they were closed or updated.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, environmentalists and others, including the
city of Houston and editorial boards at the state's five largest
newspapers, have urged a mandatory end to the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and his industry allies, who opposed removing the
exemption from the Texas Clean Air Act, prevailed after Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry appointed a Senate team to the conference committee that
generally favored their position.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate conferees did agree to a House provision,
that would impose new and annually escalating emission fees for
grandfathered plants that don't apply for voluntary permits by
September 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little incentive in the bill,'' Bush said Sunday,
referring to the fee. ``It's proper. I'm glad it's in the bill to
encourage those that are still grandfathered to meet deadlines for
the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But a prominent Texas environmentalist blamed the governor _ who
supported the electricity deregulation bill's end to the emissions
exemption for older power plants _ for the Legislature's failure to
get tough with other industries, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's intense opposition to mandating closing the
loophole made it impossible to achieve that goal in the conference
committee,'' said Ken Kramer, state director of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``chose to placate his polluter friends and contributors
rather than move more aggressively against grandfathered
polluters,'' Kramer charged.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate vote to approve the measure, Sen. J.R.
``Buster'' Brown, R-Lake Jackson, said more than 50 companies have
already volunteered for the permit program and have pledged to cut
emissions equivalent to removing 2.4 million cars from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the bill's author, said he believes more companies will
volunteer once it becomes law, noting the ``strong incentive'' that
the new emission fee provides for those that don't do so.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, industrial plants pay a fee of $26 per ton of air
pollutants for the first 4,000 tons emitted each year. The bill
would remove this 4,000-ton cap for grandfathered plants that don't
apply for a permit and triple their fee annually for emissions
greater than 4,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   For a non-volunteering grandfathered plant releasing 50,000 tons
of air pollutants annually, the fee would rise from the current
$10,400 to $1.3 million in fiscal 2002 and $3.9 million the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said, however, that he doubts the fee will have a broad
impact, because state records indicate it would apply only to eight
plants in the state that have not already volunteered to reduce
emissions under the program.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, one of the senators voting
against the bill, said 28 years has been too long a time for the
permit exemption to continue in force.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, environmentalists' leading ally
on the issue, said that with the end to the power plants' exemption
in the deregulation bill and the provisions in the bill passed
Sunday for other industries, ``we took a big bite out of the
apple'' of grandfathered emissions.

BRACK'S VICTORY IN INDY 500 DOES COMPUTE, TO THE GALLON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The white flag waved, signaling there was only
one lap remaining in the Indianapolis 500 Sunday, and the only
thing Kenny Brack could do was hope that his calculations were
right. Race cars can run only 30 laps around the Brickyard on a
tank of fuel, right?
</P>
<P>
   Brack did the math. And according to his figures, Robby Gordon's
car should already be out of methanol. But somehow it was not.
Brack, who was in second place, began to sweat. Because the only
thing running out, it seemed to him, was time. And then ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of fuel,'' Gordon screamed under his helmet. Brack
saw Gordon's bright yellow race car slowing on pit lane, and at
that moment, the 33-year-old Swede knew that victory was his. He
completed the final lap and took the checkered flag at the 83rd
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he could run more than 30 laps on one tank of
fuel,'' said Brack, who was last year's Indy Racing League champion
and drives a Dallara-Aurora owned by A.J. Foyt. ``Whether I thought
I could overtake him, I don't know. I would have tried my
hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   But a faulty fuel meter in Gordon's car meant that Brack did not
have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed one more lap of yellow,'' said Gordon, who had two
fifth-place finishes at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ``My fuel
meter told me we were getting two miles per gallon, and it
indicated 2.3 gallons coming out of Turn 4 on the next-to-last lap.
I thought this was our year. The stars seemed to be all in a line.
It makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what are you going to do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could cry, I could kick the car, but John Menard would get
mad at me,'' he said of his car owner. ``I could punch our fueler,
but what would that accomplish? We have a big race in Milwaukee
next weekend, so we just have to suck it up and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack (pronounced Breck) ran out of fuel in last year's
Indianapolis 500 because of similar miscalculation. Sunday, he lead
for the most laps, racing around the 2.5-mile oval 66 times in
front and averaging 153.176 miles an hour. ``I've been practicing
drinking milk for more than a week,'' Brack said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   Brack is expected to earn about $1.5 million out of the $9
million in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ward, also in a Dallara-Aurora, was second, finishing 6.562
seconds behind Brack. Billy Boat, Brack's teammate, was third,
completing the podium sweep for the Dallara-Aurora chassis-engine
combination. Gordon, who was in a wreck early in Saturday's
Championship Auto Racing Teams' Motorola 300 in Madison, Ill.,
wound up fourth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's final-lap misfortune was a dramatic climax to an
Indianapolis 500 _ viewed by a crowd of some 400,000 _ that was
exciting even though many of the race's stars and compelling story
lines had vanished by Lap 150.
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk, driving in his final race, was dominating Sunday
_ having led for 63 laps _ before crashing on Lap 118. Eddie
Cheever, the defending champion, saw his engine blow up on Lap 139
after leading for four laps. Scott Goodyear, the perennial threat,
was forced to leave the race early with mechanical problems and
finished 27th. Greg Ray, who started second and led for 32 laps,
took himself out of the running by causing a crash on pit lane
midway through the race and was relegated to 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fried, the crew chief of the rookie driver Robby McGehee,
was critically injured on pit lane early in the race when he was
hit by Jimmy Kite's incoming car. As Kite was going into his pit
stall, his rear wheel was hit by Johnny Unser's front wheel,
forcing Kite's 1,585-pound car into Fried, who was taken to
Methodist Hospital, where he was in critical but stable condition
with head and chest injuries.
</P>
<P>
   McGehee finished fifth in a Dallara-Aurora and is likely to be
named rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Brack, Ward, Boat, Gordon _ recognize any of them? That is
probably because of the dispute between the United States' two
major open-wheel circuits, Championship Auto Racing Teams and the
IRL, which is owned by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. This was
the fourth consecutive Indianapolis 500 to which many of the
sport's biggest names were not invited.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Michael Andretti or Al Unser Jr. No team owners
Roger Penske or Chip Ganassi or Paul Newman-Carl Haas. But that
might not be true for much longer. During the two past weeks,
reports of a reconciliation between CART and IRL have floated
through Gasoline Alley.
</P>
<P>
   A reunification would be embraced by most CART and some IRL
teams. But that was not a topic of discussion on Gasoline Alley
Sunday following the dramatic climax.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, the sentimental favorite, blamed himself for his
mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have known better than to race in traffic,'' said
Luyendyk, whose right-front wheel was clipped by Tyce Carlson while
he making a risky pass between Turns 3 and 4. ``It was my
responsibility as the leader to make the pass cleanly.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, who won here in 1990 and 1997, announced last year
that he would retire after Sunday's race. He finished a
disappointing 22nd Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get over these kinds of disappointments easy,'' he said. ``I
had so much fun driving today. In thinking back on today, when I
got out of the car, the crowd was going nuts. I was trying to take
it all in.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other drivers _ Roberto Moreno and Tony Stewart _ attempted
double-duty this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, who, like Gordon, drove the Motorola 300 and the
Indianapolis 500, finished fourth on Saturday but settled for a
20th-place finish Sunday after his car succumbed to a transmission
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's attempt was more tricky. Immediately after finishing
ninth Sunday, the 1996-97 IRL champion flew to Charlotte, N.C.,
where he drove in a stock-car race, Nascar's Coca-Cola 600. That is
almost eight hours in race cars and 1,100 miles of racing in one
day. He was the second driver to do this. John Andretti did it
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Eliseo Salazar, the veteran Chilean driver who is notorious for
not finishing races, tested out the IRL's new wheel-restraining
system on Lap 10. The crash was bad news for him and his Nienhouse
Motorsports team, but it was good news for league officials, who
saw the tether system at work for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar lost control of his race car between Turns 3 and 4 and
smacked into the concrete wall. The impact was hard enough to tear
off one of his rear wheels, but the high-strength tethers that were
installed last week kept the wheel from becoming a dangerous
projectile. The tethers were mandated by the IRL after three
spectators were killed and several other fans were injured when a
detached wheel catapulted into the stands at Lowe's Motor Speedway
in North Carolina earlier this month.

hit-and-run approach to covering the shootings at Columbine High

Waxman, a Reform jew, signs a bar mitzvah certificate last week.
More than a century ago, Reform leaders declared such practices as
wearing skullcaps and prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to
be the dated relics of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on
social ethics and a highly cerebral approach to the faith. But in a
symbolically resonant gesture, the Reform's rabbinic arm, the
Central Conference of American Rabbis, last week adopted a document
that encourages the movement's members to explore traditional
rituals. (Frances Roberts/New York Times Photo)

by a loader on May 18. Mexican officials have explained the
mounting water shortage in the northern Mexican region as one of
the vagaries of nature. But Torreon residents and several experts
said that deforestation, wasteful irrigation, and water-intensive
industrial processes ill-suited to an arid region, have worsened
the crisis. (Keith Dannemiller/New York Times Photo)

RANDY JOHNSON UNSETTLES THE METS' LINEUP EVEN MORE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing Randy Johnson is punishment enough. But having
to face the 6-foot-10-inch left-hander when your team is struggling
is cruel.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets fell behind by seven runs in the first three
innings Sunday in losing by 10-1 to Johnson and the Arizona
Diamondbacks. No wonder that frustration was the catchword in the
Mets' clubhouse, due to Johnson's pitching and two home runs by
Steve Finley, who drove in five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (6-2), making his first appearance against the Mets
before 38,302 fans at Shea Stadium, struck out 10 in eight innings.
The surging Diamondbacks, who have won their last six games,
completed a three-game sweep of the reeling Mets, the first time
the Mets lost a three-game series at Shea since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii, who had won four straight, lasted just two and
two-thirds innings, allowing seven earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Because Atlanta lost in extra innings to the Los Angeles
Dodgers, the Mets were able to remain three games behind the Braves
in the National League East. But there are signs of trouble beneath
the surface of the Mets, who are 27-23 through the first 50 games,
and a team meeting was led by Manager Bobby Valentine after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mets had won six of eight games before the
Diamondbacks came to town, there are grumblings on the team.
``There are a lot of guys who are upset that there is no set
lineup,'' one veteran player said over the weekend. ``Look around
at the other teams. They have the same lineup every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine bristled when asked about a set lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just who is it that uses the same lineup every day?''
Valentine said Sunday. ``I watched the Yankees the last three
nights and they used three different lineups. As long as the core's
the same, what difference does it make?''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who makes up that core remains unclear. Rickey Henderson
was unhappy Saturday because he didn't start. He was in a better
mood Sunday morning when he was in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said he had been upset Saturday because the weather
was good, the field dry and he felt there was no reason to be
overly cautious with his right knee. But Sunday he said he
understood why Valentine had played Brian McRae, Roger Cedeno and
Benny Agbayani in the outfield Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling the lineup will get more difficult for Valentine in
coming weeks, although juggling is one of his strengths. After
Sunday's unsightly loss, the Mets activated Bobby Bonilla from the
disabled list and optioned pitcher Rigo Beltran to Class AAA
Norfolk. Earlier in the day, the Mets optioned outfielder Jermaine
Allensworth to Norfolk and purchased the contract of the utilityman
Melvin Mora.
</P>
<P>
   Now Valentine _ whose team plays three games at home against
Cincinnati starting Monday afternoon and then plays the Yankees in
three games at Yankee Stadium beginning Friday _ must determine
what to do with five outfielders, any of whom could make a case for
starting.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who has been hampered since spring training by a partly
torn right knee ligament, has said he and the Mets ``are on the
same page'' about his being activated. Still, the 36-year-old, who
makes $5.9 million a year, is batting .157.
</P>
<P>
   ``We activated him because he's healthy,'' General Manager Steve
Phillips said. ``And Bobby will make the decisions from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno leads the major leagues in stolen bases with 28 and is
batting .323 after he hit his first home run as a Met, off Johnson.
Agbayani is batting .451.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Mets keep playing Cedeno and Agbayani, who seem to have
become favorites of Valentine? Or does he go back to the starting
outfield he began the season with: Henderson, Bonilla and McRae?
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has had to juggle his lineup since the fifth game of
the season, when catcher Mike Piazza went down with a knee injury.
Bonilla, McRae and Henderson have all missed time because of sore
knees, as has pitcher Al Leiter, who will start Monay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rey Ordonez, has missed the last two games because of
problems with his right knee. The injury precipitated Allensworth's
demotion, and Mora started at shortstop in place of Ordonez Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine seemed incredulous over Ordonez's injury, especially
because he suited up on Saturday and then refused to go into the
game. Valentine had wanted Ordonez to at least be announced as a
pinch-hitter in hopes of tempting Arizona Manager Buck Showalter to
take out a left-handed pitcher and bring in a right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine benched Ordonez once this season because of a bad
attitude. But Ordonez said Sunday: ``If I can play, I can play. And
if I can't, I can't. A day off is a day off. I have to take care of
my knee early in the season. When it feels better, I'll play. Why
pinch-hit? Do I want to hurt it more and be out longer?''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game, Valentine said: ``I've managed 12 years
and haven't had too many days when a guy couldn't go on the field
and he was in uniform. In fact, it's never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he couldn't imagine playing Ordonez in the next
couple of games, even if Ordonez said he could play. ``We can't
risk hurting the knee,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, another veteran said that frustration over losing led to
the players' discontent, implying that there would be less
grumbling by the players if the Mets were winning more regularly.

 &HT;    CYBERSCENE: Economists can find plenty of numbers
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When lists are made of all the wild and crazy things a person
can do on the Internet, learning about economics does not often top
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   The average person is keen on learning how to turn a fast buck
through something as comparatively sane as online investing and
Web-based investment sites. People are also interested in the
totally bogus get-rich schemes that are promoted by e-mail and
off-the-wall Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But, without some sort of a basic grounding in economics, much
of the information you'll find is hard to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the Web is an excellent university for economics and _
by spending a little time learning the lingo and rules of the game
_ you can turn that quick education into knowledge that can be a
practical help.
</P>
<P>
   So let's start our educational journey today with a site called
Selected Economic Resources on the Web at www.lib.umich.edu
</P>
<P>
   /libhome/rrs/classes/econ.htm. OK, so some of it is a little
over your head. For instance, most of us might blink our eyes a few
times at the link for the Heterodox Economics Archive that promises
to take you to the ``mailing list archives for the Post Keynesian
thought discussion group and the progressive economists group.''
</P>
<P>
   But other links, including one to online economics texts, can
help you get your feet planted on admittedly shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   The next site is also a collection of links, perhaps one of the
best. It's simply called Economics Resources and is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .clark.net/pub/lschank/web
</P>
<P>
   /econ.html. Take a quick look at the link called ``Best of the
Economics Sites.'' Clicking there will take you to some sites,
mostly maintained by universities, that will help give you a
relatively simple explanation of some basic laws and theories.
While you're there, check out the link to the archives at the
University of Nebraska _ it's especially complete and down to earth
(well, as down to earth as economics gets).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at some point in your journey through economics,
you'll want to get a little more practical. Keynesian thought,
after all, is heady stuff, but you're taking this short course in
economics to figure out how to become more prosperous (or at least
understand why it was a real dumb move to buy shares in a buggy
whip factory).
</P>
<P>
   So you'll want to visit a more practical site called
De-mystifying Marketing Plans at gmarketing.com/tactics
</P>
<P>
   /weekly111.html. Here you'll get plain talk on how to take all
your theories and compile them in a way that will impress the most
jaded venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of making money by understanding economics, there's
another site you'll want to visit. It's run by the Motley Fools.
Their page at www.fool.com
</P>
<P>
   /school/dowinvesting
</P>
<P>
   /dowinvesting.htm will help explain an investing method called
Dow Investing.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of the Fools, who occasionally appear in this
newspaper's Sunday business section, here is how it works: ``The
approach teaches you how to select a group of beaten-down (Dow
Jones) stocks and buy and hold them for one year, playing the
likely turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Now will that make you rich?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But, even if you lose your shirt, you now will be
able to explain the whole process to your admiring friends using
the most impressive sort of language.

 &HT;    Web genealogy data can inform, enthrall
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to genealogy for beginners. Don't feel awkward; I'm a
beginner, too.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I wrote a column about my own tedious but ultimately
rewarding search to find out more about my grandparents and
great-grandparents. My search was a hit-or-miss process, and if you
do exactly what I did, chances are your search will be hit or miss,
too. As many people wrote to tell me, there are many libraries,
archives, professional genealogists and software programs that will
help you conduct far better searches than I can. If you're really
serious about researching your family tree as far back as you can,
you will eventually have to leave your computer and head out into
the real word.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you start your search on the Web, I can tell you
there is an exciting element to researching your family or anything
else, for that matter. Sitting at a computer, typing in a Web
address that might eventually bring you to a site or database that
includes information about your family is like a big scavenger
hunt. It also gives you a sense of how much information is
available on the Internet and what a vast store of information is
out there. It may sound corny, but sometimes the information you
suddenly find at your fingertips is breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some links to get you started:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure who Cyndi Howells is, but she offers up a very
popular and extensive and easy-to-use set of links on her own site
called Cyndi's List of Genealogy Links at www.cyndislist.com.
According to the frequently asked questions list on the site,
Cyndi, with a little help from her husband, maintains this
amazingly detailed archive of genealogy links all by herself. She
encourages users to let her know if they encounter links that are
outdated or just don't work. She says she has 41,700 links on her
site.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great place for beginners to start searching, whether
your family hails from Eastern Europe or Outer Mongolia. Cyndi's
List also features a ``getting started'' section for newbies to
look over before beginning their searches. The site also offers a
mailing list for novice researchers offering even more help and
information.
</P>
<P>
   From Cyndi's List, I went to a site called JewishGen at www
</P>
<P>
   .jewishgen.org/databases. This was where things started to get
rough. The JewishGen site allows users to search for families and
towns all over Western and Eastern Europe. It also offers to
connect you with other researchers looking for the same families or
cities. However, if you don't know the exact spelling of your
ancestor's surname or it was changed entirely by immigration
officials at Ellis Island, you'll be spending a lot of time here
typing in every possible spelling you can think of and finding
yourself at the mercy of the ``Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can tell, it takes whatever you give it and searches
something, anything, really, that sounds similar. For example,
entering my grandmother's birthplace, a city called Slonim, turned
up about 40 cities from Albania to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The search also turned up a Slonim and Slonin, a classic example
of how frustrating these searches can be if you have very little to
go on. Luckily I knew how the name of the city was spelled and
could continue on from there. Clicking on the city, I was connected
to an amazing map informing me that Slonim was 107.7 miles west
southwest of Minsk in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Cyndi's List or Ancestry.com will also take more
advanced researchers to databases that will give you birth,
marriage and death records for nearly every city and state in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   If your family has been in America for a significant period,
you'll find the links from Genealogy.com particularly useful. From
this database, I was able to find my grandfather's birthday and
Social Security number, two shreds of information that might come
in handy when I try to discover exactly when he came to the United
States and from where. Some of the information on Ancestry.com is
free, while some you'll have to pay for. Even if you opt not to pay
for information, you'll be amazed at the types of information you
can locate here from New York State Civil War rosters to
biographies of Underground Railroad operators.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if you are just starting out on the genealogy trail,
don't expect to trace your family back to a 17th century French
chateau on your first try. There's a lot of trial and error, a lot
of dead ends and an awful lot of Web sites that are nothing more
than shopping sites to entice you into buying one software package
or other. And always, always keep in mind when it comes to surfing
the Web, sometimes the journey can be just as important and
enjoyable as the destination.

 &HT;    TECHTOOLS: APX-4620 speakers help computer sound
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labtec, the computer speaker company, sent me its APX-4620
system for review, and it has certainly transformed the way my
computer sounds _ as well as the way it looks.
</P>
<P>
   The APX-4620 is a three-piece system, two tweeter-midrange
satellite speakers and a subwoofer. Much to my surprise, the specs
say each satellite speaker contains two tweeters and a midrange
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny fellows, considering each satellite is only about 10 inches
tall. The outside edge of each is curved and is about 3 1/2 inches
wide at its fattest point.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-cream-colored satellite speakers come with adhesive
brackets to attach them to the sides of the monitor. I've never
mounted speakers on a monitor before. Each of these speakers has
little rubber feet on it, too, so obviously they can be set on the
desktop, although the instructions make no mention of that.
</P>
<P>
   I obediently set them up on the monitor, which makes the whole
thing look like the head of a huge, bat-eared robot whose body is
hiding under the table. I find this a little intimidating, but I
suppose I could get used to it, and it does free up some desktop
space.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanically, there is a great deal to like about this system.
The woofer, which is a heavy black box that sits on a little
platform stand under the table, is the only portion that has to be
plugged in to an electrical outlet. It supplies power for the
entire audio system. The right-side tweeter-midrange carries all
the controls _ knobs for volume, treble and bass adjust, and
Labtec's Spatializer stereo imaging system.
</P>
<P>
   This panel also has receptacles for headphones and a microphone,
a very nice touch.
</P>
<P>
   The entire system is quite simple to set up. All the cables are
color-coded, and the instructions are clear and simple. The base of
each of the high-range speakers is hollow and contains the plug
receptacles and a post, around which excess wire can be wrapped.
You still wind up with one wire on the left and three on the right
running from the speakers to the back of the table, but if you
never look at anything but the front of the monitor, that's no
problem.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who looks at the side of a monitor? And what real
computer user worries about a rat's nest of wires? Comes with the
territory, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the Labtec system takes a little getting used to,
at least for me. With the speakers mounted even with the front of
the monitor, they are more or less in your face, so to speak, and
it's fair to say the sound is more or less in your ears.
</P>
<P>
   I don't listen to music CDs through my computer; I've got a
pretty good stereo system here in the engine room with speakers
that, to my wife's everlasting disgust, are 3 feet tall. Compared
to that, the Labtec system is a little anemic. But if the monitor
looks a little odd with two speakers for ears, think how bizarre it
would look suspended between a couple of tower speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the physical affront of listening to speakers that are only
2 feet from my ears wore off, the Labtecs began to sound quite
good. The spatial imaging circuitry works very well. It seems to
spread the sound curtain out beyond the edges of the speakers
without leaving a hole in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   If you turn the volume up enough to actually hear the subwoofer
woofing, and if you stay close enough to the system to keep your
hands on the keyboard, you are getting very near the threshold of
pain.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen this system advertised at less than $140, and it's
well worth it to anyone serious about computer sound.

 &HT;    By cell phone and e-mail, our electronic future has arrived
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox news Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a typical day in the life of a modern man.
</P>
<P>
   My friend in Frotheim, Germany, let me know that she was off on
a bicycle trip with her husband and kids. And, just a few minutes
later, while taking a walk in the park, I got an update on a friend
who has a sick cat. Then I came back here to the newspaper and made
arrangements _ coordinating it with my boss and someone in another
department _ for one of our reporters to write about the results of
a technology survey.
</P>
<P>
   I found out about the bicycle trip in an e-mail that popped on
the screen of one of my two work computers. The news of the sick
cat came in a call to my digital phone while I was taking that
walk. I made all the arrangements for covering the technology
survey without talking to a single person _ I did it all by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   And, somewhere along the line that day, I did what I do best. I
discovered the obvious. The future I used to write about really has
arrived. That's a big deal to me because one of the big complaints
in my business _ writing about technology _ is that a lot of what
we cover and a lot of what we speculate about never quite seems to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   I realized on that day that while things might not happen with
the speed and drama of a comet flashing across the sky, a lot of
things that would have been geewhiz topics for a feature story when
I started in this business have become a reality. For instance,
I've watched cellular phones go from an exotic business tool for a
few to a tiny and affordable service that has become part of our
routine daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all this technology is nifty and convenient, but something
more important is going on here beyond the ability to order a pizza
while you drive home or send e-mail across the world in a flash.
Maybe like me, you may need to stop and think for a while to see
the importance behind that.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with e-mail. It's become routine _ not just for
wired folks like me, but for my friend, too, the wife of a village
police chief who works in a New Age bookstore. No one in her family
has ever been to America. I've never been to Frotheim, but we talk
and learn and our world grows smaller and easier to understand.
</P>
<P>
   I know from her that Germany is changing: Women are running for
office and getting elected. She learns from me about how life is in
Atlanta, and I do my best to answer her questions, such as the last
one: Is America really a land of opportunity? We've profited from
the conversation in ways that are equally important and hard to
explain.
</P>
<P>
   And that tiny digital phone in my pocket has come a long way.
When I got my first cellular phone, it was more of an electronic
lifesaver than a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The air time was expensive, and the batteries had the life span
of a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   But now the phone stays in my shirt pocket, and when there are
things that are important to my life, like friends with sick cats,
I can be there.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of becoming an electronic leash, the phone allows me
to take a walk without worrying that I can't be there if a friend
needs me.
</P>
<P>
   In the past (and I'm dang near famous as a worrier), I would
have sat by the telephone worried that my friend would need to
talk. Instead, I was able to go about my normal routine and not let
a friend down.
</P>
<P>
   We _ me included _ spend a lot of time talking about how cold
technology is. But when used right, it can become a way to swim in
waters that are becoming increasingly swift and deep.

 &HT;    MAC REPORT: Software developers finally bite on burgeoning Apple
market
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year about this time, Apple Computer trumpets that
thousands of new titles have been released for the Mac. If it were
true, this claim rarely translated into visible titles in stores or
catalogs, which continued to offer the same shrinking list of new
Mac software.
</P>
<P>
   But this year it's finally different. Once again, Apple Computer
announced some 3,000-plus new titles for the Mac and, by golly, it
is true.
</P>
<P>
   It seems developers are finally convinced that Apple Computer's
share of the market, driven upward by the success of its iMac and
PowerBook computers, will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to what Phil Steinmeyer, PopTop Software's CEO and
lead designer of ``Railroad Tycoon II,'' said online recently.
``The Mac is a fast-growing gaming platform, and there are legions
of loyal gamers.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a Windows developer? But it's true. Not only are
developers championing the Mac again, they are releasing titles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the number of new titles for the Mac is almost
overwhelming. Take a look at games, a category in which most
developers released only for Windows just last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now some of the biggest developers are announcing new titles
daily for the Mac. Among the games coming to the Mac are ``SimCity
3000,'' ``Civilization: Call to Power,'' ``Quake III,'' ``Falcon
4.0'' and Electronic Arts' football simulation ``Madden 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something here for just about everybody.
</P>
<P>
   While games are important, it's not the only genre of Mac
software experiencing a revival. New titles for desktop publishing,
Web publishing and graphic programs are also hitting the market.
One example is Canvas 6.0 by Miami-based developer Deneba Software.
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising, there's a trickle of new business
productivity software for the Mac. This is the category in which
Apple Computer has always been weakest.
</P>
<P>
   The trend began last year when Microsoft released a new version
of Office 98, which includes Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint.
Since then, smaller players have released new software or announced
coming releases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, BrainForest has released a powerful outliner that
works on both the Mac and the PalmPilot. And Nisus Software
reportedly is nearing release of a big new upgrade for its
acclaimed Nisus Writer word processor.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, if Apple keeps on a roll, these new titles could
just be the beginning of a growing roster of new software for the
Mac.

 &HT;    POWER USER: Boot up before buying PC from `screwdriver' shop
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jerry Yandel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember that $750 PC I wrote about not too long ago? Now it's
less than $500. You just have to know where to find them.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of ``screwdriver'' shops all over metro
Atlanta. They build systems on the fly, cranking out mini-towers in
the back while taking orders in the front.
</P>
<P>
   They use generic OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts
that come in shiny, plain, static-resistant packaging with scant
documentation. And, in general, purchases come with a warranty for
one year, parts and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The incredibly low prices are the result of bulk ordering
hardware and selling hundreds of systems a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it all by volume. The volume makes up for having no
margin,'' said a manager of one of these retailers, who compared
his store to a Waffle House for computers. These shops range from
strip-mall stores with nice display cases to a couple of tiny rooms
with some PCs on folding tables hidden in an office park.
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of buying from one of these stores is to
be a smart buyer and a savvy consumer. I know, because I wasn't. I
bought two systems and a monitor for about $1,000 from the retailer
advertising the absolute lowest prices. I had purchased from them
before without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the systems were reading 32 megabytes of RAM
as 28 MB, and one of the hard drives was only showing up as 2
gigabytes instead of the 6.4 for which I had paid. Other than that,
they ran fine.
</P>
<P>
   (Here's the kind of sub-$500 system we're talking about: a
speedy little 300-MHz AMD gamer with 32 MB of RAM, a 4-gig hard
drive, Windows 98 and all the trimmings _ 8 MB AGP video, 56k bps
modem, 16-bit sound card, 2 USB ports, 40X CD-ROM, speakers,
keyboard and mouse. Total: $480 before tax.)
</P>
<P>
   My ordeal took a week and a half and three round trips from
Stockbridge to Jimmy Carter Boulevard _ about 300 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The fun began when I faxed in my order Friday evening. Saturday
morning, I got a phone call telling me my systems would be ready at
2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When I buy a computer _ whether for me or someone else _ I get
all giddy, like a kid who spots the Scream Machine sticking over
the treetops on his way to Six Flags. So you can imagine my
disappointment when I made the one-way, 50-mile drive only to be
told that they were plumb out of CPUs and new ones were due
Tuesday. OK, fine. The price is right. I can wait.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, I called to confirm my order, and I went back Wednesday
morning. Only one machine was ready, because they only had one
4-gigabyte hard drive _ but I could get a 6-gig for another $20.
Fine, here's a check. I drove around back, and they loaded up my
stuff on a dolly. When I got home, I found the RAM and hard drive
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   I could have saved myself a trip _ and this is an important step
for anyone buying from a screwdriver shop _ by asking them to boot
up the system.
</P>
<P>
   A few quick clicks _ right-click the hard drive to see its
properties and check the size, right-click ``my computer'' to get
its properties and see the amount of RAM _ would have uncovered the
discrepancies I found later. Instead, I happily rushed out. ... And
I found myself heading back to Gwinnett County a week later to get
some of the promised tech support.
</P>
<P>
   The tech support I got was a Phillips head screwdriver and a
load of attitude from the guy behind the counter.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't even take the cover off to look at the hard drive or
check that the SDRAM was in the motherboard slot completely. (I
once solved a similar RAM problem by properly seating a SIMM in its
slot. It took 30 seconds.)
</P>
<P>
   I could have checked the machines' innards at home, but a piece
of tape on the cover warned that its removal voided the warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Hah! I ended up voiding the warranty all over the counter
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing they would do was give me a new drive and SDRAM,
but I would have to take out the hard drive and replace it myself.
</P>
<P>
   So, I did that. Then I took my toys and went home.
</P>
<P>
   I have not fired up the system again. And, I guess, if it is
still reading the drive and RAM incorrectly, it will be up to me to
find out why. (Another thing: Only buy from stores that give you
CD-ROM copies of Windows. Those will come in mighty handy if fixing
the systems involves reinstalling the OS.)
</P>
<P>
   In the future, I probably won't use that outfit again. Several
of their competitors' prices are only $20 to $30 higher. But that's
no guarantee that their customer service is any more reality-based.
</P>
<P>
   Whomever I use, I won't leave the store without booting up.

 &HT;    TECH MEDIA: Summer movies roll with sites, games
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of new movies are coming out this summer, and most of them
have supporting Web sites. The June issue of Yahoo! Internet Life
features a list of all these commercial Hollywood sites. Plus, it
lists some other noncommercial sites maintained by fans. You'll
find sites listed for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' ``Austin Powers'' and ``South Park,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence of various media technologies has turned the
high-tech economy on its head in the past several years. Read how
this phenomenon has affected industries from telephone service to
the Internet in a new book called ``Killer App.'' Written by Larry
Downes and Chunka Mui, the book examines why some new high-tech
products have succeeded and others failed. The book is published by
Harvard Business School Publishing and retails for $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You've seen ``The Phantom Menace.'' Now you can check out the
software. Yes, no sooner than the movie was released, along came a
computer CD game based on the story line. One reason for the speed
of the release is that the same company, LucasArts, was responsible
for the game and the movie. Named after the movie, the game lets
players take on roles from the film. You can play Obi-Wan Kenobi,
Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala or Captain Panaka. The game, which
contains animated violence, is published only for PCs running
Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the best spring in years for Mac gamers. All of a
sudden, developers are releasing lots of popular Windows titles for
the Mac platform. Among those titles are the air combat game
``Falcon 4.0,'' ``RailRoad Tycoon II'' and ``Quake III.''
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   It's the season for lawn care, and the Internet is a great place
to find information and help. Start at Lawnworld.com, a good
compendium site loaded with text-based information. You can trust
the information, which was developed and compiled by the
agriculture department at Ohio State University. The site is
located at home.att.net

 &HT;    B-movie nominations sought Web site honors classic B-movies
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider it a strike back against the Force, a way to make your
voice heard amid the noise surrounding the summer blockbuster
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at B-Movie Theater, the ones behind www.b-movie.com,
are looking for nominations to the B-Movie Hall of Fame. B-movies
are the quirky middle children of film, celluloid afterthoughts
that were not squeaky enough to get the grease afforded big-budget
films.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame defines a B-movie as a movie, either
independent or studio, where the entertainment and/or artistic
value transcends the perceived limitations of its low budget.
Movies like ``The Leopard Man,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   B-movie fans can nominate their favorite movies and actors from
the nomination page, www.b-movie.com.hof
</P>
<P>
   /hof.html. Voting ends July 30. No more than 10 nominations per
category will be counted, so B-movie zealots won't be able to stuff
the virtual box voting for ``Death Race 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 inductees will be announced in August during the first
B-Movie Film Festival in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 1,000 actors and films were nominated. Actors from
the first Hall of Fame class, the Babe Ruths and Ty Cobbs of their
industry, include Jeanne Carmen, the Bowery Boys, Ronald Reagan and
Nancy Davis (Reagan) and Michael Herz.
</P>
<P>
   B-Movie Theater is owned and run by Salt City Home Video, a
seller of independent film and videos in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Web, women and sports
</P>
<P>
   A survey by NPD Online Research found that 36 percent of women
who go online check out sports news while there. Of those, 46
percent get more sports news on the Web than they did six months
ago, and 23 percent said the Web was their primary source of sports
news.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, www.espn.com, www.abcsports.com and www.nfl.com, were
the most popular Web sports sites visited by women, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic sports survey, conducted in February, included
3,127 people. Of those, 1,595 were female. The survey found that
women who use the Web for sports news tend to be between the ages
of 25 and 44, with an average household income of $64,000. Female
Internet sports fans tend to be married (68 percent) and
college-educated (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   NPD Online Research is based in Port Washington, N.Y. Its parent
company, NPD Group, is the founder of Media Metrix, a company that
estimates traffic on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Use your thumb
</P>
<P>
   Passwords can be cracked. People use a familiar word for the
password that lets them log on to their computer systems. Sometimes
it's the name of their cat or the name of the town in which they
were born or the street where they live.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that the people who try to break into
computer systems use software that can try every word in the
English language in a matter of hours. That's why computer security
experts recommend making your password a combination of words and
numbers, like Scruffy99.
</P>
<P>
   But if that's too complicated and you would rather spend a few
dollars, there's something interesting on the market.
</P>
<P>
   U.are.U is a $149 device that you can program to recognize your
fingerprint. A user puts his finger on the sensor, from any
direction, and the device reads it.
</P>
<P>
   The device works on Windows 95 and Windows 98 and requires 16
megabytes of RAM and a Pentium-class processor. To set it up, scan
your fingerprint four times. The program creates a mathematical
code from your fingerprint's features. The code is then encrypted.
The system is designed to store and recognize more than one
fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine, in a February review, said the device was not ``as
fussy as some.''
</P>
<P>
   The deluxe package sells for $199. The plus package is $149. A
$1,000 software development kit is required to integrate the system
into local-business applications, such as medical file management
and badge access.
</P>
<P>
   U.are.U was developed by Digital Persona of Redwood City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The device is on sale at computer retailers and online at
www.digitalpersona.com.

TEXAS LEGISLATION TO RAISE SPEED LIMIT TO 80 MPH HITS POTHOLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legislation to raise speed limits to 80 mph on
some Texas interstates and 75 mph on certain other highways
apparently was running out of gas late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although slightly different versions of the bill won easy
approval in both the House and the Senate in recent weeks, the
House sponsor said that enough concerns had been raised about the
measure that he probably wouldn't move for final passage.
</P>
<P>
   One safety concern was a related bill, which lawmakers sent
Saturday to Gov. George W. Bush, that will allow large trucks to
legally travel as fast as autos, even 80 mph if both bills became
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some questions about the 80 mile an hour speed
limit,'' said Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, the House sponsor.
``And, frankly, I think a lot of the concerns are because of
misunderstandings on the part of different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallego said some people feared 80 mph speed limits in urban
areas, although the bill applies only to rural highways.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Madla, D-San Antonio, said some senators were
concerned about allowing large trucks to legally drive 80 on some
interstates.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego's and Madla's bill, House Bill 3328, would raise the
speed limit from 70 to 75 mph on highways where the higher limit
was warranted by a Texas Department of Transportation speed study.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have raised the legal limit to 80 mph on
east-west interstates in counties with fewer than 25,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego said he wanted to raise the speed limit in his area of
the state, sparsely populated West Texas, where it can take hours
at today's legal speeds to get from one town to another.
</P>
<P>
   But the 80 mph provision also would have affected a 110-mile
stretch of I-10 between Houston and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Bills had to win final approval before midnight Sunday. The
Legislature will conclude its five-month session Monday, but the
last day is reserved for technical changes to bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego said the speed limit issue could be studied further
between now and the next regular session in 2001. ``I'm not
uncomfortable letting it go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The related bill, HB 676, which was sent Saturday to Bush, would
allow trucks to legally travel the same speed as cars, instead of
their current highway restriction of 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety experts believe it is actually safer when all
vehicles are traveling the same speed.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislators sent Bush SB 365, which would allow the state to
monitor some repeat sex offenders after their release from prison.
Convicts determined to be sexual ``predators'' would be required to
wear electronic tracking devices and attend treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawmakers completed action on HB 2611 to require candidates
and political committees that spend more than $20,000 a year to
file their campaign finance reports electronically.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislators approved SB 560, which would cap basic phone rates
for six years and lower the cost of in-state long distance calls.
But the measure would allow Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. to
increase the cost of other services, such as Caller ID and call
forwarding.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Senate approved and sent to the governor HB 713, a new
scholarship program for students who maintain a 2.0 grade point
average or better in their first year of college. The measure
includes a special provision that would provide a free college
education for former prisoner of war Stephen Gonzales of
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   _ Senators also sent to Bush SB 138, which would prevent
government from infringing on the free exercise of religion. The
measure was prompted by a recent dispute between the city of Boerne
and a church's attempt to expand its building.

SPORTS COLUMN: PACERS SHARE STOICISM OF THEIR COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ No bands, no cheering crowds met the Indiana
Pacers at the airport here when they returned home after winning
the opening-round playoff series in Milwaukee two weeks ago. There
were no bands, no cheering crowds to hail the Pacers after they won
their second-round playoff series, the Eastern Conference
semifinals, in Philadelphia last week.
</P>
<P>
   The team returned home quietly, if not stealthily. There was a
reason for this. The Pacers carefully orchestrated no orchestra
regarding the arrival of the team. No announcement was made about
it. By orders of the head coach, Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won anything yet,'' Bird explained. ``We'll
celebrate a championship. Nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   And they still haven't won anything _ particularly in the
Eastern Conference finals, where the Knicks won the opening game
Sunday night in Market Square Arena, 93-90.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' center, said going into the
four-of-seven-game series, ``This is war!'' but Bird, who became
coach of the Pacers last season, only said: ``I came here to win a
championship. This team has been to the conference finals before,
but has never advanced. I came here to advance.''
</P>
<P>
   And so there had been no chest-thumping or crowing after the
team swept Milwaukee in three games and Philadelphia in four.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is one Pacer in particular who now mirrors the
seeming stoicism of the coach, it is Mark Jackson, as unlikely as
that may have seemed before this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackson, now in his 12th season in the NBA, who has been
known for his celebratory and wacky gyrations after scoring a
basket, let alone after winning a game. He'd spread his arms after
sinking a drive shot and come back upcourt with arms spread as if
he were an airplane. He switched to a shimmy after scoring a hoop,
and it was hard to tell whether he was exhibiting himself as a fan
dancer or a blender.
</P>
<P>
   Bird watched this last season with only partly disguised
disdain. Then the Pacers lost to the Bulls in seven games in the
conference finals. Before this season began, Bird, according to a
source with the Pacers, ``told him to cut it out.'' Showboating,
Bird said, did not advance the cause. Bird had won three
championships as the player with the Boston Celtics, and was in the
finals twice more. He speaks evenly, and his candor is both
understood and appreciated by the players. ``He's been there,''
Jackson has said. ``He knows.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, no Red Baron, no Tina Turner takeoffs for Jackson.
Instead, he has had one of the best seasons of his career. ``His
floor leadership killed us,'' Larry Brown, coach of the 76ers, said
after the series last week. Jackson's ratio of assists to turnovers
was one of the best in the league during the regular season and has
continued into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And he has, except for an occasional look of triumph _ it just
seemed to bubble up. But Bird remains the unruffled, consistently
cool, expressionless professional.
</P>
<P>
   When Reggie Miller hit a 3-point shot with four-tenths of a
second to go in Game 3 of the Pacer-Bulls series last year to put
the Pacers ahead, 107-105, Bird's face was as straight as a string
as the Bulls called time out. ``He knew,'' Miller said, ``that
there was still time left on the clock, and that Michael Jordan was
in the game. Nothing was for sure.'' Indeed, Jordan's last-second
shot rimmed out to give the Pacers the victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacer players are now comporting themselves with the
attitude reflected by their coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that if Larry Bird were in a car accident,
you wouldn't need paramedics to give him a blood transfusion,''
said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who attended the Bulls-Pacers series
last year. ``That's because he has ice water in his veins.''
</P>
<P>
   We remember, for example, when the Pistons went ahead by a point
in the last seconds of a playoff game in Boston and Dennis Rodman
and others were jumping around and celebrating the victory, until
Isiah Thomas tossed the ball inbound and Bird intercepted it and
swiftly passed to Dennis Johnson for the winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   There is a maturity in Bird that was evident even in his first
season in the NBA. ``I've always been that way,'' Bird said. ``I've
always liked hanging out with older guys. Right now, some of my
best friends are in their 60s. I just seem to be more comfortable
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many others in basketball, who have never had to work at
anything else in their lives, Bird worked on a garbage truck one
year at home. This was after he quit Indiana University and the
oppressive Bobby Knight after one month on campus following his
high school graduation. Bird returned French Lick, Ind., to sort
out his life, and got the job which, he said, taught him as a
teen-ager a great deal about life's realities as well as working
with men.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, then, that the Pacers have performed like the
best kinds of garbage collectors: thorough, prideful and not
heading for beers until the last alley is cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, if there is to be any kind of sweep, it would be
by the Knicks, who lead the series by 1-0.

 &HT;    TRACING YOUR FAMILY'S HISTORY: Find out this summer where your
roots begin
 &HT;    By Ted Anthony
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was summertime, way back in 1982, and I was bored. Trapped in
the void between middle school and a brand-new high school, I had
little to do and a lot of time to do it. My answer was a summer
project _ my family history.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years later, it's still a big part of my life. Why?
Because it's fun, it takes you to interesting places and it helps
you understand where you came from. It's like spending time with
fascinating relatives who aren't asking you to mow the lawn or do
the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   When I started, I already had some raw materials _ many families
do. My dad had stored in the closet of his study a bunch of old
papers. Some were written by my grandfather, whom I never knew.
Others were typed on manual typewriters and transcribed from even
older records.
</P>
<P>
   These records took me all the way back to the first Anthony in
America, Manoel Antonio, an 18th century merchant seaman who was
said to be Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   I was off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, I became kind of obsessed. I charted old family
relationships in notebooks, writing down in penciled block letters
the names I came across _ such as Freelove and Philander, Adelaide
and Royal, Sophronia and Aaron Isaac. I thought about the people
who came before me, what their lives were like and what was
important to them. It even got me interested in history _ over the
summer!
</P>
<P>
   But where do you go from there? It's easy. Try a few of these
ideas and create a summer project for yourself:
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk to your relatives, especially the older ones, and tape
record the interviews. This may not seem like ``family history'' to
you now, but if you ever have children or grandchildren, they'll be
happy you did this. Imagine hearing your great-great-grandmother's
voice on tape!
</P>
<P>
   _ What's more, you'd be surprised at what you'll learn. Most
everyone has a family story or two that they love to tell. Through
them you'll find a gateway to the past _ not only to your family's
past but to how people lived in ages different from our own. Take
notes, too; even though that sounds like a school thing to do,
it'll give you a written record of what you learned.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you can't interview relatives in person, ask them to answer
questionnaires. Mail a few out, and tell them what you want to
know: when they were born, what their parents' and grandparents'
names were, where they lived as children. Ask them to describe a
day in their lives when they were your age. You'll find some
interesting differences _ and some surprising similarities.
</P>
<P>
   _ If your family has been in the Atlanta area for more than a
generation or two, go to the public library (yikes, another
school-like thing to do). Ask for the local history section and
start digging.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when I was a kid, I went to our public library in
Pittsburgh to do family research. ``You're not going to find
anything there,'' my father insisted. I marched into the stacks and
dug up a history of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. It included a two-page
biography of my great-great-grandfather, a respected farmer named
Edward Mason Anthony, for whom I'm named.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have access to the Internet, try searching on Yahoo!
under the terms ``genealogy'' or ``family history.'' Those will
lead you to hundreds of sites that will help you on your way. With
the amount of stuff that's on the Web today, you might even find a
new relative or two to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your parents to take you to the places where your family
came from. If you visit the Washington Monument or Kitty Hawk or
Stone Mountain, why not go to the towns where your own family made
history as well? When you get there, look up your name in the phone
book and see what you find. And again _ write everything down.
Years from now, you'll be glad you did.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say history is bone-dry. To them I say this: My
ancestors were ship captains, immigrants, farmers, storekeepers,
fighters for religious freedom and more. They were all part of
American history, which makes me part of it too. I'm connected to
the past _ personally. I've visited some fascinating places in my
search. And by understanding where I came from, I'm closer to my
family, and I understand better who I am.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that doesn't sound at all bone-dry to me.

   Yugoslavia's leader was charged last week with crimes against
the people of Kosovo. The United Nations war crimes tribunal is
holding President Slobodan Milosevic personally responsible for the
mass killings of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavian government dismissed the charges as another

masterpiece to its original appearance. The 15-foot-tall,
30-foot-long painting, depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles at
the Last Supper, had decayed and turned grimy during the last 500
years. Some artists complain that the restorers went too far and
actually changed the original painting.

Avalanche pushes Stars to the brink 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DALLAS _ Stars fans were expecting Renoir. They got Ren and
Stimpy. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing the biggest game since the franchise moved to Texas six
years ago, the Stars bumbled their way to a 7-5 loss to the
Colorado Avalanche yesterday in Game 5 of the Western Conference
finals before the 45th consecutive sellout crowd at Reunion Arena. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Ed Belfour had his worst game of the playoffs, and
defenseman Shawn Chambers had possibly the worst game of his
career. The Stars as a whole put together one of their most
confusing efforts of the season at a time when they most needed
consistency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all, it made for a baffling afternoon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they got was what we gave them,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ``We just made far too many mistakes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, the Stars now have put themselves on the brink of
elimination. They will travel to Denver for tomorrow night's Game 6
trailing the best-of-seven series three games to two. The Stars,
who once held a 2-1 lead in this series and all the momentum, must
win the remaining two games if they hope to advance to the Stanley
Cup Finals for the third time in franchise history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said. ``It's time to pull up our shorts; there's no doubt
about that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars looked as if they were skating with their shorts down
for much of the game. Chambers twice made bad decisions on key
goals, Belfour allowed big shots to squirt through from the
perimeter for the first time in the series and Matvichuk lost a
personal battle with Avalanche center Peter Forsberg, who had vowed
to avenge what he perceived to be a dirty hit by Matvichuk in Game
4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And with all that, the score still was tied at 5-5 with 9:03
remaining in the game thanks to Pat Verbeek's gritty goal-scoring
effort. Verbeek muscled in his second goal of the playoffs on a
backhanded wraparound that cleanly beat Avalanche goalie Patrick
Roy and tied the score. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But only 2:19 later, Chambers, who had been benched for earlier
mistakes, finished off a tough night when he returned to the ice
for a rare third-period shift. After Avalanche center Joe Sakic
came up with a strong play to work high in the slot, Chambers left
Avalanche rookie Chris Drury alone in front of Belfour in hopes of
getting to Sakic, who fired a shot right past Chambers. Sergei
Zubov, Chambers' defensive partner, wasn't able to get to Drury
before the Avalanche rookie swiped a rebound past Belfour for the
game-winner at 13:16 of the third period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drury, who came up with the game-winning goal in overtime of
Game 4, has four game-winning goals in the playoffs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg added an empty-net goal for the Avalanche, who finally
cracked a Stars defense that had held them to 10 goals in the four
previous games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some tired mistakes,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``The physical and emotional side of this series is taking
its toll on people. Some of our slower people today really
struggled.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took advantage of uneven special-teams play for two
power-play goals and one shorthanded goal. But the Avalanche took
advantage of five-on-five situations as lines were juggled and
defensive pairings were mixed to compensate for the special-teams
play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Avalanche, which was missing top-end players
Theo Fleury (flu) and Milan Hejduk (broken collarbone), thrived in
the helter-skelter environment, and the Stars, masters of
discipline, looked totally out of place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We played their game; we fell into exactly the game they
wanted to play, and we couldn't come out of it because we couldn't
get the lead,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``There's no way we can let that
happen again. We didn't give ourselves a chance to win this game
because we just made far too many mistakes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Stars will have to find a way to fix those mistakes by
tomorrow night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to decide what we're going to do with our season in
the next 48 hours,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``We're
still in this, and it's still up to us what's going to happen. We
have to find a way to fix this before the next game.'' &QL;

PLAY OF STARS' DEFENSE IS QUITE STOOGE-LIKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Instead of the three stars of the game yesterday at
Reunion Arena, we're taking nominations for the Three Stooges of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Any three Stars defensemen, feel free to step forward.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of the most important day in franchise history,
or at least since the Stars arrived in Dallas from Minnesota six
years ago, the Stars completely forgot _ in the famous words of one
Darrell Royal _ who brung them to the dance in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   They allowed themselves to be suckered into a shootout with the
gunslinging Colorado Avalanche and _ no suprise here _ were
riddled, 7-5, in a game that was both immensely entertaining and
excruciatingly painful for the 45th consecutive sellout crowd at
Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning loss puts the Stars on a precipice they hoped
they'd never see during a playoff run that they were sure would
take them all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals: On the cusp of
elimination in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars must win first in Denver tomorrow night, then again
Friday night back at Reunion, or their season will be over.
</P>
<P>
   If stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump so eloquently
reminded us a while back, then the Stars went moronic at the most
inopportune time. The one thing they simply could not do against
star-laden Colorado was allow the Avalanche to turn Reunion into a
shooting gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a run-and-gun game,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher
conceded. ``I don't know how it happened, but we fell into it, and
that's not our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Duuuhhh!
</P>
<P>
   This was the absolute worst time for the Stars to abandon their
defense-first style of play, the philosophy that had won them the
Presidents' Trophy the past two seasons as the NHL's best
regular-season team. Not this on a day when goalie Ed Belfour was
giving up goals like Rangers starting pitchers cough up runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was facing a fusillade of odd-man rushes, but ``The
Eagle'' has made those same saves throughout the playoffs and _
sorry, Eddie _ we're spoiled. We've come to expect them every time
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw tired people on the ice for both teams,'' said an
obviously upset Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, who blamed the quick
turnaround from Game 4 and declined to comment on Belfour's
performance. ``It was pretty obvious who those players were. The
physical and emotional side of this series is taking its toll on
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had some people in trouble, and we had some people in
trouble. From a goal standpoint, people saw a pretty exciting
hockey game, and from an effort standpoint, a very exciting hockey
game. But we also saw a lot of uncharacteristic mistakes, a lot of
tired mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to pick on one player, because he wasn't alone out there,
but Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers was an awful minus-4 for the
game. He was on the ice, either standing or prone, for four of
Colorado's seven goals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, so was the faceoff circle, and both moved at about
the same pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I was out there, it's like I would make a bad move,
and it went in our net,'' Chambers admitted. ``We had too many
breakdowns, and it cost us. Every time we did that, they scored.''
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly disturbing that the Stars lost the way they
did because, if Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Joe Nieuwendyk are the
heart of the team, their core of six defensemen _ Hatcher, Craig
Ludwig, Richard Matvichuk, Darryl Sydor, Sergei Zubov and Chambers
_ have been the backbone.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that prides itself on its defense, thrives on
winning the 2-1 and 3-2 games, on taking a one-goal lead and
smothering teams to death. Yesterday, the Stars' defense twice blew
one-goal leads and gallantly fought back from a 5-3 deficit to tie
the score. Then, just two shifts later, they let they the Avalanche
score on yet another odd-man rush with about 6 1/2 minutes left to
take the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our slower people really struggled,'' Hitchcock said.
``It took us out of sync. When your legs are gone, your hands
follow, and you saw some weak puck play and some weak decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their sixth \Rand game-winning\S goal was really disappointing
because we made three mistakes. It was really a two-on-two, then
our defenseman Zubov got run off, then it was really a poor
decision \Rby Chambers, who left Avalanche rookie Chris Drury
uncovered\S at the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche's final goal was a Peter Forsberg chip shot into
an empty net, but by that time, it didn't look all that much
different than the first six.

   ``This one hurts,'' admitted Nieuwendyk, who scored his ninth
goal of the playoffs. ``We are a tight-checking team, and we got
away from that. That's the way \Rthey\S prepare to play. We bit
into it and it cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost them dearly.
</P>
<P>
   They are in a place they never wanted to be this playoff summer,
and they have no one to blame but their Curly, Larry and Moe
selves.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Stars fan, that's not even a bit funny.

ON BASEBALL: BIG BUDGET EARNS BIG BENEFIT FOR DIAMONDBACKS

   NEW YORK _ Buck Showalter wouldn't say it. ``We're going to find
out how good we are,'' said the manager whose team had just
completed a three-game sweep of the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley wouldn't say it. ``We're just going to go out there
and play hard every day and just try to win that game at hand,''
said the outfielder, who collected four hits and drove in five runs
with two home runs in the first three innings of the 10-1 victory
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Johnson was willing to say it. ``It's reassuring to
know this team can contend,'' said the pitcher, who in his first
game against the Mets allowed five hits and struck out 10 in eight
innings. ``It's reassuring to know that we can compete with the
best teams and maybe we're opening some eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, some eyes have opened gapingly wide because the Arizona
Diamondbacks, the two-year-old Diamondbacks, have a
two-and-a-half-game lead in the National League West. If the NL
teams were ranked together, Arizona (30-21) would be tied in second
place with Houston (29-20), both a half-game behind Atlanta
(30-20).
</P>
<P>
   As all of the Diamondbacks, including Johnson, were quick to
point out, the season is only two months old. The marathon has four
more months to run. But Rupert Murdoch's Dodgers, who were
virtually conceded the NL West title before the season began, don't
have a 30-21 record. The Mets, those wild-card wannabes, don't have
a 30-21 record.
</P>
<P>
   But here are the Diamondbacks, the product of Jerry Colangelo's
pocketbook, among the league's elite, creating a lost weekend for
the Mets, who last year won five of nine games with the expansion
team but this season have lost five of six.
</P>
<P>
   If the Los Angeles Dodgers should stop meandering through the
season and take command of the division or if the eventual return
of Barry Bonds injects new life into the San Francisco Giants, the
Diamondbacks could find themselves competing with the Mets for the
wild-card spot. If that should happen, the upstart Diamondbacks
have left the Mets with much to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he saw as the significance of beating the Mets,
Johnson said: ``It's important because the New York Mets have a
very good team, and they're going to be in the wild cards. It's
important to know that we can go and compete with some of the
bigger market teams, the L.A.'s, the New York Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   Note that Johnson, whom the Diamondbacks lured last November
with a four-year, $52.4 million contract, referred to
``bigger-market teams.'' Market size has nothing to do with it.
Revenue and the willingness to spend that revenue are more to the
point. The Diamondbacks have more revenue than most teams and a
greater willingness to spend it than most teams.
</P>
<P>
   That is neither a laudatory nor a critical commentary on
Colangelo's operation of the team. A longtime owner in the National
Basketball Association, Colangelo quickly identified how the
Diamondbacks could compete sooner rather than later and wasted no
time acting on that desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into spring training,'' Johnson, the prized recruit,
said, ``the talk was how good our starting rotation was. The
offense got overshadowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at that offense now. The Diamondbacks are first in the
league in hitting, runs scored, runs driven in, hits, home runs,
total bases and slugging percentage. As if Johnson needed it, they
gave him three runs before he threw his first pitch at Shea
Stadium, then quickly added four more in the next two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be on a team that's competing for first
place,'' the long-haired left-hander said, but quickly added: ``I
don't want to look that far down the road. I don't want to predict
anything. Just go out and continue doing the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he didn't know how good his team was. Asked if
the league should take the Diamondbacks seriously, he said: ``Not
necessarily. I'm as curious as the fans are to find out how good we
are. We're going to find out. I have a lot of trust in the people
we brought in here. I think about it constantly, but I don't want
to spend a lot of time worrying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he at least say that the Diamondbacks are a wild-card
contender? ``No,'' he said. ``We're going to be as good as we can
be. I'm looking forward to finding out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets hadn't been eager to find out first-hand how good
Johnson was. But Melvin Mora didn't mind. But then, Mora was
playing in his first major-league game after having spent
eight-plus seasons in a variety of minor league outposts and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said the shortstop, who hit three fly balls in
three attempts against Johnson. ``A lot of people maybe thought I
wasn't going to touch the ball, but I did. I had three good swings.
I'll get him next time. He's just another pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   And Einstein was merely another scientist.

SLOVAKS CHOOSE PRO-EUROPE DEMOCRAT AS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia _ Rudolf Schuster, the candidate of the
governing four-party coalition and the popular mayor of the eastern
town of Kosice, defeated former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar to
become the first elected president of Slovakia, according to
results announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster, 65, is one of the few former Communists to have made a
successful transition to democratic politics. His victory _ with 57
percent of the vote _ in a runoff election held on Saturday
confirmed that Slovaks have turned their backs on Meciar, whose six
years as prime minister saw his country become ever more isolated
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster's victory indicated that Slovakia will continue the
course of integration with Europe that has been pursued since
Meciar lost parliamentary elections in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider this result a victory of democracy,'' Prime
Minister Mikulas Dzurinda said of Schuster's victory. ``The outcome
of this election confirms Slovakia's pro-European orientation and
sends a very important signal abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia was formed, along with the neighboring Czech Republic,
from the peaceful split of Czechoslovakia on Jan. 1, 1993. The
first president of Slovakia, Michal Kovac, was once an ally of
Meciar but increasingly turned against him. When Kovac's five-year
term expired in March 1998, a deadlock in Parliament left the
legislature unable to agree on a successor.
</P>
<P>
   After the parliamentary elections in September, the Constitution
was changed to allow direct election of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Slovak leaders hope that their country will join the Czechs,
Poles and Hungarians among the group of postcommunist countries
seeking swift entry into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slovakia will continue to make its way to the European
Union,'' Schuster said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was defeated, the election results suggest that
Meciar still remains a powerful player on the Slovak political
scene. His years in power were marked by what many Slovaks regarded
as cronyism and by increasing international isolation, but he is an
ebullient campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even younger Slovaks who said they felt uneasy about
Schuster's Communist past explained that they had voted for him
because they did not want a return to the days of Meciar. Frantisek
Palko, 24, said after voting in Bratislava, the capital, on
Saturday that he had chosen Schuster only because ``it is better
than if Vladimir Meciar won.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuster was a member of the Communist Party from 1964 until
1990, and he served as the last Communist speaker of the Slovak
Parliament after the ``Velvet Revolution'' of 1989 ushered in the
demise of Communist rule, which formally ended when democrats won
free elections in 1990.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ They had no choice but to spend the night
outside a warehouse off the highway in Korisa, Haxhere Palushi said
Sunday. There were 700 Albanian refugees like her, and Serb
soldiers herded them all inside the building's iron outer gates,
promising they would be allowed to leave Kosovo the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, one soldier clicked the gate shut with a
padlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``One young guy said, `Why did they lock us in? Something is
happening,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, just before midnight on May 13, NATO planes
again bombed the village, in southern Kosovo, killing what Serb
officials and survivors say was more than 80 Albanian refugees.
Mrs. Palushi sat in a field all night watching her 4-year-old
daughter, Diana, bleed from shrapnel wounds in her left leg and
then, at dawn, die.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Korisa killed perhaps more Albanian civilians than
any other in the two-month NATO air campaign, which has been
criticized for its fatal mistakes. At the time, Serb authorities,
claiming that the refugees had merely stopped at Korisa for the
night, said the incident showed why NATO should stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But three Albanian survivors _ women interviewed here Sunday for
some of the few eyewitness accounts of the bombing _ said they had
no doubt they were put there intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used us as human shields,'' Mrs. Palushi said. ``It was
all planned.''
</P>
<P>
   While the accounts could not be independently confirmed, they
appeared to give weight to similar allegations by the Pentagon and
NATO that Serb forces have placed civilians near sites, like
bridges or military installations, that could be vulnerable to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no way to tell from these accounts how widely or
systematically such a strategy might be used. Nor are they likely
to quiet critics who say that NATO targeting procedures are not
adequate on a battlefield where civilians are mixed with military
targets.
</P>
<P>
   But these accounts suggest that in Korisa, at least, the
refugees had been calculatingly placed in harm's way, if not to
deter a NATO attack then to create the kind of civilian casualties
that the Serbs hope could erode support for the air campaign. NATO
officials said the planes specifically targeted the building among
other military sites in the town without knowing that civilians
were there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Palushi described the bombing in one of the refugee camps
here, at the door-flap of a tent that now sleeps 19 people, 10 of
whom survived the attack. The survivors arrived in Albania on
Saturday, and many of them still show signs of their wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Palushi's older son, Driton, 10, pulled up his shirt to
show a scar that runs from his navel to his sternum, from an
operation to remove a piece of shrapnel that pierced his back and
wedged near one lung. His cousin, Genci Ahmetaj, 4, still has a
bandage on his right foot covering his own shrapnel wound.
</P>
<P>
   Purple scars mark the face of Genci's mother, Zyrafete, 30, and,
no doubt, there are emotional wounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the attack, Mrs. Ahmetaj said she was sleeping
under the tractor wagon that sheltered her two children, along with
six other children and two adults. Huge explosions erupted. Tents
caught fire. Bits of the tractors blasted through the compound.
Children were shrieking, including hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was happening,'' she said. ``It was like I
was crazy. I saw my mother and I touched her but she was dead. My
father, blood was all over his face.''
</P>
<P>
   She heard the voice of her 10-year-old son, Agon, from inside
the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was screaming, `Look what they did to my legs,''' she
said. ``He started screaming, `Mommy, my legs! Why don't you come
get me?' He was only 10 years old. I could only take the little
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go back and get him,'' she said. ``But the other
people wouldn't let me go back and take my son. The Serbs were
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know I left him,'' she said. ``He was there, and he was
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she heard later that Agon died at 7 a.m., next to an
old man who had found him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying, `Give me some water,''' Mrs. Ahmetaj said.
</P>
<P>
   She wept. ``I am worried that no one could give him water.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others said that Serb forces opened fire on the refugees
as they fled from the burning compound. Those who escaped made
their way to Prizren after the attack, where some received
treatment for wounds. Saturday, they were bused out of Kosovo by
the Serbs, apparently the first batch of survivors from the Korisa
attack to get to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They were among thousands of Albanian refugees fleeing the
burning houses and looting by Serb policemen and paramilitary
soldiers near the city of Prizren. Mrs. Ahmetaj's sister, Sahadete
Ahmetaj, 26, said hundreds of refugees had been living in the hills
near Korisa for two months, waiting to go to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Weary, on May 13, after some in the group approached Serb police
officers, the refugees were promised that they could leave safely
the next day. They took some 700 people to a field for an hour,
then moved them to a warehouse surrounded on three-sides by a
chest-high concrete wall and a fence with an iron door. There they
took everyone's name and birth date, Mrs. Ahmetaj said, saying they
could move on the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But they had to spend that night outside at the courtyard of the
warehouse, she said. The Serb soldiers did not indicate that they
were being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we could only stay in that place,'' Mrs. Ahmetaj
said. ``We were not allowed to go anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The police officers then locked the refugees in and left the
compound, the survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before midnight, four American F-16s dropped what officials
said later was one 500-pound laser-guided bomb and seven other
bombs. The women said that 84 refugees were killed, many of them
burned beyond recognition. A NATO official, who spoke on the
condition anonymity, said that despite reports that all the police
had left, some police guards appeared to be among the dead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group
fighting the Yugoslav army in Kosovo, said Sunday that the general
area around the warehouse was used to store tanks and ammunition,
though they had no information about that particular building. The
survivors said it appeared to be empty. The NATO official said
intelligence reports before the bombing identified it as a command
post, though he said it might have been vacated before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ahmetaj sisters said they did not blame NATO for the attack,
even if it was NATO bombs that killed their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are guilty,'' said Sahadete Ahmetaj. ``NATO didn't
know they attacked us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Palushi, whose daughter was killed, said she did not blame
NATO either, though she said she exploded in anger when she took
her son to a hospital in Prizren and a Serb doctor told her: ``You
wanted NATO to help you. Look what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset, I was very nervous,'' she said. ``I said, `I
didn't want NATO. I don't want you. I don't want the KLA. I only
want peace.'''

THIS TIME, EWING BURIES MILLER AND THE PACERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ For years, Patrick Ewing has seen the waifish
Reggie Miller jackknife around screens, pop free for devastating
shots and then go dancing on the New York Knicks' misery, boldly
spinning and twirling on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is not so light on his feet, not so electric in his
methods. But in his own lumbering way, Ewing slipped into Miller's
role Sunday and gave the Knicks a first push toward reaching their
ultimate goal. Displaying the kind of cool that has been questioned
over the years, Ewing scored six points in the final two minutes of
the game, including four consecutive free throws, to help the
Knicks steal Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals from the
Indiana Pacers, 93-90, before a crestfallen crowd at Market Square
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, his misses have been well chronicled, and his every
make has been often overlooked,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He
was jumping out on Reggie Miller on a sore Achilles' that most
wouldn't play on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing jumped out on Miller with 13 seconds left in the game and
the Knicks ahead on two Ewing free throws, 90-88. Miller came
whip-snapping around a screen, sprang out beyond the three-point
line and saw Allan Houston coming late to his left and Ewing come
charging to his right. Still, there was a sliver of light and a
chance to release the shot. But Miller's 3-point attempt, which
would have given the Pacers a lead, bounded off the right side of
the rim and fell into the arms of Chris Childs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick has seen that play 200 times,'' said Miller, who led
the Pacers with 19 points. ``He knew it was coming. It was a good
hedge on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   With 12.4 seconds left, Childs was fouled and made both free
throws, giving the Knicks a 92-88 lead. It wasn't over, though.
Antonio Davis came up with an uncontested dunk, and then the Pacers
quickly fouled Childs. This time, he hit just one of two free
throws with 6.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   One more moment for Miller to be a hero. But Miller could not
shake free of Houston, and Mark Jackson was left to throw up a
desperate shot that came up short. Ewing caught the miss and hugged
it until the buzzer sounded. What began as a dreadful day for Ewing
_ he was 4-for-13 with 16 points _ ended with him in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Patrick has done, with how hurt he is, it's amazing,''
Houston said. ``You see him wincing in pain, but he still goes out
there and plays.''
</P>
<P>
   After a game dominated by the Knicks' running game, the end
boiled down to a slower-paced finish between two centers who hadn't
been so involved.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was the Pacers' Rik Smits. The Knicks had a 70-63 lead
to start the fourth quarter. After a miserable stretch by Marcus
Camby, which included two fouls and a three-second violation, the
Pacers pulled to 72-69 on a driving layup by Jalen Rose. Camby came
right back and bulled inside of Sam Perkins to get to the
free-throw line and hit two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers went to Smits, who had missed seven of his first
eight shots. Playing with five fouls, Smits delivered six points in
a two-minute stretch to give the Pacers an 87-82 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing came back with a finger roll. After Smits fouled out with
1 minute 33 seconds left, the Knicks put the ball in Ewing's hands.
He spun through the lane on two consecutive possessions and drew a
foul on both. He came up with four straight free throws to give the
Knicks a 90-88 lead with 29.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was a game of spurts,'' Ewing said. ``We came up and
they came back. We kept our poise and made the plays down the
stretch. A lot of people have doubted us. But we just keep on doing
what we have to do to stay alive. We stepped up our game. Reggie
has killed us so many times, I can't remember. So we started
trapping him. If someone was going to beat us, it was going to be
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Knicks tested the wheels on their transition game
as quickly as possible, which meant the instant Latrell Sprewell
stepped onto the court. When the Knicks were at their best, they
were taking almost every Pacer miss and turning it into an easy
basket. That style helped them battle back each time the Pacers
looked on the brink of taking over the momentum of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' transition game left them with a 44-40 halftime lead
and helped them come back from a three-point deficit in the third
quarter to grab a 70-63 edge entering into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's aggressiveness was contagious. Larry Johnson and
Houston were all caught up in what he brought onto the floor.
Thirty seconds after he entered the game with 4:47 left in the
first quarter, Sprewell picked off a pass by Jackson and took it
all the way for a fast-break layin to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was on fire whether he was getting out on the break or
penetrating and kicking the ball out to Houston for a
three-pointer. Sprewell, guiding a 12-1 run, led the Knicks to a
nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers slowed down the pace. Suddenly, in the half-court
game, Rose was irritating Sprewell and making him miss. Slowly, the
Pacers chipped away to hold the Knicks without a field goal for
nearly six minutes beginning in the final minute of the first
quarter. Meanwhile, the Pacers' second unit became the aggressors.
Antonio Davis got to the line in between runners by Rose over
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers grabbed back the lead, 26-25, with 7:50 left in the
half. The Knicks came right back, though, using their veterans.
Johnson filled the lane on one fast break and popped outside for a
three-pointer on another.
</P>
<P>
   Although Miller was definitely working his way around Houston,
who seemed caught up on too many screens, and Jackson was effective
in posting up Ward, the Knicks were able to counter with 18
fast-break points to the Pacers' five in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers opened up the third quarter using a variety pack
including a basket by Smits, a dunk by Dale Davis and a
three-pointer by Chris Mullin in transition to go on a 13-6 run and
take a 53-50 lead. With an aggressive Kurt Thomas, who flailed at
Smits at the end of one possession, grabbing key rebounds, the
Knicks came back and took the lead 59-57 on a face-up jumper from
Houston over Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell took over. He came up with two runners on the break and
ended the third quarter with a runner that drew a foul on Rose with
four-tenths of a second left to give the Knicks a 70-63 lead after
the third. After the Knicks gave that lead away and trailed by five
points, Ewing came out of nowhere to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it bad,'' Ewing said. ``And when you want it bad,
you step up and try to do the best you can.''

ON PRO BASKETBALL: A NEW KNICKS' TEAM RELIES ON VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In the week leading up to the Eastern Conference
finals, Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson tried to impress upon their
teammates how different the Knicks were from the team they had
faced on the last Sunday of the regular season; how these Knicks
were different from any Knicks team they had ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting the rout at Market Square Arena on May 2, the two
veterans prodded the Indiana Pacers into tossing aside whatever
preconceived notions they had about Patrick Ewing's decrepit
half-court style and told them to focus on the fuel-injected
vehicle the Knicks had become over the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Latrell Sprewell,'' Miller said of the Knicks'
sixth man. ``He's getting out there and running the break now,
getting points in transition. Their running game is starting to
click through him, and we have to be aware of that. And Marcus
Camby is a great athlete with all kinds of wingspan. The guys
coming off their bench present major problems for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. The Pacers worried about the new guys and
forgot about the old Knicks, the catch-and-shoot veterans who
calmly moved the ball around the perimeter in the final minutes:
Ewing, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   For in the crucible of Game 1 Sunday, when every possession in
the fourth quarter meant so much and Sprewell's shot selection left
a lot to be desired, Ewing led the Knicks back from a 5-point
deficit in the final 2 minutes 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won, 93-90, because Ewing rebounded, Houston and
Johnson hit several big shots to keep Indiana at bay, and the
Knicks made almost all their free throws. For one game, the style
of Sprewell and Camby gave in to the substance of Ewing and the
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   What symmetry. Ewing's 36-year-old, battered body sat in a
cramped, 30-year-old locker room Sunday, going through the usual
post-game routine of soaking his left leg in a bucket of ice water.
A member of the news media mentioned to Ewing that he was going to
have to stop writing about how Ewing always misses half his free
throws; Ewing had made eight in a row, including four in the final
30.6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff was always messing with me about that,'' Ewing said of
Coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``This year, I've been hitting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell finished 6 of 16 from the field, and Camby got into
early foul trouble and was hardly a factor. In a chess match to be
played out over the next two weeks, Jalen Rose left the bench first
after Miller got into foul trouble early. Van Gundy countered with
Sprewell a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   Each suffered through a 3-for-9 first half, though Sprewell
finally found a rhythm in the third quarter. But he was all over
the map, taking ill-advised long jumpers and unable to successfully
back Rose into the post so he could get a decent shot within 12
feet of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He provided the slashing athleticism to keep the defense honest,
his wild forays sometimes leaving his teammates open on the
perimeter. Two possessions in the final quarter, though, reflected
his day.
</P>
<P>
   He flew by Mark Jackson along the left baseline and scored on a
layup to keep the Knicks in front by 4 points. But on the next
possession, with less than six minutes left and the Knicks still
clinging to a two-point lead, Sprewell forced a 19-footer that
nearly went 21 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He then threw up an airball after a no-call against Derrick
McKey, who grazed Sprewell's elbow enough to change the shot.
</P>
<P>
   This series was supposed to come down to both teams' benches, a
duel featuring Sprewell and Camby vs. Rose and Antonio Davis.
Travis Best and Derrick McKey were supposed to play huge roles for
Indiana, and Chris Dudley and Childs were said to be key for the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   And while those players figured in the outcome, you simply
cannot get away from the fact that some people playing now have
been there before, have taken the crucial shots, and they
understand how to get position under the basket when an important
rebound is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Limping and sore, Ewing is still one of those players.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks were going to pull out Game 1, they would have to
resort to the old guard. Ewing is supposed to recede into the
background and let his teammates win a championship ring for him,
but you sometimes forget how much respect he gets from the
officials in the waning moments of a close game.
</P>
<P>
   Few players can get those calls like Ewing, not that he did not
deserve the calls on the fouls committed against him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets unwarranted criticism in New York,'' Miller said
afterward, impressed that Ewing had played injured. ``He's been the
backbone of the team for so many years. He's always proving the
news media and the fans in New York wrong when it should be the
other way around. He's been there so much for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's definitely a different New York team, a lot
more running and athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks reverted back to their old-school ways Sunday,
getting the defensive stops they needed and making every possession
count. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, proud and hobbled as ever, was there at the end to decide
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any other body part could hurt him at this
point,'' Van Gundy said. ``There's nothing left.''

AN INSINUATION REVISITED IN N.Y. POLICE-BRUTALITY TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the trial in the Abner Louima case opened a
month ago, the lawyer for Officer Justin Volpe suggested that
Louima had suffered severe internal injuries not because of torture
by his client but in a consensual sex act with another man.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive insinuation in an already explosive case was
assailed in front of the courthouse by leaders of groups
representing homosexuals, and it stirred an uproar generally. But
the lawyers for the three other police officers and for the
sergeant also on trial said nothing publicly about the opening
argument by Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg.
</P>
<P>
   That was not surprising: it would have been highly unusual for a
lawyer to publicly undercut the case that a co-defendant's lawyer
was presenting. But when Volpe pleaded guilty in midtrial last
week, a lawyer for one of the four remaining defendants no longer
felt the need for restraint regarding Kornberg's suggestion that
rough sex _ rather than Volpe's ramming a stick into Louima's
rectum _ had torn the victim's rectum and bladder.
</P>
<P>
   John Patten, the lawyer for Sgt. Michael Bellomo, one of the men
on trial, on Wednesday offered a critical assessment of Kornberg's
actions. This was the day after Volpe pleaded guilty to torturing
Louima with the stick in a restroom in the 70th Precinct station
house in Brooklyn and to other charges in the case. While the jury
was not in the courtroom, Patten asked Judge Eugene Nickerson in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn to declare a mistrial for Bellomo
because of Volpe's guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   Patten first made the expected argument: Volpe's plea hurt his
client's chances of getting a fair trial, because his admission of
guilt could lead the jurors to believe that the other defendants
must also be guilty. But Patten's second argument was not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an attorney stand before this jury for three
weeks,'' he said, ``opening by saying it was consensual sex and
homosexual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson interrupted: ``I don't remember him ever saying that.
He implied it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten agreed, but made clear that he considered this a
distinction without a difference. Kornberg's actions, he went on,
had ``established a certain loss of trust'' between ``that jury and
all of the counsel at this table.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``You can't look people in the eye for three weeks
and tell them one thing and then completely reverse yourself and
then tell them something else without those people coming to some
type of conclusion that we've lied to them. I submit the lack of
trust that could be established by that has overflowed to all
counsel.'' The judge denied the motion for mistrial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because Volpe was out of the case and in jail, Kornberg was not
in the courtroom when Patten spoke. Asked later for comment,
Kornberg, who is known for relishing verbal warfare, was restrained
this time, saying: ``Each lawyer has to do what they feel is best
to protect their client's interests. I'm not surprised the judge
dismissed that motion.''
</P>
<P>
   The four defendants still on trial are Bellomo and Officers
Thomas Wiese, Thomas Bruder and Charles Schwarz. The three officers
are charged with joining Volpe in beating Louima in a police car
between his arrest in a street melee and his torture by Volpe in a
restroom at the station house on Aug. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn,
said the officers erroneously believed Louima had punched Volpe
during the melee. They said that Schwarz also held Louima down in
the restroom while Volpe used the stick, and accused Bellomo of
trying to cover up the beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   With Volpe and his lawyers, Kornberg and Edwin Schulman, no
longer at the defense table, the remaining four defendants and
their seven lawyers could take advantage of the newly created space
to spread out a bit. Instead, they remain as crowded together as
they have been since the start of the trial, and the three chairs
that Volpe and his lawyers occupied have stayed in place, empty.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how things will remain, two of the defense lawyers
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be as disconnected from Volpe as possible,'' said
Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, suggested that the empty chairs
would be a perfect prop during the closing arguments, expected this
week, when the lawyers for the remaining defendants argue that the
only guilty person in the case is no longer in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, as the prosecution has vilified them, the
defendants have sat without expression. But last week, there was a
crack in one officer's facade.
</P>
<P>
   The brother of Wiese's fiancee was testifying as a character
witness for him. ``Tommy is a prince among men,'' the witness,
Kevin Reid, said of the officer. ``I love the guy like a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiese removed his eyeglasses. He raised his hand to his eyes and
appeared to be wiping away tears with his fingers.

 &HT;    Short woman gets a kick out of driving tall cars
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BY Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Please do not refer to my condition as
vertically challenged or under-tall. Although it's not politically
correct, it is the ugly truth - I'm SHORT! Eleven-year-olds are
taller than I am, and my son, for yuks and giggles, likes to rest
his arm on top of my head and crack wise about his ``cute little
mama.'' Even tall strangers say dumb stuff like: Seen any good
parades lately?
</P>
<P>
   In these days of super-tall kids (it's all of those vitamins we
poke in their chubby faces), short folks need to take advantage of
every opportunity to gainthe advantage, and I've figured out a way
to hold my own in the transportation department.
</P>
<P>
   I buy tall cars.
</P>
<P>
   For a while last year after a soft drink truck chewed up my '87
Bronco, I thought I might like to have a go at something even
taller - like maybe one of those semi trucks that bounces me around
on the Interstate. I've always thought I'd get a kick out of
driving one of those things, and now that they come with waterbeds
and patios, it's even more tempting.
</P>
<P>
   As I see it, there's only one drawback to my truck driving
career. Backing upcould be a problem, so I've decided not to do
that. Think about it - if I have 12 gears going forward then who
needs to back up? I'll be having all the fun I can have without
reverse as long as I can find nose-in parking places.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Christmas my parents gave me a shiny new maroon
convertible (I was four and the car had push-pedals), I've been
fascinated with things that go Vroom! And over the years I've
learned a lot more about cars than juststeering and paying parking
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I knew I did not like my parents' 1954 Buick. No
gears to shift. Remember the old Dynaflow transmissions? No
noticeable change of gears. No lurch, No clunk. You just put your
foot in it and waited for inertia to be overcome. I remember
listening to the transmission wind up tighter and tighterand
wondering when the old Roadmaster's vitals were going to come
flying out from under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later I fell in love with an Austin-Healey, a
wicked-looking British sports car. It was sleek, fast, and best of
all, had lots of gears to
</P>
<P>
   shift - as long as the synchromesh was working - which it often
didn't. Once Ispent a lifetime in a Marshall Field's parking lot
waiting for my ``funny car'' mechanic to come and kick something to
make it go.
</P>
<P>
   Just before I drove my first Healey out of the showroom, I
remember asking the dealer what that big hammer in the trunk was
for. He explained it was a resin mallet and was for tightening the
spinners that held the wheels onto the hub. As it turned out, I
never had to pull a wheel but I did use the big hammer - often.
</P>
<P>
   One snowy afternoon in the same parking lot, the Healey wouldn't
start so I went back into the store and called the mechanic. Our
conversation went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Me: It won't go.
</P>
<P>
   Him: What's it doing?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Him: Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this was all the information he needed to walk me
though some highly technical repairs. He told me to open the boot
(trunk), and pound on the accumulator (battery) cable connection
with the mallet. I asked what the battery was doing in the trunk
and he came up with the obvious reply: ``Apparently nothing right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   So there I was in a blizzard, leaning into the ``boot'' and
beating the bejeebers out of my ``accumulator'' when a nice
gentleman offered to help. I
</P>
<P>
   told him all would be fine as soon as I finished thrashing my
battery. He told me I was in the wrong end of the car. I thanked
him and kept pounding.
</P>
<P>
   Before long I gave up sporty cars - not for mechanical reasons
but because I was embarrassing myself. The only way I could get the
clutch to the
</P>
<P>
   firewall to change gears was to slide under the steering wheel
and then I couldn't see
</P>
<P>
   where I was going.
</P>
<P>
   So now I buy tall cars. Today an SUV - tomorrow a big Mack.

 &HT;    'Tacky' is as 'tacky' does
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Sometimes my clothes don't match. It doesn't
bother me a whole lot, but whenever I suspect I've slipped from
sartorial splendor to ludicrous, a little voice from the past
begins to nag: ``Tacky!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tacky'' is a pejorative southern word noted for its
flexibility of meaning. ``Tacky'' can describe anything from the
paint on the front porch floor to your son's new girlfriend's
tattoo. And no matter how it's used, it's always a ladylike thing
to say.
</P>
<P>
   For example: When I was six I wanted a pair of red sandals. Mama
said red shoes were ``tacky'' and only streetwalkers wore them. I
didn't know what one of those was but I figured it was pretty bad
for Mama to get so bent out of shape about it. No red shoes.
</P>
<P>
   One sleepy Sunday afternoon while I was still in my streetwalker
phase, I was playing store in Mama's shoe closet. On a rack in a
far back corner, I discovered a pair of silver and white satin,
high-heeled shoes that I thought were the most beautiful things I
had ever seen. They looked like Cinderella's own to me, and the
temptation to slip into them and wheel myself around the
neighborhood on my old Roadmaster was overwhelming. Mama caught me
mid-spin and hauled my silly looking self inside for a talk,
insisting I'd made a spectacle
</P>
<P>
   of myself and that it was not appropriate for little girls in
navy blue romper suits and satin high heels to pedal themselves
around the neighborhood. ``Tacky,'' she said. ``Really tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I learned that ``tacky'' in Mama's dialect
covered a broad range of social infractions. Pulling up my dress
and using my petticoat for a handkerchief was seriously tacky, as
was crawling around under the pews inchurch.
</P>
<P>
   When I was nine, I played piano in our elementary school's
orchestra. I loved making music with a bunch of other kids and
found it particularly gratifying when we came out even - you know,
where no one was left playing after the others had finished.
Performing in public was not a problem, unless my mother was in the
audience - which she usually was. ``Psst!?'' I'd hear in a raucous
stage whisper from the first row. ``Sit up straight! Knees
together!? Occasionally, as an abbreviated reminder of my
backsliding ways she'd hiss
</P>
<P>
   that one little word every southern girl dreads: ``Tacky!''
</P>
<P>
   Mama's been gone a long while now, but every time I read the
paper or listen to the news, I can almost hear her comment.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones has stopped hanging out in Arkansas hotels, and
during a hiatus between courtrooms has lent her name to a psychic
hot line. ``Paula Jones...Celebrity Psychic Network...Accurate
answers from caring psychic advisors, for life's tough questions,
$3.99 a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Get outta' here.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Buttafuoco (the 38-year-old owner of an auto body shop who
served six months for statutory rape after his 17-year-old
girlfriend shot his wife) is alive and doing well in Los Angeles
where Mrs. Buttafuoco still loves him in spite of the bullet lodged
in her head and he is hosting his own cable talk show and pursuing
an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Scuzzy living has its own rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Monica goes on Saturday Night Live and for $600 before taxes,
makes jokes about her slatternly romp through the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Class act, dearie.
</P>
<P>
   And let us not overlook Larry Flynt, pornographer extraordinaire
and congressional blackmailer, who recently delivered a lecture in
the hallowed halls of Washington's Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you what folks, if my mama were still here, I could
guarantee she'd be sitting right out there in the front row
harrumphing and muttering, ``Tacky!''

JERKENS THE GIANT-KILLER IS FOCUSING ON THE BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ He is a tall, husky, 70-year-old man who
frequently wears a broad-brimmed white hat and a serious look, and
he always rates a respectful salute when he drives through the
stable gate at Belmont Park before dawn. But for a horse trainer
who saddled his first winner nearly 50 years ago and who is known
in New York as ``the Chief'' because of his intensity and success,
Allen Jerkens has a remarkably thin record in Triple Crown racing.
</P>
<P>
   He is 0-for-3 in the Kentucky Derby, he has never run a horse in
the Preakness and he is 0-for-2 in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Jerkens will run a horse in the 131st Belmont
who did not run in either the Derby or the Preakness, and he will
be approached with wariness and even fear by the trainers of
Charismatic, who needs to win the Belmont to sweep the Triple
Crown, and Silverbulletday, the filly who has won eight races in a
row. To them, Jerkens has long since earned his nickname, the Giant
Killer of racing.
</P>
<P>
   The horse is Best of Luck, the 3-year-old son of Broad Brush
owned by Mrs. Allaire duPont. Best of Luck won the Peter Pan Stakes
a week ago as a stepping stone to the Belmont, and in a sense, he
will be New York's defender against the stars from California.
</P>
<P>
   So, is Best of Luck the horse picked by the Giant Killer to
upset the giants of the Triple Crown series? Is he targeted to play
that role for Jerkens the way Onion and Prove Out did when they
upset Secretariat, the way Handsome Boy did when he upset
Buckpasser, the way Beau Purple did when he upset Kelso three
times?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to finish in the money,'' Jerkens said,
sounding like the voice of reason last week at Barn 30 at Belmont
Park. ``You hate to try running in the Triple Crown unless you have
one of the five top choices. If you don't, it doesn't bug you. You
think about it, but you don't want it to interfere with your other
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best of Luck has some sort of chance. It'll be nice if it
happens. You try hard, but you don't shoot yourself if it doesn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like soft soap, and so does Jerkens' indifference to
that Giant Killer stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say Giant Killer about Billy Mott,'' he said.
``Everybody has his moments.''
</P>
<P>
   But didn't Jerkens target Secretariat _ already a Triple Crown
winner _ in 1973 before the Whitney at Saratoga, which was won by
Onion, and before the Woodward at Belmont, which was won by Prove
Out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Jerkens said. ``I thought Secretariat didn't
work well at Saratoga, and my horse did. That's the only way an
inferior horse can beat a superior one. The other time, in the
Woodward, the track was muddy. They probably would have scratched
Secretariat if he wasn't such a star and everything depended on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerkens reflected and came up with several of the tactical edges
that can make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't particularly scout Secretariat,'' he said. ``Horses
like that, when they run a race, the fields are usually very small.
And as great as he was, he wasn't that great in the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   He came up with a few more nuggets from the past. ``We got 16
pounds against Buckpasser,'' he said. ``Against Kelso, we also got
16, although later we beat him at even weights. My horse just went
to the front on the turf, and Kelso didn't like the turf.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is an oddity in the Jerkens record of success: He is
respected as one of the best trainers in the business, yet he seems
to shun the Triple Crown, the highlight series of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has his own aims,'' he said. ``I don't think I'm
changing with age, either. Nutrition, fitness, the things that
count for a horse. You do your best.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1978, Sensitive Prince ran in the Derby, but he was a
front-runner and he didn't break well, and he finished sixth behind
Affirmed and Alydar. In 1992, Devil His Due ran 12th in the Derby.
In the Belmont in 1993, we ran Virginia Rapids, but he was bothered
by a horse who broke down and finished fifth. Last year, Limit Out
ran in the Belmont, but the saddle slipped. I don't know that he
wanted to go a mile and a half anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of Luck will probably get strong support from the racing
public this week because he has a late-running style suited to the
Belmont Stakes and because he is trained by a hometown legend. In
all of his 11 races, Best of Luck has made a closing rush from deep
in the pack under his jockey, Jean-Luc Samyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the Peter Pan, he was ninth after the start and fifth turning
for home, and he scored by one length over Treasure Island. Best of
Luck has won three times and run in the money nine times, and he is
considered fresh and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great if you can win,'' Jerkens said. ``Winning a Grade I
stakes is worth so much in value to the horse. If a horse wins the
Belmont, it would double his value.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if he outruns Silverbulletday, the fast filly, and
Charismatic, the colt standing on the threshold of sweeping the
Triple Crown.

NAME OF FATHER JOINS SON'S ON VIETNAM MEMORIAL ROLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For 34 years, the father and son have lain together in
the same plot in a Braintree cemetery, as close in death as they
were in life, both casualties of the same war.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as the nation honors its war dead, the father will
officially join the son on that black granite pantheon of fallen
soldiers, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three years after Technical Sergeant Richard B. Fitzgibbon
Jr. was shot to death in Saigon by a fellow Air Force crew member,
his name has finally been sandblasted into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   His family had pleaded with federal officials for years that he
be recognized as a casualty of the war, along with his son, Lance
Corporal Richard B. Fitzgibbon III, who was killed in action in
Vietnam on Sept. 7, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The Fitzgibbons are the only known father-son honorees on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as Taps is sounded in the nation's capital, about 40
members of the Fitzgibbon family, representing several generations,
will gather at the wall amid bittersweet feelings of sadness and
pride.
</P>
<P>
   Family members are coming from as far away as Florida and
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all thrilled about this,'' said Alice DelRossi of
Stoneham, the sister and aunt of the dead soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   It was DelRossi who 15 years ago started seeking help from
politicians and ``every other place I could think of'' to have her
brother recognized on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Fitzgibbon's widow, Eunice, who lives in Connecticut,
will make the trip for Monday's unveiling. Her son, 23 and
unmarried, died in Vietnam nine years after his father died in
1956.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of the elder Fitzgibbon's name on the wall, along
with the names of 58,219 Americans who were killed or missing in
action in Vietnam, was ultimately achieved through the efforts of
Representative Edward J. Markey.
</P>
<P>
   The Malden congressman persuaded the Department of Defense to
move the date for qualification to be on the memorial from Jan. 1,
1961, to Nov. 1, 1955, when American soldiers first arrived in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   That change made the elder Fitzgibbon the nation's first Vietnam
War casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have come out and acknowledged that we were there (in
Vietnam) when the French lowered their flag in April 1955, and we
immediately raised ours,'' DelRossi said. ``Congressman Markey got
a picture from the French embassy showing that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Fitzgibbon was the son of a Malden mail carrier, and
many members of the family live in the 7th District, which Markey
represents. During World War II, Fitzgibbon saw Navy combat on sea
plane tenders in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   DelRossi said the campaign was painful at times for family
members, but she kept on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told my sister-in-law, Eunice, that I was doing
this,'' DelRossi said the other day, ``because I didn't want to
stir up memories and upset her. Sometimes, things seemed so
hopeless, I'd have to sit down and cry.''
</P>
<P>
   But, then, she said, a writer on the South Shore asked her if he
could write about her failed attempts and he did, in a story
titled, ``No Room on the Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   DelRossi said her son, a Vietnam veteran also named Richard,
printed thousands of copies of the story. Every Memorial Day
weekend for 10 years, Richard DelRossi, a Stoneham police officer
who is now 48, drove to Washington and handed them out at the wall
to tourists and mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of the letdowns, Alice DelRossi said the family
decided to go ahead with its quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a lot of hell in the family,'' she said. ``We
had lost a lot. I couldn't believe it when Congressman Markey's
office began calling us every few weeks and telling us it was going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had done that before and I was worried about giving
Eunice and her family hope. In fairness to the politicians, these
Vietnam veterans had been treated shabbily in so many quarters.
There were no parades, no yellow ribbons, and our government never
stood forward and told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is left for the Fitzgibbon family to wonder what might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, the father, was 35 when he was slain by an unstable
fellow crew man, Sergeant Edward C. Clarke, who also wounded
another soldier before falling from a balcony to his death.
</P>
<P>
   On her own, Eunice Fitzgibbon raised four children, two sons and
two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   When Eunice's son Richard told her he wanted to go to Vietnam,
DelRossi recalled, ``His mother begged him not to. But, I think, in
his heart, he wanted to see the building his buddies had named for
his dad, and hoped he might be able to talk to some of his father's
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Eunice's surviving son, Robert, of Park Lane, Fla., was 5 years
old when his father died.
</P>
<P>
   Robert observed his 49th birthday on May 5, the day his father's
name was etched on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was the best present he could get,'' DelRossi said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the elder Fitzgibbon was kind and generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his death, a member of his company wrote his wife that
when the men went to Hong Kong for a break, Dick always used to
come back with the same package,'' she said. ``Back in Saigon, they
found out what it was when they saw him giving out candy and gum to
little street urchins.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the close-knit family gathered at a luncheon in
Virginia hosted by Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, who praised the Fitzgibbons for their
patriotic service.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after their long goodbye, they hope to find the peace of
mind that has eluded them for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll believe it when I put my hand on my brother's name,''
Alice DelRossi said. ``Now, I know what they mean by closure. This
is really a beautiful day.''

 &HT;    LET'S DRIVE TWO: It's long day at the tracks for Tony Stewart as
he does double duty as a driver
 &HT;    EDs: A write thru will move around midnight EDT
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indianapolis and Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   When Larry Curry, who co-owns Tony Stewart's Indy Racing League
team, left an Indianapolis restaurant about 11:30 p.m. Saturday, he
had a voice message from Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called him back, he said, `What are you doing up this
late?''' Curry said. ``I looked at the phone and said, `What are
you doing? I don't have to drive 1,100 miles Sunday.'''
</P>
<P>
   By 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Stewart already had logged 196 laps and 490
miles, and he still faced the prospect of doing it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the 1997 Indy Racing League champion, finished ninth in
the Indianapolis 500, four laps behind winner Kenny Brack, who took
the victory after leader Robby Gordon ran out of fuel with one lap
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 28, of Columbus, Ind., finished ninth in the first half
of his attempt at an unprecedented doubleheader. Stewart was trying
to become the first driver to complete all 1,100 miles in the Indy
500 and the Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in
Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Current Winston Cup driver John Andretti tried the feat in 1994.
He finished 10th in the Indy 500, then crashed in the NASCAR race
before the finish. Robby Gordon was to try it in 1997, but the Indy
500 was postponed two days because of inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   After crossing the finish line in Indianapolis on Sunday,
Stewart boarded an airplane and flew to Concord, where he ran in
Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, I'm not as disappointed as I thought I would
be,'' Stewart said of his finish in the Indy 500. ``The guys worked
really hard and built me a great car.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a former sprint-car and midget champion, is a Winston
Cup rookie driver for Joe Gibbs Racing. In his first year in the
No. 20 Pontiac, Stewart was seventh in points, 304 behind leader
Dale Jarrett, entering Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who spent two years driving in the open-wheel series
before jumping to NASCAR's Busch Grand National division last year,
formed his own IRL team this year to run in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   During the month of May, Stewart faced a daunting schedule. He
made 14 trips between Charlotte and Indianapolis, logging 5,208
miles. His logistical nightmare Sunday included three airplanes,
two helicopters, eight golf carts, four cars and one Navigator
transporter to move Stewart and his support team of 51 people
between the two tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't bothered me because we understood from day 1 that
the main priority was Winston Cup,'' Curry said. ``It was a
challenge, but I think we made the most of his time (in
Indianapolis).''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a closer look at Stewart's long day behind the wheel,
which started around 9:30 a.m. and wasn't expected to end until
close to midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1:01 a.m. _ Gates open at Indianapolis Motor Speedway for crew
members and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   5:15 a.m. _ Stewart's crew members arrive at IMS to install
tethering system to left rear tire. The Indy Racing League
announced this week that the safety device, two small cables
attached to the butterfly suspension of the wheels, would be
required.
</P>
<P>
   6:15 a.m. _ Curry, co-owner of Tristar Motorsports and Stewart's
crew chief, arrives at IMS.
</P>
<P>
   8:45 a.m. _ Stewart's No. 22 Dallara/Aurora Indy car leaves
garage No. 15 for pre-race inspection.
</P>
<P>
   8:49 a.m. _ Mechanic Bill Harmon steers Stewart's car onto
Gasoline Alley for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   8:53 a.m. _ Stewart's car is seventh in line for pre-race
inspection. Stewart's orange car is dominated by stickers of its
primary sponsor, Home Depot. Among the familiar sponsors, though,
is one very unfamiliar name: Lee Kissick, CPA. Kissick is Curry's
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   9:03 a.m. _ Car rolls into inspection. Forteen inspectors
measure the car's height, width from tire to tire and weight. Six
of Stewart's crew members watch intensely as the car is closely
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   9:10 a.m. _ Car passes inspection and is pulled to pit road by a
riding lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   9:15 a.m. _ Car stops at pit stall No. 26, between the cars of
Steve Knapp and Roberto Moreno. Stewart's car is nine stalls to the
left of the start/finish line. ``I think we've got a good shot at
winning it,'' said Case Leeuwenberg, of Wilmington, N.C., one of
Stewart's seven mechanics. I really do. We've got a good car. He's
got to be patient, but you can't be to cautious because you'll get
lapped here.''
</P>
<P>
   9:30 a.m. _ Stewart wakes up in his motorhome parked in the
infield of IMS. He doesn't eat breakfast, but later has cereal and
fruit in garage area. ``We call it `Tony time,''' Curry said.
``He'll show up 10 minutes before the race and climb in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   9:49 p.m. _ Stewart's crew practices pit stops on pit road. The
first pit stop is its best at 7.56 seconds, but the drill gun on
the right-rear tire sticks. The second stop is 8.6 seconds, and the
third is 7.69.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m. _ Every car is given a six-minute engine warm-up on pit
road, and then the cars are refueled.
</P>
<P>
   10:17 a.m. _ Stewart is examined by Dr. Henry Bock, director of
medical affairs for the speedway and IRL. Stewart's blood pressure,
heart rate and weight are taken. He weighs in at 155 pounds. ``He's
in good spirits,'' said Krista Dwyer, Stewart's fiance. ``We got up
a little earlier than we normally do, but we didn't really do
anything different.'' Stewart is engaged to be married May 6 in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   10:24 a.m. _ Stewart arrives at his garage, wearing blue jeans
and a Home Depot shirt. He meets with Curry and other team members.
</P>
<P>
   11:25 a.m. _ Stewart makes way to pit road for driver
introductions.
</P>
<P>
   11:45 a.m. _ According to Firestone Tire engineers, air
temperature is 85 degrees, but temperature on track is 111 degrees.
``My job is just driving the race car,'' Stewart said. ``We don't
have to worry about the one variable we couldn't do anything about
today, and that was the weather. It's great in Indy, and it's
supposed to be great in Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   11:51 a.m. _ Indianapolis Motor Speedway chairman Mari Hulman
George gives ``Gentleman, start your engines'' command. All 33 cars
on grid are fired and running immediately after command.
</P>
<P>
   11:52 a.m. _ Cars roll from grid for first parade lap.
</P>
<P>
   12:01 p.m. _ Green flag falls and pole-sitter Arie Luyendyk
takes lead in turn one. For fifth consecutive year, field came to
the line for the start without a full stable of cars as Jack
Miller's No. 17 car and Scott Sharp's No. 2 car failed to take the
green because of mechanical problems. Stewart starts on the outside
of the eighth row, 24th overall.
</P>
<P>
   12:07 p.m. _ First caution of the race comes after Eliseo
Salazar crashes in turn two of the ninth lap. Stewart climbed four
spots to 20th in the first eight laps, trailing leader Luyendyk by
18.288 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   12:26 p.m. _ Stewart passes Roberto Guerrero, Steve Knapp, Buddy
Lazier and Robbie Buhl to move into 17th, about 14 seconds behind
Luyendyk.
</P>
<P>
   12:33 p.m. _ Leaders begin to take first green-flag pit stops on
lap 31. Kenny Brack takes four tires and fuel on lap 31, and Billy
Boat, Luyendyk, Gordon and Greg Ray follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   12:35 p.m. _ Stewart gets his first big break of the race when
he remains on the track while most of the leaders makes pit stops.
The move pays off, as Hideshi Matsuda apparently runs out of gas
and stalls in the short chute between turns 3 and 4 on lap 35. On
lap 37 under caution, Stewart's crew changes four tires and refuels
in 16 seconds. The crew also makes a slight adjustment to the
chassis. Stewart climbs from 17th to fifth after the restart on lap
39.
</P>
<P>
   12:46 p.m. _ Ray takes lead from Luyendyk on lap 45. Stewart is
fifth behind Ray, Luyendyk, Sam Schmidt and Brack. Stewart moves to
fourth when Schmidt crashes 17 laps later.
</P>
<P>
   1:03 p.m. _ Stewart makes second pit stop on lap 64. He get four
new tires and fuel, and the crew changes the height of the ``wicker
bill,'' attempting to get more downforce. The longer pit stop costs
Stewart two track positions and he falls to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   1:31 p.m. _ Stewart makes third pit stop on lap 95. The crew
again changes the ``wicker bill'' and tire pressure because
Stewart's complaining that the car is ``too tight.'' Stewart comes
out of the pit stops in 10th place. But his car is later damaged by
a mistake in the pits. While working on the Dallara Oldsmobile
Aurora, the crew released the jack
</P>
<P>
   too soon and slightly damaged the car. ``After that, you're in a
survival mode,'' Curry said. ``You just want to get the car home.
I'm disappointed in the fact we made that mistake. We would have
been the fourth or fifth or sixth car.''
</P>
<P>
   3:17 p.m. _After crossing the finish line at Indy, Stewart
sprints to his hauler, changed into a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
He then returned to his garage to say goodbye to his crew. From
there, Stewart was whisked away in a golf cart to a helicopter,
waiting on the infield near the third turn for a three-minute ride
to the Indianapolis Airport.
</P>
<P>
   3:25 p.m. _ Stewart arrives at the airport, where Home Depot,
his sponsor, has its Falcon VIP jet waiting for the 50-minute
flight to Concord. Aboard the plane, Stewart changed into his
NASCAR racing suit, ate a Power Bar and sipped Powerade and water.
He complained of a blister on his right hand from the steering
wheel and another blister on his right knee from the steering
column. And he even admitted he was a bit tired. ``That's to be
expected after a 500-mile race,'' Stewart said. ``I'm really
excited, though. I thought I'd feel a lot more fatigued. I think
after an hour's sleep, I'll be fine.'' With that, Stewart caught a
short nap in the back of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   4:15 p.m. _ Mandatory drivers' meeting at Lowe's begins _
without Stewart. That means Stewart, who qualified 27th for the
race, will have to start the Coca-Cola 600 at the rear of the
field.
</P>
<P>
   4:48 p.m. _ Stewart's entourage arrives at the speedway in a
Navigator limousine. After reaching the infield of the track,
Lowe's officials force them to remove the Home Depot decals from
their vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   5:50 p.m. _ Stewart arrives at Lowe's in Winston Cup driver
Rusty Wallace's Bell 407 helicopter. The six-seat helicopter lands
on the TBS logo just past the start-finish line. Stewart jumps in a
Chevy Camaro for driver introductions.
</P>
<P>
   5:57 p.m. _ Stewart climbs into his No. 20 Pontiac after a brief
conversation with Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   6:08 p.m. _ Speedway Motorsports Inc. president Bruton Smith,
who owns the Lowe's facility, delivers the ``Gentleman, start your
engines'' command.
</P>
<P>
   6:12 p.m. _ The 43-car field rolls off the grid.
</P>
<P>
   6:15 p.m. _ The green flag falls and Stewart faces 600 more
miles and 1,600 left-hand turns.

NATO SAYS SOME MOVEMENT DETECTED IN MILOSEVIC POSITION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO officials hinted Sunday they were more
optimistic about Slobodan Milosevic's willingness to reach a peace
deal, although an official envoy to the Balkans warned the
situation was ``not a normal negotiating process,'' even as NATO
warplanes bombed a crowded bridge in Central Serbia, killing 11.
</P>
<P>
   Several cars plunged into the Velika Morava River after three
missiles struck the bridge used by shoppers to visit a market near
the town of Krusevac, the official Tanjug news agency reported. The
attack wounded at least 30 people.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, last week reportedly accepted
the broad outlines of a peace agreement drawn up by the G-8, the
world's top seven industrialized nations and Russia. But it was not
until Sunday that NATO officials interpreted Milosevic's statement
about the plan as a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has begun to move from a position of almost total defiance
of the international community when we started'' airstrikes ``on
March 24 to at least now saying that he accepts the key demands of
the G8, which embody NATO's five conditions,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The remark _ coupled with a similar one by NATO's supreme
commander, General Wesley K. Clark, signaled a shift in allied
rhetoric, after a week in which Milosevic's statement was met in
the United States with skepticism, warnings, and promises that the
air campaign would not cease without an agreement fully acceptable
to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday, Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish president who is
serving as the European Union's special envoy to Kosovo, remained
skeptical about Milosevic's intentions, and cautioned that the
central NATO demands, including withdrawal of Serb troops and
acceptance of an international peacekeeping force, must still be
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just accepting the G8 principles does not give us the clarity
to proceed further,'' Ahtisaari said. ``We need a clear
understanding from the Yugoslav leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari, who is scheduled to travel to Belgrade this week with
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, also dismissed concerns that the
job of negotiating a peace deal has been complicated by the
decision last week by the International War Crimes Tribunal to
indict Milosevic and other Yugoslav leaders for war crimes. These
are not, he said, normal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go to Belgrade I will explain the offer the international
community is prepared to make, and the chances the Yugoslav people
have for peace,'' Ahtisaari said. ``That's entirely different from
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews and news conferences Sunday, both Shea and
Clark said it appeared Milosevic was shifting toward a diplomatic
solution, even if only to avoid a continuation of the airstrikes.
Clark, noting ``a very significant change in the tone of
pronouncements coming from Belgrade,'' said the developments were a
sign the airstrikes are producing the intended results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the bombing that is impelling the diplomacy,''
Clark said in an interview on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   --A NATO missile attack in Kosovo hit near a convoy of
journalists Sunday, killing a local driver and wounding two
European reporters and a French philosopher, the Serb-run Media
Center in Pristina said.
</P>
<P>
   Wounded were a reporter for the Times of London, Eve-Ann
Prentice, an unidentified reporter from the Italian Corriere della
Sera newspaper, and a French philosopher, Daniel Schiffer, who has
been advocating the Serbian cause. The slain driver was identified
as Nebojsa Radojevic, 28.
</P>
<P>
   --United Nations war crimes prosecutor Louise Arbour said she
has been urged to indict NATO for war crimes connected to the
airstrikes against Yugoslavia. While NATO cannot be indicted as a
whole, she said its leadership could theoretically be charged on
allegations ``that the targeting was inappropriate, that some of
the targets had no military significance, or that if they did they
were disproportionate to the anticipated civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, certainly, a debate out there that is being brought
to our attention,'' Arbour said on NBC's Meet the Press. ``Now,
where we would take it, if anywhere, is not a matter that I'm
prepared to discuss publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   --NATO pilots depicted the countryside inside Kosovo as eerily
empty and scorched, according to spokesman Jamie Shea, who spoke to
several of them over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One told me how at night, flying over Kosovo, he could see
lots of red dots representing houses and villages that were
burning,'' Shea said. ``Another spoke to me of the deserted
landscape in which virtually nothing moved. The roads were empty.
No farmers, no activity in the fields. As if the population, like
troglodytes, had gone into hiding in caves and deserted houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 600,000 ethnic Albanians are believed to be dislocated
within Kosovo..
</P>
<P>
   --The 24 Apache helicopters that have not been deployed since
being dispatched to Albania in early April ``will be used at a time
and a place of our choosing,'' Clark said. The helicopters were
brought in to target Serb paramilitary forces at close range. So
far, the US combat helicopters have flown only training missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at the Apaches,'' Clark said. ``They are
trained and ready and I'm convinced that at the right time, they'll
come into play.''

11 PEOPLE KILLED AS NATO MISSILES HIT BRIDGE NEAR BELGRADE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELGRADE _ Eleven people were killed Sunday when NATO missiles
struck a bridge south of the Yugoslav capital, plunging people and
cars into a river below, Yugoslav authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Government-controlled media said that between 30 and 40 other
people were reported missing, and that the death toll could rise.
At least 30 people were being treated in nearby hospitals,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in the town of Varvarin said they had heard two NATO
warplanes humming high overhead when the first bomb struck shortly
before 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two missiles hit first. People rushed to help those trapped.
Four minutes later, another two hit,'' said Slavoljub Blagojevic,
manager of a nearby sports center. ``Thousands of people were on
and around the bridge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Western journalists who were taken to the scene by Yugoslav
officials said there were body parts and mutilated bodies scattered
near the bridge, most of which had fallen some 30 feet down into
the VelikaMorava River.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters saw eight bodies, including that of a decapitated
priest, in a local morgue and were told a ninth victim, a girl, had
died on the way to hospital in nearby Krusevac.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was a market day in the town of Varvarin, some 90 miles
south of Belgrade, and witnesses say the bridge was full of cars
and pedestrians when the first bomb hit.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge was one of the few still linking southern Serbia with
the province of Kosovo, as NATO attempts to cut the supply lines
Serb forces use to send food, ammunition and reinforcements to
Kosovo. The explosion also cut power and phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said it was too early to
say whether the bridge had been downed by NATO bombs. He
acknowledged that NATO considered bridges military targets, but
insisted NATO did not deliberately target civilians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO appeared to escalate its air attacks Sunday, launching
bombs in and around Belgrade at 9 a.m., the first time NATO had
struck the capital on a Sunday morning. With new planes just
arrived at new air bases in Hungary and Bulgaria, NATO has said it
will launch 24-hour attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reports of killing civilians, NATO supreme commander
General Wesley K. Clark Sunday vowed to increase the intensity of
the attacks in Serbia.

SPORTS COLUMN: A MISSED SHOT AND A SOAP OPERA IN GAME ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Eds: Rewrites entirely.) (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ If New York Knick fans remember their history,
then they could have been excused if they had covered their eyes
when Reggie Miller took a pass from Mark Jackson and got set to
seal their doom again. ``Reggie has killed us so many times with
the big 3's,'' Patrick Ewing said after the game, recalling this
moment.
</P>
<P>
   All the agony that Miller, the Pacers' guard, has perpetrated
against the Knicks in playoffs over the years seemed to reappear
before their eyes Sunday night, when the Knicks were ahead by 90-88
with 29 seconds left in this opener of the Eastern Conference
finals in Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Reggie loves this stuff. He lives to make other teams' lives
miserable, especially the Knicks. His eyes are nearly aglitter as
he looks toward the basket, ball in his spindly hands.
</P>
<P>
   So Miller _ thin as a strand of linguine, with the mind-set of
the gunslingers in the Wild West movies he so admired as a boy _
was ready to bang home the game-winner once again. Duck, Knicks
fans!
</P>
<P>
   But Allan Houston and Patrick Ewing flew toward him with arms
extended toward the rafters. ``It was a good look,'' Miller said
later. ``By my standards, it was still a good look.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball went up and fell to the basket _ and bounced off the
rim! Reggie missed! Chris Childs recovered the ball and Dale Davis
fouled him.
</P>
<P>
   Childs made both free throws and, as it turned out, put the game
out of reach (though the Pacers had a desperation 3-pointer by
Jackson at the buzzer that fell short). And the Knicks, with a
93-90 victory, continued this most improbable of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Organizational turmoil to them was like spinach to Popeye. The
general manager was dismissed when they were 21-21 with eight games
remaining and a playoff berth in doubt, and they manage to do it.
They are the eighth-seeded team in the conference and knock off
Miami, the top-seeded team. In the next round, they treat the Hawks
the way they might treat a bunch of guys in a pickup game at the Y,
and sweep the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the team president tells the world that he did not
interview a possible replacement for the Knicks' coach. Then he
tells the world he did. The team president's faulty memory was like
fuel to an Apollo space launch.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it seem to matter that their spectacular new player
this season, Latrell Sprewell, grumbles that he wants to play more.
He nonetheless helps them win, as he did Sunday, scoring 16 points,
though it was not one of his best efforts.
</P>
<P>
   It also did not seem to matter that their aging and hobbling
spectacular old player, Patrick Ewing, should be spending his days
and nights in an infirmary rather than in the low post. But there
he was, hitting clutch shots to keep the Knicks from falling
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when they got behind and could have thrown in
the towel,'' Miller said, ``but they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' defense was strong, and when Antonio Davis and Dale
Davis slammed thunderous dunks, igniting the sellout crowd of
16,575, the Knicks weren't cowed. And then Childs stepped to the
line after the Miller miss, with the Knicks bench on its feet, and
Rick Brunson, the substitute guard, couldn't look. He pulled his
jersey over his head. The moans of the crowd told him the shots
were good. And then the bench players hugged each other as the
clock ran out for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Indiana is such a good team,'' Houston said, ``that you
can't exhale. It was just one game.''
</P>
<P>
   And Larry Bird, who looks so cool on the bench that one is wont
to congratulate his embalmer, said, ``They beat us today. It's not
the end of the world. We have to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   The stoicism is part of the Bird motif. When, for example, the
Pacers returned home after winning the opening-round playoff series
in Milwaukee two weeks ago, and followed with the second-round
sweep of Philadelphia, there was no crowd to greet the team. No
announcement was made about its arrival. By orders of the head
coach, Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won anything yet,'' Bird explained. ``We'll
celebrate a championship. Nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson had a propensity to shimmy and shake after making a
good play. ``Cut it out,'' Bird said. ``Celebrate when we've won a
championship.'' Now they go back to work, figuring out matchups and
strategy for Game 2 here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike numerous others in basketball who have never had to work
at anything else in their lives, Bird labored on a garbage truck
one year at home. This was after he quit Indiana University and the
oppressive Bobby Knight after one month on campus following his
high school graduation. Bird returned home to French Lick, Ind., to
sort out his life, and got the job, which, he said, taught him as a
teen-ager a great deal about life's realities as well as working
with men.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, then, that the Pacers have performed like the
best kinds of garbage collectors: thorough, prideful, and not
heading for beers until the last alley is cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   This is something the implausible Knicks, the seemingly
imperturbable Knicks, must yet keep in their mind's eye.

ROBINSON TAKES CONTROL OF THE SHIP

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In Game 1 of the Western Conference finals on
Saturday, it looked as if David Robinson were still the principal
player in the San Antonio Spurs' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting jumpers, driving to the basket and receiving passes
on the low block, the swift 7-foot-1-inch center took more shots
than any of his teammates, including his esteemed partner in the
post, Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual but welcome position for Robinson to be in.
All season long, the one-time NBA Most Valuable Player deferred to
Duncan offensively, allowing the second-year forward to become an
MVP candidate in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Trail Blazers' quick traps making it tough on
Duncan, and Portland's all but immobile center, Arvydas Sabonis,
guarding Robinson, the Spurs are wisely refocusing their attention
on the Admiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it fun,'' said Robinson, who scored 21 points in San
Antonio's 80-76 victory. ``It's nice this series to be freed up to
add a little offense to the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in San Antonio when Robinson, the MVP in 1995,
was the offense, leading the Spurs in scoring in eight of his first
nine seasons and leading the league in 1994 with a 29.8-point
average.
</P>
<P>
   When Duncan arrived last season with all of his gifts, no one
expected him to supplant Robinson as the team's main feature. But
when San Antonio's season ended in the conference semifinals,
despite the high scoring averages of both Robinson (21.6 points)
and Duncan (21.1 points), it became clear that the offense could go
through only one post player. So in pursuit of that elusive
championship, Robinson turned the offense over to Duncan, willingly
becoming a second option for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, coming from a position where you shoot a lot and
get the chance to do whatever you want,'' Robinson, 33, admitted
Sunday, after the team prepared for Game 2 on Monday. ``Last year
was more of an example of us going back and forth and switching up
the offensive responsibilities. But this year, Tim's really been
the focus and he's done a phenomenal job with it. He's our go-to
guy and I'm glad to be here for support.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Robinson became the Spurs' second option.
While Robinson says it was coach Gregg Popovich's idea, Popovich
insists there was no official role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a misconception that we just changed and made Tim
the first option,'' Popovich said. ``David gets an awful lot of
touches on the court. It basically depends a lot on mismatches and
who's guarding who out there. If Tim's got a defender on him that
we think is giving him trouble, we're going to go to David a lot
more than we go to Tim. And at the end of games, we've gone to
David as much as we've gone to Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Popovich's denials, the Spurs, at least offensively,
have clearly become Duncan's team. Robinson averaged a career-low
15.8 points this season, nearly six points fewer than Duncan, and
attempted just 10.8 shots a game, six fewer than Duncan. Saturday's
victory over Portland was just the ninth time this year that
Robinson has shot the ball more than Duncan. Entering this season,
Robinson had averaged 25.1 points and 16.9 shots a game.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich, pointing out that Duncan averages almost eight more
minutes a game than Robinson does, says the difference is due to
playing time. But last year, averaging six more minutes, Duncan
(15.7 shots) averaged just one more shot than Robinson (14.6) .
</P>
<P>
   While some observers attribute Robinson's scoring drop to the
back and knee injuries he has suffered in the past, Robinson says
it is because he is taking fewer shots. His production in other
categories _ 10 rebounds, 2.4 blocks a game, a team-best 50.9
percent shooting _ support his claim that he can still score more
than 20 points a game on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what your role is, whether you're the MVP guy or
whether you're somebody that's supporting him, you've got to do
your job,'' Robinson said. ``At some point, you have to get past
all of that ego stuff and decide that you just want to win
basketball games, and this year, I'm just happy that we're winning
basketball games. I couldn't care less who gets all of the
headlines.''

<P>
   As the trial in the government's antitrust case against
Microsoft Corp. resumes Tuesday in Washington, evidence in a
separate trial set to open this week in Connecticut seems to offer
tantalizing support for an assertion that the company's rivals have
made for years _ that Microsoft wields its industry-standard
Windows operating system as a club to control the software
business.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the Connecticut case is an issue that has been raised
peripherally by several government witnesses in the Washington case
_ how Microsoft controls its competitors' understanding of
application program interfaces, or APIs.
</P>
<P>
   APIs are the paths into and out of the operating system that
programmers must follow for their software _ spreadsheets, Internet
browsers, picture editing and so on _ to run efficiently. Rivals
have long said that Microsoft gives them only rudimentary maps of
the Windows APIs, making it impossible to compete with the designs
of Microsoft's own applications programmers, who enjoy a detailed
road map of Windows, complete with little backroads and alleys that
can be used as shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismisses such contentions as whining by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But in an internal e-mail memo to several senior Microsoft
executives on Feb. 28, 1996, Mark Ryland, a company manager,
observed matter-of-factly, ``Microsoft learned long ago that to
control the APIs is to control the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   That memo is among thousands of internal Microsoft documents
filed in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., as part of a
private antitrust suit scheduled to go to trial on Wednesday. Among
other things, they show a spirited debate inside Microsoft over how
much of its software should run ``cross-platform'' _ that is, on
competing operating systems like Unix, the platform for many large
corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the e-mail offers vivid glimpses of Microsoft's
winner-take-all style of competition. In one internal memo, a
Microsoft manager discusses a proposal to enable some of its data
base technology to work on Unix. This was a topic previously raised
with data base companies like Sybase Inc. and Oracle Corp., which
compete with Microsoft in data base software but also develop
products that run on Windows as well as on Unix.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, 1996, James Allchin, a Microsoft senior vice
president, wrote: ``Please give me one good reason why we should
even consider this. (Hint: any good answer needs to include making
more money and helping kill Unix, Sybase or Oracle.)''
</P>
<P>
   The suit in Connecticut is not directly related to the
government's sweeping antitrust case. But the justice department
and the 19 states suing Microsoft are eagerly awaiting the evidence
in the Connecticut case because it focuses squarely on the issue of
technology access.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Bristol Technology Inc., a small software maker
in Danbury, Conn., charges that Microsoft illegally cut off its
access to Windows technology after three years of cooperation and
says that Microsoft had a ``duty to deal'' with it.
</P>
<P>
   The government's more traditional antitrust suit charges that
Microsoft used its Windows monopoly to stifle competition from
Internet software. The Justice Department left the issue of
technology access to be addressed in the remedy phase of the trial
if it wins, and it is a crucial subject in continuing settlement
talks with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   One justice department official observed, ``I think we should
put a sign up in the war room here, `It's the APIs, stupid''' _ a
play on the slogan in President Clinton's 1992 campaign stressing
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that reading too much into a few e-mail messages
is unfair. The company, its lawyers note, is unapologetically
filled with highly competitive people with a passion for the
software business _ a passion reflected in their e-mail. ``And a
lot of the e-mail that Bristol has filed as evidence has nothing to
do with this case,'' said Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate
lawyer for Microsoft. ``There are discussions about cross-platform
strategies all the time within Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bristol is not going to win its antitrust suit against
Microsoft merely with piles of inflammatory e-mail that raise
important industry issues. It must produce convincing evidence that
Microsoft violated the antitrust laws, and legal experts say that
is a stiff challenge.  &QL;

 UNDATED: challenge. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristol has assembled a legal team led by two veteran antitrust
experts known for defending the International Business Machines
Corp., Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, and Anthony
L. Clapes, a former IBM assistant general counse. But legal
experts say that ``duty-to-deal'' cases are hard to win outside
industries with traditions of regulation, like telecommunications,
or businesses involving natural assets, like ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are very reluctant to say that dominant firms have
a duty to deal, because that takes you down a regulatory path,''
William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University
Law School, said. ``It also reduces incentives to innovate if a
dominant firm is forced to share its hard-won assets _ like
intellectual property in the software business _ with other
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol charges that Microsoft used it as a tool in a cynical
campaign to gain a foothold in the market for heavy-duty corporate
computing and then tried to shift those customers over to using
Microsoft's most advanced operating system, Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Windows NT has gradually improved over the years, but after it
was first shipped in 1992, it struggled to compete against Unix in
the market for big corporate systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's main advantage was the popularity of the many
software applications _ an estimated 100,000 _ written to run on
Windows. For example, a scientist using a powerful Unix work
station for research might want to use Microsoft Word to write
memos or an Excel spreadsheet for doing budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol developed a product that solved that problem. Its Wind/U
software enabled programs written for Windows to run on Unix work
stations, or hub computers called servers, that send data to
workers' desktop machines. That opened mainstream corporate
business to the legions of Windows software developers.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bristol's translation software to work, the company
needed access to Microsoft's technology. In 1994, Bristol signed a
three-year contract with Microsoft giving Bristol virtually open
access to all Windows APIs. Lifted by its partnership with
Microsoft, Bristol thrived. In 1997, Inc. magazine ranked Bristol
140th among the 500 fastest-growing companies in the nation, with a
payroll of 70 people and estimated revenue of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was the high point for Bristol. It began negotiating
with Microsoft on a contract for access to the newer versions of
Microsoft's operating-system technology. After the two sides failed
to reach an agreement, Bristol sued last August contending that
Microsoft's offer _ a fourfold increase in price and much-reduced
access to Windows technology _ was an ``apple core,'' as a
Microsoft e-mail message described it.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bristol, the changed terms were no mystery. Windows
NT has made real strides in the corporate market against Unix.
Cripple the cross-platform software provided by Bristol, and many
customers that have become dependent on Windows applications thanks
to Bristol's software would move from Unix to Windows.
``Microsoft's dealings with Bristol are a classic
bait-and-switch,'' Lynch, Bristol's lead trial lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that Bristol has no legal grounds for its case
and has embarked on litigation as a business tactic. It points out
that the 1994 contract covered access only to Windows NT 3.0,
Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, and it contained no language about
future versions of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   True, says Keith Blackwell, the president of Bristol. But he
points to the many public statements Microsoft made about its
commitment to the cross-platform program, called the Windows
Interface Source Environment, or WISE. One document posted on the
Web in 1995 stated, ``Microsoft is committed to providing WISE
licensees'' _ like Bristol _ ``with future versions of Windows
family source code.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said, ``Microsoft repeatedly and publicly made all
these representations that the WISE program was a safe way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies also had conflicts with Microsoft over access to
Windows technology, including AT&AMP;T, the inventor of Unix, which
eventually settled a contract suit seeking access to Windows NT 5.0
programming code.
</P>
<P>
   But a Bristol rival, Mainsoft Inc., did reach an agreement with
Microsoft last year. And Bristol, according to Microsoft, rejected
the same contract terms that Mainsoft found acceptable. The
negotiations with Microsoft were lengthy and difficult, William
McCarthy, Mainsoft's vice president for business development, said.
``But there's nothing we can't do that we want to do under the new
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol's duty-to-deal case falls apart because ``Microsoft has
not refused to deal with Bristol _ it was offered the same terms as
Mainsoft,'' its lawyer, Aeschbacher, said. ``Just because someone
is not happy with the terms of a deal they are offered, that is not
an antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol replies that Mainsoft was struggling and willing to take
whatever Microsoft offered to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   An internal e-mail message certainly suggests, at least, that
Microsoft found Mainsoft easier to deal with. On May 18, 1998, Dan
Neault, a WISE program manager, wrote: ``Mainsoft is in our pocket.
Bristol is rattling sabres hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol contends that the offer Mainsoft accepted is a hobbled
version of the original cross-platform promise of the WISE program,
and thus Microsoft has used its market power to undermine
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Microsoft will seek to portray Bristol as a company
bent on litigation, trying to win a huge financial judgment against
a deep-pocketed defendant.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, 1998, a month before negotiations finally broke off,
Bristol received a ``strategic communications game plan'' from

BUSH SAYS HE'LL SIGN BILL ENCOURAGING PLANTS TO CUT EMISSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legislation to encourage aging industrial plants
to comply with modern air pollution standards won final legislative
approval Sunday night, and Gov. George W. Bush said he's looking
forward to signing it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 766 by Sen. James ``Buster'' Brown, R-Lake Jackson,
calls on plants built before 1971 to voluntarily begin upgrading
equipment to reduce the amount of contaminants released into the
air. Plants that don't begin cutting emissions would have to pay
fees to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff worked with members of the House and the Senate to
come up with a bill that encourages plants that are grandfathered
to meet standards,'' Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The ``grandfathered'' plants have been exempt from clean air
standards enacted after they were built.
</P>
<P>
   The emissions bill was among more than 100 pieces of legislation
sent to the governor's desk Sunday night. Under Legislature rules,
all bills had to be passed before midnight. The 76th Legislative
session ends Monday, but rules for the final day limit lawmakers to
making technical changes in bills.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bills sent to Bush were the final piece of an
anti-gang initiative, a college scholarship program for low-income
students, a bill adding safeguards to religious expression, and a
measure to boost the amount of lottery prize payouts.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups weren't pleased with the emissions bill,
but said the version that passed is better than some of the earlier
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush wants it both ways. He wants credit for cleaning up the
air, but he stood in the way of attempts to make sure the air got
cleaner,'' said Peter Altman, director of the Sustainable Energy
and Economic Development Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to establish the so-called Hope Scholarship bill, which
would set aside $100 million for financial aid for low-income
students, won bipartisan support as it passed the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 713 by Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, and Sen. Rodney
Ellis, D-Houston, would provide tuition and fees to qualifying high
school students who have completed college preparatory courses and
maintain grade point averages of 2.0 or better during their first
year of college.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains funding to provide scholarships for an
estimated 20,000 students during the upcoming two-year budget
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation requiring candidates for state office to file their
lists of campaign contributors and expenditures on a computer disk
so the information can be posted on the Internet also was sent to
the governor without dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Under House Bill 2611 by Rep. Sherri Greenberg, D-Austin, and
Sen. Mike Moncrief, D-Fort Worth, candidates would still be
required to file paper campaign and expense reports.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prohibit candidates from planting phony names on
their lists to determine whether someone misuses the information.
The electronic reporting requirement would apply only to candidates
with Internet access and those who plan to raise more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 8 by Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, would allow the
state to establish a database that tracks gang membership and
activity statewide. Several other bills aimed at combating illegal
gang activity have already been sent to Bush's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Lottery will begin putting a larger chunk of its take
into the prize pool if the governor signs House Bill 844 by Rep.
Ron Wilson, D-Houston. The bill essentially reverses a move the
Legislature made two years ago that reduced the payout from about
57 cents for each dollar taken in to about 52 cents.
</P>
<P>
   If the new measure becomes law, the payout will be set at 57
cents per $1 beginning in September. If the Texas Lottery seeks to
raise the payout higher than 57 cents after September 2000, it
would have to lower its $40 million advertising budget by $1
million for each cent added. .MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit the

BUSH GETS BOOST FROM 76TH TEXAS LEGISLATURE'S WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was supposed to be about the money.
</P>
<P>
   But the last regularly scheduled gathering of Texas lawmakers
this century might be remembered as much for what it did to the
political fortunes of George W. Bush as how it dispensed with a
record government surplus.
</P>
<P>
   For five months, the 76th Texas Legislature has operated in the
shadow of the Republican governor's budding presidential campaign,
the watchful eye of the national media never far away.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, when the final gavel falls, the score card will be
filled _ just in time for Bush's first campaign trip two weeks
hence to Iowa and New Hampshire, the traditional first tests for
presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Several political observers said Bush will come out a winner
simply because he will take credit for large tax cuts, a huge boost
in education spending, and popular new abortion restrictions _ all
while avoiding any apparent disasters.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there were a few surprise developments that
could provide campaign fodder for Bush opponents.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter partisan fight over hate-crimes legislation wasn't on
anyone's radar screen when the session began. Before it ended,
Bush's unwillingness to take a clear position on that and other
hot-button political issues was thrust into the national spotlight
_ and probably into the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is clearly not very ready for many of the questions that
will be aimed his way,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist
at the University of Virginia. ``Once he starts campaigning, he can
only duck and dodge and weave for so long. It's already getting
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Dangers may also be lurking in Bush's record on guns, an issue
that is shifting in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he'll sign a bill shielding gun manufacturers from
lawsuits by cities, a top priority of the National Rifle
Association. Although popular in Texas, the measure could be
controversial elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also made a few confusing twists on requiring
background checks of those who purchase weapons at gun shows before
he settled on the idea that it's a federal problem, not a state
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually has a very pro-gun record that could haunt him,''
Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bush did not get everything he wanted from the
Legislature, either in tax cuts or education. Despite his rare
personal appearance on the Senate floor as the chamber was poised
to consider legislation providing state-backed vouchers for
students to attend private schools, the bill never came up for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry we didn't get a voucher bill,'' Bush said Sunday.
``I think they are needed ... to give people different options,
particularly if their children are going to failed schools.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `INTIMIDATED' BY BUSH
</P>
<P>
   But much of the governor's agenda survived _ even flourished _
despite predictions that partisan politics or a lack of money would
derail his tax cut package and education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settles Monday, the Legislature is expected to
have approved about $1.7 billion in tax cuts, less than the $2.6
billion Bush wanted but more than earlier plans provided.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also won approval of his top education reform proposal _
aimed at ending social promotion, or the practice of advancing
unprepared students through the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   And the governor saw passage of the toughest anti-abortion bill
that was politically viable: legislation requiring that parents be
notified when their minor children seek abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people, when they take an objective look, will say
this was a good session,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were moments when partisan tensions flared, the
irony for some critics is the extent to which Bush can thank
Democrats for his legislative successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some in the (Democratic) leadership that are
intimidated by his high numbers and are of the opinion that, if we
give him everything we'll do better at the polls than if we fight
him,'' said Rep. Kevin Bailey, D-Houston, an unabashed liberal and
a consistent Bush critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some excellent things this session for our constituency
_ the teacher pay raises, the improvements in funding for things
like kindergarten,'' Bailey said. ``We still, I think, could have
done better ... and should not have just laid down and allowed him
to run over us.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPENDING VS. TAX CUTS
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Bush's popularity on state lawmakers was on
display at a recent meeting of the House Committee on Public
Education, which inherited Bush's top two agenda items: education
revisions and property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Dick Lavine, giving one of his standard lectures about
the relative merits of those two items, urged the panel to forget
the tax cuts and spend all the money on teacher salaries, better
school buildings and more training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us really disagree with that,'' responded
Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, the committee's chairman. ``But none
of us got 80 percent of the vote ... statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's reference to Bush was only a tad exaggerated: Bush won
re-election in 1998 with 69 percent of the vote, not 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about his comment, Sadler said he meant that ``some
deference should be made to those that run on a statewide basis and
win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Bush) ran a campaign on certain issues and he was
overwhelmingly elected,'' Sadler said. ``I don't think you can
ignore that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats say that Bush simply jumped out in front of a
parade that was already under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's campaigning on what the Democratic priorities were in
this Legislature,'' Democratic consultant Ed Martin said. ``If he
gets to take credit for that, it's really an injustice to the
people who led this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   READING THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Although there was plenty of give and take between Democrats and
Republicans on the tax cut and social promotion issues, Bush could
not have hoped for a better outcome on the abortion front.
</P>
<P>
   Under the parental notification bill that he plans to sign, only
a judge can bypass the law and allow an abortion to take place
without a parent being notified, precisely the language Bush
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats narrowly control the House, the
Democratic-sponsored bill, which would have allowed minors to
notify non-parent family members instead of just a parent, never
made it off the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Even the chairman of the committee that produced the various
versions of the legislation, Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas, expressed
regret that only a judicial ``bypass'' was in the final version.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst place to go take this situation to is a judge who's
not going to care _ and I think all judges are not going to care,''
Wolens said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Democratic bill allowing other family members to
be involved didn't make it, Wolens said that it was all about
deadlines. Under procedural rules, and due to negotiation delays,
he said, it would probably have died for lack of time.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats said the explanation can be found in public
opinion polls and political math. Surveys show that Texans strongly
support parental notification laws, particularly those people who
live and vote in rural districts where many Democrats are
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can read the polls just like the Republicans can,'' said
one operative close to Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the House narrowly rejected an attempt to amend the
GOP bill by adding more exemptions, despite a rare intervention by
Democratic House Speaker Pete Laney, whose vote for additional
bypasses was his only one this session.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome left Rep. Patty Gray, D-Galveston, author of the
Democratic alternative, bitter. She said that some of her
colleagues voted their conscience, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few others who I think succumbed to the pressure
from the (anti-abortion) groups, on how they would report the
vote,'' she said. ``I'm saddened by it, because I don't think
that's what's in people's hearts here, and unfortunately their
hearts didn't match their backbones on this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO VS. TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush is sure to include a long list of accomplishments
from the 76th Legislature on his resume, political scientist Allan
Saxe of the University of Texas at Arlington said it probably won't
be at the front and center of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility that U.S. ground troops could go into
Kosovo, and in light of increased tensions with China, Saxe said
national defense issues will probably overshadow anything that
happened in Texas during the past 140 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will obviously talk about a major tax cut. It will
resonate,'' Saxe said. ``But I think the debate in the Republican
primaries is going to be over foreign policy. ... I think national
defense is going to be a bigger issue than anybody would have
imagined a year ago.''

D. ROBERT YARNALL JR., 74, RETIRED MANUFACTURER 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   D. Robert Yarnall Jr., who helped build a local Pennsylvania
manufacturing company into a multinational corporation, died on May
27 at the Unitarian Universalist House nursing home in the
Germantown section of Philadelphia. He was 74 and had lived most of
his life in the West Mount Airy section of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, his brother, James B.
Yarnall, said.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall started in business in 1950, when he joined the company
co-founded by his father, then known as Yarnall Waring Co., a small
manufacturer of specialty valves for power plants. The company,
based in suburban Philadelphia, eventually changed its name to
Yarway Corp. By 1962, Yarnall, then 37, had been elected president,
and in 1977 he assumed the position of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While working in that job, Yarnall founded the Envirite Corp. as
an environmental services subsidiary of Yarway. In 1984 the
subsidiary was spun off, and Yarnall remained as a chairman of both
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, Yarway had operations in seven countries and its sales
had greatly increased. That year the company merged with Keystone
International, a large maker of industrial valves, and Yarway
stepped down as chairman. He continued as chairman of Envirite
until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall was born in 1925 in Germantown and attended the
Germantown Friends School. He graduated from Cornell University in
1948 and worked in Europe with the American Friends Service
Committee before beginning his career in business. He was named to
the boards of an assortment of companies and nonprofit groups,
including Quaker Chemical Corp. and the World Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall is survived by his wife, Anne Gates Yarnall; a brother,
James B. Yarnall; a sister, Nan Yarnall; three daughters from his
marriage to the late Rie Yarnall; seven grandchildren and two
step-grandchildren.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF GIRLS' ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION RAISES
QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL and MIKE McGRAW  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Financial
questions and a staunch refusal to open the books have ignited a
battle for control of a local institution that has fostered
generations of softball and basketball players. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dispute centers on Jack Spahr, 64, executive director and
longtime president of the board of the Johnson County Girls'
Athletic Association, a tax-exempt group that collects almost $1
million a year, nearly half in sports fees from thousands of
Johnson County, Kan., girls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though some parents said they were happy, many have complained
for years about the nonprofit's fund-raisers, rising fees and a
reluctance by the board of directors _ particularly Spahr _ to
share financial information. One fed-up basketball coach broke away
from the association, taking 250 girls with him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr and his supporters defended the job he has done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack is one hell of an asset and always has been,'' said board
member Burl Denton of Merriam, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months, The Kansas City Star interviewed
dozens of people about the association's operations and examined
financial and real estate documents. The newspaper found: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --A concentration of power. As president of the board and the
paid executive director, Spahr serves as his own boss at the
group's sports complex; he and the board ignore their own bylaws
and force out those who question their actions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Questions about money. Spahr and the board refuse to explain
financial discrepancies or to release financial records, as
required by association rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Deepening debt. Spahr and the board borrowed about $3 million
for a gym after spending funds parents paid toward the project on
other expenses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A former Internal Revenue Service employee who sponsors a
Johnson County Girls' softball team recently asked Spahr to open
the books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything's on the up and up,'' said Malcolm Ayer, whose
IRS experience included overseeing nonprofits, then Spahr should
open the books to the press and the public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a public charity just like United Way,'' Ayer said he
told Spahr, Denton and the association's lawyer. ``You have a
higher standard to uphold. You need to ... see that whatever
questions there are be answered and be answered honestly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And they didn't agree with that position.'' &QL; 
Consolidation of power &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson County Girls' Athletic Association is the largest
sponsor of softball and basketball programs for girls ages 5 to 18
in the Kansas City area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The group was incorporated in Kansas in 1960 and today serves
about 3,000 girls in softball and 1,500 in basketball. A volleyball
program will be added soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association's home base is 12 lighted ball diamonds in
Shawnee, Kan., in the Valley of Champions, the site this weekend
for the Memorial Day Tournament. Also at the complex is a
58,000-square-foot gymnasium slated to open in June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many parents look forward to the new gym and are happy with the
complex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with it as a kid and now my kids play ... ,'' said
Lisa Ryan of Overland Park. ``JCGAA is a topnotch facility. It
really is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr, a retired printing salesman, got involved in the
association the way many people do _ his daughters played softball
there. Soon he was on the board of directors, a board made up
mainly of parents of current and former players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s Spahr was pushing for changes: higher fees for
the girls, mandatory fund-raisers and the elimination of
double-headers, which he said did not earn the association enough
money, said Denny Mealman, a payroll department manager and former
member of the board of governors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The board of governors was a volunteer group of parents and
coaches who organized the softball and basketball leagues for the
board of directors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Pat Kearn, an accountant whose daughter played
softball, raised questions about the association's finances. Even
then, she said, ``many parents were questioning the constant
increase in expenses.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On July 20 that year, Kearn sent the association a petition
signed by 71 parents asking for a ``public accounting to date of
all the funds received and distributed by the JCGAA for the 1990
softball season.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr responded the same way he has to some others who have
requested such information: with silence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people were upset by the changes being initiated by
Spahr and the board, said Bill Whinery, former chairman of the
governors board. ``It seemed the association was taking more
interest in the association for the association's sake, and not for
the players' sake.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The board of governors, called for in the bylaws, dissolved in
1990, the year the association moved to the new and bigger complex
in Shawnee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mealman quit in frustration; Marcia Pruitt and Taylor McCann
said the board asked them to leave. Whinery said he bowed out
because his daughter had ended her playing days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr acknowledged the bylaws should have been changed to
reflect the elimination of the board of governors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the board was discarded ``because it wasn't working. We
knew we were going to have to phase them out because they had new
ideas every two years. The whole board was behind phasing them out
and did it slow enough to where it didn't make everybody mad.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Pruitt, who works as an office manager, said that she felt
hurt when Spahr told her that her volunteer services organizing the
leagues were no longer needed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The governors, she said, ``were kind of like forced out. Nobody
had any say. He (Spahr) was just like a one-man show.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr replaced Pruitt with a paid employee: his daughter, Deb
Schmidt. Schmidt, who declined to divulge her salary, said she
believed she was hired by the board of directors, not by her
father. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, the board of directors hired Spahr as the
association's first executive director, in essence making Spahr his
own supervisor. His salary the first year was $40,000. For the last
three years, he has been paid $48,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr said his hiring was approved by the association's lawyer
and accountant. But having the head of the board of directors as a
paid staff member is a no-no, says an 80-year-old charity watchdog
group. The National Charities Information Bureau suggests
guidelines for charities and rates national groups on whether they
abide by them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The paid executive directors of two other metropolitan area
youth sports groups, the 3&AMP;2 Baseball Club of Johnson County and
the Wyandotte County (Kan.) Sports Association, are not voting
members of their boards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Spahr called fewer board meetings, former
directors and employees said. When the board did meet, no minutes
were taken, Spahr said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was fine with board member Buford Winn of Boonville, Mo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel we have had a bond and trust there,'' he said.
``We just felt that everything was right, and we felt it wasn't
necessary.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson County Girls' bylaws allow board members to serve as
long as they want unless they are removed by a board vote. Spahr
has served at least 20 years, 11 as president. Winn has been on the
board at least 16 years, and Denton at least nine years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Toeneboehn, a Shawnee resident whose daughter played
softball, was the newest member, with 16 months of service. But
Toeneboehn, who had voiced concerns about several issues, said he
was removed from the board in April in a secret meeting of the
three remaining board members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Questions about money &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Spahr's allies defend his bookkeeping practices and other
actions, he has antagonized many people over the years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, longtime treasurer Pat Vielhauer resigned from the
board. In her resignation letter, Vielhauer complained that she
couldn't get answers from Spahr about finances, the gym project or
other matters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many decisions have been made without board approval or
knowledge of such action being taken,'' wrote Vielhauer. ``Since we
are a nonprofit organization I feel we need to make sure any
actions taken follow the guidelines for a nonprofit
organization.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vielhauer, who was paid about $27,000 a year in her position as
secretary-treasurer, declined to comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missy Phillips, who was fired last June as the association's
director of operations, said Spahr often did not provide her the
information she needed to keep accurate books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much questioned the entire checking account. I'd find
myself saying, `Where is check No. 298?' I could not keep accurate
books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know how much money I was starting with or finishing
with,'' said Phillips, who said she was fired because of false
rumors that she was not doing her job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former facilities manager Jody Gill said he left in 1996 because
he couldn't get answers from Spahr about annual or long-term
budgets. Gill said he felt uncomfortable operating without
financial guidelines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr has brushed aside questions about the association's
operations and finances since he became the central figure in
charge, those around him said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This despite the association's bylaws, filed with the IRS in
1966, that say ``all books and records of the corporation may be
inspected by any member, or his agent or attorney for any proper
purpose at any reasonable time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his only interview with The Star about this story, Spahr
agreed to further interviews and said he would open the
association's books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told you that you can see the books. You can go to the
accountant. I would call the accountant and arrange it,'' Spahr
said. He even offered to share his personal banking records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, Spahr said through the association's
attorney, Tom Kowalski, that he had no time for another interview
and that he would not share financial records. In a letter a few
days later, Kowalski told The Star that Spahr, Denton and Winn had
unanimously denied the newspaper's request to see financial
records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski then asked for a letter explaining the issues that the
newspaper was looking into. Spahr, Denton and Winn did not respond
to the questions raised in the letter, or to further requests from
The Star for comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The backbone of philanthropy is the public trust and
accountability,'' said Dan Langan, spokesman for the National
Charities Information Bureau. ``It is really up to the organization
to allay any doubts that the public has.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association has released only the 990s, the federal tax
forms for nonprofits, that are public record under IRS
regulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the 990 tax forms makes it difficult to track the
group's finances, because its expenses vary widely from year to
year. For example, the group told the IRS it spent $213 for
miscellaneous expenses in its 1993 fiscal year and $107,066 in
1996. Insurance cost $14,836 in 1995, about a third of the reported
$41,350 from two years earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 990, which covers most of calendar year 1998, was not
available, but an accountant's report indicated the association's
expenses exceeded revenue by nearly $64,000. Expenditures also
topped revenues by about $6,000 in 1995. The group recorded a
surplus of nearly $110,000 in 1996. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association's accountants, Bridges &AMP; Co. CPAs, said the
group's most recent financial statements were not audited. A
January letter from the firm, obtained by The Star, said the
association ``elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures
and the statement of cash flows required by generally accepted
accounting principles.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certified public accountant Wayne Bridges said the letter means
``we took the stuff they gave us and put it in the form of
financial statements.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The charity watchdog group urges nonprofits to prepare detailed
annual budgets and release audited financial statements. The Olathe
(Kan.) Girls Softball Association and Wyandotte County Sports
Association said they do audits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County Girls' is not required to audit its finances,
though, and the 3&AMP;2 Baseball Club and North Kansas City (Mo.) Area
Baseball said they do not do audits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Sherinsky, a technical expert at the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, said the level of review used by
Johnson County Girls' Athletic Association provides no fiscal
assurances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another money issue involves numbers from last summer's national
18 and under American Fastpitch Association tournament held at the
complex. Spahr told board members and The Star that he collected
$11,238.07 in gate revenues for the six-day tournament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Toeneboehn, who was Spahr's tournament director at the time,
estimated attendance could have been as high as 2,000 a day. He
said the stands were full, even during the middle of the night when
teams played make-up games because of rain. Admission fees should
have been $30,000 or higher, he said. Others agreed, including Ed
Serdar, an American Fastpitch regional director in Illinois who has
been a host for similar tournaments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr would not discuss questions about the gate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Deepening debt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is in the building of the gymnasium that the issues of
consolidation of power and money come together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr told reporters in March the gym would cost $2.6 million to
$3.5 million. It will feature four basketball or eight volleyball
courts, a game room, concession stand, sports shop and a large
second-floor office suite for Spahr and his staff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association has been raising money for the gym and other
improvements for years. Girls paid higher fees and took part in
fund-raisers. A February 1997 association newsletter reported that
girls raised about $56,000 selling trash bags. With the money paid
by parents who did not want to sell bags, nearly $82,000 went into
the building and improvement fund. The association decided to end
fund-raisers last year, Spahr said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1993, the board announced a ``one-time'' building
fee for basketball players. The fee, which some remember as at
least $30, brought the total basketball fee for that year to about
$80. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next year, when the fee remained at $80, parent Linda
Bridges said she complained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When they topped out over $100 a child _ and I had three
(children playing) _ I just said I can't do this any more,'' said
Linda Bridges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after fees hit $140 a player, basketball coach
Steve Singer took his team out of the Johnson County Girls'
program. He started a new league and charges about $70 a girl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson County Girls' fee is ``a huge amount of money in
comparison to what leagues normally cost,'' Singer said. ``The cost
is just way out of line.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bridges said she asked association employees how much of
her fee was going to the new gym, because she wanted to use that
portion as a charitable deduction on her tax return. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end when I was really raising questions, they said all
of the fees are fees and not donations,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How much money the association raised for the gym through higher
fees and fund-raisers is unclear. And unbeknownst to parents who
thought they were paying into the building fund, Spahr told The
Star he spent the money on other improvements at the complex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year when it came time to build the gym, the association
borrowed $3.5 million to cover its cost and a previous $500,000
debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denton, a board member and an experienced contractor, said he
told Spahr to get bids for the gym project. And Denton said Spahr
later told him that he did so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Spahr, in his interview with The Star, said he did not get
bids. Instead, he interviewed several companies and picked one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I canvassed a lot of the people; I looked around,'' Spahr
said. ``I'm not saying I couldn't have got it done cheaper, but you
know, nobody ever takes the lowest bid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr chose the Johnson County firm of Strickland Construction,
and Eric Hughes, a Strickland spokesman, said: ``It is not uncommon
for nonprofit or private businesses to negotiate with only one
contractor on a design/build project.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Skip Hutton, president of the Builders' Association of
Missouri, said most private organizations either get bids or
negotiated contracts, or at least negotiate a builder's profit
margin before construction begins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hutton said he didn't know about the Johnson County Girls'
project, but in his experience as a board member of the nonprofit
United Way: ``If it is any kind of sizable project, there would be
a fiduciary responsibility to spend the money wisely, and you would
want to get some bids.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While IRS rules do not require nonprofits to seek bids on such
projects, a failure to do so makes it harder for officials to prove
they have spent the charity's money wisely, said several experts on
nonprofits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is no bidding it is very bad for an exempt
organization, especially on a project of this scope,'' said Fran
Hill, a University of Miami law professor who is an expert on
nonprofits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Owens, director of the Exempt Organizations Division of
the Internal Revenue Service, would not comment specifically on
Johnson County Girls' Athletic Association but said: ``A bidding
procedure certainly is the classic way of determining the best
price for a particular job.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr said he expected the gym to be self-supporting, with
programs in the building bringing in enough to cover the expected
$28,000 in monthly loan payments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Jack Waters, executive vice president of Exchange National
Bank in Shawnee, which loaned the association the money for the
gym, expressed confidence in its viability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr said the board approved all decisions he made on the gym,
that he and the board were prudent with association funds and that
the building was carefully planned all along the way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said some unanticipated costs _ a $250,000 maple wood floor,
a $100,000 fire wall, $142,000 drop-down baskets and $110,000 water
lines _ increased the price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board of directors knew of this,'' Spahr said. ``The board
agreed to everything, you know, the same way with the financing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the makeup of the board could change soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ayer, the team sponsor, and lawyer Barry Martin said Spahr
contacted them and a third person in recent days and asked them to
serve on an expanded board of directors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ayer said Spahr also agreed to resign from the board while
staying on as executive director. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, Ayer said Spahr had once before agreed to resign from
the board but had changed his mind. &QL;

BUYOUT OF FLOODED PROPERTIES CUTS FINANCIAL RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ Dan and Mary Puhr
returned from a family reunion one day last July and discovered
that a downpour had left their Independence, Mo., yard, three
vehicles and basement in 4 feet of water. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than four months later, it happened again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the Puhrs will turn their house keys over to
Independence as part of a federal buyout program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, spending more than $100 million in federal money, has
used the program more than any other state to get people out of
flood plains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to put our names on the top of the list,'' Puhr
said. ``When we got hit twice in four months, that was a bit much
to take.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 80 property owners in Missouri affected by last year's
floods are selling out, adding to a statewide total of more 4,200
since flooding in 1993. Add in relocations of houses or elevating
them above potential floodwaters, and the total rises to more than
5,200. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's twice as many as the next-highest state, Illinois. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, almost 1,100 properties have been bought out, moved
or elevated since 1993, including many in Johnson and Wyandotte
counties. Only three states had more buyouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has touted Missouri as a
model of flood-plain management. In the long run, buying somebody
out is cheaper for taxpayers than repeatedly paying federal flood
insurance claims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very big push on to eliminate repetitive losses,''
said Bob Shea, who oversees the program for the federal agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, exposed to hundreds of miles of the Mississippi and
Missouri rivers, is more prone to flooding than most states.
``Missouri seized very early on the buyout program,'' Shea said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary buyout program was announced in Kansas City, Mo.,
by President Clinton in late 1993 and became a pet project of Gov.
Mel Carnahan's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State officials have spent more than $100 million in 59
communities swamped in the 1993 and 1995 floods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is to get people out of harm's way,'' said Buck
Katt, assistant director of the Missouri Emergency Management
Agency. ``People's lives have been disrupted too many times.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gene Krase, deputy director for the Kansas Division of Emergency
Services, said buyouts from the 1993 flood greatly eliminated the
need for federal disaster assistance after the 1995 floods,
especially in northeast Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the '95 flood would have triggered another disaster
(declaration) had it not been for the buyout programs,'' Krase
said. ``It absolutely pays.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is happy with the buyouts. Some homeowners say
appraisals are too low. In Alexandria in northeast Missouri, many
of the 40 people who sold in 1993 also had to get federal loans so
they could afford to move. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them wish they hadn't sold, but (the Federal
Emergency Management Agency) came in here with a handful of
money,'' Mayor Bob Davis said. ``It sounded good until they had to
make those $400 or $500 monthly loan payments.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Katt said he could understand that, but ``if that's a bigger
burden than being in an area that floods frequently, they should
stay in the area that floods frequently. It depends on your
priority.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint of some property owners is that if they sell
after having collected on a flood-insurance claim, the amount of
the claim is deducted from the purchase price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to help myself by having flood insurance, but I
felt they were condemning me for having it,'' said Carl Davis,
half-brother of the mayor's. ``I paid premiums for 20 years. The
people who didn't have insurance came out ahead.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Katt said up to five years in premiums were reimbursed to
homeowners who took the buyouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his family moved from Alexandria after the 1993 flood,
but he kept the property. Davis' old home site is an empty lot, as
are three dozen lots the city acquired. Most are vacant, with some
being used as public gardens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of sad what they did _ buying property and turning
it into a ghost town,'' Carl Davis said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Local governments own the bought-out properties but are not
allowed to build permanent structures on them. Some are converted
to parks and athletic fields. The city has to maintain the land,
which no longer generates tax revenue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Carrollton, Mo., about 70 miles east of Kansas City, the city
is buying about seven homes, including the 100-year-old, white
four-room house that Anna Martin is selling reluctantly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a nice patio, a nice garage, and an acre and a half
that looks like a golf course,'' said Martin, who lived there with
her parents in the late 1940s and moved back 10 years ago. ``It was
always Grandma's house.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin said she and her husband decided to sell the house
because they didn't have flood insurance and because fixing it
would cost too much. The price won't be enough to get them into
their next home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It aggravates me we didn't get enough to relocate without
going into debt,'' Martin said. ``I kept thinking someone would
come along with a better idea, but they didn't.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the Federal Emergency Management Agency knows that
selling is difficult, even if voluntary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very emotional issue,'' Shea said. ``It's hard for them
to deal with.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homes in flood plains don't sell for much because of their
location and, sometimes, their condition. Katt said the average
price paid in Missouri is $24,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most people are elated to sell, Katt said. Last year, about
60 people who sold their homes in Cape Girardeau, Mo., in 1993 had
a five-year reunion and fish fry to look back and celebrate, Katt
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You never saw so many people with big smiles on their faces,''
he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An avid supporter of the program is the National Wildlife
Federation, which published a nearly 200-page report last year
called ``Higher Ground.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The point of the study was to show how buyouts can reduce
repetitive-loss claims. Land in 300 communities that were top
candidates for buyouts represents less than 1 percent of federally
insured property nationwide, but makes up almost 50 percent of
repetitive-loss claims, the federation found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With buyouts, you really have a situation that helps people,
is fiscally responsible and benefits the environment,'' said Ben
McNitt, the federation's spokesman. Vacated land can stimulate
habitat for birds and other wildlife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study said that about 100,000 pieces of property _ almost
five times what has been bought since 1993 _ would make sense for
buyouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a long way to go with this,'' McNitt said. ``We
have just begun to see the possible benefits.'' &QL;

VFW PLANS ACTIVITIES FOR 100TH ANNIVERSARY CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Thousands of
brown military overseas caps, along with the blue dresses worn by
members of the VFW's Ladies Auxiliary, will make vivid veterans'
pride in their numbers and their legacy this summer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Aug. 14 through 20 at Bartle Hall, the Veterans of Foreign
Wars will hold its 100th anniversary convention in Kansas City,
where the organization has had its headquarters since 1930. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want, I guess, to brag on ourselves,'' said Thomas Pouliot
of Helena, Mont., the VFW's current commander-in-chief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VFW national conventions are never small. Last year's event in
San Antonio drew 30,000 people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the 100th anniversary gathering will include attractions
that suggest a determined effort to reach beyond the veterans
community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Convention plans currently include an air show at Downtown
Airport, a Kauffman Stadium appearance by singer Kenny Rogers and a
John Philip Sousa concert with the Kansas City Symphony at the
Liberty Memorial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not events we normally have at our convention,''
said Pouliot. ``We are inviting the community to participate in
more ways than in the past.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The VFW also is reminding area residents of its presence on West
34th Street, near Broadway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our headquarters have been here since 1930, and we want the
public here in Kansas City to take part in this convention,'' said
Vern Pall, a Kansas City VFW spokesman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been invited to address the convention's
opening sessions on Aug. 16. However, it has not been confirmed
that he will attend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The veterans' arrival will recall for the larger Kansas City
community the role that American service personnel have played in
the past century's conflicts, Pall added. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been called the `American Century,' '' Pall said.
``Looking at it from the veterans' point of view, they have been
part of this century's greatest moments.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The convention also will focus attention on veterans concerns as
well as maintaining the veteran community's status in Washington
and elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mere arithmetic makes that a challenge./ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 there were 28.2 million veterans in the United States.
Today there are perhaps 25 million. About half the total VFW
membership of almost 2 million is made up of the World War II
generation. Those veterans are dying at the rate of approximately
1,000 a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the VFW membership commands respect on Capitol Hill.
Fortune magazine recently listed the VFW among the top 25 most
powerful membership organizations in the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Veterans were not always so esteemed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the Spanish-American War of 1898 galvanized the country
and made heroes of Theodore Roosevelt and Commodore George Dewey,
the public soon forgot how the rigors of jungle fighting devastated
many veterans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are wrecks for life,'' said the chief surgeon of
the American armed forces. ``Others are candidates for a premature
grave and hundreds will require most careful attention and
treatment before they regain the vigor they lost in Cuba.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The VFW traces its beginnings to 1899, when veterans of action
in Cuba and the Philippines began meeting to form organizations
that would represent them in their quest for pensions and medical
care. At the time, the government provided little of either, even
for those disabled or suffering from tropical diseases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first such group formed in Columbus, Ohio, in September
1899. In 1914 that group consolidated with several others, taking
the VFW name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The organization's first lobbyist was appointed in 1919. During
the 1920s the VFW proved influential in the creation of the U.S.
Veterans Bureau, later to become the Department of Veterans
Affairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1920s the VFW helped Congress pass various acts
that established or increased benefits for Spanish-American War and
World War I veterans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last national VFW convention in Kansas City was in 1931. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman, then Jackson County presiding judge, served as
general chairman. Resolutions approved at the 1931 gathering
included a call for better pensions for widows and orphans of World
War I veterans, as well as adequate hospitalization for all
disabled veterans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time there will be similar priorities, such as the medical
health-care budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the government has come to a crossroads,'' Pouliot
said. ``If there are no additional moneys given this year to our VA
hospitals, medical care and services will begin to be curtailed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The possible use of ground troops by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in Kosovo also will be discussed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At last year's convention, the VFW membership passed a
resolution opposing the use of ground troops in Kosovo. Since then
the start of NATO air strikes against the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic has altered the debate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The VFW's national council of administration recently passed a
resolution stating the VFW believed NATO should use all means
necessary to bring the Yugoslavia action to a successful
conclusion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That would include the ground forces if the NATO military
directors so choose,'' said Pouliot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the resolution will still be on the table in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the body of our organization will review and discuss
this,'' said Pouliot. ``We are a pragmatic organization. Sometimes
we look at an issue and come up with a different decision.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the convention will include discussion of ensuring that
the VFW and its approximately 9,900 posts in the United States and
overseas remain meaningful in their respective communities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Currently VFW members operate food banks, visit senior citizens
and organize essay contests for local students. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that to be relevant in the 21st century, community
service needs to remain an extremely important element,'' said Bill
Smith, the VFW's Washington director for communications and public
affairs.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MORE STRENGTH IN MAY'S LABOR MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   Another strong employment report is
forecast when May's labor market statistics are revealed Friday,
but the news isn't expected to be rosy enough to raise fears of a
Federal Reserve reaction. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The consensus anticipates a gain of 200,000-225,000 jobs for the
economy and a 0.1 percent decline in the unemployment rate, to 4.2
percent. Some analysts predict the jobless rate will remain
unchanged, but that's the worst-case forecast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets and institutions will be closed in observance
of the Memorial Day holiday. &QL; 
Tuesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The April reading of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators
isn't expected to show much of an increase, but if it does eke out
a gain it will be the seventh straight monthly rise. The index,
which is designed to predict economic activity three to nine months
hence, has been signaling at least moderate growth through the rest
of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- The index of the National Association of Purchasing
Management is forecast to have made a respectable gain in May,
rising to 53.5, from April's 52.8 level. The index measures
activity in the manufacturing sector, with any reading above 50
reflecting growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Construction spending is forecast to have edged up in April
by 0.2 percent, but the growth trend shows signs of slowing.
Building outlays surged 2 percent in February, but only 0.5 percent
in March. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is mixed for new home sales in April. A consensus of
leading economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets anticipates a
slight drop in the annual rate, to 900,000. The Merrill Lynch
economic research staff, however, predicts a gain of nearly 2
percent, to an annual rate of 925,000. &QL; 
Thursday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another gain is forecast for factory orders during April, but
not as strong as March. After orders for manufactured goods plunged
1.8 percent in February, the series rebounded with a 2 percent
surge. Most forecasts estimate April's rise at 0.4 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- May sales figures are expected to be reported by major retail
chains. &QL; 
Friday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The employment report's data on the average workweek and average
hourly earnings aren't expected to show much change. The workweek
is likely to have remained the same as the previous month, at 35.5
hours, while hourly earnings are predicted to have edged up 0.2
percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Shakespeare in the park, London style, gets off to its official
start this week when the New Shakespeare Co. raises the figurative
curtain on ``The Merry Wives of Windsor'' Tuesday and ``Twelfth
Night'' on Friday at the Open Air Theater in Regent's Park. The
comedies will play in repertory until the season ends on Sept. 4.
Beginning with previews on July 20, they will be joined by ``A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' and on Aug. 3 by a
children's show, ``The Last Fattybottypuss in the World,'' a
matinee attraction that begins in the park and ends in the London
Zoo. Information: 011- 44-171-486-2431.

<P>
   Surrealist art will fill the Frank Lloyd Wright Rotunda and
several adjoining galleries of the Guggenheim Museum when an
exhibition assembled from two of the most important private
collections of these works opens on Friday for a run through Sept.
12. Trumpeted as the first major New York show of Surrealist art in
30 years, ``Surrealism: Two Private Eyes, the Nesuhi Ertegun and
Daniel Filipacchi Collections'' includes some 700 paintings,
photographs, sculptures, works on paper, books and manuscripts by
artists like Giorgio de Chirico, Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, Frida
Kahlo, Rene Magritte, Joan Miro and Man Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Another Direction
</P>
<P>
   A David Mamet world premiere with a difference beckons playgoers
to the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., beginning on
Friday. The play is ``Boston Marriage.'' What's unusual about this
new work by the author of ``American Buffalo,'' ``Speed-the-Plow''
and ``Oleanna'' is that it is set at the turn of the century, and
it features an all-female cast. The plot deals with two women and
the revelation of the secrets of their relationship. The stars are
Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife), Felicity Huffman and Mary McCann.
Directed by Mamet, ``Boston Marriage'' will play through June 27 at
the Hasty Pudding Theater. Information: (617) 547-8300.
</P>
<P>
   Flights of Fancy
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 150 works of art, many of them grand, exotic objects that
have never previously left their homeland, have been assembled from
34 museums, churches and public institutions throughout Poland for
an exhibition opening on Saturday at the Art Institute of Chicago.
Running through Sept. 6, ``Land of the Winged Horsemen: Art in
Poland 1572-1764'' is billed as the first show of national
treasures of Poland's Baroque era to tour the United States. The
objects include a crown and throne of Polish kings; paintings of
royalty and nobility; liturgical objects, and the hussar armor,
with leopard skins and feathers, that inspired the show's title.
The feathers worn by the Husaria, a heavy cavalry regiment,
produced a fearsome rushing sound as it rode into battle.
Information: (312) 443-3600.

COMMENTARY: THE AMERICAN WAY OF CLASS, A GAME OF SELF-DELUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb.)  (jw) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was pointed out to me recently that the old existential
profundity ``Hell is other people,'' which we used to intone with
such dark fervor, really does better when seen as the basic
principle of comedy or, let's say, comedy at its most aggressive.
Rephrase Jean-Paul Sartre, and you get Dorothy Parker greeting new
visitors with the words ``What fresh hell is this?'' and dubbing
herself and her peers a ladies' auxiliary of the damned.
</P>
<P>
   That Parker tone, with its ironclad brightness, is absolutely
essential to American comedy. Our culture, from the political to
the familial, loves to insist on its cheery, true-hearted
simplicity. And the more this is claimed, the more likely it is
that we have crossed over into the lethally simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   No current movie gets all of this better than ``Election,'' and
no recent movie gets it better than ``Citizen Ruth.'' Both were
written by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor; both were directed by
Payne, and both are set in the Midwest, the nesting place for a
style that can join the benign and the banal, the open-hearted and
the closed-minded, with head-spinning precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' is about social, sexual and generational power
struggles in an Omaha, Neb., high school (the mostly white George
Washington Carver High, named, with a wonderfully pointless sense
of civic duty, for the Negro scientist who discovered so many uses
for the peanut).
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Ruth'' is about how an intensely moral issue _ is one
for or against abortion? _ turns into a bidding war for a female
body, complete with illegal cash contributions and transcendentally
bogus speech making.
</P>
<P>
   Both movies have a crisp, almost claustrophobic look (``Stop
shoving these people, their clothes and their houses in my face,''
you want to say), stay-in-step pacing (as if the camera was helping
to impose conformity on us) and dialogue that hits all the
necessary stops between beatitude and platitude.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the thing about ``Election,'' which, unlike ``Citizen
Ruth,'' is quite a box-office success. Right now, while adults have
good reason to brood over the furies and miseries of adolescence
and the dangers of this or that high school, ``Election'' makes
perfectly clear that adolescence and high school are not just rites
of passage.
</P>
<P>
   In their own crude, scary or (if you're lucky) glittering way,
they prefigure and embody adult life: the power struggles between
teacher and student, framed by the past in the form of parent and
child and by the future in the form of boss and worker; the
alliances and the ruptures; the passionate friendships and
betrayals; the ceaseless negotiating of class and style
distinctions (ethnic and racial ones, too, if they happen to be
available); the seesaw between hormonal imperatives and inhibition;
the perils of unconventional sexual choices. You will probably grow
up to be better at these things. You're certainly not ever going to
be free of them.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the ``Election'' war is Jim McAllister (played by
Matthew Broderick, the perfect emblem of boyishness going rancid).
Jim teaches history, current events and civics and is genially smug
about his desire to impart a real sense of morals and ethics to his
students. On the other side is the bullishly perky Tracy Flick
(Reese Witherspoon). Her calculation and drive enrage him and he is
determined to thwart her election to the Student Council
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Jim has just the kind of smugness that allows a person to be
treacherous and cowardly without thinking ill of himself. (You had
a good reason, you tell yourself, especially if you don't examine
your motives closely.) And as for Tracy, that perkiness has long
been a foolproof cover, especially in the Midwest and the South,
for an ambition that would otherwise look mannishly ruthless and
single-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy has a stage mother _ all the world's a stage in her case _
who regularly writes letters to women like Elizabeth Dole, asking
for advice on how her daughter can be successful in a man's world.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very smart. And so is the Payne-Taylor team's
forthrightness about class.
</P>
<P>
   How do its presumptions and resentments play out? Who can afford
not to think about it? And who has to think about little else?
</P>
<P>
   Tracy is the lower-middle-class daughter of a divorced mother;
her election opponents, Paul and Tammy, are the children of a
cement company owner and his deferential wife (though once Tammy
decides to run for the presidency too, Paul manages to remind her
that she is adopted). Jim McAllister is in the middle, playing one
side against the other. The difference between more privilege and
less often comes down to believing that you are acting decently
when you're not, and pretending that you are acting decently when
you know you're not.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 ``Citizen Ruth'' is starker and meaner about class: as
Ruth Stoops, Laura Dern is an anti-heroine out of Brecht. (``First
feed the face/And then talk right and wrong'' sang the beggars in
``The Threepenny Opera.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ruth is a homeless drug addict (she favors spray paint
inhalation) who has had four children (two were adopted, two went
to her brother) and 16 arrests. She gets taken up in jail by an
anti-abortion group, and while they are busy preparing to make her
a test case in a court battle, she gets spirited away by
abortion-rights advocates who want the same thing. Ruth wants an
abortion, in fact, but when the anti-abortionists offer her money,
she decides to get what she can from whoever will pay, then light
out for the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Men play important roles in both movies, but it is the women who
drive the stories. Not just Tracy, but Tammy, too, the naive young
lesbian who learns to lie and manipulate in her own best interests.
And not just Ruth, but the women around her in both camps,
determined to shape whatever sorry little bits of destiny she may
have.
</P>
<P>
   When D.H. Lawrence described the American character as hard,
isolate, stoic and a killer, he was talking about men, but he might
as well have been describing Tracy Flick. And when we think of the
wild-child outsider who survives by becoming a trickster and con
man, we think of Huck Finn. Well, his descendant is Citizen Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, there is no real territory to light out for
these days. ``That's what's great about America,'' Jim McAllister
says earnestly at one point. ``You can always start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure you can. But you're stuck with the same old self, ready to
reach out and mess everything up the next time, and the time after
that, too.

PROTESTERS SEEK MORE MONEY FOR VETERANS' HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 200 people gathered Sunday in front of the
Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Manhattan to
protest what they called the steady erosion of health-care services
for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The Memorial Day weekend rally was one of about 150 that took
place at medical centers across the United States, organized by
Disabled American Veterans, a national advocacy group, said Albion
Giordano, a supervisor of the organization's New York regional
office.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said the budget for fiscal year 2000 proposed by
President Clinton falls $3 billion short of what is required to
``meet the health-care needs of all veterans.'' The president's
proposal calls for $17.3 billion for health care for veterans,
Giordano's group said.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said the Department of Veterans Affairs' budget has
stayed at the same level for four years, while the population it
serves has been aging and requiring more services. In recent years,
the agency has been consolidating its hospitals and cutting the
number of its beds.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-Long Island, spoke briefly at the rally.
Lazio said that his mother is a veteran and that his wife,
Patricia, had worked as a nurse practitioner in two hospitals for
veterans in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staff reductions and unnecessary hospital closings are the
problems that are most troubling,'' he said. ``The president's
budget is totally inadequate to meet the minimal needs of
veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans said they were concerned that the agency's
hospitals seemed understaffed. Others complained of difficulty
getting appointments and getting to see specialists, and a fear
that hospitals would be consolidated or closed.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Shera, 42, a Navy veteran who served on Grenada, said he
was injured while on duty and is partly paralyzed. He said he was
concerned that the agency might close the Veterans Administration
hospital in Castle Point, near his home in Gardiner, which would
force him to travel farther to get care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dangling this ax of doom over our heads, and I'm tired
of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's simply not enough nursing care to go around,'' said
Paul Tobin, of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, based in
Queens.

BUSH GETS BILL THAT BOOSTS TEACHER PAY, CUTS TAXES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT and R.A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After months of arguing over how to spend the
biggest surplus in state history, the Texas Legislature gave final
approval Sunday night to landmark legislation that will raise
teacher pay, cut taxes and provide a huge boost in education
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush applauded the sweeping legislation, which he
said accomplishes the priorities he laid out on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a message to the people of Texas,'' Bush said. ``I
said, `Let's pay the teachers more money, and let's substantially
cut taxes.' I think this bill will do both.''
</P>
<P>
   The $3.9 billion legislation, Senate Bill 4, provides about $2
billion to boost teacher salaries across the board by $3,000 a
year, and directs $1.3 billion for local school property tax cuts
averaging 6 cents per $100 of property value.
</P>
<P>
   It also attempts to end the practice of social promotion, or
advancing academically unprepared schoolchildren from one grade to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is one of the most significant school finance
bills we've seen in this state,'' said Rep. Paul Sadler,
D-Henderson, one of the chief architects of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said the bill represents a ``heartfelt thank you'' to
Texas teachers, and will set up the most equitable funding system
ever for the public school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will a have a long-lasting impact on our
children,'' Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   The property tax cuts included in the bill vary among school
districts, depending on such factors as a district's property tax
wealth and debt load. In general terms, the legislation funnels to
districts additional state money and then requires them to make a
corresponding reduction in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also limits the discretion of local districts to
raise property taxes. It requires a public vote on increases of 3
cents or more per $100 property value this year, and a public vote
for increases of 6 cents or more next year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes provisions to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spend an estimated $173 million over two years for remedial
classes to help end social promotion. The bill will also require
students to pass the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) in
the third, fifth and eighth grades in order to advance, though a
local board could overrule the decision to hold a child back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide $125 million over two years to fund grants for
enhanced pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and Head Start programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funnel $85 million over two years to school districts to help
ninth-graders at risk of dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   After coming to a logjam and nearly forcing a special session of
the Legislature, House and Senate negotiators finally agreed to the
plan late Saturday. Although the final deal draws elements from
both the House and Senate versions of the school finance
legislation, it most closely resembles the bill adopted by the
Democrat-controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, chairman of the House Committee on Public Education,
refused to yield to Senate demands to use more of the money for tax
relief, saying that the original Senate proposal would have hurt
school districts without providing substantially more tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the negotiations were salvaged by the use of an
extra $100 million _ much of it to be generated by newly passed
lottery legislation _ which allowed negotiators to agree on a
school finance bill containing provisions of the original House and
Senate plans.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery bill would let the lottery commission, rather than
the Legislature, set payout rates. Texas Comptroller Carol Keeton
Rylander said the bill should bring more than $60 million in
additional education money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that we were able to reach an agreement and get our
work done without a special session,'' said Rep. Kent Grusendorf,
R-Arlington, the only Republican among the House negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents the largest increase in education spending in
the history of the state of Texas. And we'll get some tax relief.''

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday this spring my friends Steve, Rich, Kathy and I
decided to go bicycling from midtown to Riverdale. Kathy, who is
from Sarasota, Fla., has been in New York only for six months, and
she and Rich are marrying in June.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at the Morris-Jumel Mansion at West 160th Street and
were outside the gates peering in when the curator came out and
asked if we would like to look around. We said we were on our way
cycling, but she said we would be her free admissions of the day,
so inside we went for a very pleasant tour.
</P>
<P>
   We were continuing up Broadway when we passed a couple of
bagpipers, members of the Emerald Society. Since Rich and Kathy
were looking for bagpipers to play at their wedding, we approached
them. They were off-duty police officers and said they'd be happy
to play, but they didn't have a pen to write down their phone
number. One of the officers took a bullet out of his revolver and
used the lead tip to jot down the number.
</P>
<P>
   We next rode across the Broadway bridge and on our way through
Riverdale passed Wave Hill. We rested near the entrance when a
couple of the guards asked if we would like to go inside. Not
really, we said, but the guards said that admission was free until
noon and that they would watch our bikes. So off we went for
another nice tour.
</P>
<P>
   As we were leaving the Bronx, a community affairs police officer
flagged us down and asked if we wanted to register our bikes in the
police anti-theft program. We declined but appreciated her gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I looked over at Kathy. ``You see,'' I said, ``You didn't
believe us, but we told you New Yorkers were friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   _ LARRY HEROLD

<P>
   Michael Heim was shopping at Williams-Sonoma on the Upper East
Side when he noticed a fashionably dressed woman awkwardly holding
a stainless-steel colander. Would the colander look all right if
left out on the kitchen counter, she asked the saleswoman. Yes, the
saleswoman said, she thought it would be quite attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The customer then asked what else she might buy that would look
good if left out on the kitchen counter. The saleswoman, obviously
recognizing that she had a customer more concerned with appearance
than utility, happily obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   A man I had never met came to my office seeking an impromptu
meeting with my boss. When I told him that she was out, he asked
whether there was another time that day when he might drop by.
While checking her calendar, I received a personal phone call that
I really couldn't put on hold. I tried to speak as softly as I
could _ it concerned the pain I felt at the recent break-up of a
relationship of five and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   I got off the phone and apologized to the man, who appeared to
have heard some of the conversation. I told him that my boss's
schedule was nearly full, and he said perhaps he'd drop by later.
An hour later he appeared. I smiled and told him my boss hadn't yet
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured,'' he said. ``But it looks like someone is having a
bad day.'' And from behind his back, he brought forth three dozen
yellow roses and put them down in front of me, turned around and
left.
</P>
<P>
   He never returned to call up the favor. He just did it to
brighten a life. And so he did.
</P>
<P>
   _ ANONYMOUS
</P>
<P>
   Recent news stories prompted Susan Thaler to recall an incident
when a friend's daughter was in second grade. The child returned
from school and reported that her teacher, who was black, was
``different from you and me.'' Her mother, hoping to nip any
incipient racism in the bud, explained that all people were created
the same, that no one was different from anyone else. To no avail;
her daughter insisted her teacher was different.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, nearing despair, finally asked why the teacher was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has eyes in the back of her head,'' her awestruck daughter
whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Fog grounded a U S Airways flight to Richmond, Va., recently and
the passengers in the aircraft at La Guardia were impatiently
waiting for takeoff. After an hour or so, one of the frustrated
passengers announced that she had a few hundred homemade
chocolate-chip cookies she was taking to a nephew's graduation and
proceeded to distribute them to everyone on board. The woman got a
long round of applause and, according to Selma Goldstein, one of
the recipients, the cookies were delicious.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Lydia Page was on a bus recently when a woman of
about 80 tugged at her elbow. ``I don't mean to intrude,'' she said
as she pointed to a store they were passing. Written in bold
letters on the window were PORNOGRAPHY, VIDEOS and one other
descriptive term. ``I know what pornography is, I know what videos
are,'' the woman said. ``But tell me, what do you think they do in
a CD ROOM?''
</P>
<P>
   JUST MAKE A LIST
</P>
<P>
   A week ago I sat me down
</P>
<P>
   And started, with an earnest frown,
</P>
<P>
   To list the things I had to do,
</P>
<P>
   But as I wrote, the memo grew,
</P>
<P>
   For every time I thought of one,
</P>
<P>
   Six jobs occurred that must be done,
</P>
<P>
   Until the list reached such a length
</P>
<P>
   Just reading it sapped all my strength,
</P>
<P>
   And tasks that once seemed small and light
</P>
<P>
   Weighed heavily in black and white,
</P>
<P>
   Till now my head's in such a spin,
</P>
<P>
   I'm too exhausted to begin.
</P>
<P>
   _ PHYLLIS ROSENTEUR
</P>
<P>
   The driver on the uptown Broadway bus spotted a man entering
from the rear door. Jane Seskin reports that he didn't get angry.
``Sir,'' he said politely. ``Is there any reason you are coming
through the back? Have you forgotten there's a very modest service
charge?''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   A young mother and her 8-year-old daughter entered an uncrowded
M train bound for lower Manhattan. A young deaf man sitting next to
the girl was signing to his friend across from him, who was sitting
next to me.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the girl touched the signing man's shoulder and
pointed to her eye, her heart and her mother. The man smiled and
the mother said, ``Oh, I thought it was like this,'' and pointed to
her eye, hugged herself and then pointed to her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The man smiled again, held up his hand with pinky and thumb
pointing up and explained that this also meant, ``I love you.''
They all smiled.
</P>
<P>
   In the subway, with few words, ``I love you'' was expressed
three times among strangers.

ROBERTO ALOMAR ADDS SKILLS, THRILLS AND VICTORIES TO INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the first Seven Wonders of the World. The Cleveland
Indians have the Eighth, and they are taking him to New York this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Roberto Alomar bunt. Watch him hit a home run. Watch him
steal a base. Most thrilling of all, watch him hurtle through the
air and snare a ground ball or a line drive. You can't watch him
think and teach, but he does those things, too.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar, a second baseman who for 11 years dazzled eyewitnesses
in San Diego, Toronto and Baltimore, has brought his scintillating
act to Cleveland, and he is the primary reason these Indians are
better than the Cleveland teams that won four division
championships and played in two World Series the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   By adding Alomar as a free agent, the Indians completed their
own all-star team: every starter at the eight field positions has
played in the All-Star Game, and the eight players have been named
to All-Star teams a total of 32 times. Lest anyone think their
credentials have faded, they have catapulted the Indians to the
best won-lost record in the major leagues at 32-16 and put them on
course to smash the major league record for runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   With Kenny Lofton, Omar Vizquel and Alomar the first third of
the batting order, the Indians have, in effect, three leadoff
hitters batting before they get to Manny Ramirez, the majors' most
prolific run producer with 60 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   This is the team that will try to knock the Yankees off their
perch as World Series champions and will be at Yankee Stadium
Saturday afternoon to play the Yankees for the first time this
season. Alomar will be the one sprawled in the infield dirt after
making one of his acrobatic snatches of a batted ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie's probably been the reason our team is playing so
well,'' first baseman Jim Thome said last week in Cleveland.
``Obviously by his performance but also his leadership and his
intelligence. You listen to him, he knows what's going on. He knows
what's going to happen when the pitcher's on the mound. He knows
defensively where to play. He's really intelligent when it comes to
baseball. He'll lay a bunt down in a key situation and you look up
and it works out. Call it luck or call it intelligence. I call it
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Hargrove called the 31-year-old Alomar the ``major
difference'' in this year's version of the Indians, saying he is
one of the few players in the majors who make the players around
him better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie has instincts that are almost flawless,'' Hargrove
said. ``He brings an awareness of the game of baseball to the
people around him that not many players can do. Robbie didn't come
in and scream and holler and strut around and be arrogant and say,
`This is the way it's done.' He dispenses his information in bits
and pieces and he does it at the right time. He's very instinctual
about stuff like that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Alomar at the forefront after a year in which he was
reviled in Baltimore for what some saw as less than an honest
effort, the Indians are romping toward another AL Central title,
leading second-place Kansas City by 8 1/2 games. With the Yankees
shorn of their immortality, the Indians right now are the only sure
thing for a first-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   But their efforts to duplicate the Yankees' remarkable run
through the league last season have suffered a setback. When the
Indians won 29 of their first 39 games, the projectionists pulled
out their calculators and determined that the Indians, if they
maintained that pace, could win 120 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox injected a dose of reality into their season
over the weekend, however, sweeping a three-game series in
Cleveland and leaving the Indians with six losses in their last
nine games. Their .667 winning percentage now projects to 108
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Their recent run production has also been down, but the Indians
still lead the league in scoring by a wide margin. Their 6.8 runs a
game, if maintained, would result in a run total that would eclipse
the major league record of 1,067 held by the 1931 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, though, the Indians refused to look ahead at victory
and run totals. Their focus is first on Hargrove's stated goal of
100 victories and second on duplicating the 1998 Yankees'
impressive approach of playing every game as if it would determine
the outcome of the division race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking forward to having a good season and going to
the playoffs,'' Alomar said when asked if he thought the Indians
could match the Yankees' 1998 performance. ``The Yankees have
already done it. You can't compare us with what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four seasons, the Indians have fallen short of the
ultimate goal. They lost the World Series in 1995 and '97 and did
not reach the Series in '96 and '98, years the Yankees won it. The
Indians lost to the Yankees last season in the league playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus was lost a little bit last year,'' Vizquel said.
``We tried to get it back in the playoffs. But it's kind of hard.
Not too many teams can turn it on and off whenever they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove decided to do something about the focus, hoping to
avoid losing it this season. He set a goal of 100 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '97 and '98,'' he said, ``our stated goal was to get in the
post-season and take our chances. That's kind of how our team
played in '97 and '98. We played just good enough to stay ahead of
everybody and get to the post-season. We were accused of being
lethargic and being on cruise control, so I tried to think of a way
to remedy that. I challenged the guys, and they really embraced the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's arrival has fueled the players' response to the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know him before he came here,'' said Vizquel, the
shortstop who is Alomar's partner in middle-infield brilliance.
``He's just a really smart player. He knows a little bit about
everything. He can tell you stuff about the other teams that's
important. It's an awesome feeling. You know he's going to do
something every day to make his team win. He just can do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates gave Alomar credit for making noticeable
improvements in some of the players, particularly Ramirez with his
base running. Ramirez, Hargrove said, has worked hard to make
himself a better outfielder, but Alomar has made him a better base
runner, which is one of the remarkable feats of the season. Ramirez
once stole second base, then retreated to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a little more focused,'' Ramirez said of his efforts
on the bases. ``I've been running more aggressive. Robbie's been
helping me. With Robbie's help, I don't make a lot of mistakes.
Robbie says, `Do this, do that.' I'm trying to correct that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar said he has only wanted to help a good player get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day,'' he related, citing an example of his
instruction to Ramirez, ``I was on third and he was on second.
Somebody hit a fly ball to center field. We had one out. The fly
ball to center field was the second out. I tagged and scored, and
he went to third base and they almost got him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the inning, I told him if it's no outs, it's OK if you
do that. But you have to know the guy has a good arm and if you get
thrown out there's three outs and my run doesn't score.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove cited an example of Alomar's own base running that
helps the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does all the little things,'' the manager said Saturday.
``Yesterday is a perfect example. He's stealing second base, Omar
scores on the passed ball and Robbie goes all the way to third
base. Who else would have done that? He just seems to pick the
right time to do what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's efforts in the field seem to be omnipresent. He
sparkled defensively even in losses to the Red Sox on Friday night
and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning on Saturday, with the Indians ahead, 1-0, on
Alomar's sacrifice fly and a Red Sox runner at first base with one
out, Jose Offerman rapped a grounder between first and second.
Alomar, a seven-time Gold Glove winner, darted to his left, flew
through the air, snatched the ball, spun around and, from his
knees, threw to Vizquel for a forceout at second.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar made two similar flights to his right Friday night. On
one, he snared Trot Nixon's sinking line drive just before it hit
the ground. On the other, he dived in the dirt behind second,
backhanded Offerman's grounder and flipped the ball with his glove
hand to Vizquel, who caught it with his bare hand and in the same
motion fired to first base for what would have been a double play
on anyone but Offerman. ``We've made some good plays, but we
haven't really put on a show like people are expecting,'' Vizquel
had said before the game. That play was a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun watching those two guys because they're so athletic,
so acrobatic, so good at what they do,'' Hargrove said. ``It's fun
watching them in spring training. They take their ground balls and
work on double plays. Then the last five minutes of the session
they start kicking the ball like it's a Hacky Sack and kicking the
ball behind their back. It's amazing how creative they can be and
what they can do with a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As a starting pitcher, Dwight Gooden is an appreciative
beneficiary of the Alomar-Vizquel defensive deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become a fan,'' Gooden said. ``You watch it and you want
more. I've never had a sinker, but this year I'm working on a
sinker so I can get some ground balls.''

SPORTS COLUMN: OVERTIME, TV AND AIR-CONDITIONING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ You can watch some sporting events on television while
doing other things _ reading newspapers, making phone calls,
preparing meals or cleaning up the house. But other telecasts force
you to push everything aside and pull up a chair to shout and stare
at the screen for three or four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-Colorado series for the Western Conference
championship in the Stanley Cup playoffs is such an event. And what
better place to see it on a sunny Sunday afternoon than in a hotel
room here, with the Yankees and Blue Jays playing about a mile
away, near the sailboats and sunbathers of Lake Ontario?
</P>
<P>
   Just draw the curtains, turn up the air conditioning and tell
the operator to hold the phone calls. It's hockey season, darn it.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Canada, you have a choice. You can watch the Fox
telecast on a Buffalo station to enjoy the insightful commentary of
Mike Emrick and John Davidson. And when Fox's ragged visual
presentation becomes too annoying, you can switch to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., which employs producers and directors with a
feel for the rhythm of the game and the proper camera cuts. Too bad
these hotel rooms don't come with two televisions instead of two
beds.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's game, the Avalanche beat the Stars by 7-5 to take a
3-2 lead in the best-of-7-game series. Game 6 is Tuesday night in
Denver. Although Buffalo and Toronto are playing in the Eastern
Conference finals, almost everyone around the NHL agrees that the
Stars-Avalanche match is the true championship, the real World
Series, the match of the two best teams in this spring's
tournament. So why are Buffalo's chances getting better to win the
first cup in Sabres history?
</P>
<P>
   Because Dallas and Colorado are wearing each other out while the
Sabres, leading the Eastern series by 3-1, can clinch their
conference championship by beating the faltering Maple Leafs Monday
night in Air Canada Center. A victory would give Buffalo at least
one more day of rest than the Western winner, four more days if the
Stars win Game 6 and force a Game 7 on Friday night in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek missed the first two games
with a groin injury, he is back and relatively healthy. So is
Miroslav Satan, the Buffalo sniper who missed a month with a foot
injury. The Sabres emerged from Saturday's easy 5-2 victory with no
new injuries. Should they conclude their series quickly, the Sabres
will be fresh for the championship round, which begins either
Friday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the same for the Western winner, whoever it is,
whenever it is. Sunday's 12-goal shootout was partly the result of
the fatigue felt by both teams after Friday night's 3-2 Colorado
victory in overtime, as bruising a game as any fan could ever wish
to witness. Several players are out with injuries and many are
playing hurt.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, as the two teams exchanged rushes, they looked a
little like Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier throwing punches in the
late rounds of the Thrilla in Manila. Unlike the Sabres, who drive
two hours on a highway for road games, the Avalanche and Stars
travel long distances by air, switching time zones between games.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's rare air can shorten the breath from even the
healthiest athletic lungs. As the calendar moves to June, the
season enters its ninth month, its 10th if you count training camp
and exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   So where does a player like Colorado's Peter Forsberg get his
energy? He scored a goal and set up two others Sunday. He leads all
playoff scorers with 23 points. In Friday's game, he went down
screaming with what looked to be a serious shoulder injury. In
Sunday's game, he was back, crashing into Dallas players.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg is an audacious competitor, the top contender for the
Conn Smythe trophy as most valuable player in the playoffs, a
relentless performer in an enthralling series.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is much to complain about regarding the playoffs in
the 1990s. The tournament should be over by now, not in the third
round after Canada celebrates Victoria Day, as the United States
celebrates Memorial Day. With summer near, the ice is often too
mushy. The best teams should meet in the final round, not the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The American telecasts _ and that includes those on ESPN _ are
sloppy and inattentive to important detail. Inside the arenas,
incessant blasts of canned metal music pollute the aural atmosphere
with a fake frenzy that downs out honest cheering.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? Despite all this, a series like
Colorado-Dallas reminds you of why you learned to love hockey's
excitement and drama in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   And a player like Forsberg demonstrates how the very best
players combine skill, courage, stamina and passion in this most
visceral of team sports. You see a player like this, in a series
like this, and you know that, year after year, no matter how shabby
the presentation, you will keep coming back for more, more, more.

EDITORIAL: ON SUMMER'S PORCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 31:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dry resonance at night _ the ticking of insects _
is not as authoritative as it will be in another month. The city
has just begun to seep with heat, and has not yet melted at the
crosswalks. Memorial Day is the porch before the house of summer,
and spring is still latent here, still discernible in what blooms
and has not bloomed, in the constellations that have not yet risen
to midsummer's height.
</P>
<P>
   If summer is the flat light on a dead-calm sea, the haze that
enshrouds the horizon after a week without rain, then this is a
time when wind and water are still freshening, still disturbed by
echoes from a more vehement season.
</P>
<P>
   It is always striking how holidays that begin, in effect, as
legislative events embed themselves in our sense of the year's
natural order, as though they marked a celestial event as
distinctive as a solstice. Memorial Day began as a Grand Army
proclamation in 1868 to coordinate the decoration of the graves of
the Union dead, and it was adopted as an official holiday in 1873
by New York, the first state to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the holiday, and the decorating of graves with
flowers, has embraced the dead from all of America's wars, even as
the day itself has, for many Americans, lost its commemorative
quality.
</P>
<P>
   But to anyone who has ever marched in an old-fashioned,
small-town Memorial Day parade, there is no forgetting the peculiar
stir of feelings this day brings. It is a morning parade, and it
makes its way to a cemetery on the edge of town, a place where
cypress grows against the backdrop of clean-shaven lawns and fields
of new-sprung corn.
</P>
<P>
   An odd moment occurs when the parade arrives at the cemetery,
for the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and the members of the
high-school marching band look on while their elders, evidently
moved though the day is bright and it is not yet noon, honor men _
mostly men _ who barely figure in the minds of the young people
trying to stand at attention. It is always this way, the old
honoring those who died young while the young wait impatiently
nearby, disbelieving in death.
</P>
<P>
   To enter summer with an act of solemnity, however slight,
however quickly dispelled by the long afternoon that follows the
parade, has a certain elemental logic, an emotional fitness.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost an apology for the thoughtless vitality of this
season, a time when the naked exuberance of nature bears the living
away into June and July and forgetfulness. Our job now is to live
out all those summers that were lost to the men and women who died
in wars past, as well as our own summers too. It is no burden to do
so.

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   Questions about money 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Spahr's allies defend his bookkeeping practices and other
actions, he has antagonized many people over the years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, longtime treasurer Pat Vielhauer resigned from the
board. In her resignation letter, Vielhauer complained that she
couldn't get answers from Spahr about finances, the gym project or
other matters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many decisions have been made without board approval or
knowledge of such action being taken,'' wrote Vielhauer. ``Since we
are a nonprofit organization I feel we need to make sure any
actions taken follow the guidelines for a nonprofit
organization.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vielhauer, who was paid about $27,000 a year in her position as
secretary-treasurer, declined to comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missy Phillips, who was fired last June as the association's
director of operations, said Spahr often did not provide her the
information she needed to keep accurate books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much questioned the entire checking account. I'd find
myself saying, `Where is check No. 298?' I could not keep accurate
books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know how much money I was starting with or finishing
with,'' said Phillips, who said she was fired because of false
rumors that she was not doing her job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former facilities manager Jody Gill said he left in 1996 because
he couldn't get answers from Spahr about annual or long-term
budgets. Gill said he felt uncomfortable operating without
financial guidelines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr has brushed aside questions about the association's
operations and finances since he became the central figure in
charge, those around him said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This despite the association's bylaws, filed with the IRS in
1966, that say ``all books and records of the corporation may be
inspected by any member, or his agent or attorney for any proper
purpose at any reasonable time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his only interview with The Star about this story, Spahr
agreed to further interviews and said he would open the
association's books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told you that you can see the books. You can go to the
accountant. I would call the accountant and arrange it,'' Spahr
said. He even offered to share his personal banking records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, Spahr said through the association's
attorney, Tom Kowalski, that he had no time for another interview
and that he would not share financial records. In a letter a few
days later, Kowalski told The Star that Spahr, Denton and Winn had
unanimously denied the newspaper's request to see financial
records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski then asked for a letter explaining the issues that the
newspaper was looking into. Spahr, Denton and Winn did not respond
to the questions raised in the letter, or to further requests from
The Star for comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The backbone of philanthropy is the public trust and
accountability,'' said Dan Langan, spokesman for the National
Charities Information Bureau. ``It is really up to the organization
to allay any doubts that the public has.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association has released only the 990s, the federal tax
forms for nonprofits, that are public record under IRS
regulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the 990 tax forms makes it difficult to track the
group's finances, because its expenses vary widely from year to
year. For example, the group told the IRS it spent $213 for
miscellaneous expenses in its 1993 fiscal year and $107,066 in
1996. Insurance cost $14,836 in 1995, about a third of the reported
$41,350 from two years earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 990, which covers most of calendar year 1998, was not
available, but an accountant's report indicated the association's
expenses exceeded revenue by nearly $64,000. Expenditures also
topped revenues by about $6,000 in 1995. The group recorded a
surplus of nearly $110,000 in 1996. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association's accountants, Bridges &AMP; Co. CPAs, said the
group's most recent financial statements were not audited. A
January letter from the firm, obtained by The Star, said the
association ``elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures
and the statement of cash flows required by generally accepted
accounting principles.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certified public accountant Wayne Bridges said the letter means
``we took the stuff they gave us and put it in the form of
financial statements.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The charity watchdog group urges nonprofits to prepare detailed
annual budgets and release audited financial statements. The Olathe
(Kan.) Girls Softball Association and Wyandotte County Sports
Association said they do audits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County Girls' is not required to audit its finances,
though, and the 3&AMP;2 Baseball Club and North Kansas City (Mo.) Area
Baseball said they do not do audits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Sherinsky, a technical expert at the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, said the level of review used by
Johnson County Girls' Athletic Association provides no fiscal
assurances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another money issue involves numbers from last summer's national
18 and under American Fastpitch Association tournament held at the
complex. Spahr told board members and The Star that he collected
$11,238.07 in gate revenues for the six-day tournament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Toeneboehn, who was Spahr's tournament director at the time,
estimated attendance could have been as high as 2,000 a day. He
said the stands were full, even during the middle of the night when
teams played make-up games because of rain. Admission fees should
have been $30,000 or higher, he said. Others agreed, including Ed
Serdar, an American Fastpitch regional director in Illinois who has
been a host for similar tournaments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr would not discuss questions about the gate. &QL;

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   Deepening debt 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is in the building of the gymnasium that the issues of
consolidation of power and money come together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr told reporters in March the gym would cost $2.6 million to
$3.5 million. It will feature four basketball or eight volleyball
courts, a game room, concession stand, sports shop and a large
second-floor office suite for Spahr and his staff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The association has been raising money for the gym and other
improvements for years. Girls paid higher fees and took part in
fund-raisers. A February 1997 association newsletter reported that
girls raised about $56,000 selling trash bags. With the money paid
by parents who did not want to sell bags, nearly $82,000 went into
the building and improvement fund. The association decided to end
fund-raisers last year, Spahr said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1993, the board announced a ``one-time'' building
fee for basketball players. The fee, which some remember as at
least $30, brought the total basketball fee for that year to about
$80. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next year, when the fee remained at $80, parent Linda
Bridges said she complained. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When they topped out over $100 a child _ and I had three
(children playing) _ I just said I can't do this any more,'' said
Linda Bridges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, after fees hit $140 a player, basketball coach
Steve Singer took his team out of the Johnson County Girls'
program. He started a new league and charges about $70 a girl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson County Girls' fee is ``a huge amount of money in
comparison to what leagues normally cost,'' Singer said. ``The cost
is just way out of line.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bridges said she asked association employees how much of
her fee was going to the new gym, because she wanted to use that
portion as a charitable deduction on her tax return. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end when I was really raising questions, they said all
of the fees are fees and not donations,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How much money the association raised for the gym through higher
fees and fund-raisers is unclear. And unbeknownst to parents who
thought they were paying into the building fund, Spahr told The
Star he spent the money on other improvements at the complex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year when it came time to build the gym, the association
borrowed $3.5 million to cover its cost and a previous $500,000
debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denton, a board member and an experienced contractor, said he
told Spahr to get bids for the gym project. And Denton said Spahr
later told him that he did so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Spahr, in his interview with The Star, said he did not get
bids. Instead, he interviewed several companies and picked one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I canvassed a lot of the people; I looked around,'' Spahr
said. ``I'm not saying I couldn't have got it done cheaper, but you
know, nobody ever takes the lowest bid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr chose the Johnson County firm of Strickland Construction,
and Eric Hughes, a Strickland spokesman, said: ``It is not uncommon
for nonprofit or private businesses to negotiate with only one
contractor on a design/build project.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Skip Hutton, president of the Builders' Association of
Missouri, said most private organizations either get bids or
negotiated contracts, or at least negotiate a builder's profit
margin before construction begins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hutton said he didn't know about the Johnson County Girls'
project, but in his experience as a board member of the nonprofit
United Way: ``If it is any kind of sizable project, there would be
a fiduciary responsibility to spend the money wisely, and you would
want to get some bids.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While IRS rules do not require nonprofits to seek bids on such
projects, a failure to do so makes it harder for officials to prove
they have spent the charity's money wisely, said several experts on
nonprofits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is no bidding it is very bad for an exempt
organization, especially on a project of this scope,'' said Fran
Hill, a University of Miami law professor who is an expert on
nonprofits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Owens, director of the Exempt Organizations Division of
the Internal Revenue Service, would not comment specifically on
Johnson County Girls' Athletic Association but said: ``A bidding
procedure certainly is the classic way of determining the best
price for a particular job.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr said he expected the gym to be self-supporting, with
programs in the building bringing in enough to cover the expected
$28,000 in monthly loan payments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Jack Waters, executive vice president of Exchange National
Bank in Shawnee, which loaned the association the money for the
gym, expressed confidence in its viability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spahr said the board approved all decisions he made on the gym,
that he and the board were prudent with association funds and that
the building was carefully planned all along the way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said some unanticipated costs _ a $250,000 maple wood floor,
a $100,000 fire wall, $142,000 drop-down baskets and $110,000 water
lines _ increased the price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board of directors knew of this,'' Spahr said. ``The board
agreed to everything, you know, the same way with the financing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the makeup of the board could change soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ayer, the team sponsor, and lawyer Barry Martin said Spahr
contacted them and a third person in recent days and asked them to
serve on an expanded board of directors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ayer said Spahr also agreed to resign from the board while
staying on as executive director. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, Ayer said Spahr had once before agreed to resign from
the board but had changed his mind. &QL;

EDITORIAL: TEACHING HOSPITALS IN TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 31:
</P>
<P>
   The nation's teaching hospitals are facing deep financial
trouble, brought on by the growth of managed care and cost-cutting
measures in government health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can help by restoring some cuts made to Medicare
funding in 1997 that squeezed these institutions severely. But
their long-term financial health will depend on new ways of
financing their special missions. They also should be required to
live by reasonable cost controls.
</P>
<P>
   All hospitals are facing the same pressures, chiefly cuts in
government payments and managed care's demand for lower hospital
fees and shorter hospital stays. Most have responded by reducing
staff and merging with other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals have also taken these steps, but their
problems are compounded by the extra obligations that teaching
hospitals have long assumed _ training new doctors, conducting
medical research and providing charity care for the poor. These
functions have traditionally been indirectly underwritten in part
by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care has changed that by making it much harder to pass
along charity care and education costs through higher fees. At the
same time, these hospitals have been especially hard hit by
government cuts because they derive much of their revenue from
Medicaid and Medicare patients. These pressures are especially
severe in in New York City, which has the nation's largest
concentration of teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   City hospitals have cut their staffs by 10 percent since 1993.
Still, Gov. George Pataki has proposed trimming roughly $150
million in state Medicaid payments to hospitals in the new fiscal
year, and the Clinton administration is also proposing further
Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst blow comes from the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. That
law has produced the welcome and unexpected result of actually
cutting Medicare expenditures in the first half of this fiscal
year. But it also had a disproportionate impact on teaching
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Among other cost controls, the law sharply cut the federal
subsidy for graduate medical education that is financed as part of
Medicare. By 2002, when all the cuts are fully phased in, New York
state hospitals will have lost $5 billion in federal revenue, with
$3 billion of that squeezed out of the metropolitan area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan introduced legislation that would
reduce some of the damage. One bill would freeze the graduate
medical education subsidy, rather than allow further annual
reductions for the next two years, as required under the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   That would save teaching hospitals $3 billion in losses over
five years. Another bill would take the federal subsidies for
serving low-income patients that are included in payments to
Medicare managed-care plans and redirect the money to the hospitals
that provide the care. In theory, Medicare HMOs pass on the subsidy
to the hospitals, but in practice they often do not. A similar bill
would redirect the subsidy for training nurses from Medicare HMOs
to teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should make these adjustments without unraveling other
cost-containment measures of the 1997 law. Moynihan has also
proposed broader legislation that would spread the burden of paying
for medical education.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would establish a separate medical education trust fund
that would be financed by a fee levied on private health insurance
premiums, as well as contributions from Medicaid and Medicare. The
bill calls for an advisory commission to debate alternative
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to be done to shore up this key part of the
nation's biomedical infrastructure. Simply plugging holes in the
current patchwork of funding will not ensure stability for the
future.

 &HT;    Double duty at the tracks proves too much for Stewart
 &HT;    (EDS: UPDATES STORY to include Stewart's second race of the
day.)
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. and CONCORD, N.C. _ Tony Stewart barely
completed his auto-racing doubleheader on Sunday, leaving Lowe's
Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., in an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 28, became the first driver to complete both the
Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race in the same day. In
all, he completed 596 laps, 1,090 miles and 2,384 left-hand turns.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was 10 miles short of his goal of 1,100 after enduring
handling problems in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Stewart already logged 196 laps and 490
miles, and he still faced the prospect of doing it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the 1997 Indy Racing League champion, finished ninth in
the Indianapolis 500, four laps behind winner Kenny Brack, who took
the victory after leader Robby Gordon ran out of fuel with one lap
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart finished fourth in the Coca-Cola 600, the longest race
on the Winston Cup schedule, behind winner Jeff Burton, Joe Gibbs
Racing teammate Bobby Labonte and Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stewart) was spectacular,'' Martin said. ``He's been that way
all year. It looks like we're all going to be chasing Tony before
too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart completed both races after two other drivers attempted
the feat and failed. Winston Cup driver John Andretti finished 10th
in the Indy 500 in 1994, but then he crashed in the NASCAR race
before the finish. Robby Gordon tried it in 1997, but the Indy 500
was postponed two days because of inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   After crossing the finish line in Indianapolis on Sunday,
Stewart boarded an airplane and flew to Concord, where he ran in
Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a driver, I wanted to win the race,'' Stewart said of the
Indy 500. ``Anything short of winning was a disappointment. We did
everything we could. We fought hard all day. We did the best with
what we had, and we just missed the setup a little bit. ...
Considering all the variables that were against us before we
started this project, and to see how everything has come together,
I'm thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   In Concord, Stewart started in the back of the field because he
missed the drivers' meeting, but he made his way to the front of
the 43-car field quickly. Over the final few laps, Stewart
complained of being ill and was immediately transported to the
infield care center when he finished.
</P>
<P>
   During the month of May, Stewart faced a daunting schedule. He
made 14 trips between Charlotte and Indianapolis, logging 5,208
nautical miles. His logistical nightmare Sunday included three
airplanes, two helicopters, eight golf carts, four cars and one
Navigator transporter to move Stewart and his support team of 51
people between the two tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't bothered me because we understood from day 1 that
the main priority was Winston Cup,'' Curry said. ``It was a
challenge, but I think we made the most of his time (in
Indianapolis).''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a closer look at Stewart's long day behind the wheel,
which started around 9:30 a.m. and didn't end until after 10:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   1:01 a.m. _ Gates open at Indianapolis Motor Speedway for crew
members and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   5:15 a.m. _ Stewart's crew members arrive at IMS to install
tethering system to left rear tire. The Indy Racing League
announced this week that the safety device, two small cables
attached to the butterfly suspension of the wheels, would be
required.
</P>
<P>
   6:15 a.m. _ Curry, co-owner of Tristar Motorsports and Stewart's
crew chief, arrives at IMS.
</P>
<P>
   8:45 a.m. _ Stewart's No. 22 Dallara/Oldsmobile Aurora Indy car
leaves garage No. 15 for pre-race inspection.
</P>
<P>
   8:49 a.m. _ Mechanic Bill Harmon steers Stewart's car onto
Gasoline Alley for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   8:53 a.m. _ Stewart's car is seventh in line for pre-race
inspection. Stewart's orange car is dominated by stickers of its
primary sponsor, Home Depot. Among the familiar sponsors, though,
is one very unfamiliar name: Lee Kissick, CPA. Kissick is Curry's
brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   9:03 a.m. _ Car rolls into inspection. Forteen inspectors
measure the car's height, width from tire to tire and weight. Six
of Stewart's crew members watch intensely as the car is closely
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   9:10 a.m. _ Car passes inspection and is pulled to pit road by a
riding lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   9:15 a.m. _ Car stops at pit stall No. 26, between the cars of
Steve Knapp and Roberto Moreno. Stewart's car is nine stalls to the
left of the start/finish line. ``I think we've got a good shot at
winning it,'' said Case Leeuwenberg, of Wilmington, N.C., one of
Stewart's seven mechanics. ``I really do. We've got a good car.
He's got to be patient, but you can't be to cautious because you'll
get lapped here.''
</P>
<P>
   9:30 a.m. _ Stewart wakes up in his motorhome parked in the
infield of IMS. He doesn't eat breakfast, but later has cereal and
fruit in garage area. ``We call it `Tony time,''' Curry said.
``He'll show up 10 minutes before the race and climb in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   9:49 p.m. _ Stewart's crew practices pit stops on pit road. The
first pit stop is its best at 7.56 seconds, but the drill gun on
the right-rear tire sticks. The second stop is 8.6 seconds, and the
third is 7.69.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m. _ Every car is given a six-minute engine warm-up on pit
road, and then the cars are refueled.
</P>
<P>
   10:17 a.m. _ Stewart is examined by Dr. Henry Bock, director of
medical affairs for the speedway and IRL. Stewart's blood pressure,
heart rate and weight are taken. He weighs in at 155 pounds. ``He's
in good spirits,'' said Krista Dwyer, Stewart's fiance. ``We got up
a little earlier than we normally do, but we didn't really do
anything different.'' Stewart is engaged to be married May 6 in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   10:24 a.m. _ Stewart arrives at his garage, wearing blue jeans
and a Home Depot shirt. He meets with Curry and other team members.
</P>
<P>
   11:25 a.m. _ Stewart makes way to pit road for driver
introductions. ``This is the most relaxed I've ever been going into
a 500-mile race,'' Stewart says. ``I woke up this morning and
didn't have a single butterfly. I went through the drivers intros
and didn't have a single butterfly then, either. I have a good
feeling about today.''
</P>
<P>
   11:45 a.m. _ According to Firestone Tire engineers, air
temperature is 85 degrees, but temperature on the track is 111
degrees. ``My job is just driving the race car,'' Stewart says.
``We don't have to worry about the one variable we couldn't do
anything about today, and that was the weather. It's great in Indy,
and it's supposed to be great in Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   11:51 a.m. _ Indianapolis Motor Speedway chairman Mari Hulman
George gives ``Gentleman, start your engines'' command. All 33 cars
on grid are fired and running immediately after command.
</P>
<P>
   11:52 a.m. _ Cars roll from grid for first parade lap.
</P>
<P>
   12:01 p.m. _ Green flag falls and pole-sitter Arie Luyendyk
takes lead in turn one. For fifth consecutive year, field came to
the line for the start without a full stable of cars as Jack
Miller's No. 17 car and Scott Sharp's No. 2 car failed to take the
green because of mechanical problems. Stewart starts on the outside
of the eighth row, 24th overall.
</P>
<P>
   12:07 p.m. _ First caution of the race comes after Eliseo
Salazar crashes in turn two of the ninth lap. Stewart climbed four
spots to 20th in the first eight laps, trailing leader Luyendyk by
18.288 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   12:26 p.m. _ Stewart passes Roberto Guerrero, Steve Knapp, Buddy
Lazier and Robbie Buhl to move into 17th, about 14 seconds behind
Luyendyk.
</P>
<P>
   12:33 p.m. _ Leaders begin to take first green-flag pit stops on
lap 31. Kenny Brack takes four tires and fuel on lap 31, and Billy
Boat, Luyendyk, Gordon and Greg Ray follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   12:35 p.m. _ Stewart gets his first big break of the race when
he remains on the track while most of the leaders make pit stops.
The move pays off, as Hideshi Matsuda apparently runs out of gas on
lap 35 and stalls in the short chute between turns 3 and 4. On lap
37 under caution, Stewart's crew changes four tires and refuels in
16 seconds. The crew also makes a slight adjustment to the chassis.
Stewart climbs from 17th to fifth after the restart on lap 39.
</P>
<P>
   12:46 p.m. _ Ray takes lead from Luyendyk on lap 45. Stewart is
fifth behind Ray, Luyendyk, Sam Schmidt and Brack. Stewart moves to
fourth when Schmidt crashes 17 laps later.
</P>
<P>
   1:03 p.m. _ Stewart makes second pit stop on lap 64. He gets
four new tires and fuel, and the crew changes the height of the
``wicker bill,'' attempting to get more downforce. The longer pit
stop costs Stewart two track positions and he falls to seventh.
</P>
<P>
   1:31 p.m. _ Stewart makes third pit stop on lap 95. The crew
again changes the ``wicker bill'' and tire pressure because Stewart
is complaining that the car is ``too tight.'' Stewart comes out of
the pit stops in 10th place. But his car is later damaged by a
mistake in the pits. While working on the Dallara Oldsmobile
Aurora, the crew released the jack
</P>
<P>
   too soon and slightly damaged the car. ``After that, you're in a
survival mode,'' Curry said. ``You just want to get the car home.
I'm disappointed in the fact we made that mistake. We would have
been the fourth or fifth or sixth car.''
</P>
<P>
   3:17 p.m. _ Indy 500 finishes when Brack crosses finish line.
Stewart finishes ninth, four laps behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   3:19 p.m. _After crossing the finish line at Indy, Stewart
sprints to his motorhome, showers and changes into a red T-shirt
and blue jeans. He then returns to his garage to thank his crew and
Curry. Stewart also is evaluated by Dr. Bock, who says Stewart lost
2 1/2 pounds but doesn't need to take fluids intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   4:02 p.m. _ Stewart is whisked away in a golf cart to a
helicopter, waiting on the infield near the third turn for a
three-minute ride to the Indianapolis Airport.
</P>
<P>
   4:12 p.m. _ Stewart arrives at the airport, where Home Depot,
his sponsor, has its Falcon VIP jet waiting for the 50-minute
flight to Concord. Aboard the plane, Stewart changed into his
NASCAR racing suit, ate a Power Bar and sipped Powerade and water.
He complained of a blister on his right hand from the steering
wheel and another blister on his right knee from the steering
column. And he even admitted he was a bit tired. ``That's to be
expected after a 500-mile race,'' Stewart said. ``I'm really
excited, though. I thought I'd feel a lot more fatigued. I think
after an hour's sleep, I'll be fine.'' With that, Stewart caught a
short nap in the back of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   4:15 p.m. _ Mandatory drivers' meeting at Lowe's begins _
without Stewart. That means Stewart, who qualified 27th for the
race, will have to start the Coca-Cola 600 at the rear of the field
in the 43rd position.
</P>
<P>
   4:21 p.m. _ Stewart's plane leaves ground.
</P>
<P>
   4:48 p.m. _ Stewart's entourage arrives at the speedway in a
Navigator limousine. After reaching the infield of the track,
Lowe's officials force them to remove the Home Depot decals from
their vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   5:37 p.m. _ Stewart's plane reaches gate at Concord Regional
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   5:42 p.m. _ Stewart boards Winston Cup driver Rusty Wallace's
Bell 407 helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   5:50 p.m. _ The six-seat helicopter lands on the TBS logo just
past the start-finish line. Stewart jumps in a Chevy Camaro for
driver introductions.
</P>
<P>
   5:57 p.m. _ Stewart climbs into his No. 20 Pontiac after a brief
conversation with owner Joe Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   6:08 p.m. _ Speedway Motorsports Inc. president Bruton Smith
delivers the ``Gentleman, start your engines'' command.
</P>
<P>
   6:12 p.m. _ The 43-car field rolls off the grid.
</P>
<P>
   6:15 p.m. _ The green flag falls and Stewart faces 600 more
miles and 1,600 left-hand turns.
</P>
<P>
   6:19 p.m. _ Stewart passes three cars in the first two laps.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   7:01 p.m. _ Stewart makes his first green-flag pit stop and a
succesful one in only 18.6 seconds on lap 68. He led one lap after
staying on the track longer than the other leaders, and comes off

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A WAR HERO APPEALS TO THE NONCOMBATANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a theory for a presidential campaign: Take a prominent
Republican senator and war hero, who once underwent enormous
suffering for his country, and voters weary of moral relativism
will leap at the chance to have a chief executive they can really
look up to. Sen. John McCain of Arizona is trying out the scenario
this year, undeterred by the fact that it failed completely for Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, of course, was probably the worst campaigner since John
Quincy Adams or, at least, Michael Dukakis. But his defeat was also
a sign of changing times. A product of the World War II generation,
Dole never seemed to grasp the fact that he was addressing a nation
of noncombatants, most of whom either avoided the draft, were not
eligible, or did not remember that it ever existed. Dole suffered
permanent disability after he was shelled in Italy as a young
draftee, and his campaign carried an implicit, and perhaps
unwelcome, message of guilt _ how could we not elect him, after all
he did for us?
</P>
<P>
   McCain was a 31-year-old Annapolis graduate when he was shot
down over North Vietnam in 1967. He remained a prisoner of war for
more than five years, and he was tortured by his captors, who hung
him from his broken arms. It is an excruciating story to hear, and
the McCain camp offers potential supporters any number of ways to
hear it. But the candidate himself seldom brings it up, and he
makes some effort to point out that he was not a victim. ``I was a
professional,'' he says. ``I wanted to go.'' He seems to understand
how to talk about his war experience to an electorate with a
dwindling population of veterans, and a large number of voters who
might interpret an intense show of emotion as implicit criticism of
their failure to serve. When he mentions his time in the POW camp,
his tone is generally cool and detached. He dismisses the more
effusive tributes with an ironic reference to how little brains it
takes for a pilot to get his plane shot down. He has always shied
away from the bitter side of the Vietnam experience, standing next
to Bill Clinton when the president announced he was granting
Vietnam full diplomatic recognition in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain becomes a serious presidential contender only if
George W. Bush stumbles, and he says that if he wins the
nomination, it will be because of his leadership in the Senate on
issues like campaign finance reform and national defense. He is a
very attractive candidate in a field that is full of automotons and
fire-eaters, although many people who like his forthright manner
may find his conservative voting record hard to swallow. There is
also a man's-man quality to him that could rattle the gender gap.
(A Seattle newspaper recently quoted McCain as calling Leonardo
DiCaprio ``an androgynous wimp.'')
</P>
<P>
   But whether he wins or not, the senator is a bridge candidate, a
symbol of the new way America has begun to think about the
military. After World War II, politics was dominated by veterans,
and politicians who did not serve felt constrained to apologize or
compensate. John Kennedy _ who never stressed that it did not take
much brains to sink a PT boat _ had surrogates remind the voters
that Hubert Humphrey stayed home with a medical exemption. Lyndon
Johnson used his clout as a congressman to get into a fighter plane
over New Guinea so he could tell the public he had been in combat.
Ronald Reagan gradually adopted his film personas and spoke as if
he had spent the war in Europe instead of an Army film unit. As the
Vietnam-era generation assumed power, the political dialogue
continued along the same lines, and candidates argued about Bill
Clinton's draft exemption and Dan Quayle's stint in the Indiana
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of American history, the nation was governed by
lawyers who had never served in the military, and the public
regarded soldiering as a career choice rather than a patriotic
duty. Without much noticing, we have returned to that pattern.
Neither the current secretary of state or secretary of defense had
military experience. Only a third of the members of Congress are
veterans, down from 75 percent in 1971. McCain says the senators
who served in Vietnam feel a special bond, but the bonds do not
have to stretch very far _ there are only six of them.
</P>
<P>
   If this campaign winds up focusing on McCain, we will debate
again the issue of whether military valor translates into
presidential character. If he loses, the subject may never come up
again in our lifetimes. Except for Al Gore, who worked as a
journalist for the Army in Vietnam, the rest of the pack of
presidential candidates is virtually veteran-free. George W. Bush,
Bill Bradley and Steve Forbes, like Dan Quayle, worked off their
draft eligibility as reservists. Younger candidates, like John
Kasich, graduated from college after the draft was abolished in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very rarely do I hear a discussion about Vietnam anymore,''
McCain says, directing the conversation away from the old debate
about how men who fought in the war should feel about the men who
did not. ``I just kind of think it's passe _ it's been a long
time.''

JOAO CARLOS DE OLIVEIRA, 45, HELD TRIPLE JUMP WORLD RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joao Carlos de Oliveira, a Brazilian sports hero who held the
world triple jump record for a decade, died Saturday at
Beneficencia Portuguesa Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was 45.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira, who lived in Pindamonhangaba, in Sao Paulo state,
was suffering from pneumonia, hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver
that caused internal bleeding, the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira won the triple jump at the Pan American Games in
Mexico City in 1975 with a distance of 58 feet 8\ inches, beating
the previous world record of 57-2{. The record was set at an
altitude of 7,550 feet, with reduced air resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The record stood until Willie Banks of the United States leaped
58-11{ at the USA/Mobil outdoor track and field championships in
Indianapolis on June 16, 1985. Banks' mark, at an altitude of 700
feet, also stood for 10 years. The current record is held by
Jonathan Edwards of Britain, who jumped 59 feet in July 1995 at
Salamanca, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira won bronze medals at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal
and the 1980 Games in Moscow and captured gold at the World Cup in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   His athletic career came to an end in December 1981, when his
right leg was amputated below the knee after his car was hit
head-on by a drunken driver being chased by the police going the
wrong way at night on a highway in Campinas, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira was twice elected a state deputy in 1986 and 1990
but confronted financial problems afterward when business ventures
foundered. Unemployed since he left public office, de Oliveira had
been living on a monthly pension of about $700, according to local
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, de Oliveira announced that he would train for the
long jump at the Paralympic Games for disabled athletes in Sydney,
Australia, in 2000, when he would be aided by an artificial leg.
But he abandoned training earlier this year amid illness and
depression, friends said. The weekly magazine Epoca said he had
been plagued by heavy drinking, which his family denied.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira's body was taken Sunday to Sao Paulo's state
Assembly, where he once served.

AT LEAST FOR A GAME, `CURSE OF REGGIE' LIFTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ No Reggie time _ not this time. No 3-point
rainbow to bury the Knicks. This time if Reggie Miller wanted to
put both hands in that taunting choke hold, they would have to grab
his own throat and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario was familiar, 12.4 seconds left and the Indiana
Pacers down by two points, 90-88. All 16,575 fans at the Market
Square Arena knew where the ball was going; so did the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew you had to prevent Reggie from getting the shot,''
Allan Houston said. Well, they didn't and they did.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who zigzagged with Houston through the lane and off an
Antonio Davis pick, took the pass on the left wing. He turned and
saw something stunning. Houston had stayed close and, like a
mountain on three wobbly wheels, Patrick Ewing lurched at him too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick has seen that play 200 times,'' Miller said of Ewing's
move toward him. ``Injured or not, he knows the game of basketball.
It was a good hedge.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot went up. The ball rimmed out. The breath of the crowd
blew out and the Knicks nailed three free throws in the closing
seconds to win, 93-90. The curse of Reggie Miller had been lifted _
at least momentarily _ so that the Knicks could take a 1-0 lead in
the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ewing said it hurt to hobble so far away from the basket.
But he did it again on Indiana's final play, flashing in front of
Miller, forcing the Pacers to pass the ball to Mark Jackson, who
missed a 3-pointer to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He killed us so many times by hitting big threes,'' Ewing
said. ``We started trapping him. If they were going to beat us,
it's got to be somebody else. You just have to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Miller had no excuses. He finished with 19 points on
7-of-13 shooting. Solid, but no pyrotechnics _ no eight points in
8.9 seconds to win the game as he had done in 1995. No 3-pointer
with 5.1 seconds left to send the game in overtime, which he did
last last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good look at the basket and that's all you can ask,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have thrown in the towel, but they didn't,'' Miller
said of the Knicks. ``It was a good topsy-turvy game.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the theme and tone in the Indiana locker room afterward
was what you would expect from a veteran team that had won seven
straight playoff games. Coach Larry Bird expected his team to be
rusty after a week off and the Pacers were. They got outrun in
transition in the first half by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes, we gave up a lot of fast-break
points,'' Bird said of the 18 breakaway points the Knicks scored to
take a 44-40 halftime lead. ``We want to play in a half-court
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Dale and Antonio Davis, the Pacers found their legs, and
Rik Smits helped them find the lead with four minutes left in the
game. The Davises combined for 17 points and seven rebounds in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the opportunities to put them away but we just couldn't
finish,'' Dale Davis said. ``This loss hurts but it is a long
series. We will be all right in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits, the big center, scored eight of his 12 points in the
fourth quarter, but fouled out with 1:27 left in the game. His
absence down the stretch allowed the Knicks to pull the noose
tighter around Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been in there we probably would have run a different
set with a two-man game with myself and Rik,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Pacers have lost the home-court advantage _ at
least temporarily. They know the sorely need to win the game here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts a lot of pressure on us, but we're a veteran team,
there's no panic here,'' said Mark Jackson, who had 11 assists but
only six points and was 1 of 8 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, who lost his sixth-man duel with Latrell Sprewell,
confessed that the Knicks had won an important game. He had eight
points to Sprewell's 16, but he was hardly downcast about the
Pacers' prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we know there won't be a sweep in this series,'' said
Rose. ``We'll get him here Tuesday and then start all over in New
York.''

STANDISH F. MEDINA JR., 58, LAWYER WHO OFTEN AVOIDED TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standish Forde Medina Jr., a leading trial lawyer who
made a name for himself by resolving disputes so that clients could
avoid trial, died Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering hospital in
Manhattan. Medina, who had residences in Manhattan, Westhampton,
N.Y., and Washington, Conn., was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, according to his widow, Kathryn Bach
Medina, division vice president and executive editor at Random
House.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3 inches tall, with a resonant voice and a playful
wit, Medina, known as Forde to friends, was a striking figure. ``He
was big, enthusiastic and lusty in the most gentlemanly way,'' said
Barbara Paul Robinson, a friend and a partner at Debevoise &AMP;
Plimpton, a 450-member law firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He specialized in the toughest cases in the often arcane world
of securities and class-action law. Euromoney magazine listed him
in 1997 as one of the world's 600 leading litigators. ``He loved
the law,'' said Martin F. Evans, the firm's presiding partner.
``People would come into the office early in the morning and he
would already have analyzed the previous day's proceedings and
prepared detailed to-do lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Among colleagues, Medina was known for bringing order to a
years-long complex of insurance company cases in which
policyholders accused New York Life, Phoenix, Transamerica and
Hancock of unfair sales practices. Medina, representing the
insurance companies, helped design a process that brought automatic
relief for some policyholders and accelerated arbitration for
others, thus avoiding lengthy litigation for all parties.
</P>
<P>
   The law ran in the family. Medina was the grandson of Harold R.
Medina, a federal judge for more than three decades, who was best
known for his handling of the trial of 11 communist leaders in the
1940s. Like his grandfather; uncle, Harold Jr., and father,
Standish, Medina graduated from Princeton University and Columbia
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   While at Columbia, from which Medina graduated magna cum laude
in 1965, he was a Kent Scholar and a member of the law review. He
joined Debevoise &AMP; Plimpton in 1966 and became a partner in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Medina became known as a gregarious guest and
tennis partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very funny with my husband and knew there was something
behind that reserve,'' said Lucinda Franks, the author, who is
married to Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney.
``Forde would always say on the tennis court, `And in this corner,
the Honorable, the Learned, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau,
and over here we have humble Forde Medina, only a lawyer, but he'll
do what he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina is survived by his wife of 31 years and their son,
Nathaniel.

   CRIME31 (Phoenix) _ When a Phoenix man was shot in the back at a
party, he believed the shooter wasn't the only one to blame. He
successfully sued the condominium association where it happened,
saying it knew there was a need for added security. Another Phoenix
association now is being sued after its added securitybackfired. If
a gang known for crime routinely hangs out in a common area but a
homeowners association cuts back on security to save money, can it
be sued if there is a crime? Absolutely. Across the Valley of the
Sun, as the Phoenix area is known, and across the country,
community associations are vogue. But when crime happens on their
turf, these groups are becoming targets. ``Courts all across the
country are starting to hold community associations liable,'' says
Beth Mulcahy, a Phoenix attorney who represents more than 150
community associations _ which include planned communities, condo
communities and homeowners associations. By CHRIS FISCUS. Story
will move in the ``A'' category.
