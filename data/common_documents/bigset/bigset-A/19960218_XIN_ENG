<HEADLINE> Qatari Newspaper Criticizes US Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Qatari newspaper Al Arab
today criticized the United States for including Syria in the list
of the countries sponsoring terrorism, describing the act is an "open
attempt to blackmail political attitudes and pressure Damascus."
</P>
<P>
In an editorial today carried by the Qatari News Agency, the
paper expressed surprise at the U.S. accusation at a time when
American officials make shuttle tours and conduct dialogue with
the Syrian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it was astonished at the American attitude
which overlooks the terrorism of some country which commits
aggressions and killings.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspapers today highlighted President Hafez al-Assad's
rejection of some powers' accusations of Syria's sponsoring
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to enrolling Syria's name among the list of
terrorism-sponsoring countries issued by the U.S. State
Department, President al-Assad said Friday night that some people
apply the bright slogans of democracy, human rights and liberty to
blackmail others and put pressure on them.

between Balkan leaders and Western mediators ended here today,
with Balkan leaders pledging to restore all contacts between
Bosnian factions and the NATO-led Implementation Force in Bosnia.

"The three sides have agreed that all the contacts, military
and civilian, that have broken down in recent days will resume on
schedule," U.S peace mediator Richard Holbrooke told a press
conference after the summit.
</P>
<P>
The first of the meetings is scheduled for Monday on the USS
George Washignton aircraft carrier in the Adriatic.

up between the presidents of Serbia and Bosnia to allow them to
speak together directly to address problems that arise.

city,"the document said."The parties have adopted this

The agreement will come into effect on February 20, the
document added.

Muslims and Croats.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Urges IRA to Stop Violence Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton has made a direct appeal to the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
to end its campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview this morning, Bruton
urged IRA leaders to call a halt to their resumption of terrorism,
saying, "Your way of killing people has only divided people on the
island of Ireland over the last 25 years."
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process has run into great
difficulties following the IRA bombing in central London earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said that the bombing was immoral and and politically
advised as the British and Irish governments were close to
achieving the objective of all-party talks that could have
advanced the fragile Ulster peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Prime Minister also stressed that he would not talk
with Sinn Finn, the political wing of the IRA, until a new
ceasefire is announced.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his conviction that Sinn Finn leader Gerry
Adams could persuade IRA to end the violence and then return to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the same television interview, Gerry Adams
expressed disappointment at the ban imposed by the Irish
government on direct talks with Sinn Finn.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not within his power to make the IRA restore the
ceasefire, but he was "totally committed" to trying to create
conditions to persuade the IRA leaders to do so.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi Urges Guangdong to Promote Reform, Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guangzhou, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, the top Chinese
law-maker, has urged south China's Guangdong Province to work hard
to bring about a new situation in the reform and opening-up and
the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that Guangdong should make good use of its advantages,
expand its efficient farming sector, step up enterprise
restructuring and open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting Guangdong February 9-18, Qiao, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that
Guangdong holds an especially important position in China's
economic construction and trade with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He visisted factories, vegetable production experimental
centers and residential quarters in this provincial capital, as
well as the Shenzhen and Zhuhai special economic zones. He
extended Spring Festival greetings to workers, farmers and
officials.
</P>
<P>
He praised Guangdong for its contributions to China's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years Guangdong has scored new successes in
economic construction, reform and opening-up, and has made fresh
progress in promoting the establishment of a socialist legal
system as well as cultural progress, he told local officials.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that over the next five years Guangdong should make
better use of its advantageous conditions, and continue to draw on
what is useful from other parts of China and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a sustained, rapid and sound growth of Guangdong's
economy and scoring greater successes in promoting the
establishment of a legal system and cultural progress are of great
significance in promoting the smooth transition of and prosperity
and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, " said Qiao, a standing
committee member of the political bureau of the Chinese Communist
Party central committee.
</P>
<P>
He asked local officials to work hard to boost Guangdong's
agriculture and upgrade production and the processing of farm and
sideline products over the next five years, in an effort to meet
the needs of both domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting factories in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai,
Qiao said that by relying on the workers and giving full scope to
the wisdom of managerial staff and technicians, "we will certainly
be able to overcome all kinds of problems and difficulties which
may crop up in the course of development."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that enterprises must give top priority to
technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
In the course of expanding the socialist market economy,
enterprises will not be able to survive the competition without
advanced technology and marketable products, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He praised a number of enterprises in Guangdong for
independently developing new production processes and new products
which have enabled them to break into domestic and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the Xiangzhou Water Purification Plant in Zhuhai
he stressed the need to control pollution while expanding the
local economy.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Drug Dealers Arrested in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 people have been
arrested here over the past month on charges of producing and
distributing narcotics, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening paper Ettela'at said that a total of 1,043
smugglers, who belonged to six narcotic smuggling rings in Tehran,
have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Over one ton of narcotics were seized from those smugglers, the

<P>
In addition to smugglers, 819 addicts and small-time drug
dealers were arrested, the paper said.

Iran since it is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area
between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest
drug-producing center in the world.
</P>

<HEADLINE> England Beats UAE by Eight Wickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- England wrapped up an eight
wickets victory Sunday over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in
Peshwar, Pakistan, to take a step toward its quarter final berth
in Group B at the World Cup Cricket.
</P>
<P>
UAE won the toss and elected to bat first on a placid Arbab
Niaz Stadium pitch but their listless innings was rounded off for
136 with nine deliveries of the stipulated 50 overs still to spare.
</P>
<P>
Graham Thorpe hit a circumspect 44 and shared an unbroken 36
runs third wicket stand with fellow left-hander Neil Fairbrother
(12 not out) to take England past the winning target of 137.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe's winning boundary which hoisted England to 140 for two
was his sixth but none of batsmen from either side was able to
reach half century.
</P>
<P>
But it was Neil Smith who won the man of the match as he
captured three wickets and then scored 27 runs before sickness
forced him to retire.
</P>
<P>
Opener Alec Stewart made 23 runs before he played a delivery
from medium pacer Arshad Laeeq straight at mid-on. After Smith's
retirement, Atherton took the field and in company with Graham
Thorpe accumulated 47 runs before his stumps were shattered as he
lunged forward to a slightly turning delivery from slow leftarmer
Azhar Saeed.
</P>
<P>
The England skipper continued his poor run with bat as he made
20 off 40 deliveries.
</P>
<P>
UAE earlier was involved in another prosaic batting display
with Mazhar Hussain (33), Samarasekera (29) and Mohammad Aslam
(23) remaining notable batsmen for them.
</P>
<P>
England now meets another qualifier the Netherlands on Thursday
while UAE plays Pakistan at Gujranwala on February 24.
</P>
<P>
In the Sixth World Cup opening match in Pakistan at Rawalpindi
Cricket Stadium last Friday, UAE had lost to South Africa by 169
runs.
</P>
<P>
UAE and the Netherlands, two of the three non-test playing
qulifiers along with Kenya, appear headed to be cast aside from
Group B while four other teams -- Pakistan, South Africa, England
and New Zealand -- are strongly tipped to advance to the quarter
final stage from the group.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Refutes US Allegation of Importing  Ring Magnets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister
Aseff Ali refuted the US media's allegation that the country has
imported ring magnets used in making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing happened. It is a campaign launched by
the West against Pakistan," he said at a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is helping construct the Chashma Nuclear
Power Plant in Pakistan and a lot of equipment is coming to the
country. However, all the equipment for the project is cleared by
the International Atomic Energy Agency, he added.
</P>
<P>
The US media created such controversy to isolate China and
affect the Pakistan-China relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the story broke out as the Clinton
administration is going to implement the Brown Amendment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the US plan to delay the supply of the
ordered arms to Pakistan, the minister said the US is under moral
and legal obligation to deliver the arms to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a favor from the US. The arms belong to Pakistan,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Aseff, who returned here Friday after a week-long visit to the
United States, said he had extensive talks with the US
administration on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Aseff met with Acting US Secretary of State Strobe Talbot and
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali during his visit.
</P>
<P>
It is a planned visit to the US, indicating that the two
countries have agreed to upgrade the consultative level to the
ministerial one, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he briefed the US administration on the rising tension
between Pakistan and India and India's move to develop missiles
and conduct nuclear test.

MACAO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha

good cooperation with China on the question of Macao, and he
believes it will play a crucial role in the smooth transition of
Macao.

He said that he has become increasingly aware of the great
importance to ensure a good future for Macao and will make efforts
towards that end.

"We will continue to march on the right road and strive for

</P>
<P>
He noted that Macao completed many civil projects last year,
and these projects have helped ensure Macao a better future.
</P>
<P>
The Macao International Airport, for instance, he said, will
not only help promote economic growth of Macao, but also increase
exchanges with the outside world and accelerate the
internationalization of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The governor foresees a bright year in 1996, which he said
will enjoy a peaceful and stable growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister
Aseff Ali, outlining the country's Afghan policy here today, said
that the Afghan peace plan must be based on three principles.
</P>
<P>
The plan should reflect not only the ground reality but also
the ethnic reality in the country, Aseff said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it should not ignore all groups and leaders inside
and outside Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Formation of a council to take over power should be based on
the three principles, he added.
</P>
<P>
A peace force should be formed in Kabul so that the council
could function in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) and the United
Nations should send observers to Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OIC should provide neutral elements rather than
peace-keeping forces to Afghanistan to collect heavy weapons and
create peace zones in Kabul, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aseff, who returned here Friday after a week-long visit to the
US, said he had long discussions with the US Administration on the
Afghan problem, urging the US to intensify its peace efforts in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated that the Afghan problem could be solved
only by the Afghans themselves.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of non-interference, unity in the
country as well as the formation of a broad-based government.

secret negotiations are being held on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The statement stresses that the government's policy is to keep

resorting to methods used by authoritarian regimes to shut up
opposition.

minister to back up his statement by closing down Orient House,
PLO's office in East Jerusalem, by the beginning of March.

TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran today criticized Japan for
the postponement of loan providing under the pressure of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Iran News today quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati as saying Saturday that "it is not in the interest
of Japan to buckle under the U.S. pressure."
</P>
<P>
"We don't need hard currency for dam building ... except for
purchasing certain machinery including generators," said the
Iranian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the Japanese postponement of their second
instalment of loan will not exert any pressure on his country and
will not cause a problem.
</P>
<P>
Japan extended 38.6 billion yen (about 364 million
U.S. dollars) to Iran as the first instalment of the loan for dam
projects.
</P>
<P>
Japan, one of the largest trade partners of Iran, imported a
total of 143.98 million barrels of crude oil from Iran in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 3.6 billion

<HEADLINE> England Coach Venables Likely to Go to America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The out-going England coach
Terry Venables is likely to go to the United States to coach the
US national team, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the American soccer team was quoted as
saying:"We are fully aware of the Terry Venables situation and
realise he is under contract until this summer."
</P>
<P>
The official expressed great interest in Venables by saying the
Americans would like to sign a four-year contract with the current
England coach.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that Venables could earn some two million
pounds (about three million U.S. dollars) by accepting the offer.
</P>
<P>
Venables was the best man with expertise to take the Americans
to the 1998 World Cup Finals in France, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from being a superb coach, he is a great motivator of
players, a brilliant communicator and a guy with real charisma,"
he added
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Venables announced that he would resign as
England coach after the European Championships in June to focus
his attention on his legal battles.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were massively impressed by the 52-year-old
Venables when they came to Wembley earlier this year and lost 2-0
to England.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian newspapers highlighted
today President Hafez al-Assad's rejection of some powers'
accusations of Syria's sponsoring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to enrolling Syria's name among the list of
terrorism-sponsoring countries issued by the U.S. State
Department, President al-Assad said Friday night that some people
apply the bright slogans of democracy, human rights and liberty to
blackmail others and put pressure on them.
</P>
<P>
"We are against terrorism in the sense of crime." President
al-Assad said.
</P>
<P>
"We may intimidate a criminal, but it is impossible for us to
intimidate a citizen defending his homeland. Syria could be
neither subdued nor intimidated by being accused of terrorism," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, President al-Assad said Syria is continuing the
peace process with Israel but Syria could not present any
concessions as far as its rights and national interests were
concerned.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have already proclaimed that they have enrolled
Syria among the countries sponsoring terrorism once again this
year despite its participation in the peace negotiations with
Israel sponsored by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Youth Crime Rise Triggers Review of Rehabilitation Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The effectiveness of Hong
Kong's rehabilitation programs for juvenile offenders will be
reviewed as youth involvement in petty crime increases.
</P>
<P>
The Fight Crime Committee said yesterday shoplifting and
pickpocketing went up five and 15 percent respectively in 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,500 cases of shoplifting and 993 cases of
pickpocketing were reported last year.
</P>
<P>
The committee yesterday endorsed a proposal for two large-scale
studies on the programs, and work on the studies was to be started
in April and completed by May 1997.
</P>
<P>
A first study will assess the effectiveness of the current
rehabilitation programs while a parallel study will focus on the
phenomena of juvenile gangs and runaway children.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Security Peter Lai said that despite a drop in
juvenile offenders last year, youngsters still made up a sizable
portion of the increasing instances of petty theft.
</P>
<P>
Petty theft and pickpocketing are now the most common offenses
committed by juveniles.
</P>
<P>
The overall number of juveniles aged 16 to 20 arrested for
crime dropped last year by 2.3 percent to 8,961, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Figures for those under 16 also fell by 4.4 percent to 6,723
arrests, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
Many schemes now in use concentrate on cautioning and guiding
offenders rather than punishing them.

variety of fireworks go up in smoke on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
A crew of 25 technicians were busy yesterday getting the six
tons of fireworks ready for the spectacular annual show.
</P>
<P>
A team of specialists will man four barges placed at two
locations in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
"The end result of this remarkable assembly of firepower will
be more than 5,000 explosions bursting between 60 and 150 meters
high and 6,000 crackers exploding between 150 and 300 meters
high," said Wilf Scott, from Britain's Pyrovision Limited.
</P>
<P>
"There will be fireworks in the shape of flowers, stars and
some other irregular shapes," Scott was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There will also be 1,600 European rocket effects, most of
which have never been seen in Hong Kong before," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 25-minute show will begin with noisy drums to dispel evil
spirits.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the display is based on Hong Kong's history as one
of the most important trading ports in the world.
</P>
<P>
Scott, who and other members of the crew have been working for
three months for the annual spectacle, was not worried about an
expected cloudy weather on the day. "The weather shouldn't affect
the display much, except maybe slow it down for a few seconds,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Booming on Sino-Vietnamese Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Over five million Chinese and
foreign tourists have visited areas along the border between
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Viet Nam over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
Tourism in that period generated over 400 million yuan (48.19
million US dollars) for Guangxi, in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
On the Guangxi side of the border, stretching for over 1,000
kilometers, there are numerous tourist attractions including
murals on the Huashan Mountain Cliff, the Friendship Pass, the
magnificent Detian Waterfall and major cities such as Dongxing and
Pingxiang.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, over 1.8 million tourists visited Dongxing and
500,000 toured Pingxiang.
</P>
<P>
Since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations, local
governments have given priority to the growth of tourism,
developing new tourist spots and raising funds through diversified
channels for the construction of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a thriving cross-border trade added to the good
prospects of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism authorities are offering an increasing number of
programs, including cross-border one-day visits and longer tours.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Sino-Viet railway resumed traffic after a
suspension of 17 years, considerably facilitating cross-border
tourism.

<HEADLINE> Cloudy Weather Threats HK Lunar New Year Fireworks Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Although low cloud is
threatening to impair an expectedly spectacular fireworks display
Tuesday night for Hong Kong's Lunar New Year celebrations,
specialists in the local observatory were optimistic.
</P>
<P>
They hope the cold weather sweeping from the north may save the
day.
</P>
<P>
Whether the heavy mist shrouding Hong Kong for the past days
will continue is "in the balance", assistant director of the
observatory's forecasting Lam Chiu-ying said.
</P>
<P>
"We are certain it will be cold, around 10 degrees Celsius,
with the arrival of more and more cold air from the north from
Sunday onwards," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the cold air keeps on coming the cloud will go higher and
higher and may not worry us on Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
Lunar New Year often brought gloomy weather at the time of the
year, he explained.
</P>
<P>
And the pyrotechnicians are even more optimistic. Rain or
fine, the fireworks can go ahead because mortar casings, which
fire the shots, are insulated with aluminium foil to keep them
dry.
</P>
<P>
Wilf Scott, head of the 25-strong crew responsible for the
fireworks show, said that a bad weather would be more of a problem
for spectators than for the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Many of these fireworks have chemicals in them like magnesium
which can burn even in water. The team even held a show in 60
centimeters of snow, he said.
</P>
<P>
Six tons of fireworks will be deployed during the 25-minute
show, which begins with noisy drums to dispel evil spirits. The
theme of the display is based on Hong Kong's history as one of the
most important trading ports in the world.

<P>
MADRID, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Picabo Street of the United
States claimed the first major gold medal of her career when she
sped to a superb victory in Sunday's women's downhill at the
Alpine skiing world championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old covered the 3.4-kilometer Veleta course in one
minute 54.06 seconds, more than half a second ahead of Germany's
Olympic champion Katja Seizinger, who finished in 1:54.63.
American Hilary Lindh claimed the bronze in 1:54.70.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger took gold to Street's silver in the 1994 Olympic
downhill, but Street was in a class of her own on the fast
Spanish piste despite losing time on the final jump. She was the
first American to win a world championship downhill title.
</P>
<P>
After encouraging Lindh down the slope and with Seizinger
already beaten, Street screamed victoriously after a
disappointing performance by major rival Isolde Kostner of Italy
who finished almost a second behind in 1:55.04.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Kate Pace of Canada, a natural glider who
was well-suited to the course, was fourth and missed out on a
bronze medal by just one hundredth of a second.

<HEADLINE> Sharia Leading Member Escapes Death In North Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed
and four others wounded in north Mogadishu when the residence of
a leading member from the Sharia Islamic Council was attacked by
an unidentified number of gunmen last night.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed Islamic militiamen from different districts have
rushed to the scene and sealed off the whole area surrounding the
residence of Sheikh Hassan Ali Alasow, the deputy chairman of
Sharia Implementation Council, in an effort to rescue the Sheikh
who at that time was at home.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the council said their militiamen have
captured a temporary base created by the perpetratiors in the
area and confiscated all the logistics they had in the base.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also revealed they killed one attacker and
wounded another.
</P>
<P>
The perpetrators, who drove two cars, later managed to escape
with their dead and wounded. The Islamic militiamen have now
erected check points in all cross roads and junctions in North
Mogadishu to nab culprits, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheikh Alasow, the perpetrators were militiamen
from the Habar Gidir clan of General Aideed who controls most of
the southern part of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Alasow said a man named Ismail Madahey was identified
to be in charge of the infiltration operation.
</P>
<P>
Mr Madahey is a well known militia leader who is always
opposed to the Islamic authority in North Mogadishu, he added.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed an earlier attack directed to the
residence of the chairman of the Sharia Council, Sheikh Sharif
Sheikh Muhidin, who narrowly escaped death.

TOKYO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Lulia Negura lead a Romanian
1-2-3 finish Sunday to win the women's race in the Chiba cross
country, the 11th leg of the 15-round IAAF World Cross Challenge.
</P>
<P>
Compatriots Elena Fidatov and Mariana Chirila came in second

</P>
<P>
It was a repeat performance of the ninth round two weeks ago in

<HEADLINE> Fighting Intensifies In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 people,
mainly women and children, have fled across the Liberian border
over the weekend to neighbouring Ivory Coast, escaping from the
heavy fighting between two rival rebel groups in the wartorn
nation.
</P>
<P>
According to local journalists reached by telephone from here
early Sunday, fighters of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia
(NPFL) are using heavy artillery against the Liberian Peace
Council (LPC) to dislodge them from Tareas in southeast Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the incident, Monrovia Radio said on Sunday that
many of the survivors, mainly civilians, have been "travelling on
foot through dense forest while others have died from exhaustion
and hunger."
</P>
<P>
Releif agencies in the area said the situation is "chaotic and
alarming".
</P>
<P>
The radio broadcast an ultimatum demanding LPC release 10
vehicles commandeered by its armed gangs "the latest by monday"
or "face tough action".
</P>
<P>
Correspondents in Monrovia said the LPC has so far ignored the
demand.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles belong to the British non-governmental
organization, Oxfam, the Belgian based Medecins Sans Frontieres
and the United Nations department of humanitarian affairs.

<HEADLINE> Peres Takes Lead in Pre-Campaign Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Polls published here over
the weekend show that Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
maintains a steady lead and is close to the 50 percent majority
needed for a first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that Peres' lead over Likud leader
Binyamin Netanyahu remains at about 15 percent, though one poll,
Gallop, brings the gap up to 18 percent in Peres' favor.
</P>
<P>
The polls also show a fall for the Likud-Tsomet bloc rather
than a rise in fortunes.
</P>
<P>
According to surveys taken at mid-week, opposition parties
Likud and Tsomet now stand to amass less Knesset (parliament)
seats on a joint ticket than they would have together on separate
lists.
</P>
<P>
While campaigning is already under way, there is still no date
for early elections. Labor sources say their election team will
meet their opposition counterparts this week and then set a date
within a few days.
</P>
<P>
The problem now is a clear linkage by Peres led Labor party
between the election date and legislative amendments on
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Labor wants election ads limited to the low-rated Channel 1 of
Israel Television, while the Likud refuses to be banned from the
more popular Channel 2.
</P>
<P>
Labor also wants to abolish the law that forbids featuring any
candidate on the electronic media for the month preceding election
day. But the opposition fears that this should give a clear
advantage to the government, saying the media is already
left-leaning.
</P>
<P>
The date the opposition, especially the religious parties,
would like is June 4. But Labor sources -- possibly striking a
bargaining position -- agreed Saturday that the most likely date
is May 28, which is said to be Peres' personal choice.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Investors Face Legal Issues in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Legal problems have run aground
several Malaysian hotel projects in the Philippines, bruising the
confidence of the country's most aggressive Asian investors.
</P>
<P>
According to Zainuddin Rahaman, former Malaysian envoy to the
Philippines, the problems faced by Malaysian investors are
undermining "the confidence of Malaysian businessmen on the wisdom
of investing in the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
Rahaman, who helped facilitate the two waterfront hotel
projects in Cebu, said, "This can also have much wider
implications on the bilateral relations between our two
countries."
</P>
<P>
The Senate is investigating charges of anomaly in the 75-year
lease of 8.1 hectares of land to the Malaysian Waterfront Group by
the Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
The probe has cast a dark cloud over the projects, one of which
is due to open in July.
</P>
<P>
Later last year, the Supreme Court issued a temporary
restraining order, freezing the deal which transfers 51 percent
ownership of the Manila Hotel to Renong Berhard and It Sheraton of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The order was sought by losing bidder Manila Prince Hotel
Corp., which said that the hotel was part of the national heritage
and therefore should not be sold to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Metroplex Group, which operates a hotel and casino
at Subic Bay, has been caught in the middle of a row between the
Philippine Congress and the state-run Philippine Amusement and
Gaming Corp.
</P>
<P>
Both bodies are fighting over the authority to grant casino
franchises.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian businessmen are seen as the most aggressive among
Asian investors in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio investments by Malaysians in the Philippines rose
from 100 million US dollars in 1993 to 178.7 million dollars in
1994.

settlement with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) "that

press said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced in a joint statement issued by
Cameroon Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono and his Nigerian
counterpart Tom Ikimi following talks in Togo yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have "examined the situation which prevails over
the Bakassi and have agreed to stop all hostilities", said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to meet again in the first week of March to
prepare a summit meeting between the two countries under the
auspices of Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1960, Nigeria has disputed with cameroon
on the sovereignty of the peninsula which has rich deposits of
oil and minerals.
</P>
<P>
The fresh armed clash early this month has left a number of
casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is currently brought to the international court of
justice in the Hague. Nigeria would prefer mediation by a third
country, but has nevertheless agreed to let the world court
arbitrate on the claim.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal Wants Closer Economic Ties With India (By Chen Anning and Cao Weiguo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba's visit to India last week indicates that this
Himalayan kingdom hopes for strengthened economic relations with
its giant southern neighbor, especially trade links and
cooperation in water resources development.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long visit to India which ended on Saturday,
Deuba held talks with his Indian counterpart P.V. Narsimha Rao on
trade, joint exploitation of water resources and transit
facilities for Nepal through India.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, they signed a treaty on a border river development
which settled a contentious issue between the two countries
arising from an Indian hydropower project on Nepal's western
border river.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali River treaty provides for Nepal's rights over
India's Tanakpur project on the border and would replace the old
Tanakpur Treaty between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nepal regards the 1991 Tanakpur Treaty as not having brought
about enough benefits for the country and its parliament never
ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement on electric power trade between Nepal and
India was initialed Saturday at the end of Deuba's visit. Under
the accord, any public or private company in both countries could
do business of power trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the airport here upon arrival Saturday
night, Deuba said the Mahakali Treaty and the power trade
agreement were the main highlights of his visit to India.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two governments also signed an agreement
on the construction of 22 highway bridges in Nepal with India's
assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that the Nepali prime minister had achieved
little on other major issues between the two countries, including
Nepal's new transit route via India, its trade imbalance with
India and the 1950 Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued at the end of Deuba's visit said only
that the two countries had agreed to initiate talks at the
appropriate level on those issues.
</P>
<P>
The two governments agreed to diversify two-way trade and begin
talks on removing the 50 percent labor and material content
requirement for Nepalese goods' entry into the Indian market, the
joint statement said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal ran a trade deficit of more than 320 million US dollars
with India during the 1994-95 fiscal year ending last July.
Nepal's total foreign trade in last year was valued at about 1.54
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the 1950 Nepal-India Friendship Treaty, which Nepal
considers to be outdated and has been asking for a review, the
joint statement said the two governments would hold further talks
at the foreign secretary level.
</P>
<P>
India has maintained that the 1950 treaty would either be
retained entirely or abolished in accordance its clauses, ruling
out any possibility of revision.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Military Link with Chechen Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today denied it has any military links with Chechen
separatists, saying that "we do not interfere in the domestic
affairs of Russia or any other country."
</P>
<P>
Velayati made the statement to press here today following
official protest lodged by Iran's Ambassador to Moscow Mehdi
Safari against recent remarks by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
over Iran's link with Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the Iranian foreign minister said, "We
freely express our views on the situation of world Moslems and
Islam. We believe that Moslems or other groups of human beings
should not be put under pressure."
</P>
<P>
"This belief does not constitute interference in the affairs
of others," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We hope that the Russian government and Chechen
officials would be able to hold dialogues to justly and peacefully
solve their problems."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Iranian officials said, Iran had sacrificed the
interest of Chechen Moslem brothers and sisters for the support of
Russia in building a nuclear power plant in this country.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Russian
officials, while expressing surprise over President Yeltsin's
remarks, said that the Foreign Ministry or intelligence agencies
had not provided the president with such information.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Yeltsin in his address to the workers of a
plant in Chelyabinsk said Chechen fighters were being trained in
Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and sent back home with arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had accused Iran of having links with the Chechen
separatists last month which was followed by Iran's strong
denial.

<HEADLINE> Banned Parties Reject Swazi King's Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Banned parties in
Swaziland have rejected King Mswati III's promise that his
government would reinstate constitutional rule, the local daily
"City Press" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the the 1996 sitting of the parliament on Friday, King
Mswati III promised to reinstate the Kingdom's 1968 independence
constitution, which was suspended by his father the late king
Sobhuza II in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Mswati said: "The time has come that we carry on with the
constitution," adding the constitution committee would be set up
to prepare the way for the reintroduction of a constitution.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the Popular People's United Democratic
Movement (PUDEMO) Dominic Mngomezulu said yesterday in Manzini
that Mswati's promise was "just like his usual promises that he
will bring political change" in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Mngomezulu said "Mswati hasn't started saying anything. To us
(PUDEMO) he is just silent."
</P>
<P>
He also demanded the king remove the Sobhuza II's proclamation
No. 12 of 1973 which banned political activity and the freedom of
gathering.
</P>
<P>
"With that decree still in force, we feel he hasn't moved even an
inch," he said.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties remained banned.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival is in the Air for Chinese Travellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China Kanghui Travel Agency
today saw off its last group of Chinese holiday makers flying to
Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore to spend the Spring Festival
beginning February 19.
</P>
<P>
The travel agency originally planned to arrange overseas
travel for 260 Chinese people during the festival, which would
have been a 20 percent rise over last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
In the event over 500 people applied to the agency for travel
arrangements. The agency had to persuade its own staff and their
families, who had planned to travel abroad, to stay at home to
make space for clients, said Liu Jin, manager of the agency's
Southeast Asia Department.
</P>
<P>
"It takes about 10,000 yuan (1,204 US dollars) per person to
travel the three countries in Southeast Asia, which is quite a
big sum for an ordinary Chinese citizen. So we did not expect to
get so many clients", said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The unusually long seven day Spring Festival this year, coupled
with rising living standards, meant that many Chinese travel
agencies have witnessed a sharp increase in Chinese holiday makers
heading overseas.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines said all 4,400 seats on flights between Beijing
and Bangkok for February were fully booked, mostly with Chinese
passengers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Villagers Reported To Live On "Grass Grain" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Serious food shortages have
hit most parts of Gokwe district in northern Zimbabwe, forcing
villagers to resort to eating "grass grain", the local Sunday
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
People in the area, who last received maize under the grain
loan scheme in November last year, are in some cases going for up
to four days without food, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a way to relieve hunger, most of the villagers have to
collect large quantities of a "grass seed", which was
traditionally used in times of food scarcity, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The district administrator Nyaguse admitted that there were
serious food shortages in the area but said he was unaware of any
deaths from starvation.
</P>
<P>
But according to the local health authorities, six people had
died of a "mixture of hunger and malaria".
</P>
<P>
The headmaster of Nenyunga School, Mr. Arova, said the lack of
food had forced students to attend lessons an average of three
times a week.
</P>
<P>
Some children had fainted in class due to hunger, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 people were left homeless and property worth
thousands of dollars was lost when floods swept away their huts
in Gokwe recently.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Revise Inflation Target (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
expected to revise its inflation targets for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation in 1995 hit 8.1 percent, higher than
the targeted 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The higher inflation was not due to excess liquidity, but
rather due to the rice supply shortage which surfaced last
September.
</P>
<P>
The government originally programmed an inflation rate of 6.5
percent to 7.5 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
But a revision is now being considered due to the impact of the
expanded value added tax, oil price hike and wage hike.
</P>
<P>
However, Amando Tetangco, managing director of the Central
Bank, noted over the weekend, "as far as we are concerned,
inflation should not be higher than what we achieved in 1995."
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will review the country's
economic performance under its three-year program from February 23
to March 4.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government expects the IMF to examine closely
the country's failure to attain its inflation targets.
</P>
<P>
Tetangco said, "They recognized that it was due to supply
factors. But they will still try to look into it closely and see
what the path for monetary growth should be."
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate stood at 11.2 percent in January
and is expected to remain at the double-digit level in the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, government economic managers predict that the
country's inflation will drop to the single-digit level by the
second quarter of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador, Peru Seek Solution to Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A year after Ecuador and Peru
signed the Itamaraty Protocol to end their war over a land
dispute, the two countries have withdrawn their troops from the
disputed zone Alto Cenepa and begun to sit down for direct
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
To mark the first anniversary of the peace accord, signed in
Brazil's Foreign Ministry building, the four mediator and
guarantor countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United
States -- issued a communique in Brasilia on Friday stating their
satisfaction "with the important advance toward distention in the
relations between Ecuador and Peru."
</P>
<P>
The mediators also called for the two countries to seek a
definitive solution to their century-old territorial dispute
through direct talks, the last and decisive step provided for in
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Reports from authoritative sources said both Ecuador and Peru
have been complying with the five points in the Itamaraty Protocol
-- ceasefire, separation of the forces, demobilization and
demilitarization of the conflict zone, establishment of a
demilitarized zone in the border, and gradual power transfer to
the two countries from the Military Observers Mission for Ecuador
and Peru (MOMEP), deployed by the guarantor countries.
</P>
<P>
What is more heartening was that Ecuador's Foreign Minister
Galo Leoro had already met with his Peruvian counterpart Francisco
Tudela in Lima on January 17 and 18, the first contact of this
kind in 54 years since 1942.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers will continue their talks in Quito on
February 22 and 23, which are expected to bring about positive
results to the settlement of procedural matters and possibly to
lead to the initiation of dialogue on Ecuador's proposal of a
non-aggression agreement.
</P>
<P>
These developments are creating a climate of mutual confidence
in both countries, although there is still a long way to go before
the two countries can find a definitive solution to their
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru had been embroiled in border dispute since
their independence in the early 19th century and driven into a
number of clashes this century. As far back as 1942, the four
mediator countries had brokered a Rio de Janeiro Peace Protocol on
their border dispute, which, however, has failed to lead to a
lasting solution.
</P>
<P>
The Itamaraty Protocol was signed after the dispute over the
Alto Cenepa zone flared up again in January, 1995 and developed
into a 50-day war that killed more than 500 people and caused a
loss of 1.5 billion dollars.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 568 traffic
accidents involving 17 deaths were reported throughout Malaysia
over a 24-hour period as Chinese and Muslims celebrated their
festive holidays.
</P>
<P>
Federal deputy traffic police chief Dell Akhbar told the press
today the figures for the period of 6 a.m. Saturday to 6 a.m.
today were higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
Although police stepped up patrols nationwide, the number of
accidents showed that police efforts did not help much in reducing
accidents during the holidays, Dell Akhbar said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for more care among road users, especially
motorcyclists who accounted for 16 of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged road
users to be more careful and cautious when they rush home for
holidays, warning that otherwise some people may never reach their
destinations.

<HEADLINE> Passengers in Shanghai Held Up by Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Flights to and from Shanghai
have been cancelled as snowstorms battered the China coastal
city. Trains and long distance buses were also badly disrupted,
leaving thousands of homeward bound travellers stranded.
</P>
<P>
Three flights leaving Shanghai and five others scheduled to
touch down at China's largest industrial city had to be cancelled
because of the snowfall which started on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The snow added a spectacular festival flavor to the Spring
Festival which falls tomorrow. But for more than 1,300 passengers
waiting to join their families and friends by air to celebrate the
festival, it could not have come at a worse time. Their flights
were waiting to jet off to Nanjing, Hefei and other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The snow in the lower valleys of the Yangtze River and Huaihe
River and part of central China's provinces have also caused
delays for Shanghai-bound trains. Meanwhile more than 10,000
people were left waiting in the Shanghai Railway Station.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, long-distance buses carrying passengers to
surrounding cities in the Shanghai area were also delayed,
stopping over 1,500 passengers from reaching home.
</P>
<P>
To help the stranded passengers, transportation departments,
including civil aviation, communications and railways, have
mobilized people to clear snow, and open public places such as
stores to accommodate held-up passengers, and ensure water and
food supplies for the passengers.
</P>
<P>
By late night Saturday, long-distance bus services had returned
to normal.
</P>
<P>
According to Tao Zuqiang, deputy director of Shanghai Railway
Station, normal transportation will resume later today if the
weather improves. With the help of the railway station,
passengers unable to fly back home have switched to the railway.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people seemed to have
found a substitute for firecrackers -- Flower power.
</P>
<P>
In the lanes and streets of Chinese towns and cities, flower
peddlers are among the busiest.
</P>
<P>
"I have sold thousands yuan worth of flowers," said 96-year-old
Li Jianwang, in southern province of Fujian. "What I regret is
that I planted too few."
</P>
<P>
A total of 91 Chinese cities have banned firecrackers to avoid
pollution and danger, halting a thousands-years-old tradition
during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The move has driven people to seek other holiday
enjoyment: flowers, lanterns and travel.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong province, opened
seven flower markets in its downtown area this year.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that 400 varieties of flowers are on
sale, many of them imported from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"Peony are among the most popular," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Ming, from Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
province, bought 126 yuan worth of flowers. He said he will
present some of them as gifts to his grandmother-in-law, and
decorate his bedroom with the rest.
</P>
<P>
In Chengdu, the retail sale of flowers has increased by 40
percent annually in recent years, according to the local
Industrial and Commercial Administration.
</P>
<P>
Similar scenes have also been witnessed in other cities such as
Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
However, not everybody is in the mood to admire lovely flowers.
</P>
<P>
For example, Xin Guangwei, an official of the State Copyright
Administration. "Months of crackdowns on piracy have left me
exhausted. I just want to have a good sleep during the holiday,"
he said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a third
force as an alternative to India's ruling Congress Party and
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ran into rough weather
Saturday as the Communist Party of India (CPI) expressed pessimism
about the issue, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the CPI National Council here,
General Secretary Inderjit Gupta said it would be difficult to
"squeeze" all like-minded parties together in a national

</P>
<P>
He said despite several rounds of talks, the constituents of

alliance, let alone a common program.
</P>
<P>
Gupta, a strong advocate for a third front, admitted that much
of the floundering among the front partners was due to the absence
of any focal point or personality who could rally all together.
</P>
<P>
In a major departure from its earlier stand, the CPI National
Council has decided that left-wing parties should go ahead and
prepare their own common election program on major issues in view
of the difficulties in forging any national-level alliance with
the national front, especially the Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
But the CPI stressed that it would be feasible to form an
alliance at the state level.
</P>
<P>
CPI's change of attitude will be a major setback for the
national front-left front "combine" which wants to form an
alliance prior to the general elections to make use of the hawala
case.
</P>
<P>
In the case, ten leading politicians, including BJP President
L.K. Advani and three Congress cabinet ministers, were accused of
taking bribes from illegal foreign exchange dealers.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parliament Endorses Political Parties Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A number of small political
parties will likely be disbanded in Romania under a new political
parties act adopted by the parliament recently.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, a political party will have to have a membership
of at least 10,000 with branches in at least 21 of the 40 counties
across the country at its inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The act bans political parties from obtaining funds from
foreign countries and puts a strict limit on the amount of funds
raised from outside the parties.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered political parties in Romania has grown
to some 200 since 1990, when the country adopted a multiparty
system. But only 13 parties are now represented in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing practice, a political party needs a
membership of only 250 to be registered.
</P>
<P>
The new political parties act is yet to be approved by the
president of the country to enter into force.

<HEADLINE> Quake, Tidal Waves Kill 10 in Irian Jaya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
and 17 others injured when an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the
Richter scale shook several coastal towns in north Irian Jaya,
Indonesia, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said today that 70 percent of the houses
along the coast were wiped away by tidal waves which occurred
immediately after the quake struck just before 3:00 pm local time.
</P>
<P>
Severe destruction was reported in Biak and Manokwari, and many
coastal villages were swept away by tidal waves reaching three to
four meters high.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological and Geophysical Agency in Jakarta confirmed
that the epicenter of the quake was in the Pacific Ocean, about
110 km east of Biak district at a depth of 63 km. The quake was
also felt in other districts in Irian Jaya, including Manokwari,
Nabire and Serui.
</P>
<P>
The death toll could rise, the reports said. And First
Sergeant Sodi Irwanto of the Biak police told the Jakarta Post
that most of the deaths and injuries were caused by collapsed
buildings.

There had been at least four aftershocks measuring about 3.0 to

<P>
The town was dark last night as power was cut out.

The authorities have asked local residents to leave their homes
and head for open fields for fear of some more aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
Biak's Frans Kaisiepo airport, which also handles some
international flights, was closed down because its control tower
was destroyed and could not monitor or direct incoming flights.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have also arranged for the evacuation and
were distributing whatever relief aid is available locally.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Celebrate Traditional New Year (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eating out instead of the tradition of having a big dinner at
home is becoming more popular in urban areas as people have less
time to prepare meals, and more money to spend.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing many restaurants arranged a family-party service,
hundreds of stores and businesses hung lanterns, and hotels
sponsored New Year get-togethers.
</P>
<P>
All festival feasts in the major restaurants of Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, have been booked
during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
In shops and markets of Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, people are dazzled by the endless array of brand-name and
native goods from all parts of the country: candy from Shanghai,
wine and vegetables from the neighboring Sichuan Province, apples
from coastal Shandong Province, pears from north China's Hebei
Province, biscuits from Beijing, and sausages from south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
While selecting goods, Yang Dron, a Tibetan woman, said that
the traditional Tibetan New Year coincided with the traditional
Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
"Lhasa has more goods than before, and here we can buy almost
everything produced and sold in the other areas of the country
with similar prices," she said.
</P>
<P>
Trucks are busy shipping meat, eggs and vegetables to Lijiang
and Zhongdian counties in northwest Yunnan Province to ensure
people there to have a good holiday.
</P>
<P>
The two counties were hit by a strong earthquake measuring
seven degrees on Richer Scale two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
To enliven the festival, cultural and recreational
organizations have sponsored a package of colorful TV programs of
entertainment and temple fairs, and local opera troupes headed to
rural areas, remote mountain regions and army camps to give
performances, and convey their new year greetings to farmers and
soldiers.

BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- If you travel along streets
and lanes of China these days, you will be attracted by lanterns,
colored streamers, flowers and a superb collection of goods, all
marking the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival falls tomorrow, heralding the traditional
Chinese New Year and the biggest holiday in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most people will have a seven-day holiday from work, and sons
and daughters working away will usually return home to join their
parents for a big dinner on the eve of the festival.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 Hong Kong compatriots a day have passed
through the Lowu Customs Office in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province,
on their way to visit their families and relatives on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Among hundreds of local residents welcoming their relatives
from Hong Kong at the Lowu Bridge were Shi Linsen and his
daughter from Taiping Town, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"This is the 14th time that I have come here to welcome my
parents to spend the new year with us," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Another China bound visitor was Mr. Huang who was on his way
from Hong Kong to the mainland, carrying a light travelling
bag. He used to bring a heavy load of gifts, just like a laden
donkey, from Hong Kong for his relatives during the Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
"The living standard on the mainland has improved so quickly,
and many goods sold in Hong Kong can be found in my hometown
nowadays," he said, explaining his lightweight luggage.
</P>
<P>
As compatriots and overseas Chinese return to the mainland
around festival time, many people, the young in particular, are
visiting scenic spots, tourist attractions and overseas instead of
following the old tradition of joining their parents.
</P>
<P>
The International Travel Agency in Beijing ordered 1,000 air
tickets for domestic customers and organized visits overseas
around the festival for about 400 people.

<HEADLINE> Likud Kicks off Election Campaign In Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The major opposition party,
Likud, is launching election campaign today under the banner of
"(Prime Minister Shimon) Peres is dividing Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
As of this morning, the Likud is beginning to run ads in the
press and on billboards claiming that Labor Party will divide
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party Secretary General Nissim Zvilli proposed Saturday
that the Jerusalem issue be removed from the national election
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"The entire nation is united on the Jerusalem issue, and there
is no sense in raising it as a bone of contention when in fact it
is not," Zvilli said. "Moreover, doing so may give the "Arabs" the
impression that we really are divided on Jerusalem and there is
something to talk about."
</P>
<P>
But Zvilli's proposal was categorically rejected by the Likud
as a sign that "Labor is indeed afraid of this issue, and that
means that there is something happening behind the scenes despite
all of Labor's denials," Likud's spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The Likud's campaign will suggest that secret Oslo-type talks
are already in progress in Europe about the future arrangements in
Jerusalem. Since this follows Peres' denial, the Likud line in
effect challenges Peres' credibility.
</P>
<P>
The Likud apparently regards the Jerusalem issue as Labor's
soft spot, and as one with which it stands the best chance of
making some electoral impact.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labor Party is ready for the election campaign of
itself. In its election campaign team, Interior Minister Haim
Ramon is head of information office; Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
is head of steering committee, which will, among other things,
formulate political platform.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Moshe Shahal is head of
organizational office; Deputy Defense Minister Orri Orr is in
charge of youth and labor activities; Minister at Prime
Minister's Office Yossi Beilin will oversee party opinion polls
during elections; and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer will
head the election campaign office.

Li Peng said that 1996 is the first year of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000), and "it is important to have a good beginning".
</P>
<P>
He added, "we should properly handle the relationship of
reform, development, and stability," trying to make new progress
in all fields of work.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to the promotion of cultural and
ideological progress and democracy and legal system, accelerating
the anti-corruption drive and severely punishing those involved in
major cases.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations and governments at all levels should
concentrate their efforts on maintaining social security, severely
cracking down on criminal activities, and providing people with a
good social environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will be less than 500 days before China resumes
the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) signals that various
preparatory work for the SAR has entered its key period, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with the support from and efforts by the
people in every sector of Hong Kong, the Preparatory Committee
will surely fulfil its glorious historic mission."
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's
territory, Li noted that President Jiang Zemin's eight-point
propositions on the development of relations across the Taiwan
Straits and the promotion of the reunification of the Motherland
have won support from people both at home and abroad. An early
termination to the separation of the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits is a trend of the times and a desire of the people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are confident and capable of maintaining
state sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to create 'two Chinas', 'one China, one Taiwan'
or 'Taiwan independence' is sure to be opposed by all the Chinese
people, including Taiwan compatriots, and is doomed to failure."
</P>
<P>
He pledged, "we will firmly carry out the principle
of 'peaceful reunification and one country, two systems', and
promote the reunification of the motherland free of any
interference".
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that compatriots both at home and abroad get
united and make concerted efforts for the complete reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Finally he emphasized that the Chinese government and people,
together with all governments and people in the world, will make
untiring efforts to promote peace, stability and prosperity and
build a better world.
</P>
<P>
Performances were also given at the gathering by

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa on Saturday said that only the Zanzibar House of
Representatives (Parliament) had the mandate to settle the
Zanzibar political conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar House of Representatives was the organ enacting
the law and other related electoral rules for Zanzibar, the
president stated on the issue arising out of the contraversial
election results in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He made clear that neither the courts of law, nor himself as
President of the United Republic of Tanzania, had legal powers to
nullify election results announced on October 26 last year.
</P>
<P>
The president was making the statement at Morogoro, west of
Dar es Salaam, while addressing local officials and political
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged all the opposition Civic United Front (CUF)
members of the House of Representatives to attend instead of
boycotting the sessions on the thorny election issue.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa's speech follows the present political
misunderstandings which have led to rejection by the CUF members
to Dr. Salmin Amour's Presidency in Zanzibar and CUF's boycott to
the House sessions.

<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 17 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Defending champion
Xie Jun scored a precious victory over challenger Zsuzsa Polgar of
Hungary in the 12th game of the Women's Chess World Championship
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Xie, trailing Polgar 3.5-7.5 after the 11th game, took
three hours 42 minutes to beat the Hungarian, who needs only one
more win to take over the crown from Xie.
</P>
<P>
With white pieces, Xie launched fierce attacks from the start
and enjoyed the space advantage after the 16th moves.
</P>
<P>
Xie continued to press the opponent hard, having Polgar's
knight and bishop deadlocked after the 24th move.
</P>
<P>
Polgar was gradually pushed to a passive situation and lost her
bishop before giving up the game in the 45th move.
</P>
<P>
"I have to win the game," Xie said, "I've got no matches to
lose."
</P>
<P>
Xie had one win and five draws in the first 11 games.
</P>
<P>
With a win worth of one point and a draw 0.5 point, challenger
Polgar has to score 8.5 points to wrest the title.
</P>
<P>
Xie dethroned Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia to take the world
title in 1991 and beat another Georgian Nana Ioseliani for her
first defence in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Moves to Try to Stop Boycott of Thai Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa said the government is pondering how to respond to a
campaign on the computer network for a boycott of Thai products as
a protest against government inactivity over child prostitution in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the
best way to respond to the "don't buy Thai" campaign.
</P>
<P>
American cartoonist Andrew Schwarz is reported to have launched
the campaign on the internet in mid-January, claiming that buying
Thai products would only encourage the Thai government's
inactivity over child prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister admitted on Saturday that the government had
not done enough to end child prostitution, adding that the problem
was complex and could not be solved overnight.
</P>
<P>
Sexual abuse of children in the northern provinces was a matter
of serious concern and solving the problem would take time because
it involved dealing with poverty and family matters, Banharn said.
</P>
<P>
One practical way to help was to promote child education, he
said, adding that he would ask the Education Ministry and the
Public Health Ministry to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said he had also instructed the police to strictly enforce
laws against the child sex trade and prostitution.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Deal with More Copyright Cases in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese courts handled 400
copyright cases last year, an increase of 20 percent over 1994, a
senior judge revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xianqi, vice-chief-judge of the civil court of the Supreme
People's Court, attributed the fact to China's strengthening legal
protection of copyright.
</P>
<P>
Courts nationwide heard an increasing number of new types of
copyright cases, many of them computer-related, he said.
</P>
<P>
More attention had been attached to overseas-related cases,
including one brought by the American Walt Disney organisation in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More big cases were a feature last year, Zhou said, citing some
high-technological cases involving compensation each running into
dozens of millions yuan.
</P>
<P>
These cases have caused great social concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion at home and abroad have acclaimed the
settlement of some cases," Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
However, courts have felt it more difficult to handle some
copyright disputes because of technical and other reasons, Zhou
said, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
China is considering a revision of its five-year-old copyright
law, the State Copyright Administration has announced.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that 70 percent of the 400 disputes were settled with
law verdicts, 25 percent of them were mediated, and the rest were
dealt with by other methods.
</P>
<P>
He forecast a rising number of copyright cases coming before
the courts in 1996, and stressed that importance of coordination
between courts and administrative departments.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese cities have set up special intellectual property
rights tribunals in local courts.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Library Remains the Fifth Largest in the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) -- China's National Library in
Beijing has held on to its title as the largest in Asia, despite a
threatened lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
And the library, which also ranks fifth in the world in size,
is turning over a new leaf after managing to increase its
collection by almost a million volumes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
It means the capital's famous library has crammed a staggering
19 million books onto its shelves.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman, An Ning, based in the library's general office,
said that the library has held onto the honor for eight
consecutive years since it was opened in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government had to spend 300,000 yuan (36,000
U.S. dollars) every day to cover the library's expenditure, she
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Many libraries and museums in China have been suffering money
shortages as a result of inflation. And some staff members even
quit the institutes for more lucrative jobs in foreign-backed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Among the collection in the national library, 40 percent are in
Chinese language and the rest are in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the achievement to the support of the Ministry
of Culture, as well as a thrift policy adopted by the library.
</P>
<P>
The library is still China's largest warehouse for rare books,
for example, the 1867 German edition of the "Kapital" by Karl Marx
and Buddhist scriptures found in the Dunhuang caves on the Silk
Road (1,600 years ago).
</P>
<P>
It now contains 260,000 ancient books, in addition to 3,500
pieces of tortoise shell bone on which pictograph words are
written, dating back to 16th-11th B.C..
</P>
<P>
An said that the library has received 12.5 million readers over
the past eight years and is maintaining relations with 1,000
libraries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will sponsor the 62nd International
Federation of Library Associations General Conference in August
this year, which will attract 2,500 librarians from throughout the
world.

<HEADLINE> India's CBI Chief Likely to Get Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- K. Vijaya Rama Rao, director
of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of India, is expected
to get another extension when his present term expires on April
30, the National Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
According to highly placed sources, a decision in this regard
has already been taken, said the newspaper, a mouthpiece of the
ruling Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
The expected extension is regarded as a reward for "the good
work" done by the chief of the country's premier investigating
agency and is also granted in view of the fact that he is dealing
with important and sensitive cases, particularly the hawala case
which shook the political scenario of the country, according to
press reports.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case is a bribery scandal in which some leading
Indian politicians were accused of taking money from illegal
foreign exchange traders.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Rules Out Talks With Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition parties
have ruled out talks with the government, saying it had lost its
legitimacy after Thursday's "farcical" parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minster and Chairperson of the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Begum Khaleda Zia has promised to hold
talks with the opposition after the elections over the issue of
setting up a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda has indicated that the issue could be addressed through
necessary amendments to the constitution in a bid to find solution
to the country's prolonged political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the idea, Mohammad Nasim, the organising
secretary of the Awami League, the largest opposition party in the
country, said on Saturday that there was no question of having
dialogue or signing an agreement with the BNP government which he
termed "illegal."
</P>
<P>
The opposition had all along demanded the resignation of the
prime minister to pave the way for a neutral caretaker government
to supervise the polls.  Prime Minster Khaleda rejected the
demand and the polls went ahead.
</P>
<P>
With all opposition parties boycotting Thursday's elections,
the BNP together with 40 small parties contested the polls, but
the voter turnout was very low. The BNP won the election by
winning 166 parliamentary seats out of 300, according to a
preliminary calculation of the polling results.
</P>
<P>
Nasim said a parliament elected through what he called a
"farcical election" did not have the right to enact any law or to
amend the constitution, adding that the present political crisis
can only be resolved after the resignation of the prime minister
to pave the way for the formation of a neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of the BNP's victory in the elections,
Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina asked the president of the
country to take over as the head of the government and constitute
a caretaker government headed by the chief justice to hold fresh
elections within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
BNP leaders have said they would go ahead with the caretaker
plan by making a formal offer to opposition parties for fresh
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Asked what they might do if the opposition did not respond to
the offer, a BNP leader said the possibility was that the
government side would pass a bill on a caretaker government on its
own and then call fresh elections at a suitable time.

ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- An emergency summit to give new

a first day of difficult talks between the Balkan leaders,
officials attending the summit said.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia held six and a

mediators to seek an end to violations of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters at the end

very difficult negotiation."
</P>
<P>
But he confirmed that the three parties have "completely
recommitted themselves to Dayton."
</P>
<P>
The peace deal, negotiated last November, has fractured over
prisoner exchanges, conflict in the divided Moslem-Croat city of
Mostar and Bosnian Serb anger at the extradition of two Serb
officers accused of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Serbian sources said one of the biggest problems on the Rome
agenda was the timetable for the takeover of Serb-held suburbs in
Sarajevo by the Bosnian government.

Milosevic and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic were all

HANOI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is planning to transform
at least 100 more state-owned companies into joint stock firms by

</P>

municipalities had been asked to list one or four companies for
the program.
</P>

The country has so far sold five state firms to share-holders
since 1993. The new program will target more than 100 state firms,
or about one-fifth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The government will retain at least a 20-30 percent share in
the stock firms and foreigners will not be allowed to buy any of
the equities, the official said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that those state-run companies playing a "decisive
role in the country's cultural and material life" will remain
intact.

HANOI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese men are Asia's
heaviest smokers with 73.4 percent surveyed saying they are
addicted to cigarettes, local press said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has the largest proportion of male smokers in Asia,
more than Japan's 66 percent and China's 61 percent, according to
a survey conducted by Vietnam's Sociology Institute in Hanoi and
the University of California.
</P>
<P>
Only four percent of Vietnamese women are cigarette smokers
with their age ranging from 50 to 70, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The annual consumption of cigarettes in the country was 373
cigarettes per capita in 1989 and 535 cigarettes in 1994, which
cost about 61 U.S. dollars, enough to buy 169 kilograms of rice
needed to feed a man for a whole year, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 38 percent of the addicts preferred foreign
cigarettes, and about 7.3 million Vietnamese, or about one-tenth
of the population, will have their lives shortened by smoking
cigarettes, said the survey.

<HEADLINE> More Work Needed for Genuine Bosnia Peace, Bildt Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Much more work should be done to
bring peace to the war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite some
progress in rebuilding the former Yugoslav republic under the
Dayton peace accord, EU mediator Carl Bildt said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest tension in Sarajevo and the Bosnian southwestern
city of Mostar highlighted the difficulty in translating the peace
accord into reality, said Bildt, who is here for a two-day
international Bosnia summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit will begin today with the participation of envoys
from the United States, Russia and the European Union (EU) as well
as the presidents of Croatia, Bosnia and Yugoslavia's Serbian
Republic.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the U.S., aims to give new impetus to
the stalled peace process over the Bosnian government's takeover
of the Serb-held part of Sarajevo, the pursuit of war criminals
and the reunification of Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Mostar, which should be reunited under the terms of the Dayton
peace accord, has been divided between Muslims and Croats since
1992 when the two former allies began to fight each other.
</P>
<P>
Bildt described the Bosnian Serbs' absence in the Rome meeting
as indicative of their "fragile" trust in the world community.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Aguelli said the Bosnian peace
process should not be suspended because of temporary obstacles and
the peace accord should be honored. Italy is the holder of the
rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
One of the meeting's purposes is to send a strong and clear
message to the Bosnian people that the region is entitled to
peace, development and stability in the future, she said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will help create an environment for the former
Bosnian warring factions to reconcile and open dialogues, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Phuket as Sri Lankan Rebels' Base Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Phuket governor has
denied allegations that his island province has been used by the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels to smuggle drugs
and guns to support their war back at home.
</P>
<P>
The sea off Thailand's southern resort is strictly and
regularly patrolled and it would be difficult for arms shipments
to pass unchecked, the Bangkok Post today quoted Phuket governor
Sudjit Nimitkul as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's state-run newspaper, the Daily News, Saturday
claimed that Phuket was the origin of a Tamil Tiger arms ship sunk
by the Sri Lankan navy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sudjit said foreign ships entering Phuket waters are usually
strictly checked, and the marine police and the Thai navy's third
fleet also regularly patrol the coast to prevent illegal
activities in Thai territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar asked Thailand to supply it with any information on
activities by LTTE guerrillas following claims that the group was
operating on an island in the Andaman sea.
</P>
<P>
After an investigation, the Thai military said it had found no
evidence to support Colombo's suspicion.

<P>
ZAGREB, February 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO Implementation Forces
(IFOR) said today that they had released all 11 terrorist suspects
detained Thursday near Fojnica, a town in the government
controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Col. John Kirkwood said in Sarajevo that of the
11 suspects, one with Iranian diplomatic passport was released
immediately after an interrogation and the rest were handed over
to the Bosnian government Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The 11 people were arrested at a facility that NATO believed
was used to train terrorists.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. General Julian Burns attached to the IFOR
headquarters in Sarajevo, the documents seized in the NATO raid on
Thursday showed the facility had been used for preparing
terrorist activities, including an attack on one of IFOR's bases.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement issued by the Interior Ministry of the
Bosnian Federation criticized NATO's action as "unnecessary and
inappropriate" because the facility was an anti-terrorist center,
where special police units were trained to arrest war criminals.

NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- New York State Governor
George E. Pataki today declared that his state officially
recognizes February 19 as Lunar New Year's Day and called the

It is duly fitting that the whole state join with the Chinese
Americans in commemorating the Lunar New Year.

He said, "On February 19, 1996, people of Chinese heritage
around the world will celebrate the arrival of the Year of the
Rat. The rat, the first of twelve animals represented in the lunar
calendar, symbolizes the start of a new rotation of the Chinese
zodiac. This will be a year in which we begin a new era of peace,
progress and prosperity."

Pataki highly appreciated the Chinese in America for their
contributions to both the New York State and the United States as
a whole.

HANGZHOU, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Insurance companies in
Hangzhou, capital city of east China's Zhejiang Province, provided
cover valued at 150 billion yuan and settled 466 million
yuan-worth of claims in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Subsidiaries in Hangzhou of the People's Insurance Company of
China, the Pacific Insurance Co.Ltd, and the Pingan Insurance
Co.Ltd, China's top three insurers, received 1.17 billion yuan in
premiums, statistics released by the Insurance Society in Hangzhou
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that more than 300,000 people have bought
policies in Hangzhou, a city famous for its scenic West Lake,
because residents have stronger sense of insurance and their per
capita income has surged to 6,000 yuan from 2,000 yuan in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Population is aging, government-supported social security
network is giving part of its ground to commercial insurance, and
people have felt the significance of insurance in providing
security and even investment opportunities," some experts say.
</P>
<P>
Family property life insurance and life insurance are the
products Hangzhou residents like most, and policies for the sons
and daughters of one-child families are the most favored among
young couples.
</P>
<P>
Since China opened Hangzhou to foreign financial institutions
at the end of 1995, some overseas insurance companies have sent
groups to investigate opportunities in the city.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday called for ridding national politics of "big money"
and attack ads.
</P>
<P>
"`We have got to make democracy work for America," the
Associated Press quoted Clinton as saying when he addressed more
than 3,000 citizens of southeastern New Hampshire gathered in a
community auditorium.
</P>
<P>
Clinton opened a five-city romp through New Hampshire's primary
politics, calling for fundamental change in the ground rules of
campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
The president said that should include giving candidates free
television time to make their case to the voters and discouraging
attack ads and the influence of big money.
</P>
<P>
"Let's put politics aside, work together and get this done,"
Clinton said in his weekly radio address, taped for broadcast
today.
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that even here in New Hampshire, with its proud
tradition of town meetings and studied debate over the issues,
people want all of us in politics to clean up our act," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton endorsed legislation sponsored by two senators, which
he said would limit spending, end the "soft money" system of
campaign contributions to political parties and curb the influence
of political action committees and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's planned schedule would take him to events in
Portsmouth, Rochester, Keene, Manchester and Nashua.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is running unopposed in New Hampshire's Democratic
primary Tuesday, said political reform is needed because
"organized interests have too much influence in the halls of
government."

<HEADLINE> Serbs Move out of Serb Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- About 800 Serbs left their
homes in Sarajevo's Hadzici suburb today just one month before the
sector is transferred to the control of the Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnia peace accord, five Serb-controlled Sarajevo
sectors, including Hadzici, must be handed over to the Bosnian
government on March 19 to make the capital a united city.
</P>
<P>
Ratko Radic, president of the Hadzici district council, said
that the Serbs were heading for Bratunac in eastern Bosnia, where
they have been allowed to settle down, according to Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs are moving out of Hadzici in line with a decision of
the Serb Sarajevo City Council, made recently by the Serb
government which leaves it to the Serbs themselves to decide
whether to stay or move out after the city is reunited again next
month.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1991 census, there were 160,000 Serbs in
Sarajevo, accounting for 30 percent of the city's population, as
against 35,000 Croats (6.6 percent) and 260,000 Muslims (49.3
percent). About 10 percent of Sarajevans declared themselves as
Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, thousands of Serbs have fled their
homes in Sarajevo to other Serb territories, fearing possible
retaliation by the Muslim authorities for the siege of the city by
the Serbs during the past three and half years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Block EU Funds to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government is
Determined to block not only European Union funds to Turkey but
also Ankara's Customs Union with the community which is scheduled
to be discussed on March 25, the country's Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos said today.
</P>
<P>
Greece has already requested a month's postponment of the
Customs Union discussion by the EU, the minister told a press
conference on the occasion of the first meeting of the World
Hellenism Council in northern Greek city of Salonika.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said in order to give its consent to the unanimous
decision of the Council of Ministers for the EU-Turkey Customs
Union, Greece will request the inclusion of Thursday's
Europarliament resolution on the recent crisis in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
A declaration passed by the European Parliament accused Turkey
of ''provocative military operations'' and violation of Greece's
''sovereign rights''.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the EU funds provided for Turkey under terms of
the Customs Union agreement, Pangalos said that there was a
preamble to the accord stipulating that a condition for the
advancement of the Customs Union was that Ankara maintains good-
neighbourly relations and respects international law.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Turkey has violated the agreement and
therefore we feel it is logical on our part to want to discuss the
entire issue again. Of course there will be no funding until this
discussion has been completed," Pangalos said.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects for Greek-Turkish relations, Pangalos said
Ankara "has upgraded its demands against Greece by openly
claiming territory" and urged Turkey to respect international
law.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey has long been at odds over a number of
isuues, including demarkation of the territory waters and airspace
in the Aegean and the Cyprus issue. the recent military stand-off
in the eastern Aegean over the sovereingty of the Imia Island
rought the two countries to the brink of war.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- PLO official Nabil Shaath said
today that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat welcomes Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's call for holding an Egyptian,
Palestinian and Jordanian tripartite summit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Saut Al Arab (Voice of Arabs)
Radio, Shaath described the call as "truly positive."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, following his meeting with Jordan's King Hussein in
Cairo Thursday, told reporters that he hopes to have a summit with
the Jordanian monarch and Arafat in Cairo soon to back the
Palestinian stance in the final stage of the PLO-Israeli peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, member of the elected Palestinian Legislative Council,
said that Mubarak's call is very important because the summit will
pressure Israel into continuing the peace march and implementing
what has been agreed upon with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
The local press also reported today that the summit is expected
to take place following the Lesser Bairam, which begins Tuesday,
marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier media reports, Mubarak extended his
invitation to Arafat for the summit during a telephone
conversation between the two leaders Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria, one of the Egypt's leading newspapers, said in an
editorial today that the expected summit will seek to create a
suitable atmosphere conducive to maintaining serious negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shaath, outgoing Planning Minister at the Palestinian
Authority, also said that the first ever Palestinian airport in
the Gaza Strip will be completed and ready for operation by the
end of May despite obstacles posed by Israel in this regard.
