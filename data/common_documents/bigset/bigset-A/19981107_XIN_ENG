<HEADLINE> Explosion Hits Jerusalem, Killing 2, Injuring 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A suicide car bomb exploded
Friday in the heart of Jerusalem, killing two attackers and
injuring 25 Israelis, according to the latest figures given by the
police.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility
for the fresh attack that occured at 09:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) in the
Mahane Yehuda open-air market, the same site of a bomb blast in
July, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A red car loaded with explosives ripped through at the entrance
of the main thoroughfare. The Fiat was reduced to a pile of
twisted metal while black smoke rose from the burning mass,
covering the streets.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, two Hamas activists blew themselves up in the
crowded food and vegetable market, killing themselves and 16
others, and injuring 151. The twin bombing attack had disrupted
planned resumption of negotiations between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This time, the bombing is threatening to blow up the
newly-signed Wye agreement under which Israel is to surrender a
further 13 percent of the West Bank in return for hasher
Palestinian crackdown on anti-Israeli activities.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the news of the bombing, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu called off a cabinet meeting to discuss the
interim peace agreement inked less than two weeks ago in
Washington. His cabient decided to suspend the ratification
process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet debate, and an eventual vote, on the accord
had already been postponed time and again; but this time,
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis immediately upped preconditions for the process to
resume. In a statement the cabinet said it will reopen debate only
after the Palestinians take "vigorous steps for an all-out war
against terrorist organizations and their infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said ratification of the
agreement was possible as early as next week if the Palestinians
take decisive steps against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
He said the incident showed the Palestinian side has to
"fulfill their obligations to fight terror."
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned the attack,
which he said was aimed at destroying the peace process, but asked
Israel not to use it as a pretext to stop the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was doing all it could
to stop the violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA minister in charge of Jerusalem affairs, Faisal
Husseini, said the car bomb "was a rejected act conducted by those
who oppose the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Hassan Asfour, PNA state minister in charge of negotiations
affairs, said if it is proved the involvement of some Palestinian
elements, "actions should be taken to get them out of the
Palestinian ranks."
</P>
<P>
Soon after the car bombing blasted, Israel announced to
continue construction of settlements in Har Homa, a controversial
hill site in the traditional Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was the building of Jewish neighborhood at the very site 19
months ago that brought the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to a
prolonged standstill. The deadlock was only unblocked by the Wye
River agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet also demanded the convening of the
630-member Palestinian National Council to revoke clauses in the
national charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
The interim agreement does mention the annulment of the
anti-Israeli provisions, but is far less specific as to the
procedure.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Players Vote to Join Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- WNBA players voted
overwhelmingly Thursday to have the National Basketball Players
Association represent them, the same union negotiating for the
locked-out NBA players.
</P>
<P>
The players voted 55 to 24 in favor of unionizing, said Daniel
Silverman, regional director of the union. A total of 122 players
were eligible to cast ballots, which were mailed last month after
the union petitioned for an election.
</P>
<P>
The union needed a majority of the returned ballots, which
were due this past Wednesday, to be declared the bargaining unit
for the WNBA players, Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic day for women's sports and for
professional basketball," said Billy Hunter, executive director
of the NBPA, in a statement. "We are very grateful for the vote
of confidence expressed by the WNBA players and we are thrilled
to have the opportunity to represent these tremendous athletes."
</P>
<P>
More than half the WNBA players are in their second seasons
with the new league, and most of those players had contracts that
expired at the end of this past season.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues for the players are higher salaries, free
agency and improved health insurance and retirement benefits.

<HEADLINE> Russia Negotiates With EU Over Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government began
negotiations Friday with the European Commission, the executive
body of the European Union (EU), over humanitarian and food aid.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, who is in charge of
agriculture, and EU agriculture directorate chief Gui Legras were
present at the negotiation, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side briefed the EU delegation about the situation
in the country's agroindustrial sector and food market, and
answered questions raised by the guests.
</P>
<P>
Together, the two sides discussed principles for the decision
to aid Russia.
</P>
<P>
Legras, for his part, told reporters that no specific decisions
were made, saying further steps and feasibilities of the aid would
be discussed after his return to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a United States delegation prolonged their stay in
Russia for further talks on food aid after the two sides plunged
into stalemate Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Kulik said a "main difference with the Americans is about the
tax policy, and not about where to direct funds."
</P>
<P>
An initial plan envisioned that Russia channel money into
social program and the agriculture sector by selling 1.5 million
tons of grain to be provided by the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. delegation insisted that the money should go
into the Pension Fund.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unveils New Incentives for US Dollar Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif on Friday unveiled a package of incentives to make
the Special U.S. dollar bonds more attractive and restore the
confidence of investors.
</P>
<P>
"It is a step towards increasing investment and production in
the country," he said while announcing the new scheme at a special
ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said these incentives would also make up for the
difficulties faced by the overseas Pakistanis as a result of
freezing of their foreign currency accounts after the country's
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year maturity bond will be paid in LIBOR (London
Interbank Offered Rate) plus four percent interest and the
five-year bond will have LIBOR plus three percent interest and the
three-year bond will get LIBOR plus two percent interest.
</P>
<P>
Registration of the special bonds will not be compulsory and
these will be held in the form of bearer bond as well. The bonds
and interest will be exempt from wealth tax and income tax and
encashable in Pakistani currency before the maturity period.
</P>
<P>
At maturity, both the principal as well as the interest will be
payable in dollars. Purchasers will not be questioned about the
source of income and no wealth tax will be levied if bonds are
encashed in rupees before or at maturity.
</P>
<P>
These incentives will also be available to bond-holders who
purchased dollar bonds after the July 22 this year. These bonds
will be tradable at all stock exchanges of the country. Interest
on these bonds will be paid after every six months in dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Refugee Act Passed in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has passed an
act which will tighten the management of refugees amid an outcry
that refugees have contributed to the rise of crimes and other
problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
officials in Tanzania said Friday that they will study the new
law and continue to co-operate with the Tanzanian government in
settling the problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the Refugees Act, 1998, which was passed
Thursday, new members will be included in the National
Eligibility Committee, an organization responsible for
considering all applications for refugee status and recommending
to the relevant authority to or not to grant such a status.
</P>
<P>
After expansion, the committee will comprise members of
parliament (MPs) for areas hosting refugees, the Director of
Refugee Services -- a new post created under the act, members
appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs, as well as others,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR representative in Tanzania will act as the observer to
the committee.
</P>
<P>
The act, which has made amendments to laws on refugees adopted in
1965, was passed at a parliamentary session in the central city
of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Kagera Regional Commissioner Mohamed
Babu said that affected by refugees, incidents of robbery, rape
and arson have notably increased in his region.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, UNHCR senior protection
officer, Henrik Nordentost, a legal advisor, said Friday in Dar
es Salaam that the full text of the new act will be studied and
at the moment it is premature to comment on the impact of the
act.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the act may make it difficult for refugees to
move freely because violators could face stricter punishment like
being fined or imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
The new act, he said, has as well introduced "positive
things." For example, it "provides more clarity and guidance for
the procedures dealing with asylum seekers and refugees."
</P>
<P>
It will also, in accordance with U.N. conventions, guarantee
the right of education for children in refugee camps, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nordentost stressed that there exists a difference between
criminals and refugees because some criminals came to Tanzania
and disguised themselves as refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said UNHCR has did a lot in maintaining security in areas
surrounding refugee camps. This year it has provided 1.7 million
U.S. dollars in reinforcing the police force in the areas.
Vehicles, telecommunication facilities and 280 policemen have
been mobilized for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania currently plays host to more than 300,000 refugees
primarily from Burundi, DRC, Rwanda and Somalia. Most of them are
accommodated in camps in Kagera and the Lake Tanganyika region
Kigoma.

<HEADLINE> EU Continues to Prioritize Small Firms, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
spend 20 percent of its structural funds to help develop small
firms during the current program of 1994-1999, said an EU annual
report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The total money earmarked for small businesses during the
5-year period is up to 30 billion ECU (28.57 billion U.S.
dollars). It is expected to improve the productive facilities and
economic environment of small-sized enterprises, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The EU's 1997 structural funds report, which had been adopted
by the European Commission, the executive body of the EU,
concentrated on the implementation of its aid programs in 15
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Among those, Austria, Sweden and Finland had spent more money
on small firms, accounting for 30 to 40 percent of EU assistance,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed out the sharp increase in the budget
execution of programs: by the end of 1997, 52 percent of EU
contributions had been committed and 46 percent paid.
</P>
<P>
The report meanwhile found that the member states enjoying
highest implementation rates were generally the least prosperous,
and also the main beneficiaries, principally under the EU
Objective 1 including Spain, Portugal and Ireland.

<HEADLINE> ADB on Poverty Situation in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) said here Friday that the rate of economic growth has been
insufficient to offset population growth in South Asia and the
region continues to have the highest concentration of the poor in
the world, particularly in Bangladesh, eastern and central India
and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"There are indications that poverty situation in some of the
countries in the region, particularly Nepal, has remained
unchanged or may have even deteriorated over the years," the bank
said in a paper on "Poverty in Nepal and ADB's Interventions."
</P>
<P>
The paper was presented Friday by M. Ali Shah, the bank's
resident representative in Nepal, in the International Social
Studies Refresher Course on Poverty Alleviation in South and
Southeast Asia being jointly conducted here on November 2-13 by
the National Planning Commission of Nepal and the Institute of
Social Studies, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"While rich in cultural heritage and natural beauty, Nepal
remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with the level
of absolute poverty among the highest in Asia," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that according to the most recent estimates based on
the Nepal Living Standards Survey 1995/96, the level of poverty is
42 percent and earlier estimates put it at close to 50 percent as
against 36 percent in Bangladesh, 34 percent in Pakistan, 35
percent in Sri Lanka and 44 percent in South Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The poverty situation in Nepal is manifested not only in
economic terms but also in poor social conditions. Human resource
conditions in Nepal are among the poorest in the world and in
South Asia, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
For example, national per capita income is only about 200 U.S.
dollars (1995) in Nepal compared with 521 dollars in South Asia
and 867 dollars in other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Its adult literacy rate is the lowest in South Asia at 28
percent as against 38 percent in Bangladesh and Pakistan and the
South Asian average of 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Access to safe water and sanitation is 67 percent and 18
percent respectively, compared to 97 percent and 48 percent in
Bangladesh and the South Asian average of 82 percent and 36
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Nepal ranks 152nd among the 174 countries
on the 1998 Human Development Index presented by the United
Nations Development Program, and the situation is exacerbated by
rapidly growing population at 2.5 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
"Continued and widespread poverty in Nepal is primarily the
result of insufficient growth in the economy, which is agriculture
based," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Low agricultural productivity is one of the chief causes of
the poverty trap," the paper observed.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the deteriorating agriculture sector in
Nepal mainly to inefficient distribution and inadequate supply of
fertilizers, non-availability of year-round irrigation, lack of
rural infrastructure and ineffective research and extension
services.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's overall strategy for poverty alleviation in a country
as poor as Nepal emphasizes broad-based, equitable and sustainable
growth, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture has been the prime sector for bank assistance as
it will continue to be the mainstay of the population and presents
the most promising potential for growth and poverty alleviation in
the short-to-medium term," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that 46 percent of the bank's total assistance which
stands at 1.6 billion dollars for 92 loans since its operation in
Nepal in 1969 has been for the agriculture sector with a view to
increasing the agricultural productivity.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's No. 2 figure, Izzat
Ibrahim, visited the ongoing 31st Baghdad International Fair here
Friday, signaling Baghdad's willingness to cooperate with Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh,
Ibrahim visited the pavilions of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Sudan,
Palestine and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The move was viewed here as a political gesture reflecting
Iraq's desire to enhance cooperation with these Arab countries, at
a time when it is challenging the U.S. over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
As vice-chairman of Iraq's most powerful decision-making body -
Revolutionary Command Council, Ibrahim is second only to President
Saddam Hussein. He seldom made public appearance because of his
poor health.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of these countries and heads of the pavilions
briefed Ibrahim on the exhibits of their pavilions and stressed
the desire to expand trade and economic cooperation with Iraq, the
Iraqi News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The 31st Baghdad International Fair opened on November 1, a day
after Iraq announced it was halting all forms of cooperation with
the United Nations Special Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Iraq said 30 countries and 66 world companies participated in
the fair, the largest in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, despite
that Iraq is still under U.N. sanctions which have been in place
for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions can not be lifted unless U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership has vowed not to resume cooperation with
UNSCOM unless a timetable for lifting the sanctions is offered by
the U.N. Security Council.

immense and profound changes, he said, adding that "nearly 100
countries have rid themselves of the colonial yoke and achieved
independence."
</P>
<P>
The struggle against racism and racial discrimination has won
historical victories, he said, and a number of important
instruments adopted by the United Nations have set forth explicit
goals and guidelines for the promotion and protection of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
"Today, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms have
become a commitment and goal for peoples and governments around
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These developments represent great achievements in the global
cause of human rights and bespeak the historical importance of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the declaration, and
considering of human rights issues in this General Assembly
session "is therefore of particular significance," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Insists Bombing No Reason to Slow Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
insisted Friday that a land-for-peace deal between Israel and the
Palestinians should be implemented despite a car-bomb explosion in
a Jerusalem market that killed two people and wounded 21.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said more than a brief
delay to implement the agreement, signed on October 23, would only
encourage extremists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express her
condolences, while President Bill Clinton publicly deplored the
violence, saying it was an attack on efforts to bring peace to the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"(First Lady) Hillary and my deepest sympathies go out to the
victims and families of this outrageous and cowardly act," Clinton
said in a statement read on his behalf by a National Security
Council aide.
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of peace seek to derail the courageous steps taken
by the Israelis and the Palestinians at Wye River," said Clinton,
referring to a land-for-peace deal negotiated in the Wye
Plantation in Maryland and signed in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can re-gain the momentum and both sides will
implement the Wye agreement as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The suicide attack while Jews shopped in preparation for the
Sabbath prompted the Israeli Cabinet to suspend discussions of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
The agreement requires Israel to relinquish another 13 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority and the authority to
carry out an action plan to uproot terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, we cannot let the extremists, the enemies of the
peace process, destroy the hopes of Israelis and Palestinians,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin said, "we do understand the need to suspend
consideration of this in the current climate."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy on Main Obstacles in Human Rights Realm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat said here Friday that the world should "fully recognize"
of the importance of the right to subsistence and the right to
development.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the statement at the current U.N. General
Assembly session on main obstacles to the realization of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the human rights issue at the Third Committee of the
Assembly, which is in charge of social, humanitarian and cultural
matters, he said, "The Cold War has ended, but the world is still
far from tranquil."
</P>
<P>
"Local wars and armed conflicts persist, endangering the lives
of large numbers of people in certain areas" in the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The negative impacts of economic globalization have aggravated
the economic difficulties of many developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 1 billion people live under the poverty line,
eking out their existence in starvation, disease and deprivation,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"These problems undoubtedly pose serious obstacles to the
universal exercise of basic human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, certain countries or groups of countries have
arbitrarily imposed sanctions on developing countries and even
threatened the use of force against them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Such a practice constitutes serious violation of
human rights and fundamental freedoms."
</P>
<P>
China "holds that the international community should solve
differences and disputes through peaceful means on the basis of
the U.N. Charter as well as the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To eradicate poverty and backwardness, which are the main
obstacles to the implementation of human rights, full recognition
should be given to the importance of rights to subsistence and the
right to development in the promotion of human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, all countries dedicated to the promotion of human
rights should take effective actions to help developing countries
overcome difficulties in their economic development, strive to
establish a new international economic and political order, which
is just and reasonable so as to create necessary conditions for
exercise of human rights," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore, considering the question
of human rights at the 53rd General Assembly session is "of
particular significance," he added.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Inflation Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation fell sharply
from 5.2 percent in September to 4.7 percent in October, the
National Statistics Service (NSS) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the drop in inflation to lower prices for
gasoline and heating oil as a result of tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
To help reduce inflation, the Greek government has also
announced this week tax cuts on car purchases and electricity
bills.
</P>
<P>
The NSS believes that the Greek government's target of 4.5
percent by the end of December was attainable.
</P>
<P>
Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
Friday expressed his confidence that inflation would from now on
pursue a strong downward path to achieve a target of 2.0 percent
by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Reducing inflation would accelerate progress in other sectors
of the Greek economy, chiefly allowing interest rates to fall
faster and growth to accelerate.

<HEADLINE> Internet "Cyberdocs" Could Be Deadly: German Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Patients who seek medical
treatment on the Internet could be putting their lives at risk,
German doctors warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "cyberdocs," who may not be medically trained,
are dispensing information and treatments that could be dangerous,
researchers from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, wrote in
The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
The researchers requested advice on symptoms indicating a form
of herpes from 17 different U.S.-based medical websites, seven of
which charged for advice.
</P>
<P>
Although the information they provided was identical, the
advice they received varied considerably.
</P>
<P>
Of 10 cyberdocs who responded, three refused to give advice.
Five of the seven who did reply correctly diagnosed the herpes
zoster infection which needed immediate attention with a drug
called acyclovir.
</P>
<P>
But in two cases it was completely wrong and could have killed
a genuine patient, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
One cyberdoc prescribed fresh air, rainwater and dandelions.
Another recommended vitamin C and homeopathic and charged 25 U.S.
dollars for the advice.
</P>
<P>
Warning that there is no way to determine the qualification of
"cyberdocs," the researchers proposed an international,
independent body to assess cyberdocs and issue licenses for
doctors who practise on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Women More at Risk from AIDS Than Men: U.S. Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Women are more vulnerable to HIV
than men as they need 50 percent less of the virus to go on to
develop AIDS, American scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The research showed that it needs a change in clinical
guidelines on drug treatments for AIDS, said doctors from the
Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
The doctors studied the relation between viral load, the amount
of the HIV virus in the blood, and sex and their joint impact on
how the disease progresses.
</P>
<P>
Their research, involving 650 drug users, showed that viral
load values for women were roughly half those for men at a
specific CD4 cell count, a measure for assessing the body's immune
response.
</P>
<P>
The research also discovered that women were 1.6 times more
likely to contract AIDS than men with the same viral load.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by Dr Homayoon Farzadegan, reported in The
Lancet medical journal that they do not know the reason women
require less of the virus to develop AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Although the mechanism is unclear, the possibility that women
have lower viral loads than men owing to biological factors must
be considered," Dr Homayoon Farzadegan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the possibility that women, according to current
guidelines, will be undertreated on a population level must be
carefully considered."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy on Declaration of Human Rights Defenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A draft declaration
adopted by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in April this year
may not be considered an ideal document by everyone but is
acceptable to all parties concerned, a senior Chinese diplomat
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As a product of compromise, the draft resolution may not be
considered an ideal document by everyone, but it is, nonetheless,
a result acceptable to all parties participating in the
negotiation," said Shen Guofang, Chinese deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Shen made the statement as he was speaking on the question of
human rights at the Third Committee of the 53rd General Assembly
session. The committee is in charge of social, humanitarian and
cultural matters.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that "the draft resolution has established a
basic framework for individuals, groups and organs of society
engaged in human rights activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
After 14 years of efforts, the Commission on Human Rights
adopted by consensus the draft Declaration on the Right and
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to
Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation attended all the meetings of the working
group since its third session. "For the past 12 years, we have
always participated in the consultations with the desire to expand
areas of agreement and to narrow differences through dialogue on
an equal footing, and have thus made our contribution to the
drafting of the declaration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the main contents of the declaration consist of the
following elements:
</P>
<P>
-- It clearly stipulates that the state has a prime
responsibility and duty to respect human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Domestic law is the most important judicial framework for the
effective protection and promotion of human rights activities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
-- It provides for the rights and responsibility of
individuals, groups and organs of society engaged in human rights
activities. In parallel, it has also spelled out duties of
everyone towards and within the community in which alone the free
and full development of his or her personality is possible.
</P>
<P>
-- It provides that nor shall anything in the present
declaration be interpreted as permitting states to support and
promote activities of individuals, groups of individuals,
institutions or the Non-Governmental Organizations contrary to the
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation holds that implementation of the
declaration by the international community must be guided by the
aforementioned principles," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Approves Repair of 8 Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State
Abdulsalami Abubakar has approved the rehabilitation of eight
power plants to improve power supply in the country, media
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Power and Plant, Bello Suleiman was quoted by
"This Day" newspaper as saying at a seminar Thursday in Abuja
that the eight plants currently produce a total of 2,788 mega
watts out of their combined capacity of 5,876 mega watts.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the rehabilitation will be carried out
within the next four to six months.
</P>
<P>
Frequent power cut due to ailling generators and distribution
systems has been causing great inconviences in the daily life of
Nigerians and at the same time increased the cost of business.
</P>
<P>
The minister estimated that it will cost Nigeria 23.94 billion
U.S. Dollars to repair all its power plants and build new ones to
improve the power supply situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will need 21 years for Nigeria to get the
funds even if all the internally generated revenue of the
National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) are devoted to the work
plus the annual budgetary allocation of three billion Naira
(about 35 million dollars) to the power sector.
</P>
<P>
Suleiman called on the private sector to invest in the power
industry, especially in the generation sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that 16 new sites have been identified for investors
to build new power plants.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that even if all the existing power plants
get rehabilitated and the 16 new ones built, it will be just
enough to meet Nigeria's projected capacity need of 20,962 mega
watts by the year 2008.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Sign Three Protocols on Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States at
last signed here Friday evening three protocols on the shipment of
U.S. food and humanitarian aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
These documents were signed by Russian Vice-Premier Gennady
Kulik and U.S. ambassador to Russia James Collins, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first protocol provides for a purposeful credit against
goods at an amount of 600 million dollars for the purchase of 1.5
million tons of foods.
</P>
<P>
The second protocol announces the U.S. intention to donate 1.5
million tons of food wheat to Russia. The proceeds will be
transferred to the Pension Fund and used in social programs.
</P>
<P>
The third protocol provides for the humanitarian aid of 100,000
tons of foods, to be delivered right to regions.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the protocols, the two countries will soon
prepare intergovernmental agreement, under which the United States
will provide Russia with 1.5 million tons of wheat for free,
100,000 tons of humanitarian aid and a tied loan of 600 million
U.S. dollars to buy U.S. food, said the Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Kulik said that an agreement was reached at the talks that no
taxes or duties will be levied on the humanitarian food shipments
on the border.
</P>
<P>
Collins said that the United States will participate in the
control of the distribution and use of the humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Russia and the U.S. failed to sign the
necessary documents Thursday due to some misunderstanding. A
compromise was found later.
</P>
<P>
Kulik noted that the U.S. provided Russia with a tied loan of
600 million dollars for food purchases on very favorable terms:
for a period of 20 years with a 2 percent annual interest rate and
a five-year delay in payment.
</P>
<P>
The agreements will help Russian companies, including poultry
farms, animal-feed producers and grain-processing enterprises, to
resume normal operation, the Russian vice-premier said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela Friday expressed deep shock at the death of President Mohamed
Taki Abdulkarim of the Comoros, the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government and people of South Africa, President
Mandela conveys his sincere condolences to the family of the late
president as well as to the people of the Comoros," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Mandela described Taki's death as a sad loss not only for the
Comoros, but also for the entire African continent.
</P>
<P>
Taki, 62, died suddenly overnight Thursday, apparently of a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the South African government will continue its
efforts to facilitate negotiations aimed at resolving divisions within
the archipelago and hoped that President Taki's untimely death will
lead all political forces in the country to recommit themselves to
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Comoros has had a turbulent history. Several coups have occurred
since it obtained independence from France in 1975. Two of its islands
seceded unilaterally in August last year.

The U.N. chief condemned such acts, which had the obvious
purpose of derailing the peace process in the Middle East.

<P>
Annan said those espoused terrorism and violence must not be

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Admits Having Troops in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Friday admitted to
having deployed troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), and said it would support the withdrawal of all foreign
troops from the country.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Rwandan Vice-
President Paul Kagame as saying in Pretoria that his country's
military involvement in the DRC conflict was aimed at protecting
Rwanda's national security.
</P>
<P>
After an hour-long meeting with South African President Nelson
Mandela, Kagame said Rwanda supports regional peace efforts in the
DRC, and it will consider withdrawing its troops if its
security concerns are addressed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela welcomed Kagame's admission, saying it would help
clear the way for peace talks between parties involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's initial refusal to acknowledge that it had deployed
troops to the DRC had created immense difficulties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Rwanda, through the vice-president, has made this
acknowledgement I think that we have reason to believe that there
is going to be progress."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the stalemate could not be allowed to continue
for too long, adding that he was pleased with progress made so
far.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that there will be faster progress now."
</P>
<P>
He said the next step would be to hold another meeting of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), although he could
not give a date.
</P>
<P>
"The statement now by the vice-president means that what was a
stumbling block at the last meeting in Lusaka has now been
removed."
</P>
<P>
He was refer2$L"3\/ of foreign and defense ministers
of some 12 African countries over the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kagame said Rwanda initially denied having deployed troops in
Rwanda because it did not want to be seen as fuelling the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning there were different complications because
people were confusing issues. They were confusing any information
about the presence of our troops as the problem. They did not
realize that the problem was basically an internal one."
</P>
<P>
Kagame said the Rwandan troops were first deployed in the DRC
around August, adding the intervention was prompted by, among
other things, attacks on his country by militias inside the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"When (DRC) President (Laurent) Kabila consistently talked of
taking the war to Rwanda, then we had no other options but to
deal with that situation," Kagame said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said security for all countries in the region centered
around putting into effect a joint statement issued by the SADC
in August.
</P>
<P>
The body resolved that there should be a cease-fire, a
withdrawal of foreign troops and negotiations that would lead to
democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
"That will secure the borders of all neighboring countries,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Kagame said independent military forces were also active in
the DRC conflict and hoped this would be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela replied: "A proper settlement will not only consist of
the withdrawal of foreign troops, but all militias inside the
Congo."
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting was the second between Mandela and Kagame in
a few weeks aimed at bringing peace to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rebel forces intent on overthrowing Kabila's government are
being backed by Uganda and Rwanda, and government troops by
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has admitted having troops
in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Spain Supports Lebanon on Israeli Pullout: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Spanish official said
here Friday that his country supports Lebanon on the
implementation of the United Nations Resolution 425 which demands
an unconditional Israeli pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ramon de Miguel, Spanish state secretary for foreign and
European Union affairs, said in a news conference that his
country believes that Lebanon's territorial integrity is an
essential factor of the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After two invasions, Israel carved out a self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting
its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israel offered to withdraw its troops from
south Lebanon on conditions that Lebanese government make
arrangement to guarantee the security of its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the offer, asking for Israel's pullout without
any preconditions, as stipulated in the the U.N. resolution
adopted 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Miguel stressed that peace should not be confined only to
Palestine and Israel but should be a full and comprehensive
settlement which includes Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Wye Plantation accord paved the way for the
resumption of negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in
the peace process which have been stalled for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed an interim peace deal in
Washington, breaking a 19-month deadlock in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel is to withdraw from a further 13 percent
of the West Bank in exchange for harsher Palestinian crackdown on
anti-Israeli militants.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish official arrived here Thursday on a regional tour
which has taken him to Jordan and Syria.

promote their cultural heritage and not to concentrate only on
marketing wildlife and natural resources.
</P>
<P>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Developments of human
rights have a good deal to offer in terms of experiences as well
as lessons over the past 50 years since the adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a senior Chinese diplomat
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the statement as he was addressing the Third
Committee of the 53rd General Assembly session. The committee is
in charge of social, humanitarian and cultural matters.
</P>
<P>
"Differences in the treatment of human right issues often boil
down to whether one strives to find common ground or to accentuate
differences and whether one seeks dialogue or confrontation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"These contrasting attitudes reflect two fundamentally
different approaches that have long existed in the area of
international human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The end of the Cold War has undoubtedly laid important
foundations for the advancement of the global causes of human
rights into the new century," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All countries today acknowledge that no country in the world
has a perfect human rights record and that all have the
responsibility and obligation to promote and protect human
rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the interests of common efforts of the promotion of human
rights advances, all countries should endeavor to enhance
exchanges, promote understanding and reduce differences on the
basis of equality and mutual respect so that confrontation will
give way to dialogue and conflict will be replaced by
cooperation," he said.

HARARE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will always support the
cause for both regional and international peace, President Robert
Mugabe said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Zimbabwe will undertake these obligations under the
auspices of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and

ADDIS ABABA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian delegation
will attend the meeting of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) aimed at seeking a peaceful solution to the Ethio-Eritrean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome
Taddesse said in a statement Friday that the Ethiopian
delegation, led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, with Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin as one of its members, will attend the
meeting scheduled for the weekend in Ouagadougou, capital of
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Taddesse said: "Ethiopia has no doubt that the OAU Heads of
State will base their recommendations on the findings of the OAU
committee of Ambassadors which reached the conclusion that the
town of Badme and its environs were administered by Ethiopia
prior to May 12."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Netanyahu not to Halt Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat phoned Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday in the wake of a suicide
bombing in Jerusalem, urging him not to halt the peace deal the
two signed last month.
</P>
<P>
During the phone conversation Arafat expressed sorrow for the
attack, which blew up the two assailants and injured 25 shoppers
and passers-by in the central Mahane Yehuda food and vegetable
market.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on Netanyahu not to halt the peace agreement
under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent more of the West
Bank in exchange for Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the two bombers were from PNA-controlled
areas. He told Arafat that for the process to continue, the
Palestinians would have to step up their war against terrorists in
a significant way, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu decided for the fourth time in about a week to
postpone a cabinet deliberation on the peace accord, which would
finally lead to its ratification, after the bombing ripped through
at 9:45 a.m. (0745 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said the military wing of the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has claimed responsibility for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The military wing also claimed responsibility for an earlier
suicide bombing in Gaza at the end of October, in which an Israeli
soldier was killed when his jeep intercepted a Palestinian car
loaded with explosives ramming at a bus carrying children of
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which opposed the Oslo peace process, has accused
Arafat of selling out the Palestinian interests by signing the
land-for-security agreement with Netanyahu on October 23.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the suicide bombing, hundreds of supporters of
three Palestinian militant groups demonstrated in the Gaza Strip
in protest of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The rally was jointly organized by Hamas, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction of the
Palestinian Liberation Organization, and the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators urged Arafat to repudiate making peace with
the Israelis and to join them in the armed struggle. "Revolution
is the solution," they chanted.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Reaffirms Decision to Deploy Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides reaffirmed on Friday his government's decision
to deploy Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles, Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides, who is in London for talks with his British
counterpart Robin Cook, told London Greek Radio that "this
decision continues to be valid and will be implemented if nothing
happens to meet the security concerns of the people of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides added that the Greek Cypriot-controlled government
would try to avoid undermining any effort toward the solution of
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after a recent European Union Commission
report on candidates for EU membership said the delivery of
missiles to Cyprus has again been delayed until spring next year.
</P>
<P>
The report expressed serious concerns about the consequences of
the deployment of the missiles as efforts are being made in
pursuit of a peaceful solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Greek coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government signed the 227-million-U.S.-dollar missile
deal with Russia early last year. The surface-to-air missiles were
seen as a sophisticated defensive weapon to protect the Cyprus
army from the threat of Turkish air attacks.
</P>
<P>
The United States and a number of European nations, including
Britain, have expressed their strong opposition to the deal, while
Turkey has threatened to launch pre-emptive strike against the
missiles if they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the Russians were to deliver the
missiles by July this year. The original delivery date was
put back until the end of autumn and then until the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government has declared that it would cancel the missile
deal only if there is sufficient progress toward an overall
settlement of the Cyprus issue or the demilitarization of the
island.

In a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,

Speth said each of the United Nations agencies was focusing on
its own area of expertise and, in some cases, working within a
particular geographic location.
</P>
<P>
"In additional to facilitating the emergency response, UNDP is
laying the groundwork for a shift in the months ahead from relief
to comprehensive rehabilitation and reconstruction," the
administrator said.

NAIROBI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) said Friday that the Angolan
troops are reinforcing its key counter-attack against the rebels
in the central and eastern fronts.
</P>
<P>
"They are there and more are moving in," Reuters quoted DRC
Information Minister Didier Mumengi as saying.

A local newspaper in the war-torn central African country

Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad have reportedly sent troops
to help DRC President Laurent Kabila crack down on the Tutsi-led
rebels who have been fighting for overthrowing Kabila since
August 2.
</P>

Mumengi said that Kabila's forces and their allies exchanged
fires with the rebels on different fronts in Eastern Kasai
Province and around the town of Kalemie on Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
The rebels still hold about a third of the vast country,
mainly in the east and northeast close to Rwanda, Uganda and the

<HEADLINE> Saddam to Explain Iraq's Standoff with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
to send letters to Arab leaders and envoys to some countries to
explain Iraq's stance on a recent standoff with the U.N. over
weapons inspections, an Iraqi official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"These moves aim at elaborating on a host of facts related to
the Iraqi position on cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission," or UNSCOM, Iraqi Minister of Agriculture Abdil-Ilah
Hamid Saleh said during a stopover at Cairo airport en route to
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced Saturday to cut off cooperation with UNSCOM,
charged with investigating the country's weapons of mass
destruction. The move is seen as a protest at the U.N. Security
Council's failure to propose a timetable for the lifting of trade
embargo.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, can not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We have proofs that the UNSCOM includes elements from the
(Israeli intelligence service) Mossad holding forged passports,"
Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has accused UNSCOM of donning the cloak of the U.N. but
spying for Israel and the United States, which it denounces
manipulates the U.N. weapons inspections in an attempt to prolong
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Former U.N. arms inspector Scott Ritter, an American who
resigned in August, has said that he routinely briefed Israeli
intelligence agents on the findings of Iraq's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister was heading to Khartoum for a meeting of a
joint panel on bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar said Friday that his government is
implementing fundamental reforms to restore normalcy to the
energy sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the opening of the 1998 International Trade

steps to address the menacing problem of energy crisis,
particularly fuel scarcity."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar who was represented by the Minister of Commerce and
Tourism, Major General Patrick Aziza, assured that the fuel
situation would normalize "in the near future."

completed early next year with the Kaduna refinery already being
test-run.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also said in the message that his government is
committed to the pursuit of economic liberalization and
deregulation which would further serve to open up the economy to
a greater level of private investment.

would be enacted in due course, adding that this policy would
enable the private sector "to play a leading role in the process
of economic revitalization and transformation."
</P>
<P>
He gave an assurance that the government would work toward a
credible democratization process and the sustenance of
macro-economic stability with a view to stimulating confidence in
the economy.

Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) attracted foreign
companies from more than 10 countries including China, India,
Pakistan, Egypt, South Africa, the United States and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Gains Turkish Support over Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen wound up his short visit here Friday with the impression
that Ankara will support Washington in the event of a military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told a press conference here that "we have the support of
all our friends should any military action be required. What
action that might constitute will be discussed in the future.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we have had a very strong relationship with
Turkey over the years and that friendship will continue."
</P>
<P>
Immediately following Iraq's refusal to cooperate with the
United Nations Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM),
Cohen set out for Europe and the Gulf countries early in the week
to seek support for a possible military strike against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's visit to Turkey is reported to have concentrated on
the use of Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey to strike targets
in Iraq, although no official confirmation was made.
</P>
<P>
Cohen had talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
met with his Turkish counterpart Ismet Sezgin and Chief of
General Staff Huseyin Kivrikoglu during his short stay here.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Turkish presidential palace said that
Cohen did not make any special requests of Turkey but asked
Ankara to continue its position held out during previous crises.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Saddam Hussein will take action to reconsider
his flagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions," Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. Security Council resolution Thursday demanded that Iraq
resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors but stopped short of
explicitly allowing military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen had visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Egypt and Jordan before traveling
on to Turkey.

KAMPALA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Uganda
Menashe Zipori has pleaded on behalf of his government to extend
assistance to Makerere University toward private sector
development, Uganda News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador made the call Friday when closing a
two-week diary processors course in the university with funding
from Israel.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Zipori as saying that future collaboration
will be geared toward more advanced projects in agricultural
commercialization and modernization.
</P>
<P>
He commended the university for identifying development
projects for Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
John Ssebuwufu, vice chancellor of the university, said that
food processing techniques are very relevant to a growing economy
like Uganda's, where value-added commodities exhibit better terms
of trade as opposed to primary, unprocessed agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
The Faculty of Agriculture and Fishery of Makerere University
is currently involved in demand-driven short courses, farmer
out-reach and agricultural extension programs.
</P>
<P>
Linkages and collaboration between stakeholders is very

<HEADLINE> Romania to Receive Joint But Conditioned Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A joint effort is decided to
be made by the reputed international financiers to prevent a
collapse in Romania similar to those in Moldova or Russia.
</P>
<P>
Prone to finance Romania much enough to prevent the economic
crisis are financial bodies such as the International Monetary
Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the
World Bank and the European Union, the national Rompres news
agency reported on Friday citing the Transport Minister Traian
Basescu as saying.
</P>
<P>
To open financing, the international financiers have put
several conditions amid which the most important are those of
economic nature: losses diminishing in the Romanian economy, such
as the 15 large Romanian loss-making plants annually producing
20,000 billion lei (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) losses.
</P>
<P>
The other conditions refer to the administrative and
institutional reform as well as the stability of the national
economy, Basescu said.
</P>
<P>
The international financial bodies also warned that "should any
political party quit the current ruling coalition, the external
financing either does not start or it is cut immediately."
</P>
<P>
Romania is currently undergoing a most serious economic crisis.
Data provided by the National Commission for Statistics showed
that 1998 is the year of the poorest economic performance after
1989.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output fell by 17.3 percent in the first three
quarters, due to lower production in the manufacturing sector,
piled-up stocks of finite products and lower consumption. The
trade deficit exceeded 2 billion U.S. dollars, from about 1.5
billion dollars last year, following the steady rise in imports
and diminished exports.
</P>
<P>
The periodic report on Romania released early this week by the
European Commission also noted that "the macro-economic state is
obviously impairing, and the reform process in Romania is
delayed."
</P>
<P>
Romania's Prime Minister Radu Vasile estimated the tough period
Romania is currently going through will last for more three up to
seven months, with the first positive results likely to appear
during the third term of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Iran Is Best Export Route for Caspian Oil: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan
Namdar Zanganeh said here Saturday that Iranian territory is "the
shortest, least expensive, safest and the most
environment-friendly route" for transfer of Caspian oil.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh made the remarks at the opening session of a two-day
international conference on the Caspian oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the United States for its action to block the
transfer of Caspian oil through Iran, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that as long as the U.S. economic sanctions
on Iran stand, the Caspian energy resources will not be
economically developed and exported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has repeatedly announced its opposition to the plan to
transfer the Caspian oil and gas through Iranian soil. In order to
contain Tehran, Washington also threatened to punish foreign
companies which invest in Iran's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. strongly supports the plan to transfer the Caspian
oil through Azarbaijan Republic to Turkish port of
Ceyhan. However, the international consortium which will decide on
the export routes believes that the plan is too costly.
</P>
<P>
Eventually economics will have the final say, Zanganeh said,
all sanctions are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the time has come to set aside the unilateral
political considerations to pave the way for entrance of the
Caspian Sea in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"If the risks of the regional projects are to diminish and for
the investment companies to carry out the most economical
alternatives, the political and economic cooperation amongst the
regional countries has to be enhanced, and tensions have to be
avoided in the Caspian region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Freezing Talks Not Solution to Violence: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has urged Israel to continue the peace talks with the Palestinians
in face of violence, instead of freezing the process, the Egyptian
Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I tell the Israelis that the solution does not lie in freezing
negotiations. Challenges to peace process should be faced boldly
and courageously," Mubarak said in an exclusive interview with the
Arabic-language Al Gomhuria newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was commenting on Israel's decision to halt the cabinet
consideration of the latest interim peace agreement in the wake of
Friday's deadly car bomb explosion in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed the two suicide bombers and injured more than
20 shoppers in the crowded open-air market in central
Jerusalem. The militant group Islamic Jihad has claimed
responsibility for the attack in a statement issued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said few believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will carry out the interim peace deal signed with the
Palestinians in Washington two week ago. The deal provides for
Israeli withdraw from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in
return for intensified Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
"If you (Netanyahu) want to change the picture, then you will
have no choice but to take the practical measures for the
implementation (of the accord)," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The accord, originally expected to be implemented starting
mid-November, is now indeed face delays. It should be ratified by
the Israeli cabinet and parliament first.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had postponed thrice the cabinet debate and vote on
the agreement before the car bomb ripped through in Jerusalem
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Jerusalem explosion, Mubarak said such attacks
take place everywhere in the world, stressing that "it is
necessary to deny the peace enemies, who are many, any
opportunity."
</P>
<P>
He warned that unless the West Bank accord is implemented as
agreed, no one may guarantee that attacks will not occur in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he highlighted the prospect that peace will enable
the Israelis and Palestinians alike to live in peace and stability
and implement development plans sought by the Middle East
peoples.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Renewed Over Control of Somali Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- After four days of lull in
the fighting for control of the southern Somali port of Kismaio,
heavy fighting flared up again Saturday between the Marehan clan
militiamen and those mainly Majerten fighters in and outside the
town.
</P>
<P>
According to independent sources, the mainly Majerten clan
fighters launched the attack on four Marehan militia bases
outside the town Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Each side conducted heavy shelling from mortar rounds and
anti-aircraft guns in the attack and counter attack operations.
</P>
<P>
Since the fighting is still going on, there are no exact
casualty figures available at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The Somali National Front (SNF) faction of Marehan issued a
warning Saturday for both local and international
non-governmental organization (NGOs) operating in Kismaio not to
try to use the air and seaports of the town.
</P>
<P>
The SNF has declared Kismaio and its surrounding areas as a
war zone.

The fighting has already caused humanitarian difficulties for
the civilians of the town following the cessation of business and
aid supply activities to the town.

<HEADLINE> 1917 Revolution Marked by Demonstrations in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The 81st anniversary of Russia's
October Revolution of 1917 was marked on Saturday by nationwide
rallies and demonstrations from Far East to the West.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 people from left-wing oppositions were gathered
at some main places in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally on the Lubyanskaya Square in Moscow,
Communist Party Leader Gennady Zyuganov called on deputies of all
levels "to put their signatures under a demand to remove Russian
President Boris Yeltsin from office" in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to work out a new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Movement in Army Support Viktor Ilyukhin
proposed to abolish the presidency in Russia and transform it into
a parliamentary republic.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested holding alongside the next State Duma
elections a national referendum on the abolition of the presidency
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the rally demanded that the Russian media be
purged of Yeltsin's underlings, accusing journalists as deliberate
and active conductors of this unpopular regime.
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted a resolution calling for the set-up of a
public committee to probe into the conduct of these and other
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 2,000 people gathered on Vasilyevsky slope
near the Kremlin paraded through the Red Square at 14:30 Moscow
time (9030 GMT), when the rally was over, despite a refusal from
the Kremlin commandant's office.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations on Saturday were dominated by supporters of
the Russian Communist Party, the Movement in Army Support, the
Russian Communist Workers and other parties. Among the marchers
there were State Duma lawmakers and other officials.
</P>
<P>
Besides the capital city, places such as Novosibirsk,
Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Khabarovsk, Krasnoyarsk, Yakutsk, Ulan-Ude
and Irkutsk also witnessed demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over TV on the Day of Accord and Reconciliation which
the Communists celebrate as another anniversary of the October
revolution, Yeltsin again asked the Russian people to achieve
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the revolutionary period in the
Russian history was over for good. "No matter how our reform is
being criticized today, the main thing has been done," he said.

<HEADLINE> Polar Spirit Retains Overall Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
DALI, China, November 7 (Xinhua) -- After two days of
frustration, Team Eco-Internet came from behind to win the third
stage of the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Paced by team captain Robert Nagle, Eco-internet overcame a
puncture early in the opening mountain bike leg and pulled away
during the 26km kayak across Erhai Lake. "If it wasn't for bad
luck we'd have no luck at all," Nagle joked afterward.
</P>
<P>
Overall race leader Team Polar Spirit finished fourth on S
aturday, but still retained their overall race lead. With just
one day of competition remaining, Polar Spirit holds a tenuous
six-minute lead over Team EAR.
</P>
<P>
Despite a gritty display of courage and teamwork that
exemplified the spirit of the MSOQ, Team Mild Seven of China, a
local crowd favorite, finished seventh and dropped in the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
Team member Cao Xinxin raced despite a severe foot injury
suffered during Friday's mountaineering stage. "That's what this
race is all about," said Don Baker, Team Mild Seven coach. "Cao's
courage and endurance showed her commitment to the team and the
competition and to doing her very best."
</P>
<P>
The Mild Seven Outdoor Quest is a multisport endurance
competition. Four-person teams, each having at least one woman,
race a total of 230km over the course of four stages. The events
include mountain biking, trail running, mountaineering, lake
paddling, kayaking team biathlon and offroad inline skating.
</P>
<P>
Teammates must stay together at all times, working as a single
unit to encourage one another. The team with the lowest elapsed
time at the end of Sunday's fourth stage will be declared the
winner.
</P>
<P>
On legs already weary from trail running and mountain biking,
and with arms exhausted from almost 50km of paddling, teams will
begin the last day's race with a 20km team biathlon (a mountain
bike/running event where teammates take turns riding and
running), 3km of trail running, 1km of lake paddling in a
traditional local watercraft, 15km of offroad inline skating,
then another 15km of team biathlon.
</P>
<P>
The race for 1998 MSOQ champion has come down to two teams.
Polar Spirit and EAR are within six minutes. A handful of teams
are further back, but poised to move up in the standing should
the leaders falter.
</P>
<P>
"I think the ride-and-run competition favors them," Polar
Spirit's Terho Lahtinen said of EAR after Saturday's race. "They
come from a triathlon background and have a great deal of speed.
We must be strong during the offroad inline skating competition,
which is very much like cross-country skiing. We are all from
Finland, where cross-country skiing is a part of growing up."

<P>
CAIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Head of Egypt's Supreme State
Security Court Ahmed Salahaddin Bedour was attacked by an
unidentified gunman early Saturday, but was luckily unhurt,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The assailant fired at Bedour with a pistol when he was driven
back home in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, 190
kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry officials, who spoke on condition of

<P>
No casualties were reported in the incident, the officials
said, adding that the police were investigating the case.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Stealing Lebanon's Water After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 7 (Xinhua) -- After a rare admission of soil
theft, Israel was accused on Saturday by Lebanese media of
carrying out another plan to transfer Lebanon's water to its own
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Orient radio quoted Lebanese residents living inside the
Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon as saying that Israel is
carrying out a plan to steal Lebanon's water resources in
al-Khiam, a border area where 90,000 cubic meters of soil has been
taken away by Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israelis have gathered waters and springs on the Khiam plain
into several tunnels which lead to Israel's northern area, the
radio added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has always accused Israel of stealing its water but the
charge has never been admitted by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Israeli army informed the United Nations Interim
Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) of an investigation result, which said
that Israelis are indeed removing Lebanon's soil for agricultural
use in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army promised to UNIFIL that it would take measures to
prevent the reoccurrence of such activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> - Bangladeshis Await Verdict of Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshis are awaiting the
scheduled announcement of the verdict on Sunday of the delayed
trial of the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the
first prime minister of independent Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The judgment comes 23 years after Mujibur Rahman, father of
incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and most of his family
members were assassinated in a plot on August 15, 1975.
</P>
<P>
"It is a unique case in the criminal case history of
Bangladesh...none of us (the judge and lawyers) got such an
important case to deal with earlier," Judge Kazi Golam Rasul told
the court while fixing the date of verdict on completion of the
hearing on October 13.
</P>
<P>
The court would pronounce "a proper and neutral judgment to the
best of its ability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the case formally began in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, some 450 people, both civil and
military, were interrogated. And during the 148 working days of
trial, the court recorded the testimony of 61 out of 74 listed
prosecution witnesses, including 39 from the military, and heard
the arguments of the prosecution and defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
No action was taken against those allegedly involved in the
killing case before the Hasina-led Awami League came to power in
June 1996. And in November 1996, the parliament scrapped the
Indemnity Law, which had been previously enacted and later
incorporated in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 people were killed in the 1975 assassination,
including 11 gunned down at the residence of Mujibur Rahman at
Dhanmondi in the capital city. According to prosecution witnesses,
Mujibur Rahman, his wife, his brother and three sons were among
those killed at his residence.
</P>
<P>
Two daughters of Mujibur Rahman, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh
Rehana escaped the massacre as they were abroad at the time.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the number of the accused was 24, but four of them
were kept outside the charge-sheet as dead. Six of the accused
were arrested, and one of them was later relieved from the case by
an order of the High Court, with 14 absconding.

<HEADLINE> Enwei Group Plants Fined for Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Two pharmaceutical plants
operated by the Chengdu-based Enwei Group, a leading producer of
hygiene products for women, will be required to pay a total of 108
million yuan (13 million U.S. dollars) in overdue taxes and fines
for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The assessment was based on an in-depth investigation conducted
by a local branch of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, according
to an SAT official.
</P>
<P>
The Group will be required to pay overdue taxes of more than
44.6 million yuan (5.4 million U.S. dollars) for the Enwei Shiheng
Pharmaceutical Plant, a joint venture established in 1990 along
with the Hong Kong Shiheng Bank. The venture was dissolved in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The group must also pay 37.1 million yuan in overdue taxes for
the joint venture Enwei Pharmaceutical Plant. The group used tax
breaks due for 1994 and 1995 in spite of the fact that the
overseas partner failed to provide the required investment for the
plant until the end of the second year.
</P>
<P>
The group will also be assessed fines ranging from one to three
times the actual amount of taxes evaded in 1993, 1994, 1995 and
1998, and must pay all overdue amounts.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu Branch of the SAT has notified Enwei of all
relevant assessments and the group has remitted 36.3 million yuan
in arrears and fines.

<HEADLINE> UK Hopes for Diplomatic Solution to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain preferred a peaceful
solution to a military action for ending the Iraq arms inspection
crisis, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told BBC radio that Britain hoped to resolve through
diplomatic channels the latest standoff in Iraq after Baghdad
decided to stop cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Due to visit Kuwait and Bahrain on Sunday, he said military
action was "still an option" as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
reneged on an agreement with the United Nations in February.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the preferred option, it is not the best option, but
it has to be an option because in many ways that is the only thing
that Saddam recognizes," the British defense chief said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the suggestion that there was little appetite in
the Gulf region for a further confrontation with Iraq. "Kuwait was
strongly with us on the last occasion and I have no doubt that
they will be this time because they, as a close neighbor of Iraq,
fully recognize the danger that he (Saddam) is," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world community is absolutely united in telling him
(Saddam) he must comply with (U.N.) Security Council resolutions
and we are absolutely determined to get over the message in the
Gulf and elsewhere that this man represents a threat not just to
his neighbors but to stability in the world as a whole," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Foreign Ministry
Saturday strongly condemned the Friday terrorist act in Jerusalem,
which put the Middle East peace accord on hold.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the bombing, killing two and injuring 21, was
a most blamable act by its tragic consequences, which in turn
prones to endanger the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
It called for the continuation of the peace process restarted
recently under the Wye Plantation Agreement, urging reason in the
Palestinian and Israeli peoples' interest.
</P>
<P>
Romania will further support countries in the area and the
international community in their efforts to build a long lasting
peace and a climate of stability in the Middle East, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also said peace and stability will allow economic growth and
boundless cooperation among all countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility
for the attack Friday morning in the heart of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet met earlier Friday to discuss the peace
accord and indefinitely postponed its ratification.

<HEADLINE> France: Government Finance to Draw Foreign Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- France has decided to spend 100
million francs (about 17 million U.S. dollars) to draw
international students to study in France.
</P>
<P>
Calling education of international students a "market of the
grey," the French government wishes to draw back foreign students
in order to increase the influence of the French culture among the
future elites of countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The National Education Minister Claude Allegre announced on
Friday that a public institution called Agence Edufrance will be
established in Nice, South France, to "promote abroad the chances
to have an education in France."
</P>
<P>
The Agence Edufrance will offer programs of major French
universities, colleges and engineering schools and will be in
charge of arranging services from housing to visa application to
foreign students, he said.
</P>
<P>
France now has 130,000 foreign students among two million
college students -- most of them from French speaking countries or
Europe -- as compared with a legion of 560,000 international
students in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Allegre estimated ambitiously that within four years, from
500,000 to 600,000 international students will come to France to
study under the arrangement of the Agence Edufrance.
</P>
<P>
Students from Asia and Latin America, who now only account for
0.7 percent and 2.7 percent of all the international students in
France, will be given priority in enrollment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fees for their studies in France will be paid through
several channels such as scholarships, sponsorship by big
companies and foreign governments, as well as by the students
themselves.

According to the daily Le Figaro newspaper, the decline of the
French language in the world, bureaucracy in university

from French consulates because of tough immigration restrictions
have discouraged foreign students from applying for enrollment in

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The sudden and surprise decision by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich to step down marks the end of one of the most remarkable
and tumultuous chapters in the history of the U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
--Bolstered by Iraq's estrangement from diplomatic allies and a
more favorable political climate at home, the Clinton
administration is closer to a military strike against the Baghdad
regime than at any time since an armed conflict was narrowly
averted last winter, according to interviews with policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
--U.S. Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican
takeover of Congress in 1994 and presided this year over what at
times seemed like the political destruction of President Bill
Clinton, was himself driven from office Friday by a party that
swiftly turned on his after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's
midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
--With winter approaching, but for other reasons,too, Russia,
ordered 625 million U.S. dollars in food from the United States

<HEADLINE> New Technique to Drill Horizontal Wells Found in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A drilling team of PT Caltex
Pacific Indonesia (CPI) has found a new technique to drill
horizontal oil wells, Antara News Agency Saturday quoted the
company's spokesman Harry Bustaman as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the innovation on a vertical rig in drilling a horizontal
well, CPI could save on its huge operational costs, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Harry said the new technique was discovered by making various
modifications to the connecting system of drilling pipes.
</P>
<P>
The new technique, called the Aggie Drill Collar, has already
been tried in the Rindu oil field in Duri district, Riau province.
</P>
<P>
"Some 2.7 million U.S. dollars in operational costs could be
saved in one oil well in Rindu," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that CPI has been using a slanting rig to explore
shallow and horizontal wells but the system needs 400,000 U.S.
dollar to operate.
</P>
<P>
Harry did not go into details on the advantages and
disadvantages of using the old technique.

<HEADLINE> Cape Verde Implements Anti-Drought Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of Cape Verde
announced an emergency anti-drought program Saturday in a bid to
ensure the livelyhood of 18,000 families in the rural areas,
according to reports reaching here from Praia, capital of Cape
Verde.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Veiga, prime minister of Cape Verde, said Saturday that
his country suffered great reduction in agricultural production
in the last rainy season due to the shortfall in rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened this year, with famine and water
shortage reported in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to spend one million Conto (about eight
million U.S. Dollars) in solving water and hunger problem in
rural areas through constructing anti-drought facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also appealed to the international
community for financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde, a west African country consisting of several
islands, is located in the north Atlantic Ocean. Due to its
geographical position, the country has dry weather throughout the
year and therefore water shortage is often the problem. This is
the second consecutive year the country has suffered a serious
drought.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Free Trade Area Will Not be Annulled or Reviewed: Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA), set to liberalize trade in the region by 2003, will not be
annulled or reviewed despite the economic crisis, Indonesian

</P>
<P>
The AFTA may even be moved from 2003 to 2000, Alatas told
reporters after the ceremony to install Prof. Achmad Faik Hayder
as a professor of Diponegoro University in Semarang, capital of
Central Java province.
</P>
<P>
"The recent meeting of ASEAN trade and industry ministers in
Manila decided that in these difficult times, the implementation
of the AFTA should be moved on to spur greater trade among ASEAN
countries. I think that is the best way," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
On Indonesia's readiness for the AFTA, the minister said he
assumes that Indonesia and other ASEAN countries are ready to
enter into regional free trade by 2000 as some proposed.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to move the implementation of the AFTA will
however be made at the ASEAN summit, to be held in Hanoi this
December," he was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alatas further pointed out that the economic crisis and the
heating political temperature in some ASEAN countries will not
influence the ASEAN's commitment to achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) consists of
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei Darussalam,
Singapore, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will step up the
construction of Minor Works projects to improve environment in the

Works projects in the current financial year, costing a total of
380 million HK dollars (48.72 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Encouraging News for Crisis-hit HK Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The worst of the financial
crisis is probably past and Hong Kong economy is expected to
recover in the second half of 1999, according to a recent forecast
of an international rating agency here in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The forecast, which was done by Standard and Poor's, might warm
the hearts of over 6 million Hong Kong people who have suffered a
year-long painful readjustment process since the regional
financial crisis spilled over to Hong Kong in October last year .
</P>
<P>
Leo O'Neill, the agency's president and chief rating
officer, told a business gathering Thursday: "There is perhaps
some room to believe that the economic recovery in Hong Kong might
occur in mid- to late 1999 as opposed to perhaps the end of 1999
and the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
"I think Hong Kong has probably passed its worst time -- that
doesn't mean that it's headed back to its best time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Hong Kong is not in for any change in its ratings
 in the near term. But O'Neill pledged, "if the economy does begin
 to recover strongly and the situation begins to stabilize in the
property market and the equity market then we might very well view
it more favorably."
</P>
<P>
In September, the rating agency had cut Hong Kong's long- and
short-term sovereign credit ratings and its long- and short-term
local currency ratings.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's was not alone in getting more upbeat about
Hong Kong's economic outlook. Also on Thursday, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, a global financial services firm, announced that it
has reconsidered its 18 month-old bearish prognosis for the
Asia-Pacific stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The firm has reduced the cash weighting in its mixed asset
model portfolio to 10 percent from 24 percent, raised Hong Kong's
weighting to overweight from underweight, Singapore overweight
from neutral and Thailand overweight from underweight.
</P>
<P>
Markus Rosgen, Asia strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said that a 20 to 30 percent upside exists for investors in each
of the Hong Kong, Singapore and Thai markets by the end of the
first quarter of 1999. He expected the Hang Seng Index, the key
indicator of Hong Kong market, to rise to the 13,000-point level
at the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
"After a thorough review of recent events we believe there is a
great window of opportunity through which investors can capitalize
on the Asian markets, particularly Hong Kong, Singapore and
Thailand," Rosgen said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The return of bullish sentiment was predominately generated
from events outside the region -- U.S. interest rate cuts as well
as the weakening of the U.S. dollar and good news from Japan,
according to Rosgen.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the rating agency or the regional analyst, Hong
Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang appeared rather cautious in
forecasting the economic climate.
</P>
<P>
"There are clearly some better signs in terms of stabilization
of unemployment rates, better tourist inward figures, and also a
few other aspects as well, particularly the stock market and the
real estate market," said the financial chief.
</P>
<P>
"But I am not too sure whether these are enduring signs or just
a flash in the pan," he said, adding that "Whether or not they are
likely to be a permanent feature depends on, I suppose, a further
revitalization of the Japanese economy."
</P>
<P>
Tsang noted that Hong Kong's financial markets have stabilized
somewhat in the past several months. "Shorter-term liquidity has
eased and interest rates are coming down following recent cuts in
the United States. The Hang Seng Index has rebounded. The Japanese
yen has strengthened and stabilized and there have been noticeable
improvements in the regional financial environment."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he viewed a more active local property market,
in terms of "more transactions, greater price stability and in
some cases even a slight reversal of earlier price declines."
</P>
<P>
But the financial secretary emphasized that, as one of the
world's most externally-oriented economies, "our recovery is
dependent as much upon an international recovery as it is on
improving local market sentiment."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that he would be able to make a more definitive
assessment around Christmas when he is going to finalize his
estimated budget.
</P>
<P>
Also adopting a wait-and-see attitude was Peter Sutch, chairman
of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, who said that the
next few months will make it clearer whether the economy is to
recover.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think the economy is in recovery. I suspect it's more
likely to be a slightly false dawn," said Sutch, who is also
chairman of Hong Kong flag carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be quite a lot longer yet before we see
anything that is secure and solid in the way of recovery," said
Sutch.

NANNING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region expects a good grain harvest this year in
spite setbacks resulting from a series of natural disaster.

Local governmental departments predict that the total output
for late rice, maize, sweet potatoes and soybeans will hit eight
billion kg., up 7.3 percent on 1997.
</P>

Local officials attributed this year's good harvest to the
region's intensified efforts to improve water conservation

Guangxi was hit by extended periods of torrential rain in June
and July, followed by a lingering drought since August.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Aims Archery Gold in 2004 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The newly appointed chairman
of the Indonesian Archery Association Hayono Isman said he
expected Indonesian archers to bring home a gold medal from the
2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"To fulfill the dream, we must at least win a bronze at the
2000 Olympics in Sydney. Our archers have said they could do it,"
he said after visiting his new office at the Senayan sports
complex in Central Jakarta Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's top men's archer Hendra Setiawan said he was
optimistic Indonesia could win an Olympic gold in the sport if
the association continues to employ South Korean coach Lee
Jae-hyun for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Hayono said he would promote a "family approach" to the
athletes in a bid to help them improve their results.
</P>
<P>
He argued that such an approach was in line with the nature of
the sport which he said demanded mental endurance rather than
technical skills.
</P>
<P>
"A hierarchical method is not appropriate to develop athletes
who need 70 percent mental preparedness and only 30 percent
technical skills to perform at their best," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Archers are more vulnerable to nontechnical problems. That's
why personal matters must not disturb training programs," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said he would open his door wide for athletes to air their
personal problems if these would affect their performance.
</P>
<P>
Archery was included in the 21 sports Indonesia is to contest
at the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok next month. The Indonesia won
a women's archery bronze in the Asian Championships in Myanmar
last August.
</P>
<P>
"We have not set a target of winning any medals at the Asiad,
because our preparations have not been good enough for the
event," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 7 (Xinhua) -- King Norodom Sihanouk said
on Saturday he has no right to expel a Royal Government of
Cambodia in order to replace it with another Royal Government of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Only the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Cambodia has the
right to deal with the Cambodian government problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
The King made the point when he was asked for comment about the
replacement of present Hun Sen-Ung Hout government and the
granting of a royal amnesty to five persons including General
Nhiek Bun Chhay and Serial Kosal, etc.
</P>
<P>
"Certain Khmers exert pressure on you to do two things. One is
to replace the present Ung Hout-Hun Sen government by a neutral
government and compose a non-aligned technician on political
parties, and another is to grant a royal amnesty to five persons.
What will you decide?" he was asked by someone.
</P>
<P>
The King said he cannot do that because it will meet with the
opposition from Hun Sen and a conflict between Hun Sen and him
"will bring a lot of consequences to our unfortunate Cambodia and
of our already unfortunate people."
</P>
<P>
"Neither our people nor the international community wish for a
Hun Sen-Sihanouk conflict," the King stressed.
</P>
<P>
The King plans to leave here for Beijing on November 14 to have
his medical checkup.

<HEADLINE> 6 U.N. Weapons Inspectors Withdrawn From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Six U.N. weapons inspectors
left here Saturday as part of the 26 people that will be
withdrawn from Iraq, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources told Xinhua that six arms inspectors working with
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for disarming Iraq,
including three Americans, had left for Habbaniya airport, 80
kilometers west of Baghdad, where they would fly to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The other 20 people will be withdrawn on Sunday and Monday,
said the sources. UNSCOM has a permanent staff of about 120 people
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for UNSCOM Ewen Buchanan announced in New York on
Thursday that the U.N. planned to reduce its arms inspectors in
Iraq by 20 percent when Baghdad bans all their inspections and
monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to keep high-powered people sitting there
doing nothing when presumably they all have jobs to do in their
own countries," said Buchanan, explaining why the U.N. took this
move.
</P>
<P>
He added that "this partial paring back does not affect our
ability to be up and running if and when Iraq decides to rescind
its decision."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on October 31 decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with UNSCOM. The Security Council adopted a
resolution on November 5, condemning Iraq and demanding its
decision be reversed.

<HEADLINE> Foul Floodwater to Blame for Fish Death in Bay of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The fish epidemic in the Bay of
Bengal recorded since the first fortnight of last month is mainly
due to water contamination caused by the flow of the floodwaters
into the Bay, according to a special experts' committee.
</P>
<P>
The water of the Bay of Bengal up to a depth of 25 meters
turned sweet by the sheer volume of fresh water flushed in by the
August-September flood, The Independent newspaper Saturday quoted
the committee, which was formed by the Ministry of Fisheries and
Livestock, as saying in its preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The flood which took on a devastating form for two months,
flushed muddy and filthy water into the Bay, and the flood waters
took a long time to mix with the sea water and thus caused an
environmental change in the Bay, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by Mohammad Ali Azad Khan, chief
scientific officer of the Marine Fishery Resource Survey and
Management Unit (MFRSMU) of the Fisheries Department, noted that
the dissolved oxygen content of muddy flood waters was below
normal and might have reduced the oxygen content of the Bay waters
too.
</P>
<P>
Sudden influx of sweet water reduced the salinity level of the
brackish water, and a drastic fall in the level of salinity level
leads to a process called "Osmosis" and some fish species cannot
tolerate this and die, some experts said.
</P>
<P>
But, there were differences of opinion between the experts of
the Marine Fisheries Research Institute (FRI) and the MFRSMU about
the cause of the death of fish in the Bay, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
FRI experts in their preliminary report said that in some
species-specific pathogens might have been responsible for the
fish deaths, while MFRSMU experts on the other hand held pollution
of the environment responsible for the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary report of the inquiry was inconclusive, Joint
Secretary of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, said, adding
that in-depth studies were needed to identify the factors that led
to the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The committee revealed that the epidemic had been observed most
by a 25-square-kilometer area near the Moheshkhali coast, and
about six species of fish had been affected. Marine "poa" died in
large numbers.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army to Stay in Congo (K): Wamba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan People's Defense
Forces (UPDF) will stay in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) as long as the country's security fears
are not allayed, DRC rebel leader Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba has
said.
</P>
<P>
Wamba made the remarks Friday in an interview with Uganda's
New Vision daily, which was published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF sodliers in DRC are deployed there in accordance with
an agreement with the DRC government and the agreement could not
be broken unless a peaceful solution to secure the borders is
guaranteed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his men will continue fighting to bring
President Laurent Kabila and his allies to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
A meaningful ceasefire can only be achieved if all the parties
involved in the conflict are catered for. The only way to stop
escalation of the war is for his side to talk directly to Kabila
and his allies, said Wamba, the grey-haired former Dar-es-Salaam
university don.
</P>
<P>
The rebel chief warned that the war could slide into an
African crisis if more countries on the continent joined in.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted an earlier report that Ugandan and Rwandan
troops had helped the uprising against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Another report said Wamba led a rebel delegation and came here
to meet U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Susan Rice who met President Yoweri Museveni on the last leg of
her week-long Africa tour two days ago.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks ADB's Help in Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 7 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has tried to get
help from the African Development Bank (ADB) to realize its
economic and social development projects.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day joint seminar which concluded here Friday,
Tanzanian an ADB officials made their suggestions that ADB's
focus should be on agriculture, transport, education, health and
water supply sectors in the bank's lending strategy for the
1999-2001 period.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that the ADB, which could play an important
and direct role in Tanzania's development, should establish a
liaison office to be frequently informed of the latest
development in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Bank was suggested to articulate a clear operational
strategy for reducing poverty, specifying specific sectors and
programs for assistance.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the private sector, the bank should build capacity
in the sector's institutions, training in business skills and
supporting the micro-business, they said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the seminar, Richard Mariki, Permanent Secretary in
the Ministry of Planning, said improvement of social services
like education, health and water delivery system and capacity
building for community level productivity, remain vital areas in
need of cooperation between Tanzania and the bank.
</P>
<P>
The ADB officials said Tanzania, well endowed with human and
natural resources, has never exploited fully its potential.
</P>
<P>
"Out of 44 million hectares of arable land, less than 20 per
cent is under cultivation," they said.
</P>
<P>
ADB operations in Tanzania began in 1971 and as of September
30 of this year, it has approved 58 loans and grants worth 764
million US Dollars to finance 56 programs.

<HEADLINE> New Job for Laid-off Lumbermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight years ago, 800 lumbermen
of state-owned forest farms in Gansu bade farewell to their old
profession to become farmers in the Gansu Corridor in northwest
China as a result of decreasing forest resources.
</P>
<P>
They have reclaimed wasteland of over 2,000 hectares, planted
trees, constructed houses, built roads, and set up flour
factories on the gobi desert, turning their new home place lush
green.
</P>
<P>
Today, their success is providing a successful experience for
lumbermen in China who are facing the situation of losing their
job after the government ban on logging in certaian areas issued
after this summer's devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
The Bailong River Forest Administration where the 800 lumbermen
worked for is located between the Bailong and Taohe rivers on the
upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers.
</P>
<P>
After a logging ban issued by the Gansu provincial government
on October, 18,000 workers of the forest administration are facing
the threat of losing their job.
</P>
<P>
Farming at the Gansu Corridor is an ideal way for reemployment,
the administration officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The administration has already decided to resettle 3,000
laid-off lumbermen and their family members by 2000.

<HEADLINE> China to Combat Pollution in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection
bureaus around the Bohai bay are jointly formulating a ten-year
pollution treatment program on the Bohai Sea, according to the
Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Experts plan to carry out the program in three stages. First,
all land polluting sources are required to reach discharge
standards by the year 2000. Second, different functional parts of
the Bohai sea reach regional standards by the year 2002, and
third, the whole marine ecological situation is expected to be
restored as it used to be by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
Around Bohai sea are located Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning
Provinces, and Tianjin Municipality. It is one of the most
developed regions in northern China, with the greatest potential
for development.
</P>
<P>
With rapid development of the surrounding areas, the Bohai sea
suffers severe pollution. A red tide occurred in Bohai sea in
August and September.
</P>
<P>
Pollution treatment in the Haihe River is a key part of the
program. The river receives almost all pollutants discharged by
land polluting sources in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Tianjin is
to invest nearly 15.6 billion yuan (about 1.9 billion US dollars)
in launching 236 pollution treatment projects on the river.
</P>
<P>
A regional administration institution will be set up by the
State Environmental Protection Administration to coordinate the
efforts, and a monitoring system will also be established.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Textile Industry Cut As Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China has gained remarkable
progress in cut its textile industry this year, the reform of
which is regarded by the central government as the breaking point
in restructuring the massive state industry, reported the China
Economic Herald.
</P>
<P>
By October 15, China had reduced 4.32 million spindles, which
account for 90 percent of the planned workload. Meanwhile, 450,000
workers, or 75 percent of the planned number, had been laid off,
according to Du Yuzhou, chief of the State Textile Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Du said that spindle reduction is smooth because the textile
companies have realized themselves the necessity of doing so and
they are willing to cooperate with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The oversupplied domestic market and difficulties in export as
the result of the Asian financial crisis, forced the producers to
choose to eliminate some spindles and receive government subsidies
that encourage the cuts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bureau now replaced the request of "reducing
spindles" with "smashing spindles", to discourage the practice of
relocating spindles to places where control is loose.
</P>
<P>
The Central government arranged to cut spindles as early as in
1991 but because what is reduced in the eastern China showed up in
western China, where labor is cheaper and lacks industry, the
policy of spindle reduction was not really implemented.
</P>
<P>
China plans to reduce a total of 10 million outdated spindles
in three years, lay off 1.2 million workers to drag the textile
industry out of the red. The industry has been loosing money every
year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The country planned to smash 4.8 million old spindles in the
coastal areas this year first, then 5.2 million old spindles next
year in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Du said that the massive job of smashing spindles is not unique
to China because Britain and Japan both went through this in their
past.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British textile industry cut down from over 30
million spindles to 270,000 spindles in a period of more than 100
years while the Japanese textile industry achieved a smaller size
in about a dozen years starting from the 1960s.

<P>
Manila, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a former rebel guerrilla
group, failed to reach an agreement on the identification of MILF
area at the conclusion of their three-day meeting, the Philippines
News Agency said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF earlier proposed to the government the recognition of
13 major MILF camps and 33 other satellite enclaves.
</P>
<P>
Lanang Ali, MILF chairman for the Committee on the Cessation of
Hostilities, was quoted by the agency as saying that both sides
discussed the "definition and criteria" of camps and "could not
meet along the way," resulting in a deadlock in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, the two parties issued a joint communique at the
meeting condemning all forms of terrorism in the wake of the
recent bombings in two Philippine cities, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ali added that since they were tackling a "ticklish issue",
both parties agreed to continue their talks at a still unspecified
time and venue.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that with the things going on
between the government and MILF, a peace agreement is still far
from being reached.

<P>
HARARE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe left here Saturday for Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to
attend a high level mission meeting of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) on the Ethiopian-Eritrean border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The OAU high level mission, which comprises Burkina Faso,
Djibouti, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, is the brainchild of the OAU
assembly of heads of state and government which is aimed at
defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Zimbabwe said one of the major issues of the meeting is to
draft a framework agreement which will be handed over to
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his Eritrean
counterpart Issias Afwerki for their consideration.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the draft will be based on the principles
of peaceful resolution of disputes and rejection of the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
It calls for an end to all hostilities, defusion of tensions
and demilitarisation of the border to facilitate the delineation
process under international supervision.
</P>
<P>
The OAU high level mission is also expected to establish a
follow-up committee with the active participation of the United
Nations to determine the modalities for the implementation of the
framework agreement.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A widespread leakage of
test papers has forced Tanzania to annul National Form Four
examinations, affecting 55,000 students across the country.
</P>
<P>
Juma Kapuya, the Minister of Education and Culture, said a new

JOHANNESBURG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

<HEADLINE> Scientists: American Panthers May Be Found in Qinling Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists here said
various traces indicated that American panthers may be found to
reside deep in the Qinling Mountains in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shifeng, a professor of biology from Northwest China
University currently on a scientific investigation tour in the
Qinling Mountains, said that if the rare American panters are
really proved to be there, it will be a major discovery of wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Fengsong, a senior engineer of the state-level Changqing
Nature Reserve, said he spotted an American-panther-like animal
jumping onto the highway from the river course and then quickly
fled away to the forests on the other side of the highway on
February 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said when he got off the bus with his mountain inspection
 team, the panther-like animal had already been out of
sight. However, Zheng and his colleagues took photoes of the clear
claw prints in the shape of a plum flower, one of the
characteristics of the animal of the kind, on the snow covered
ground.
</P>
<P>
He said, a few days later, they found fresh remains of two
takins near the place where the panther-like animal was
spotted. They inferred that the takins were taken by the animal.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shifeng said, the animal only left photos of its claw
prints, and clear photos covering the whole body are needed to
identify its species.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shifeng recorded in his scientific investigation diary in
1984 that a hunter told him that he had killed a black
panther-like animal on the hillside near his house in Taibai
County.
</P>
<P>
The hunter said he had not kept any remains of the wild animal.
</P>
<P>
Qinling Mountains are known as the habitat of more than 20 rare
wild animals such as giant pandas, crested ibises and spotted
leopards.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has established five nature reserves in
the Mountains in the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Strange Slope in Gansu to Be Explained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are studying
to explain the mysteries surrounding a sloping field in Gansu
Province in northwest China that hinders vehicle operation.
</P>
<P>
Drivers have to speed to drive downward the slope which is 60
meters long and has a sloping angle of 15 degrees. If they wish to
drive upward, they have to go with the breaker, otherwise the
vehicle will accelerate on its own.
</P>
<P>
However the phenomenon is not there with a ditch with a gentle
slope along side.
</P>
<P>
The strange field, in the desert in the Yugur Autonomous County
in southern Gansu, was first reported by Zhao Guobiao, an army
officer.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said he tried with different cars and other tools such as
bicycles and even rolling rubber tyres that produced the same
effect. He poured water on the slope, the flow just went upward.
</P>
<P>
Fang Xiaoming, a professor of physics with Lanzhou University,
said after field investigation that the phenomenon could be
explained by geomagnetism or changes in air pressure.
</P>
<P>
He assumed there might be a terrestrial magnetic field caused
by magnetic minerals beneath the surface of the slope.
</P>
<P>
What he can not explain is that a terrestrial magnetic field
should affect a wider range of field, not just a slope. Further
more, water flowing upward should not be caused by a magnetic
field. It should be better explained by the differences in air
pressure in the limited open field.
</P>
<P>
The mysterious slope have attracted attention from many
geologists who wish to take a major field investigation to solve
the myth.

<HEADLINE> Asian Ancestors in East China: Chinese Archeologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered 180 stone tools and a great number of primate fossils
dating back 2.4 million years in Fanchang County in east China's
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said
that their discovery proves that human beings living here more
than 2 million years ago may be the earliest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The stone tools and fossils they found were unearthed from an
50-square-meter earthen layer about seven meters beneath ground
surface.
</P>
<P>
"Making and using tools make human beings different from
animals," said Jin Changzhu, one of the archeologists, adding that
the unearthed stone tools with irregular patterns might be made by
the ancient human beings.
</P>
<P>
He said that many elephant, horse and mouse fossils have also
been discovered, which proves that there were plenty of food for
the ancient human beings in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although no human fossils were found at present, the large
number of stone tools could date human activities in Fanchang back
much earlier than the past record, Jin said.

CHENGDU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China is to invest over 300 million yuan (37.5 million US dollars)
to build seven large waste water treating plants to help improve
water quality in the Yangtze River.
</P>

The plants, designed to handle 940,000 tons of waste water
daily, are to be built in five major industrial cities along the
main tributaries of the Yangtze River, the country's longest.
</P>
<P>
Lying on the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Sichuan Province has
become a main source of pollution for the river as the local

WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
welcomed a statement by Rwanda that its troops are helping rebels
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), saying it could help
bring about a ceasefire in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in South Africa on Friday, Rwandan
Vice-President Paul Kagame admitted that Rwanda had a military
presence in the DRC, but said it was based on security concerns of
his nation.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. State Department statement, the
U.S. "welcomes the announcement made in Pretoria by Rwandan
Vice-President Kagame. This admission is a positive contribution
to efforts to find a political settlement to the Congo conflict."
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official, traveling with Assistant Secretary of
State Susan Rice on her way back from Africa, said the U.S. played
a part in persuading the Rwandans to make the admission.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed at considerable length in our meetings in Rwanda
the utility of making such an announcement and noted the
contribution it could make to achieving a ceasefire," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government and its allies, several of whom have
sent troops to fight the rebels, have been pressing for a
statement by Rwanda to admit its military presence in Congo as a
condition for a ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Teenager Ranks First in Short Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Fumie Suguri had her
surprising performance to rank first in the women's singles short
program in the Skate Canada in Kamloops, British Columbia Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
Elena Liashenko of Ukraine was second and Irina Slutskaya of
Russia third.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Suguri displayed the best triple Lutz-double
toe loop jump combinations in her two and a half minutes program
which earned six of the eight judges, with the other three opted
for Liashenko.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I can do in the competition what I do
in practice," she said, "In junior, I missed a lot (of jumps). I
could do them in practice, but not in competitions."
</P>
<P>
Suguri is competing in her second senior meet. She was fifth
in the NHK Trophy meet in Japan last fall.
</P>
<P>
Liashenko, 22, was ninth in the Olympics and seventh in the
world championships last season, and Slutskaya, 19, the 1995
world junior champion, finished third in the 1996 World
Championships.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Russian Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
criticized what it called Russia's retreat from a free market
economy and warned that financial decline could lead to political
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The criticism came from Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott when he delivered a speech at Stanford University in
California. A copy of the text was released by the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said that U.S.-backed financial help from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) "must wait until the Russian
government shows itself willing and able to make the difficult
structural adjustments necessary for recovery and growth".
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the U.S. and Russia "may be in for heightened
tensions over security and diplomatic issues".
</P>
<P>
Talbott said that less than a year ago, Russia seemed poised
for "economic take-off", but now faced a crisis that was "largely
though not wholly self-inflicted".
</P>
<P>
"Economic decline carries with it the danger of political
drift, turmoil and even crack-up," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Russian government unveiled a new economic plan
that called for greater state control over the economy and the
ruble, tax breaks for industry and some financing from the
central bank through printing more money.
</P>
<P>
The government of new Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is
seeking ways to pay wages and pensions and revive the industrial
sector, which are indispensable goals, Talbott noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that, in trying to reach those goals, the
Primakov team is prepared to abandon a stable currency, a viable
exchange rate and a sound monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
"It is operating with neither a realistic budget nor a credible
system for collecting taxes. That means Russia is at the mercy of
the printing press, cranking out rubles to meet payrolls and keep
bankrupt enterprises afloat," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the numbers (in the new plan) don't add up, the intended
remedies only aggravate the disease," Talbott said, noting
inflation was already 50 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
"It has become all but impossible for the International
Monetary Fund to weigh in with macroeconomic stabilization funds
that might help in arresting and reversing the slide.
</P>
<P>
"Money from outside will do no good if it is inflated away or
if it pauses only briefly in Russia before ending up in Swiss bank
accounts and Riviera real estate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Whether Moscow can prevent an extremely dangerous break-up of
Russia would depend in large measure on how it handled the economy
in general and the ruble in particular, Talbott said.

<HEADLINE> OSCE's Kosovo Mission in Effect by Year's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The monitoring mission in Kosovo
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
will be in operation by the end of December, a top official said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Giancarlo Aragona, the OSCE's secretary-general since 1996,
said the field preparation has already begun.
</P>
<P>
Aragona expected the mission would cost 230 million
U.S. dollars a year, much less than the cost of possible military
intervention in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funds will come from the OSCE's wealthier members,
but some voluntary contributions have also been made. Norway, for
example, has contributed 26 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The safety of the 2000 monitors will be ensured by a rapid
reaction force deployed in Macedonia, Aragona said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also confirmed that Italy will
supply 200 monitors to the mission.
</P>
<P>
He said the necessary pressure from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), saying "there would be no solution to Kosovo
crisis" without it.
</P>
<P>
Aragona also argued that recent international cooperation has
played an important role in solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE "can play a very strong role" in strengthening such
cooperation, he added.

SAN JOSE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government
Friday presented to the Legislative Assembly a set of draft laws
which would allow United States enforcement agencies to combat
drug trafficking on its territory.
</P>
<P>
The document seeks to overcome criticisms by the Attorney
General's Office, which had considered unconstitutional proposals
authorizing the operation of armed U.S. ships and aircraft on the
country's territory.
</P>
<P>
It would permit the U.S. forces to patrol Costa Rica's sea and
air space as well as pursue suspected drugs couriers there.
</P>

The U.S. has called on several other Central American and

<HEADLINE> Exports in India Continue to Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The downtrend in India's
exports continued with a negative year-on-year growth of 4.89
percent registered in September this year, official sources said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Exports in September amounted to 2.75 billion U.S. dollars,
less than the 2.89 billion dollars recorded in September last
year.
</P>
<P>
The dismal export performance in the month is reflected in the
overall data for the first half of this fiscal year (April 1,
1998-March 31, 1999). Cumulative exports in the April-September
period declined 3.28 percent to 16.27 billion dollars from 16.82
billion dollars in the first half of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Imports, however, surged more than 20 percent in September
compared with the same month in the previous year. Imports were
valued at 3.68 billion dollars as against 3.05 billion dollars in
September 1997, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Imports in April-September 1998 are estimated at 21.26 billion
dollars, 10 percent higher than the 19.32 billion dollars in the
first half of last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The negative growth in exports was primarily due to a negative
growth in exports of cotton yarn fabrics, ready-made garments,
engineering goods, basic chemicals and hardware electronic goods
in September.

<HEADLINE> CIA Warns of New Terrorist Attacks Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A network led by Osama bin
Laden, the exiled Saudi Millionaire suspected of planning the
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, could strike at U.S.
targets in the coming months, warned the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA).
</P>
<P>
"A clear danger in the months ahead is that bin Laden, his
allies or his sympathizers will strike again," Air Force General
John Gordon, the CIA's deputy director, told a gathering of
investment professionals this week, according to an Associated
Press report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gordon's comments echoed warnings made by other U.S. officials
after the United States struck alleged terrorist targets linked by
U.S. intelligence to bin Laden, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the August 7 bombings, Gordon said, the CIA has received
300 tips pointing to possible terrorist attacks by the bin Laden
organization against targets, including 215 aimed at "official
U.S. governmental facilities, as well as U.S. commercial, tourist,
cultural and nongovernmental facilities."
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies
"have preempted additional attacks" planned by bin Laden, "and we
have disrupted more elements of his network."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Prosecutors on Wednesday offered a record five million
U.S. dollars reward for bin Laden's capture.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees in Gingrich a "Worthy Adversary" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday praised resigning House Speaker Newt Gingrich as a
"worthy adversary" after Gingrich announced he was stepping down
from the speaker's post.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we
were able to work together in the national interest, especially
Speaker Gingrich's strong support for America's continuing
leadership for freedom, peace and prosperity in the world,"
Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich on Friday announced he will not seek re-election to
the post of speaker.
</P>
<P>
Republican attempts to use the Monica Lewinsky affair for
political advantage were considered a key factor in their
disappointing performance in midterm elections on Tuesday, which
led to Gingrich's decision.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Clinton said, "Newt Gingrich has been a
worthy adversary, leading the Republican Party to a majority in
the House, and joining me in a great national debate over how best
to prepare American for the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich is widely believed to have tried to take political
advantage of the Lewinsky affair since it was revealed early this
year. When the House Judiciary Committee began its impeachment
inquiry into Clinton, the White House accused Gingrich of actually
calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Gingrich was involved in directing a
10-million-dollar Republican ad campaign, in the days leading up
to the elections, focusing on whether Clinton could be trusted
because of his alleged lies about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton was surprised at
the outcome. White House aides Bruce Lindsey and Doug Sosnik
informed Clinton of the news as his limousine pulled up at the
home of friends in Arkansas. There, Clinton called White House
chief of staff John Podesta and House Democrat leader Dick
Gephardt.

WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympic Committee
President Bill Hybl has requested gold medals from a 1976 Olympic
swimming relay because of evidentce at least one of the Germans
used steroids.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. squad was beaten by 6.6 seconds by East Germany
during the final.
</P>
<P>
Hybl met with International Olympic Committee (IOC) President
Juan Antonio Samaranch, who said the IOC executive board will
consider the matter next month.
</P>

Earlier this year, the IOC opened the way for athletes to
contest medals won by East Germans after evidence confirmed
systematic doping in the 1970s. It said it would review cases on
an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the IOC turned down U.S. boxer Roy Jone's request
for a gold medal after detailed allegations that judges accepted
bribes to award his final bout in the 1988 Seoul Olympics to

<HEADLINE> NBA, Union Make No Progress in Friday Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Representatives for NBA
owners and players were back together today, but the talks ended
quickly and no end to the lockout appears imminent.
</P>
<P>
NBA commissioner David Stern and Players Association Union
executive director Billy Hunter were part of today's meeting,
which lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and concluded with the NBA
claiming it had not recieved a new proposal from the union.
</P>
<P>
"The union informed us they were unable to give us a new
proposal as they had indicated earlier this week," said deputy
commissioner Russ Granik. "We agreed that we are very far apart
with no solution in sight."
</P>
<P>
The parties at least re-established contact aftet Wednesday's
bargaining session quickly disintegrated into labeling and
accusations.
</P>
<P>
None of the recent proposals have come close to ending the
lockout, which is in its 129th day. Monday's meeting made little
progress while Wednesday's session did not last two hours and was
marked by frustration and disagreement.
</P>
<P>
While disclosing details of the owners' latest proposal, Stern
questioned the tactics of the union and the involvement of
agents. A statement from the union was headlined "NBPA Respoinds
to NBA's Latest Conspiracy Theory."
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner had continuously tried to drive a wedge
through the players and repeatedly he has failed," Hunter said
Wednesday. "He attempted to pit the superstars against the
minimun-salaried players and he has tried to buy off the current
veterans at the expense of younger and future players. Now he
wants to split the players, agents and the union."
</P>
<P>
Stern again revealed some of the details of the latest
proposal, which included a 50-50 split of basketball-related
income with players who want no less than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We're starting on two different sides of a very long page and
the owners have experienced more of a willingness than players to
negotiate," Stern said. "They know exactly where the trigger
point of financial danger was and they far exceeded it."

<HEADLINE> Veltroni Elected Secretary-General of Italy's Left Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Walter Veltroni was elected
secretary-general of Italy's Democrat Party of the Left on Friday,
taking the party reins from new Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema was named chairman of the party -- the largest in
parliament with 171 of the 630 lower house seats and accounting
for more than half of the Olive Tree coalition.
</P>
<P>
Veltroni collected 1,069 votes from the 1,199 delegates who
took part in Friday's special assembly.
</P>
<P>
The special assembly was held after Veltroni's predecessor,
D'Alema, was sworn in as Italy's premier, replacing Romano Prodi,
whose cabinet fell after losing the support of the hard-line
Communist Refoundation party over the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
Veltroni, 44, had served as deputy premier in Prodi's cabinet.
In 1994, he was elected deputy secretary-general of the Left
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the new appointment, Veltroni promised to
reorganize, strengthen and expand the party, saying, "Our primary
duty is to grow."
</P>
<P>
He said the key was to become "culturally and politically open".
</P>
<P>
"Today, we start together on a new course. We must find the
right way and language so that young Italians wishing to become
involved in politics will find in us a great force, which is open
and modern, " Veltroni said.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the Left Democrats, under his leadership,
would not rest in the government's shadow, despite D'Alema's dual
role as prime minister and party chairman.

HANOI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics from Vietnam's
National Nutrition Institution reveal that the percentage of
malnourished children nation-wide now stands at about 40 percent,
according to Saturday's "Vietnam News".
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's government expects to cut the number of malnourished

<P>
However, Director of the Ho Chi Minh City Nutrition Center Kim

of malnutrition among Vietnamese children in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Significant steps have been made in improving living standards
through the influences of industrialization and modernization, but
despite this, 28 percent of children in Ho Chi Minh city remain
malnourished, the Vietnam News reported.
</P>
<P>
It added that malnutrition and low standards of health care for
children are still common in low-income households.

<HEADLINE> Spain Approves Pinochet Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish government on Friday
approved a formal judicial request for the extradition of former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Spanish government spokesman Josep Pique said the request and
other documents will be passed on to the Spanish National High
Court, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Police Bureau and the
International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol).
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested on October 16 while he was recovering
from back surgery at a London clinic on a warrant from Spanish
investigating magistrate Baltasar Garzon.
</P>
<P>
The former Chilean head of state is accused of genocide,
torture and terrorism during his military rule of the country from
1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Britain's House of Lords -- the country's highest court -- is
hearing an appeal that will decide whether Pinochet can be handed
over to Spain.
</P>
<P>
The appeal is against a High Court ruling last week that
Pinochet could not be extradited because he had sovereign immunity
for crimes that took place when he was head of state.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government stated that the request was "a judicial
decision", not a political one, and Spain hoped to keep good
relations with Chile.
</P>
<P>
However, some Spanish officials have said that the Spanish
courts have no jurisdiction over crimes committed in a foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
In Santiago, Chile reacted by recalling its ambassador to Spain
"for consultations". Chilean President Eduardo Frei said he
strongly opposed the "extraterritoriality" of the Pinochet issue,
saying any foreign attempts to act as a substitute for the Chilean
judiciary were a "serious threat" to Chile's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee of the Andean Group condemned some
European countries' attitude over the Pinochet issue, calling it a
"dangerous example" of developed countries imposing their
judiciary power on developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Colombian government sources said the arrest and the possible
extradition of Pinochet brought "humiliation to the democracy and
the rule of law of Latin American countries".

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Sets Out Nine Steps for Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Participants at an ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) seminar on food security,
which ended here Friday, proposed nine solutions in this regard,
the Vietnam News Saturday reported, quoting Rural Development
Minister Le Huy Ngo.
</P>
<P>
The nine measures include steps to increase yields, prevent
soil erosion and loss of arable land, diversify rural industries,
expand markets, increase food storage facilities, minimize risks
in food supply, link rural development projects to food security,
protect the poor to ensure their access to food supplies, and
establish a food security information network.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar on Vietnam-ASEAN food security regarded
the nine solutions as a framework for future cooperation among
ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
Ngo said ASEAN is a fertile region, but dangers of food
shortage lurked and could upset the entire region if no measures
were devised to maintain food security.
</P>
<P>
There is a strong potential for ASEAN to achieve a stable
surplus of food, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that this promising sign does not mean all
challenges have been overcome.
</P>
<P>
Despite the severe impact of the regional economic crisis and
the prolonged drought this year, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar
still managed to export an estimated 10 million tons of rice, more
than what the other ASEAN nations had to import in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
He said that difficulties arise from rapid population growth
and urbanization extending to arable land, high unemployment
caused by the current regional crisis, problems at the macro
economic level in paying for food imports, and competition among
food exporting countries.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Chinese Cabbage Declining in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A reduction in planting Chinese
cabbage, used to be the leading vegetable in winter in Beijing, is
not stirring passions as it once might have.
</P>
<P>
This year, 10,400 ha of Chinese cabbage have been grown in
Beijing's suburban areas with an output expected to be 550 million
kg, about one-fifth of last year's figure, "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cabbage appeared in local vegetable markets in
mid-October, half a month earlier and with more varieties than
usual.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most consumers bought large amounts of Chinese
cabbage in the fall and stored it to eat during the winter, a
season that was noted for lacking vegetables.
</P>
<P>
But this year, Chinese cabbages are not moving quickly. Buyers
usually select only on or two.
</P>
<P>
The declined demand for Chinese cabbage began several years ago
and is continuing as a result of a large shipment of vegetable
from other parts of the country to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, most vegetable growers in Beijing reduced Chinese
cabbage planting. Some have planted other popular vegetables in
green houses instead.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese cabbages are still widely accepted in Beijing,
its sales remain higher than the total of other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese cabbage is still a common item in our dinners, but is
not as popular as it once was," Liu Yuejin, a downtown Beijinger
said.

HAVANA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy will provide a
preferential loan of 80 million U.S. dollars to Cuba for the
purchase of Italian machinery and consumer goods, a visiting
Italian official announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of Foreign Trade Antonello Cabras made the
announcement after meeting with Cuban Central Bank President
Francisco Soberon.
</P>
<P>
Cabras, accompanied by 40 Italian entrepreneurs, arrived here

</P>
<P>
"This is the first step to develop bilateral relations and
finance Cuba's acquisition of Italian machinery and consumer
goods," said Cabras.
</P>
<P>
He said the next step will be for small and medium-sized
Italian businesses to create joint ventures with their Cuban
counterparts to market products not only in the island nation but
also in the entire Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
Cabras also met with Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage. They
toured the Italian pavilion of the Havana International Fair where
some 200 Italian firms were exhibiting their products.

<HEADLINE> Business Leader Urges Reform in U.S. Sanctions Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. businessman
has called for major reforms in the use of economic and trade
sanctions by the United States, citing damage to both American job
opportunities and U.S. international relations.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address Thursday at the U.S. National Foreign
Trade Council forum in San Francisco, Ken Derr, chairman of
Chevron Corp. -- one of America's biggest oil companies -- said
the Sanctions Reform Act, which stalled in Congress this year,
should be taken up again and passed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require the U.S. president and Congress
to use a strict process that would determine in advance whether
sanctions have clear, valid and achievable objectives before
imposing them on other countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that unilateral sanctions are almost never effective,
Derr argued that "engagement" through trade and shared business
investments is a far more effective way to influence foreign
governments because it generates economic benefits rather than
trying to withhold them.
</P>
<P>
"This country's unfortunate tendency to impose unilateral
sanctions on other countries carries a price -- lost opportunities
and lost jobs for Americans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Derr recalled that federal sanctions cost the U.S. 15 billion
to 20 billion U.S. dollars in lost exports in 1995 alone. In
1994, specific sanctions cost the U.S. economy six billion dollars
and 120,000 export related jobs.
</P>
<P>
Unilateral sanctions also bar U.S. companies from competing for
new business ventures in the target countries, where international
competitors are under no such restrictions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "growing desire lately among some people to
return to the bad old days of isolationism and protectionism",
Derr said, "We can't turn back the clock."
</P>
<P>
"Whole sectors of the American economy now rely heavily on
overseas markets," he said. "Most of the world's population
growth is taking place outside the U.S.. Tapping those emerging
markets is absolutely imperative if U.S. companies are to continue
to expand and prosper."

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Stepping Down as U.S. House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich announced Friday that he would not run for another term
as speaker.
</P>
<P>
Blamed for the disappointing Republican showing in Tuesday's
midterm elections and faced with open challenges to his
leadership, Gingrich said he would not seek re-election to the
third ranking position in the United States after the president
and vice president.
</P>
<P>
"Today I have reached a difficult personal decision. I will
not be a candidate for Speaker of the 106th Congress," Gingrich
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Although no final decision has been made, Gingrich also was
unlikely to finish the two-year term as a Congress member from
Georgia that he was re-elected to on Tuesday, his spokeswoman
Christina Martin said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich helped Republicans in the 1994 elections to become the
majority party in the House.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's election results led to disappointment among
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob
Livingston said he would challenge Gingrich for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
The infighting broke into the open as Republicans started
taking sides.
</P>
<P>
"The Republican conference needs to be unified, and it is time
for me to move forward where I believe I still have a significant
role to play for our country and our party," Gingrich said in his
statement.
</P>
<P>
"My party will have my full support, and I will do all I can to
help us win in 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Representative Steve Largent had said he
would challenge House Majority Leader Dick Armey for the second
spot on the leadership when House Republicans choose by secret
ballot their leaders for the new Congress in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Representative George Radanovich said he would challenge
Representative John Boehner of Ohio for Republican Conference
chairman.
</P>
<P>
"I urge my colleagues to pick leaders who can both reconcile
and discipline, who can work together and communicate
effectively," Gingrich said in his statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has reported success in fighting patent infringement but
violations still remain serious, according to a provincial
official.
</P>
<P>
The number of patent disputes in Zhejiang has grown by an
average of more than 20 percent annually since China implemented
the patent law in 1985, Yan Xiaolang, director of the Zhejiang
Science and Technology Committee, said in a report delivered to
the Standing Committee of the provincial people's congress.
</P>
<P>
The number of patent disputes reached 500 in 1996, with 85
percent of them involving patent right violations, Yan noted.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the 60 enterprises surveyed in the cities
of Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Jinhua and Quzhou said that they have, to
various degrees, suffered from the insufficiency of patent
protection, according to Yan.
</P>
<P>
He also said that cases of fake patents have been rising by an
average of 15 percent a year in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks in Shanghai had
extended 9.89 billion US dollars in foreign-exchange loans by the
end of September, an increase of 2.38 billion US dollars, or up
31.6 percent from the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The rising of foreign-exchange loans indicates that confidence
of borrowing enterprises in China's promise not to devalue its
currency, the yuan, has rebounded, experts say.
</P>
<P>
They note that the recent interest rate reduction in the United
States and increased domestic investment have also contributed to
the growing demands for foreign exchange by enterprises in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that foreign-exchange deposits in
Chinese banks in Shanghai are rising, to 5.96 billion US dollars
in savings deposits by the end of September, up 6.84 percent from
the end of June. Hard-currency deposits of enterprises totaled
5.73 billion US dollars by the end of September.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Commander Denies Reshuffle in Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander General Wiranto Friday denied reports that he plans to
conduct a military reshuffle involving Army Chief of Staff General
Subagyo Hadisiswoyo.
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports, quoting sources within the ABRI, said
Subagyo will be replaced by Lieutenant General Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono, who is currently the military's chief of
socio-political affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It's not true. It is only rumors," Wiranto told reporters at
the National Resilience Institute office here.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that plans are being discussed to
replace several military officers, but said there will be no
changes in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, ABRI has no plan to conduct a reshuffle in
the Army because we are concentrating on efforts to make the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) a success," national
newspapers Saturday quoted Wiranto as saying.
</P>
<P>
The special MPR session, from November 10 to 13, is expected to
adopt a timetable for the implementation of general elections and
a general session of MPR next year.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a reshuffle after the special
MPR session, Wiranto said, "Wait and see. If there is to be a
replacement of the Army chief, I will myself announce it. But, if
there is no announcement, there will be no replacement in the
Army's top position."
</P>
<P>
Subagyo, however, said he would be ready should the military
leadership want to replace him.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I have no ambition to maintain my job and I am
prepared to do whatever the ABRI leadership wants me to do and go
wherever I am assigned."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expects to Win Three or Four Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is tipped to win
either three or four gold medals at the Asian Games to be held in
Bangkok next month, the Indonesian Observer Saturday quoted one
of the country's sports figures as saying.
</P>
<P>
Badminton, the sport bringing the country to the international
fame, is expected to provide two golds, the Badminton Association
of Indonesia's official in charge of athletes development M.F.
Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
"Three gold medals look the most that we can do. It should be
a good feat, given our shaky performance due to our monetary
crisis, as well as the fact that other Asian countries have shown
speedy improvement in sports," Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
"If we can take four, it will be excellent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Should Indonesia end up with three gold medals, it will be a
repeat of the Indonesian performance at the Asian Games in
Hiroshima, where the contingent brought home three gold, 12
silver and 11 bronze meals. The three golds were won by the
badminton squad.
</P>
<P>
While badminton can guarantee a two-gold haul for the
contingent, Indonesia is still considering other possible
triumphs. The most likely are karate, taekwondo, tennis or wushu.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the reports from the sport federations, our target
of six gold medals at the Asian Games remains," said M. Hindarto,
project officer of the team preparation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will send 125 athletes, 75 coaches and officials to
the quandrennial event to be held in Bangkok from December 6 to
20.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian athletes will compete in weightlifting, badminton,
rowing, karate, yachting, shooting, taekwondo, tennis, boxing,
wushu, fencing, athletics, judo, archery, swimming, sepak takraw,
gymnastics, volleyball and equestrian events.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Remembers Heroes Who Saved Jews from Nazi Death Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's parliament Friday
commemorated 43 former members who jointly saved 48,000 Jews from
Nazi concentration camps in 1943.
</P>
<P>
Their heroic defiance of the German occupiers took place at the
height of the holocaust which swept Europe in the wake of Hitler's
armies, a solemn session of the National Assembly heard.
</P>
<P>
Assembly Chairman Iordan Sokolov told how then-Deputy
Parliamentary Chairman Dimiter Peshev and 42 other members
protested against an order to deport Bulgaria's Jews to the
extermination camps.
</P>
<P>
The group organized a petition against the order and Peshev
wrote to then-Prime Minister Bogdan Filov in protest, saying:
"Such a move is inadmissible, not only because these people, being
Bulgarian citizens, cannot be expelled from Bulgaria, but also
because this would incur heavy political consequences for the
country."
</P>
<P>
Sokolov told the session that the rescue of the Jews was one of
the most honorable moments in modern Bulgarian history, the
Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Bozhkov read a letter from
Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, who was visiting Turkey, saying Peshev
and the other 42 MPs had earned a place in world history and set a
model for unity between the people and government.
</P>
<P>
The session also honored Italian journalist Gabriele Nisim with
the Madara Horseman Order, first class, for his record of the
event in his book, "The Man Who Stopped Hitler".
</P>
<P>
"No army in the world, no head of state or pope ever delivered
such a heavy blow against the Nazis in their war against the
Jews," said Nisim.
</P>
<P>
The session was also attended by Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Chairman Dan Tichon, Israeli State Archives Director Moshe Moseck,
Italian MPs and European Union representatives in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Peshev will also be commemorated by the Italian parliament on
November 17.

<HEADLINE> Chile Recalls Ambassador to Spain Over Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Chile recalled its ambassador
to Spain on Friday immediately after the Spanish government
approved a judge's request for the extradition of former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet from Britain.
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza told reporters that
the recall does not mean a break-up of diplomatic relations with
Spain.
</P>
<P>
He said ambassador Sergio Pizarro Mackay was being recalled
because President Eduardo Frei wanted to know more about why
Madrid decided to approve Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's request
to seek Pinochet's extradition and put him on trial for genocide.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said the Chilean government was "extremely annoyed" at
the decision that has been made "without taking into account
political responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, government spokesman Josep Pique said Friday that
the formal request by Judge Garzon, who ordered Pinochet's arrest
last month in London, would now be forwarded on to the British
authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet asks the British authorities for the extradition
of Augusto Pinochet Duarte. ... The judicial authorities have
charged him with genocide, terrorism and torture," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, now Chile's lifetime senator, ruled the southern
American country from 1973 to 1990. He was blamed by the Spanish
judge for the deaths or disappearances of more than 3,000 people
between 1973 and 1980.

<HEADLINE> Thai Minister Warns of Increasing Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Road accidents may claim more
than seven lives an hour in Thailand by the year 2000 unless the
state improves road safety measures in time, according to
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban.
</P>
<P>
The minister based the forecast on a study by Sweroad, a
Swedish transport consultant, hired by his ministry to work out
road safety measures, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The study said road deaths during 1993 and 1995 rose by 32.72
percent annually. Road accidents killed 9,496 people in 1993, 1.08
persons per hour on average. Casualties were recorded at 16,727 in
1995, 1.90 persons per hour.
</P>
<P>
Based on the growth rate, deaths from road accidents could
reach 68,000 in 2000, or 7.76 persons an hour.
</P>
<P>
Concerned agencies have been told to review their transport
safety measures. The Highways Department will improve
accident-prone routes and the Land Transport Department will watch
closely the record of motorists, Suthep was quoted by the Bangkok
Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
A scoring system might be introduced to discipline traffic law
violators and those who lose scores will have their driving
licenses seized, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and Communications Ministry may improve a work
hour limit on truck drivers to prevent them from working too hard.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will forward improved road safety measures to the
National Transport Safety Committee chaired by Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai for implementation, Suthep said.

<HEADLINE> Elected Factory Directors Turn Poor Enterprises Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 86 percent of the
1,203 state-owned enterprises (SOE) managed by directors elected
by workers through fair competition in central China's Henan
Province have helped lift their businesses out of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
This marked a step ahead compared with the conventional system
of appointment by higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Luoyang No. One Color Textile Plant incurred a debt of 17.8
million yuan in the past nine years and was forced to stop
production in February 1992. Workers elected Ma Mingsha, a former
workshop head who has been bold in technical innovation, as the
new director, who succeeded in getting the factory out of the red
in three years.
</P>
<P>
The Pingyuan Pharmaceutical Plant in Henan Province changed its
directors three times in the past four years. The three former
heads, appointed by higher authorities, showed little market
information and accumulated a debtor of 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, workers elected a director of their own, who earned a
profit of 7 million in the same year he took the post.

Imported furniture sold in Shanghai come from dozens of

just five years ago. Currently, imported furniture takes up

<P>
Annual sales of furniture in Shanghai are estimated at more
than three billion yuan, according to a joint survey conducted by
banking and furniture experts.
</P>
<P>
Demands for imported furniture will expand rapidly in Shanghai
as foreign-related commerce, tourism and the catering industry
grow and more foreign nationals come to reside in the city,
experts predict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more local residents will choose to buy imported
furniture as their living standards rise, the experts add.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Official on Economic Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China should make full use of
the on-going global industrial restructuring in the light of its
national conditions, a senior trade official has stressed.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization, in essence, is worldwide industrial
restructuring led by developed countries with transnational
corporations as the central force of commerce. And China should
carefully compose its strategy of participating in this process,
today's China Daily quoted Long Yongtu, assistant minister of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC), as
saying.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country with the largest population in
the world. Long said that to bring the country's comparative
advantage of low labor costs into full play, more labor-intensive
industries with advanced technology should be encouraged to be
transferred from developed countries to China.
</P>
<P>
The country, however, should also develop its own capital and
technology-intensive industries by absorbing foreign
investment. China should open wider to the outside world to make
itself an overseas production base for transnational corporations,
a link in their international production chain and a part of their
global market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a large country, China must have an industrial structure
that has necessary industries, particularly new and developing
industries.
</P>
<P>
The State should also take an active part in global and
regional economic and trade co-operation, Long urged.
</P>
<P>
China should try to participate in formulating international
trade and investment rules to safeguard the interest of developing
countries and help establish fair international economic and trade
order.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to take full advantage of the globalization
process, the country should strive to create a risk-proof domestic
economic environment, Long said.

Chelsea's Danish international Brian Laudrup is to move to FC

LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- World football legend Pele said
Friday that he would like to see the 2006 World Cup staged in
Africa rather than England.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted there were still question marks over the
practicalities of doing so.
</P>

In particular he raised concerns over whether South Africa -
thought to be the continent's front-runner - could produce
satisfactory facilities for the 32-team tournament.

FIFA President Sepp Blatter confirmed he favoured a bid from
Africa after a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and

<HEADLINE> Guivarc'h Joins Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Glasgow Rangers paid Newcastle
United 3.5 million pounds for World Cup-winning striker Stephane
Guivarc'h - just six months after the Frenchman snubbed the Ibrox
club.
</P>
<P>
The fee equals that paid by former Newcastle manager Kenny
Dalglish, when he signed Guivarc'h from Auxerre in the summer.
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed when I came to Rangers in May but for most
French players, the Premiership is a better level to play in.
Kenny Dalglish was keen to take me and I made a decision to join
Newcastle then," Guivarc'h explained Friday.
</P>
<P>
"But now all I am concerned about is helping Rangers win
things. Of course it is vital to win the championship, but it is
also important to succeed in Europe."
</P>
<P>
He fell out of favour under new St James' Park boss Ruud
Gullit, despite scoring against Liverpool during his first game
in charge at St James Park.
</P>
<P>
But Gullit wished him well in Glasgow, saying: "I hope he can
prove himself there. Rangers are a big club. They have the best
players and nearly every year they win the championship. They
create a lot of chances, so if he can't score goals there......"
</P>
<P>
Guivarc'h found the net 47 times in 57 games for Auxerre, but
had a barren World Cup despite France's success.
</P>
<P>
He has signed a three-and-a-half year contract at Ibrox and
goes straight into the Rangers squad for Sunday's trip to St
Johnstone.
</P>
<P>
Boss Dick Advocaat said he had no problem with the fact that
Guivarc'h had previously turned Rangers down.
</P>
<P>
"I would rather look at the positive side of things than the
negative. I think we are very fortunate he has signed for us,"
the Dutchman added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday issued a presidential statement, extending a
welcome to a recent negotiated peace agreement to end a civil war
in Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the council president,
Peter Burleigh of the United States, said, "The Security Council
welcomes the agreement reached on November 1, 1988" in the
Nigerian capital of Abuja between the Government of Guinea-Bissau
and "the self-proclaimed Military Junta."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council considers the agreement to be a positive
step towards national reconciliation and lasting peace in
Guinea-Bissau," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Abuja on the sidelines of a summit
of the 16-member Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the Council commends the mediation efforts of
ECOWAS and of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, and
their respective chairmen," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council affirms its firm commitment to preserve
the unity, sovereignty, constitutional order and territorial
integrity of Guinea-Bissau," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presidential statement called on the Government
of Guinea-Bissau and the self-proclaimed Military Junta to respect
fully their obligations under the Abuja Agreement and the Praia
Agreement, signed on August 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Council welcomes, in particular, the decision immediately
to put in place a Government of National Unity and to hold general
and presidential elections not later than the end of March 1999,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, all foreign troops began withdrawal from
the west African country and the west African peacekeepers, known
as ECOMOG, simultaneously started the deployment of the
interposition force.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council calls upon all States to provide
voluntarily technical, financial and logistical support to assist
ECOMOG to carry out its mission," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council appeals to States and organizations
concerned to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to displaced
persons and refugees," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It calls upon the Government and the self-proclaimed Military
Junta to continue to respect relevant provisions of international
law, including humanitarian law, and to ensure safe and unimpeded
access by international humanitarian organizations to persons in
need of assistance as a result of the conflict," it said.
</P>
<P>
The conflict began on June 7 this year when disgruntled
military veteran seized the main army garrison and international
airport in the capital, Bissau. A ceasefire was signed in August,
but fighting broke out again earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
About half of the former Portuguese colony's 1 million people
have been displaced by the fighting. Figures, however, were not
available as to how many people were killed and wounded in the
nation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agrees to Provide Russia Million Tons of Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
on Friday that it will provide 3.1 million tons of food to
Russians, who were in a shortage of food supply after a poor grain
harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
After a week of negotiations in Moscow, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said it would donate 1.6 million tons of U.S. wheat and
other food to Russia and provide low-interest loans to cover the
sale of another 1.5 million tons of food.
</P>
<P>
"This understanding is good news for the Russian people, who
might otherwise face the possibility of food shortages this
winter," U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The first aid shipments are expected to head for Russia next
month. About half the food will be provided free. The rest is
being sold to Russia under a 20-year loan.
</P>
<P>
With the loan, Russia will purchase from the United States
500,000 tons of corn, 300,000 tons of soybean meal, 200,000 tons
of soybeans, 200,000 tons of wheat, 100,000 tons of rice, 120,000
tons of beef, 50,000 tons of pork and 30,000 tons of nonfat dry
milk.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 1.5 million tons of wheat donation, the U.S. will
also provide 100,000 tons of various commodities to private
volunteer groups in Russia and then distributed among the poor and
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The United States will pay 200 million U.S. dollars in
transportation costs while another 60 million dollars in shipping
costs will be repaid with the loan.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said the United States "will continue to assess the
Russian situation" and is prepared to offer additional assistance
later.

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees to Release $960 Mln Credit Tranche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Friday announced its Executive Board's completion of
the second review under the Extended Fund Facility and approval of
releasing 960 million U.S. dollars credit tranche for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, Managing Director of the IMF said in a
written statement that the approval of the disbursement indicated
IMF's support for the Indonesian government's economic program.
</P>
<P>
"Due to good policy implementation, the Indonesian economy is
showing welcome signs of stabilization," Camdessus noted. "The
rupiah has strengthened considerably over the last month,
notwithstanding some slippage in recent days."
</P>
<P>
"The steep fall in output is showing signs of bottoming out.
Inflation has slowed sharply, with the price level declining in
October, as a result of improvements in the food situation and the
strengthening of the rupiah. It is also welcome that interest
rates have begun to decline," the IMF chief said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the Indonesian government should continue
to make rapid progress in several key structural areas,
particularly in domestic banking and corporate debt restructuring.
"Together with consolidation of the progress in stabilization,
these reforms will create the basis for a sustained recovery of
output," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
The credit is part of the IMF-led international rescue package
of 23 billion dollars approved on October 31, last year.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Faces Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of
U.S. House of Representatives was "saddened" by Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bob Livingston's announcement to challenge him
for the top House leadership position, Gingrich's spokeswoman said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Because of their long and close friendship and his great
respect for Chairman Livingston, the speaker was obviously
saddened by today's announcement," Christina Martin, spokeswoman
for Gingrich, said in a statement making clear Gingrich had no
plans to step aside.
</P>
<P>
"This election for speaker will offer Republican members a
clear choice," Martin said. "Newt Gingrich is a visionary leader
who created the Contract with America (and) led Republicans in
winning control of the House for the first time in 40 years."
</P>
<P>
Republicans lost five House seats in Tuesday's midterm
elections, which left them with a reduced advantage of 223-211
over Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans blame the leadership, and Livingston on Friday
became the first to announce he would run against Gingrich when
Republicans choose their leaders on November 18.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was reportedly busy calling Republican congressmen
asking for their support, an aide in Georgia said.

WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Friday faulted ethnic Albanian rebels and
their Serb adversaries for not observing international demands
aimed at ending the violence in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the statements at a press conference with
visiting Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), made up of ethnic Albanians
seeking independence from Belgrade, have not "met fully its
obligations to observe a ceasefire and ensure freedom of movement
for international observers," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Serb compliance with U.N. resolutions is not yet complete...
and we continue to face substantial obstacles in our work toward a
negotiated settlement that will ensure the legitimate rights of
all the peoples of Kosovo," she added.
</P>
<P>
Besides Kosovo, Dini and Albright also talked about the Iraqi
weapons inspection, the Middle East and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy would participate in an international mission
that will verify Serb and Albanian compliance with a ceasefire
agreement in Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Italy also would contribute forces to a rapid deployment force
based in Macedonia that would be on hand to evacuate verifiers of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
verifiers if they get into trouble, Dini said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offenses not Impeachable: Legal Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 legal scholars
in the United States are issuing a report saying the case against
President Bill Clinton falls short.
</P>
<P>
Even the charge that Clinton lied under oath does not
constitute an impeachable offense because he did not misuse his
office, three of the law professors told reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing official about his misconduct," University of
Texas law professor Douglas Laycock said.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in Congress are damaging the presidency by even
opening an inquiry, the scholars said.
</P>
<P>
"Dangerous precedents are being set," said Georgetown
University law professor Susan Low Bloch, who will testify for the
Democrats at a hearing on defining impeachment on Monday before
the House subcommittee on the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and other legal scholars strongly disagree, saying
it is Congress' duty to probe whether impeachment is an
appropriate punishment for Clinton's behavior. Fitness for office,
according to one professor set to testify at the hearing, is the
standard for Congress' decision.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen scholars are listed as witnesses to debate the what
the founding fathers meant when they wrote that "high crimes and
misdemeanors" would be grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Democrats requested the hearing, saying the
Republican-controlled committee should decide what constitutes an
impeachable offense before investigating Clinton's conduct in the
Lewinsky matter or other charges probed by Starr.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday proposed the Security Council extend the
mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan
(UNMOT) for another six months until May 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his report presented Friday to the 15-member Security
Council, Annan said, "The precarious security situation in
Tajikistan has remained a very significant hindrance to the
functioning of UNMOT and other United Nations agencies and
programs" in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
"While acknowledging the efforts of the authorities to enhance
the protection of international personnel, I am deeply concerned
that there has not been more progress in establishing all relevant
facts concerning the killing of the four members of UNMOT in
July," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNMOT's current mandate is scheduled to expire on November
15. By October this year, the U.N. mission comprised 170
civilian staff, of whom 54 were internationally recruited, and
33 military observers.
</P>
<P>
Tajik government troops drove rebel forces out of key
buildings and began reclaiming control of a city in northern
Tajikistan on Thursday during a second day of heavy fighting,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fierce battle for Khodzhand, about 200 kilometers north
of the capital, Dushanbe, was one of the most serious outbursts
of violence since a peace accord was signed last year to end
five years of civil war in this impoverished Central Asian
nation.

LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Friday formally launched the country's National Grid for
Learning, which aims to give schools throughout Britain access to
online information and teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair announced that by the year 2002, the British
government will invest 700 million pounds (1.16 billion U.S.
dollars) in computers for schools focusing on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The cash will be used over the next four years to ensure every
school in the UK is connected to the Internet and most children
leave school "computer literate".
</P>
<P>
"The investment announced today will prevent a generation of
children emerging who don't have these skills - the information
poor," the Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair said that the Grid would be like having "the best
library in the world in our classrooms."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also challenged businesses to play their
part in developing educational hardware and software for schools.
</P>
<P>
However, the task of getting every school online remains huge.
Statistics show that only one in five teachers in the UK has been
trained to use computers and many schools are struggling to meet
the demands of information technology.

NAIROBI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany and Ghana Friday
signed an agreement for a 24 million-Deutsche Marks (some 15
million U.S. Dollars) commodity aid to the latter, Ghana News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Ghanaian Finance Minister Kwame
Peprah and West African Director of the German Federal Ministry
for Economic Cooperation Development Christian Potyka at the end
of a three-day bilateral and technical consultations between the
two countries in Accra, the capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, 6.25 million Dollars out of the
amount has been earmarked for the supply of energy equipment and
another 1.2 million Dollars allocated to technical cooperation to
support the promotion of seed production and marketing in west
Africa. The remaining would be used for buses and bus
components.
</P>
<P>
The consultations started Wednesday with the signing of a
50-million-Deutsche Mark (31.25 million Dollars) agreement, under
which the German government would support rural water supply,
road construction and the rehabilitation of 388 teacher training
colleges in the west African country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Slide Deeper despite Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) - Oil markets dropped further on
Friday, with the slide of prices extending near 10-year lows.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent closed down 15 cents at 12.35 US dollars a
barrel, less than a dollar up from this August's 10-year lows, as
supply glut overrides Iraq's crisis with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Prices are nearly seven US dollars below last year's average
despite the threat posed by U.S. President Bill Clinton's latest
warning of possible military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has called Iraq's latest defiance of U.N. resolutions
"totally unacceptable," telling Baghdad that it must comply
immediately and that military force was an option.
</P>
<P>
Yet oil traders believe military action would only cut Iraq's
exports under the U.N-sponsored "oil-for-food" program in the
unlikely event that oil facilities are directly targeted.
</P>
<P>
Fears of supply disruption are further blunted by a huge stock
surplus that has besieged prices this year, thwarting a three
million bpd producer cut package aimed at boosting prices.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, a
leading indicator of trends in the world's biggest oil consuming
nation, showed a near eight million barrel leap in crude stocks
last week, the fourth straight weekly rise, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say producers must now cross their fingers for a long,
cold northern hemisphere winter to ease swollen stocks.

detect sub-surface water, whether it exists in the form of
underground rivers, pools, glaciers or permafrost.
</P>
<P>
It said that aboard the spacecraft, a lander called Beagle 2
will reveal whether signs of life on Mars extinct or
continue today, and will also send to the ground invaluable
information about the chemistry of the Martian surface and

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Jerusalem Bombing as "Criminal" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat Friday evening appeared on Israel TV to condemn the bombing
as "criminal" and appeal for joint efforts to move forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He told Israelis that he would "exert 100 percent effort" to
track down those involved in the suicide bombing earlier in the
day, which killed the two bombers and injured more than 20
shoppers in Jerusalem's central Mahane Yahuda market.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility
for the attack that happened at 09:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) at the food
and vegetable market, the same site of a bomb blast in July,
1997. But Palestinan security officials blamed members of the
militant Islamic Jihad for carrying out the attack.
</P>
<P>
A red car rigged with explosives ripped through at the entrance
of the open-air market. The Fiat was reduced to a pile of twisted
metals while black smoke rose from the burning mass, covering the
streets.
</P>
<P>
Arafat phoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the
wake of a suicide bombing, urging him not to halt the peace deal
the two signed last month.
</P>
<P>
During the phone conversation Arafat expressed sorrow for the
attack, and called on Netanyahu not to stop the newly-signed peace
agreement under which Israel is to hand over 13 percent more of
the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the two bombers were from PNA-controlled
areas. He told Arafat that for the process to continue, the
Palestinians would have to greatly step up their war against
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the bombing, Netanyahu decided for the fourth
time in about a week to postpone a cabinet debate on the peace
accord, which would finally lead to its ratification before it is
implemented.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997, two Hamas activists blew themselves up in the
crowded food and vegetable market, killing themselves and 16
others, and injuring 151. The twin bombing attack had disrupted
planned resumption of negotiations between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This time, the bombing is threatening to blow up the
newly-signed Wye agreement inked less than two weeks ago in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis immediately upped demands for the process to
resume. In a statement the cabinet said it will reopen debate only
after the Palestinians take "vigorous steps for an all-out war
against terrorist organizations and their infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said ratification of the
agreement was possible as early as next week if the Palestinians
take decisive steps against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
He said the incident showed the Palestinian side has to
"fulfill their obligations to fight terror."
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned the attack,
which he said was aimed at destroying the peace process, but asked
Israel not to use it as a pretext to stop the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was doing all it could
to stop the violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Asfour, PNA state minister in charge of negotiations
affairs, said if it is proved the involvement of some Palestinian
elements, "actions should be taken to get them out of the
Palestinian ranks."
</P>
<P>
Soon after the car bombing blasted, Israel announced to
continue construction of settlements in Har Homa, a controversial
hill site in the traditional Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was the building of Jewish neighborhood at the very site 19
months ago that brought the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to a
prolonged standstill. The deadlock was only unblocked by the Wye
River agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet also demanded the convening of the
630-member Palestinian National Council to revoke clauses in the
national charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
The interim agreement does mention the annulment of the
anti-Israeli provisions, but is far less specific as to the
procedure.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Flat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's resistance to
profit-taking from a string of recent gains prevented further
weakness in European markets on Friday, although gains in New York
and Europe were on the slim side.
</P>
<P>
London shares drifted upwards, ending a topsy turvy week for
the stock market. The FTSE index closed 11.2 points higher at
5491.
</P>
<P>
Share prices saw strong gains on Wednesday followed by sharp
losses on Thursday. An indifferent start on Wall Street and
continued profit taking saw an early rise in share prices tail
off. Trading volumes were thin.
</P>
<P>
Shares had got off to a good start after Alan Greenspan, head
of the U.S. Federal Reserve, said on Thursday that investor
confidence was returning to markets.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE index of leading shares had risen by as much as 100
points before heading downwards.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended the day with modest gains,
despite an earlier rally which had taken the Dax index above the
4,900 point level. Lufthansa and automotive shares had performed
particularly strong. When floor trading closed the Dax was up 24
at 4,836 points.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the share market failed to hold on to early gains,
closing down 7.55 points at 3,588.

<HEADLINE> North Romania Struck by Serious Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Downpours kept falling over
the north of Romania in the first days of November, with the
overflowing rivers causing damages in about 20 towns and villages
in the county of Maramures.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,500 ha of crops and over 400 households were flooded,
and 25 bridges and footbridges, along with 400 km of communal and
forest roads were destroyed or damaged, said sources of the
Ministry of Water, Forestry and Environment Protection. Damages
have been assessed to amount to 25 billion lei (about 2.5 million
U.S. dollars), according to the county committees fighting floods.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have already taken a series of emergency
measures, evacuating more than 10,000 persons and calling for
emergency aid for people evacuated (tents, mineral water, food).
They also asked for quick intervention of the personnel working
for road rehabilitation, power supply and telecommunications, in
order to make relays operational again.
</P>
<P>
Forces of the Public Health Inspectorate also intervened in
emergency aid operations. Ministry of Water, Forestry and
Environment Protection called on the Defense ministry to help the
victims in flood-stricken areas. Environment Minister Romica
Tomescu asked the Defense ministry for a helicopter, as well as
boats to evacuate people seeking for refuge in the garrets of
their houses about to fall down.
</P>
<P>
In Maramures authorities still maintain the alarm state, as
flows of the rivers are extremely high.
