<HEADLINE> Kuerten Beats Kafelnikov to Reach French Open Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten defeated
Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in five sets to reach the semi-finals
of the men's singles at the French Open here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, the fifth seed, won the three-hour match 6-3, 3-6, 4-6,
6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, 23, the 1997 champion of the French Open after beating
Kafelnikov at the same stage, rallied from two sets and a break
down to book a semi-final.
</P>
<P>
He will next face the winner of an all-Spanish clash between
10th-seeded former finalist Alex Corretja and 16th seed Juan
Carlos Ferrero, who followed Kuerten and Kafelknikov onto Centre
Court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Albert Costa of Spain downed ninth-seeded Australian
Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in three hours two minutes.
</P>
<P>
Costa next plays another unseeded Franco Squillari, who earlier
became the first Argentine to make a Grand Slam quarter-final in a
decade when he beat 15th-seeded Moroccan Younes El Aynaoui 6-4, 6-
1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Costa, a quarter-finalist in 1995, became the third Spaniard
into the last eight.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, world number one Martina Hingis blitzed
unseeded American Chanda Rubin 6-1, 6-3 as the Swiss teenager
moved closer to her dream of pocketing the only Grand Slam singles
title she has yet to win.
</P>
<P>
Also through to the last four is three-time champion Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, who beat fourth-seeded American Venus
Williams 6-0, 1-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
It is the 10th time Sanchez-Vicario, the eighth seed, has made
the last four of the event.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Monica Seles of the United States, who a three-time
winner here, was meeting Mary Pierce of France while Conchita
Martinez was facing fellow Spaniard and qualifier Marta Marrero in
the other women's quarters.
</P>
<P>
With Sanchez-Vicario next to face either Martinez or Marrero,
Spain is guaranteed a women's finalist. Hingis will play either
Seles or Pierce in her semi.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Albright Hold Talks Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
held talks again with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Tuesday night to exchange their opinions on how to push
forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
There is no news conference about the outcome of the meeting,
which was their second in less than 24 hours to narrow the
difference between Israel and the Palestinians in reaching a
framework agreement on final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel Radio quoted Barak as saying that he has
determination to seize the moment of truth to reach a final peace
with the Palestinians. He did not elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in the Middle East region on Monday, had
held talks with Barak Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon. Earlier
Tuesday, she also met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy respectively.
</P>
<P>
During her talks with Arafat, the secretary of state managed to
persuade the Palestinian leader to accept an arrangement, in which
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will be sent back to the
Washington area early next week and resume their works on a final
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the meeting date between Arafat and U.S. President
Bill Clinton at the White House was also slated for June 14, which
is a move to push forward the peace process further after Clinton's
meeting with Barak in Portugal last week.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed her hope on Tuesday afternoon after meeting
with Levy that the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations will make
tangible progress on key final-status issues, such as the fate of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, border,
security and water, with full-speed after the resumption.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians launched their intensive peace talks
in March in the United States and moved the talks back to the
region in April.
</P>
<P>
In May, it was revealed that the two sides had opened a secret
channel in Stockholm, capital of Sweden, to speed up the
finalization of the framework agreement. This channel has also been
moved back to the region by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday night by Barak's office said that the
two side's delegation to next week's Washington round of talks
would be led respectively by Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami and Ahmed Qurei, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council.
</P>
<P>
The two negotiators had cooperated in so-called "back-channel"
Stockholm talks in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposed three-way summit between Clinton,
Barak and Arafat, the statement said: "Only after the extent of
progress in the deliberations is examined will it be decided
whether to convene a three-way summit."
</P>
<P>
Albright also admitted at the joint news conference with Levy
that the conditions for holding such a Camp David-style summit
between U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders are still immature.
</P>
<P>
Clearing the way for such a meeting by the end of June in the
United States is reportedly the major task of Albright's current
Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
It has been hoped that such a summit will reach a final-status
framework agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the United States, Egypt and Israel met in Camp David
in 1979 and hammered out a treaty, the first between an Arab
country and the Jewish state, to realize peace between the two
Middle East powers.
</P>
<P>
Albright pointed out Tuesday afternoon that She and President
Clinton had "rolled up sleeves" to help the two sides to reach a
peace plan, but the final decision should be made by Israeli and
Palestinians leaders themselves.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to leave Jerusalem for Cairo Wednesday
morning to meet with foreign ministers from Arab countries there,
including Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.

<HEADLINE> New Coalition to Be Formed in Days: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
suggested Wednesday night that he will form a new coalition "in a
matter of days", rejecting the possibility of an early election.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israel's Channel One television, Barak stated
that any ministers voting along with the oppositions for an early
election bill in the Knesset earlier Wednesday had "fired
themselves."
</P>
<P>
This means that as a result of their voting against the
government, ministers from three of his ruling partners -- Shas,
National Religious Party (NRP) and Yisrael Ba'aliya -- will be
dismissed soon.
</P>
<P>
These ministers are Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli
Yishai, Religious Affairs Minister Yitzhak Cohen, Health Minister
Shlomo Benizri, National Infrastructure Minister Eli Suissa, all
from Shas, Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, from
NRP, and Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, from Yisrael Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
A "formal announcement" would follow Sunday's weekly cabinet
meeting, Barak added, as technically a cabinet meeting is required
for the dismissal of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Barak declined to elaborate on the possible makeup of the new
coalition. But it has been speculated that the secular Shinui,
Democratic List, and Am Ehad will join the coalition since the
Shas, NRP and Yisrael Ba'aliya are leaving.
</P>
<P>
Such a new coalition will hold 52 seats in the 120-member
Knesset, thus depending on the support from 10 Israeli Arab
legislators outside the coalition for its survival.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that on Sunday, the cabinet will meet
and the "appropriate decisions will be made."
</P>
<P>
Similar or different, the new coalition will tolerate "a minimum
of deal making" and would include a "maximum of action," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The new government would therefore deal with national and urgent
issues in a more harmonious atmosphere, said Barak.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party was demanding more
government funding for its financially ailing educational network
in exchange for its pivotal 17 Knesset members' support for Barak's
peace efforts with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak refused to make concessions under Shas threat to support
the bill against the government, and ordered the cancellation of
negotiations with the party.
</P>
<P>
Barak said in a televised interview Wednesday night that he is
directly authorized by Israeli people to make important political
and social decisions, anybody or any party's trick will not hamper
his determination to make such decisions.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he will not sign any peace deals with the
Palestinians unless Israel's demands for security guarantee are met
and Israel's national interests guarded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are currently in talks to
reach a framework agreement in preparation for a final peace accord
by September 13 on final-status issues, such as the fate of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, borders,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
Their negotiation teams, led respectively by Israeli Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Legislative
Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala), will go to Washington and
resume talks there early next week.

<HEADLINE> Barak Suggests Firing Ministers, Promises New Coalition EDS-Updates with Likud and Shas reactions and more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
suggested Wednesday night that he will form a new coalition "in a
matter of days", rejecting the possibility of early elections.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israel's Channel One television, Barak stated
that any ministers voting along with the oppositions for an early-
election bill in the Knesset earlier Wednesday had "fired
themselves."
</P>
<P>
The motion, proposed by Avigdor Lieberman from National Union-
Yisrael Beiteinu to dissolve the 15th Knesset and hold early
elections, passed its preliminary reading by a voting of 61-48 in
the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from three ruling partners in Barak's coalition --
Shas, National Religious Party (NRP), Yisrael Ba'aliya -- had voted

against the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak's words indicated that as a result of their voting against
the government, ministers from the three parties will be dismissed
soon.
</P>
<P>
These ministers are Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli

from Shas, Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, from

</P>
<P>
A "formal announcement" would follow Sunday's weekly cabinet
meeting, Barak added, as technically a cabinet meeting is required
for the dismissal of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that all Israelis should wait patiently
over the upcoming Jewish Shavuot Holiday weekend for a new
coalition under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate on the possible makeup of the new
coalition. But it has been speculated that the secular Shinui,
Democratic List, and Am Ehad will join the coalition since the
Shas, NRP and Yisrael Ba'aliya are leaving.
</P>
<P>
Such a new coalition will hold 52 seats in the 120-member
Knesset, thus depending on the support from 10 Israeli Arab
legislators outside the coalition for its survival.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister declined to answer whether or not a new
coalition would include Shas, but emphasized that on Sunday, the
cabinet will meet and the "appropriate decisions will be made."
</P>
<P>
Similar or different, the new coalition will tolerate "a minimum
of deal making" and would include a "maximum of action," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The new government would therefore deal with national and urgent
issues in a more harmonious atmosphere, said Barak.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Barak's statement, leader of the opposition Likud
party, Ariel Sharon, told Channel One television that joining the
Barak coalition is absolutely out of the question and he will
continue to work to "replace" the current government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shas leader Benizri told the same television that
his party announced prior to the vote the opposition was just
a "symbolic signal" to the government and it was not seeking to
topple the coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, Benizri added, if necessary, Shas would be willing
and is ready to join the ranks of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-Orthodox religious party was demanding more government
funding for its financially ailing educational network in exchange
for its pivotal 17 Knesset members' support for Barak's peace
efforts with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> British Envoy in Cyprus to Prepare for Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's envoy on Cyprus Sir David
Hannay on Wednesday started a four-day visit to Cyprus to prepare
the ground for the third round of U.N.-sponsored talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Larnaca airport on Cyprus' southern
coast, Hannay said he would hold talks with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash as well
as other officials to prepare the ground for the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the envoy did not go into details about the
discussions,
citing an appeal by the U.N. for a news blackout on public
statements concerning the talks.
</P>
<P>
These matters "are familiar", he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Hannay is the first of several
foreign envoys to visit Cyprus ahead of the third round of talks,
which were scheduled to start on July 5 in Geneva to pave the way
for a settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Next week U.N. Secretary-General's Special Advisor for Cyprus
Alvaro de Soto will come here on a similar mission and U.S.
Presidential Emissary Alfred Moses is expected to come a few days
later.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The two communities have held two rounds of proximity-talks
under the U.N. auspices in an effort to find a solution to the
Cyprus problem.

agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while holding talks with Vietnamese First

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for Drought Relief for Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children'
s Fund (UNICEF) Wednesday urged international donors to support
the urgent appeal made on the same day by the world body for
drought relief in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.N. relief agencies and partners are seeking 378 million U.S.
dollars to address the immediate humanitarian needs of more than
13 million people affected by the drought, about 70 percent of
whom are women and children.
</P>
<P>
The appeal covers urgent needs in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya,
Somalia and Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF portion of the appeal totals some 30 million U.S.
dollars and addresses needs in the areas of health, nutrition,
water and sanitation, education and services to meet the special
needs of children.
</P>
<P>
"We are already geared up and working full speed throughout
the region," said Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF. "We
stand a good chance saving lives, but it will require sustained
action for several months. For that we need strong donor support --
and we need it now."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has mounted nine separate relief flights into the Horn
since April, including four to Eritrea, and one each to Kenya and
Djibouti. Each flight carried up to 40 tons of relief supplies,
principally therapeutic milk and biscuits for malnourished
children, medical equipment, and water purification and storage
items. Two more relief flights are due to arrive in Eritrea next
week.

<HEADLINE> U.N., OAU to Probe into Alleged Extrajudicial Executions in Togo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Wednesday set up a commission
to investigate the deaths of hundreds of people allegedly murdered
by security forces in Togo.
</P>
<P>
A three-man commission of inquiry will look into "allegations
that hundreds of people were victims of extrajudicial executions
in Togo in 1998," the two organizations said in a statement issued
here.
</P>
<P>
The commission, chaired by Mahamat Hassan Abakar of Chad, "is
being established at the initiative of the government of Togo,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The government of Togo called a report a "fabric of lies"
which claimed hundreds of people were murdered after elections in
June 1998, but urged the U.N. and the OAU to set up the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be based at the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva and will "undertake its
work in the field," the statement said. "Appropriate consultations
will take place, including with the Togolese authorities and
others in a position to assist the commission."

UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua -- U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations, Richard Holbrook, warned on Wednesday that male control
of the high tech would probably result in women's suffering as
earlier generations did when innovative farming methods were
introduced.
</P>

Addressing a forum at a global United Nations Meeting aimed at

"Don't let the men control the process, because for explicit or
implicit, conscious or subconscious reasons," he said.

The Ambassador said the agricultural revolution of 30 years ago,
which introduced such technologies as irrigation and fertilizers
to the developing world, was expected to benefit women, but had
the opposite effects.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Successfully Tests Anti-Rocket Laser Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The test of the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) was conducted
at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico State of the United
States at 5:48 p.m. local time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first in a series before the high-energy laser is
to be handed over to Israel to protect its northern borders
against short-range rocket threats. The laser gun was described as
"the world's first high-energy laser weapon system designed for
operational use."
</P>
<P>
"We've just turned science fiction into reality," Lieutenant
General John Costello of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense
Command commented on the test.
</P>
<P>
"This compelling demonstration of THEL's defensive capabilities
proves that directed energy weapon systems have the potential to
play a significant role in defending U.S. national security
interests worldwide," Costello said.
</P>
<P>
The laser's ability to shoot down multiple rockets will be
tested this summer, according to military sources.
</P>
<P>
If those tests succeed, the United States expects to ship the
laser to Israel this fall.
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense officials have said Israel would need more laser
weapons to protect its whole northern border from rocket attacks
by Hizbollah guerrillas, who took over areas vacated by Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon in May.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Meeting of the Central
American Security Commission was inaugurated Wednesday here by
Panamanian Acting Foreign Minister Harmodio Arias Cerjack.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian acting foreign minister said during the
inauguration ceremony that the Manual for Regional Coordination
Before Disasters that establishes a mechanism of joint,
transparent, and participative action in case of natural disasters
in Central America will be approved during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arias Cerjack said that the isthmus countries will also analyze
the inclusion of the Mutual Legal Assistance Work in penal affairs
among Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
Guatemala, which constitutes instruments that will consolidate the
Central American integration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the analysis of the reasonable equilibrium of
military and public security forces, the annual program of
measures of promotion of confidence as consolidating norms of the
Central American integration will also be themes to be discussed
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of information on the efficacy of the juridical
instruments in the matter of democratic security, and the creation
of the Police Higher Studies Central American Institute stand out
among other themes.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala has proposed the creation and exchange of police
aggregates to the embassies, while Panama suggested the
establishment of a Central American Academy for the Prevention and

<HEADLINE> British Government Sets Targets to Cut Work-Related Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government and the
Health and Safety Commission (HSC) Wednesday announced targets for
the nation to reduce work-related deaths, ill-health and injury in
the country.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest health and safety shake-up for 25 years.
Over 1 million workers are injured every year in Britain.
Accidents and ill-health among the work force cost the British
economy up to 8 billion pounds (12.8 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The British government and the HSC decided there was now a need
to take a fresh look at health and safety policy in general to
give it fresh impetus and gain further improvements.
</P>
<P>
Among the specific targets were: to reduce the number of
working days lost from work-related injury and ill-health by 30
percent by the year 2010; reduce the incidence of people suffering
from work-related ill-health by 20 percent by the year 2010; and
reduce the rate of fatal and major injury accidents by 10 percent
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The government and the HSC also introduced a 10-point strategy
which will provide incentives and practical support to employers,
together with a range of measures to tackle employers who do not
meet their health and safety responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The strategy highlights that the health and safety system must
promote a better working environment as well as prevent harm.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said: "Health and safety is
a priority issue for those at the top of all organizations and
they must be prepared to face the consequences of ignoring the law;
in future that could well mean prison."

<HEADLINE> Asylum Seekers in Britain Face Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Immigration Service
Wednesday announced plans to speed up the deportation of asylum
seekers after their applications are rejected.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at removing nearly 60,000 people a year by
2004, compared to 12,000 this year, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
A key part of the new radical plan for change would see more
detention centers built.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 900 detention spaces in the UK for asylum
seekers but officials are proposing that 4,000 be created.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 8,000 asylum seekers who lost their claims were
removed from Britain last year.
</P>
<P>
Discrepancies remain between the numbers refused asylum and
those who were actually forced to leave the UK.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Immigration Service's enforcement directorate
confirmed that they were working to new, much tougher targets.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 12,000 people would be removed from Britain
this year, rising to 30,000 between 2001 and 2002, and to 37,000
the following year. That total would be expected to rise to 57,000
by 2004.

<P>
U.N. special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen, who has held shuttle
talks among Israel, Lebanon and Syria in the last two weeks to
verify Israel's pullback, is on his way back to the U.N.
headquarters, convinced that the issue will be resolved, he said
</P>
<P>
Larsen is due in New York late Wednesday to report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his mission.
</P>
<P>
U.N. and Israeli experts who met into early hours of Wednesday
did not resolve the issue, and experts need additional time to
sort it out, said Eckhard, without giving details.
</P>
<P>
Because of that, the four U.N. teams prepared to begin
verification activities "have not gone out on their mission yet"
and they are going about their work pending the resolution of the
issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
The work in marking a line in the border area is required to
confirm Israel's withdrawal in accordance with Security Council
resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Once this is done, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
will deploy troops to verify Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected its military presence in south Lebanon
since the Israeli pullout on May 24 from the area where the
resistance groups are in control of the former occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has stressed that the Lebanese army will not be
deployed in the area until the U.N. confirms full Israeli
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Warns over "IRA Killing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary
Peter Mandelson said on Wednesday that early prisoner releases
under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement could be affected if it is
proven that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was behind a bar-room
killing.
</P>
<P>
Senior security sources in Northern Ireland told the BBC that
they were "very definite" the IRA was involved in the shooting of
Ed McCoy in a bar on May 28, despite being on an official
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
But officials at the Northern Ireland Office dismissed the
report. A spokesman said: "We understand the investigation is
still at an early stage. The [police] still have an open mind on
the case."
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said in a statement: "An intensive police
investigation is now under way. If evidence becomes available in
the course of that investigation that any paramilitary
organization now on ceasefire was responsible for this crime I
would take this very seriously. "
</P>
<P>
"It would have a direct impact on my assessment of the
ceasefire and therefore potentially on further prisoner releases,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to paramilitary organizations not to do
anything which could undermine political progress.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson is under pressure from unionist politicians to take
action if it is confirmed the IRA were behind the shooting.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein senior negotiator Gerry Kelly said he had no
reason to believe the IRA had broken its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said: "The IRA has been involved in a ceasefire. They
have adhered to it and I have no knowledge there has been any
change in that. Anyone who is involved in anything which affects
the peace we are working for is wrong."
</P>
<P>
McCoy, 28, was singled out in a pub and was shot several times.
Soon afterwards, security sources said the shooting was "drugs
related".

<HEADLINE> Political Status Return to ELN Opens Colombian Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government decision to
return the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla its political
status opens new opportunities to negotiate the zone of distention
both sides agreed to create in the north of the country, Attorney
General Jaime Bernal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the urgent matters to be addressed now is, according to
Bernal, to have the communities of the region to accept the
establishment of the "zone of encounter" that will serve as the
venue for this new peace process, the second after the one opened
by the government with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC).
</P>
<P>
President Andres Pastrana's government declared open "the
process of dialogue" with the ELN in a resolution issued Tuesday,
in which it returned to the rebel group its political status.
</P>
<P>
This status had been granted to the ELN on October 9, 1998, but
was withdrawn on June 18, 1999, after that guerrilla force
kidnapped more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
The government and the ELN, the second most important insurgent
group in the country after the FARC, agreed, according to a
preliminary accord published in April of this year, that the
neutral area would include the Cantagallo, San Pablo, and Yondo
localities, the first two ones in the Bolivar department and the
third in Antioquia.
</P>
<P>
But residents of the region rejected that possibility by
erecting roadblocks on the roads that connect Colombia's inland
regions with the northern coast, a protest that was lifted in a
negotiated way on June 1, after three weeks of a conflict in which
the extreme right took part, according to several sources.
</P>
<P>
The government promised then to the leaders of the residents of
the region to leave in suspension the "zone of encounter" with the
ELN and to discuss with the communities its eventual establishment
in that place of the north of Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Govt Targets Sustainable Reduction of Poverty (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government's main
medium and long term objective "is the sustainable reduction of
poverty through the establishment of an environment that generates
economic growth", a newly released government keynote document
said.
</P>
<P>
The document will be submitted to a meeting of the World Bank's
 Consultative Group on Mozambique to be held in Paris on Thursday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group is a forum at which the government
presents donors and funding agencies with the economy's financial
requirements for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics available show that about 70 percent of the
Mozambican population has been sunk in poverty since 1997 and the
government hopes to cut this to 50 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 there were 11.3 million Mozambicans living in absolute
poverty. Even if the government succeeds in cutting the incidence
of poverty to 50 percent, there will still be 10.8 million poor
Mozambicans in 2010 because of the exponential population growth
(currently running at 2.3 percent a year).
</P>
<P>
The government also promises to fix intermediary objectives to
ensure that the 2010 target is reached, to draw up clear and
specific anti-poverty actions at regional, sector and national
levels, and to design a monitoring system to follow the success
(or otherwise) of the anti-poverty measures.
</P>
<P>
The government is optimistic that over the coming decade, the
country's economic growth can be maintained at 9 to 10 percent per
annum.
</P>
<P>
However, it admits that for this year growth will be 2 or 3
percentage points lower, because of the catastrophic floods in
southern and central Mozambique in February.
</P>
<P>
The government also hopes that over the next decade inflation
can be kept to between 5 and 7 percent a year. However, for this
year the price rises triggered by the floods had resulted in an
inflation of 10 percent in the first four months.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, public expenditure will rise from
about 800 million U.S. dollars in 1999 to about 1.9 billion
dollars in 2010, while tax revenue and other domestic sources of
income are expected to generate about 1.3 billion dollars in 2010,
leaving some 600 million dollars to come from foreign donors and
creditors.
</P>
<P>
In percentage terms, the government expects the dependence of
the state budget on foreign aid to fall from 60 percent in 1998 to
slightly more than 30 percent in 2010.
</P>
<P>
But in absolute terms, the need for foreign aid will continue
to rise -- from 514 million dollars in 2001 to 568 million in
2005, and 586 million in 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mozambique will this year need 504 million U.S. dollars,
against the 425.9 million dollars pledged by donors in Rome early
this May for post- flood reconstruction, to ensure the smooth
running of the national economy, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) had risen
from 145 U.S. dollars in 1995 to more than 240 dollars in 1999,
the document said, noting that "this means that Mozambique is no
longer the poorest country in the world", the label regularly
stuck on the country in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The document estimated that if the government's plans come to
fruition, the per capita GDP of the country should reach between
375 and 400 U.S. dollars by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The document called once more upon creditors to scrap
Mozambique's foreign debt in its entirety, saying "the effects of
the war on the human, social and infrastructural fabric of the
country, plus the enormous devastation caused by the recent
natural disasters impose the need for a total write-off of the
foreign debt."
</P>
<P>
Such a total debt cancellation would allow resources currently
spent on debt servicing "to be channelled towards the main goal of
creating a climate that generates economic growth, and towards
poverty reduction", the document said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government welcomes the cancellation of 3.4
billion U.S. dollars of debt (in nominal terms) last year under
the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) initiative, and the
steps under way for Mozambique to qualify for further relief under
"enhanced HIPC".
</P>
<P>
The government's projections for future budgets rely heavily on
indirect taxation, particularly on the Value Added Tax (VAT) that
was introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
VAT should account for an enormous 36 percent of total state
revenue in 2010, compared with 23 percent in 1999, the document
said. Customs revenue will play a much less pivotal role in
government income than in the past because of the gradual
reduction of tariffs with neighboring states, the document said,
adding that tariffs will decline to zero with all SADC (Southern
African Development Community) states except South Africa in eight
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the document makes no mention at all of property
taxes. Currently, the top band of income tax is an extraordinarily
low 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Passes Referendum Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament has passed the
Referendum (Political Systems) Bill 2000 which was challenged by
chief of the Democratic Party Paul Ssemogerere, Radio Uganda
reported Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which should have come into effect on July 2, 1999,
was passed without any amendment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bill aims to make provision for the holding of the
referendum required under the Ugandan Constitution, the report
said, adding that it will determine the political system the
people of Uganda are to adopt.
</P>
<P>
It will fulfil the aspirations of the people of Uganda by
guaranteeing them a political system of their own choice, the
report quoted members of parliament as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to James Wapakabulo, national political commissar and
member of Parliament, the bill is well intentioned and is
guaranteed by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ssemogerere had filed a petition challenging the referendum law
on the grounds that it was passed without a quorum, but his
petition was dismissed by the Constitutional Court, which said
that the courts have no power to inquire into the internal
procedures of the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Attracts 75 percent of Foreign Direct Investment in Sub-region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria attracted 7.7 billion U. S.
dollars as foreign direct investment between 1994 and 1999,
representing three quarters of the total amount in the West
African sub-region, said a report issued by the African
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was made available to Xinhua here on
Wednesday, said that most of the investment Nigeria attracted went
to the country's oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
"The expectations are that Nigeria's return to civilian rule
will attract even larger inflows over the next few years, while
the region as a whole is likely to become more popular with
foreign investors, as the economic reforms take root," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Nigeria's current economic
liberalization and policy reforms designed to encourage the
private sector are likely to enhance its appeal to investors
especially in the fields related to infrastructure development,
construction and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The pace of economic reform in West Africa accelerated in 1999
mainly as a result of the return to civilian rule in the region's
largest economy, Nigeria, and the quickened steps taken towards
regional coordination of monetary and fiscal policies by the
Economic Community of West African States, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's money supply growth has been reduced to less than 20
percent in recent years as a result of the declination of
inflation, the document said, noting that ''Nigerian inflation
which peaked at 72 percent in 1995 fell steeply to 8.21 percent
and 10.32 percent in 1997 and 1998, respectively."
</P>
<P>
The document praised Nigeria's new democratic government which
it said has chosen an expansionary path that will raise the
economic growth rate to nearly 4 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The document also predicted that Ghana is expected to recover
from its economic recession in 1999 and score a 5 percent growth
this year.

<HEADLINE> Door Still Open for Resuming Syrian-Israeli Talks: Syrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Syria left the door open for the
resumption of the Syria-Israeli peace negotiations, said Syrian
Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Syria has no objection to the U.S. viewpoint that there are
chances to resume the Syrian-Israeli talks, and is ready to seek
revival of the talks on the return of the Golan Heights, Shareh
told reporters after meeting here with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria agreed to resume contacts and intensify
exchange of views with the U.S. as Washington believes there is
still a chance to reach a just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East before U.S. President Bill Clinton leaves office in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for a day-long
visit after two-day visits to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas to discuss the Syrian-Israeli peace talks with Shareh, who
was in the Egyptian capital for Arab meetings.
</P>
<P>
Albright did not speak to reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Before her meeting with Shareh, Albright held talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to brief him on the latest
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. The two sides
have agreed to hold negotiations near Washington early next week.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. State Department official said that Shareh told
Albright that Syria "would like to find a way" to reopen
negotiations with Israel. But "it is going to take some time before
we get a resumption of the talks," the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Shareh, meanwhile, stressed that Syria would not sacrifice Arab
rights, defined as recovering all the territories occupied by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, including Syria's Golan Heights,
and restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke down last January due to
disputes over Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the
control of water resources.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Children Wounded in Left-over Bomb Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi boys have been injured
when a bomb believed to be left over from the 1991 Gulf War
exploded, a local report said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened in the Al-Dair town, some 40 kilometers
north of the Al-Basra city in the southern Basra Province, the
report said. No exact time was given.
</P>
<P>
The two wounded boys, identified as 8-year-old Satar Hamdan Aziz
and 12-year-old Jabar Hamdan Aziz, were sent to hospital
immediately for emergency treatment.
</P>
<P>
The previous such incident occurred on April 9 when a bomb went
off, wounding two women, named as Saada Abbas Shalan and Jawahir
Faris Shalan, 60 kilometers west of the capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Gulf War and the ensuing bombings by the
U.S. and British planes over the two no-fly zones in southern and
northern Iraq, have left many unexploded bombs, thus posing threat
to people's life.
</P>
<P>
To avoid civilian casualties, Iraqi civil defense has been
engaged in the arduous work of defusing unexploded cluster bombs.
Over 56,000 bombs and a cruise missile left over from the 1991 Gulf
War and the regular U.S.-British bombardments have been defused.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi civil defense has warned that citizens must not approach
or touch unknown objects, let alone take unexploded bombs to their
houses.

<HEADLINE> Miss Greece Criticized for Contesting in Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Wednesday criticized as "
foolish" the participation of a Greek beauty queen in a contest in
northern Turkish Cypriot area of the island.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said in a statement
that "Miss Greece" Katerina Delli has violated the laws of the
Republic of Cyprus by entering the country illegally and recklessly
allowing the northern regime to exploit her presence there.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in the
north in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey, against the
internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Delli, during her contest in northern Cyprus, was featured in
the Turkish Cypriot press holding a flag of the northern regime.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said Delli's "presence in the illegal Turkish Cypriot
regime" to participate in the contest has provoked the feelings of
the Cypriot people.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Cyprus News Agency, Greek government
also criticized Delli's action.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Greek embassy here said that Delli's visit
to northern Cyprus is a private affair. "The Greek government had
no knowledge about the visit and consequently bears no
responsibility," he stressed.

JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
suggested Wednesday night that he will form a new coalition "in a

<P>
Interviewed by Israel's Channel One television, Barak stated
that any ministers voting along with the oppositions for an early

</P>
<P>
This means that as a result of their voting against the
government, ministers from three of his ruling partners -- Shas,
National Religious Party (NRP) and Yisrael Ba'aliya -- will be
dismissed soon.
</P>
<P>
These ministers are Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli
Yishai, Religious Affairs Minister Yitzhak Cohen, Health Minister
Shlomo Benizri, National Infrastructure Minister Eli Suissa, all
from Shas, Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, from
NRP, and Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, from Yisrael Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
A "formal announcement" would follow Sunday's weekly cabinet
meeting, Barak added, as technically a cabinet meeting is required
for the dismissal of ministers.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Barak in Three-Option Political Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (Parliament)
Wednesday morning gave preliminary approval to a motion calling for
early elections, a move that may threaten the survival of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's fragile coalition government and the whole
Middle East peace process in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Although Wednesday's voting is only for the preliminary reading
of the bill, which still waits for going through the Knesset Law
Committee and three more readings, its passage with a 61-48 margin
was already regarded as a warning to Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
Barak is now facing a three-option political dilemma in the most
serious coalition crisis since he took office last July.
</P>
<P>
But all the options, whatever Barak chooses, will no doubt cast
shadow over Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians and other
Arab countries, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Since three ruling partners in Barak's coalition -- Shas,
Yisrael Ba'aliya, National Religious Party (NRP) -- voted along
opposition parties during Wednesday morning's Knesset showdown, the
first option for Barak is to eat his words and resume talks with
the powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas party over its demands for more
government funding for its nearly bankrupt Orthodox educational
network.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Shas will re-endorse the government once it
gets the cash and Yisrael Ba'aliya will also not quit the coalition
once its demands are met.
</P>
<P>
The three right-wing parties carried out their rebellion even
though officials in Barak's office pledged to kick them out of the
government if they voted against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that should Barak fulfil his threats finally,
his administration will surely be dwarfed from a 68-52 majority to
a 42-member minority in the 120-seat Knesset, with the loss of the
17 seats of Shas, the five seats of the NRP, and the four seats of
Yisrael Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
Barak's concession will keep his government's majority intact,
but Barak will suffer a serious blow in the eyes of the public. The
patched-up coalition is only waiting for another major crisis once
the insatiable parties feel hungry again.
</P>
<P>
Such an option will also tie Barak's hands under the negotiation
table with the Palestinians and the Syrians, as those hawkish
parties are inclined to oppose making more concessions to the
Palestinians and Syria regarding the Israeli withdrawal
respectively from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are currently in talks to reach a
final-status framework agreement and a final peace accord before
the September 13 deadline. They will begin a new round of talks in
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
The second option for Barak is to fire the ministers and deputy
ministers of the three rebelling parties and recruit new partners
from Shinui, Democratic List, and Am Ehad, which will build up a
minority government with 52 seats in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Depending upon 10 votes from Israeli Arabs' parties, the
government may push forward peace proposals with the Palestinians
through the Knesset with a thin majority.
</P>
<P>
In such a difficult-to-manage government, Barak will refrain
from taking risks to launch controversial and dauntless peace
initiatives with the Palestinians, such as peace plans about the
fate of Jerusalem, the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, having run into a moment of truth, the Israeli-
Palestinian peace track is in dire need of such initiatives to
resolve thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace track is also waiting for daring
proposals to reopen.
</P>
<P>
The final option for the Israeli prime minister is to resort to
Israeli people and embrace an early election.
</P>
<P>
"I won't hesitate, if necessary, to go straight to the Israeli
people, and the people will know how to judge the behavior of
those, who will interrupt this mission (the peace process)," Barak
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Historically, an identical early-election legislation passed a
preliminary reading in July 1998 against then Benjamin Netanyahu's
government, which was seemingly harmless at first but toppled the
then regime later.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, a new election will not happen in six to 10 months, as
the bill has to go through the Knesset legislative procedure,
leaving plenty of time for political maneuvering, and there were
indications that some ruling coalition legislators who backed the
bill simply wanted to send a warning to Barak.
</P>
<P>
However, the uncertainty during the transition time between now
and the final reading of the early-election bill will drain Barak's
attention from the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Barak may have to play tough to the Palestinians
and the Syrians during the campaign for a new election to attract
voters as many as possible. Such a tough stand may result in
deadlocks in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and Syrian leaders, Barak's negotiating rivals,
will also adopt a wait-and-see attitude toward the peace talks as
long as they can not ascertain the survival of the Barak
administration.
</P>
<P>
They don't want to negotiate with a loser in the internal
crisis, and history has proved that the delay itself is a major
threat to the Middle East peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is appealing for
377.7 million U.S. dollars to address the immediate needs of 13.4
million people affected by the drought in the Horn of Africa, the
UN humanitarian aid coordination office OCHA said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal targets 10 million beneficiaries in Ethiopia, 2.2
million in Kenya, 750,000 in Somalia, 335,000 in Eritrea and 150,
000 in Djibouti, according to OCHA. There is an immediate need for
medicines and health services, safe water, food, seeds and tools,
and support with livestock.
</P>
<P>
"If relief aid is late and inadequate, this humanitarian crisis
can easily become a human tragedy of historic proportions," said
Catherine Bertini, Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for
the Drought in the Greater Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Three consecutive years of poor rains and crop failures have
exhausted the coping mechanisms of populations in the region. OCHA
urges donors to respond generously to the present appeal, saying
that the serious effects of the drought can be contained if the
required resources will be made available quickly.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-three percent of French voters
approve the shortening of presidential term from seven to five
years, said a poll published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted on June 6 on telephone with 1,012 people by
the IPSOS polling institute and Le Point weekly, showed that a
majority of people from all political orientations of France will
vote for the constitutional reform in a referendum expected to be
held at the end of September.

<P>
French President Jacques Chirac proposed on Monday that France
hold a referendum on shortening the seven-year presidential term,
which he said is too long and does not meet the requests of a
democratic system today.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year presidential term came down from the Third
Republic of France established in 1871 and was adopted by
President Charles de Gaulle in his 1962 Constitution of the Fifth
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Socialist government adopted on Wednesday a
draft law on reforming the presidential term which will be
presented to the National Assembly on June 14 and the Senate June
30.

<HEADLINE> Important Findings in U.N. Report" Progress of the World's Women 2000" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7(Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) launched here Wednesday a
biennial report titled "Progress of the World's Women 2000".
</P>
<P>
The report assesses how globalization impacts women's lives
using three indicators: gender equality in secondary education
enrollment, women's share of seats in parliament, and women's
share of paid employment.
</P>
<P>
Following are the important findings of the report:
</P>
<P>
WOMEN"S SHARE OF SEATS IN PARLIAMENT
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe has suffered the most dramatic decreases of
women's seats in parliament, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 nations in Western Europe and other developed
countries, the United States ranks 19 in the number of seats held
by women in congress. The United States has reached 12 percent,
followed by Italy (10 percent), Malta(9.2 percent), France(9.1
percent), Japan(8.3 percent) and Greece(6.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
Women's share of seats in parliament increased in 17 developed
and developing countries from 1987 to 2000, most notably because
of governmental positive action and quotas.
</P>
<P>
Eight countries have achieved the goal of at least a 30
percent share of seats held by women in parliament. They are:
Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, South
Africa and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
GIRLS ENROLMENT IN SECONDARY EDUCATION DETERIORATES IN SUB-
SAHARAN AFRICA
</P>
<P>
The level of girl's enrollment in secondary education has
seriously deteriorated in much of sub-Saharan Africa, and the
report draws linkage between increased indebtedness and declines
in enrollment. Of the 15 countries with decreases in girls'
enrollment, 12 also showed an increase in national debt.
</P>
<P>
While 11 percent of countries have achieved gender equality in
secondary education enrollment, there have been decreases in: 11
out of 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa; 7 out 11 countries in
Central and Western Asia; 6 out of 26 countries in Latin America
and the Caribbean and 6 out 9 countries in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S SHARE OF PAID EMPLOYMENT
</P>
<P>
Much of women's work is invisible to economic decision makers,
particularly unpaid"caring" work and the informal sector labor of
street vendors and home-based workers.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic transition, when State-run businesses
privatize and a market economy is ushered in, women and girls
often pay the price, especially when services such as day care and
health care are cut back.
</P>
<P>
Women typically provide around 70 percent of the time spent on
unpaid care work within the family while men provide around 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
There are only a few countries in the world where women's share
of paid employment in industry and services in around 50 percent,
and handful in which it is somewhat higher.
</P>
<P>
The report found that from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s,
women's share of paid employment had increased in most regions,
with the exception of parts of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1990s, the share ranged from a high of 54 percent
in Ukraine and Latvia to 5 percent in Chad.
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 Western Europe and other developed countries, the
United States ranked sixth with 48 percent. The lowest shares were
in Luxembourg with 36 percent and Malta with 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Western Europe and other developed nations, the
United States has the highest share of women in administrative and
managerial positions. From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, the
United States's share of women in administrative and managerial
positions increased from 38 percent to 47 percent, compared with
the United Kingdom with 22 to 23 percent, Canada with 35 to 40
percent.

<HEADLINE> NATO Denies Amnesty International Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization on Wednesday denied an accusation by Amnesty
International that the western military alliance deliberately
targeted civilians during last year's 78-day air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The London-based international human rights watchdog released a
60-page report which has alleged that NATO's bombing of the Serb
Radio and Television station, in which 16 people were killed,
constituted a war crime.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General George Robertson said in a written
statement that the Amnesty International accusation was "baseless
and ill-founded".
</P>
<P>
The Briton quoted Carla del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the
United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, as saying that there was no deliberate targeting of
civilians or of unlawful military targets by NATO during the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Del Ponte made the remark at last week's U.N. Security Council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said that the western military alliance"
scrupulously adhered to international law, including the law of
war, throughout the conflict and made every effort to minimize
civilian casualties".
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that mistakes were made or weapons
malfunctioned leading to civilian deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
On April 11 last year, NATO war planes bombed a civilian train
travelling on a bridge in southern Serbia, killing more than 10
people and injuring dozens.
</P>
<P>
On April 14 last year, NATO war planes bombed a civilian convoy
of Kosovar Albanians and caused more than 70 deaths in
southwestern Kosovo. It took NATO days to acknowledge the fact
that civilians were bombed and killed in that incident.
</P>
<P>
On April 20 last year, NATO war planes targeted the
headquarters of the Serb Radio and Television station killing 16
people working on night shift.
</P>
<P>
NATO also bombed civilian coaches travelling inside Kosovo
killing Kosovar Albanians on these occasions.
</P>
<P>
NATO also bombed Yugoslav power grids and running-water supply
systems, causing great difficulties to the civilians of the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombed factories that manufactured motor vehicles,noodles,
electrical fans, vacuum cleaners and other household utilities as
well.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities gave the casualty of civilians during
the NATO air strikes at more than 1,000 deaths.

<HEADLINE> Russia Extends Its Peacekeepers' Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council, upper
house of parliament, Wednesday unanimously voted for prolonging
the presence of the Russian peacekeeping troops in the Yugoslavia
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The prolongation was proposed by Russian President Vladimir
Putin on Wednesday, Federation Council speaker Yegor Stroyev told
the upper house before the voting.
</P>
<P>
Exactly a year ago, under the understandings reached by Group-8
foreign ministers peacekeeping contingents were sent to the
breakaway province from NATO states and neutral countries, and
from Russia -- at Yugoslavia's special request.
</P>
<P>
On June 25, 1999, the Federation Council at an extraordinary
closed-door session gave its consent to the participation of
Russian troops in the international peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The total size of the Russian force in Kosovo is 3,616 persons,
currently divided into five battalions, control bodies, logistical
units and an airdrome service unit.
</P>
<P>
Russian peacekeepers do not have their own control sector in
Kosovo, therefore they have to operate in the British, American,
German and French sectors.
</P>
<P>
Now the number of Russian peacekeepers abroad tops to over 10,
000,ranking second after the United States. The Russian units are
mainly deployed in Bosnia, Kosovo, Moldova, Tajikistan, the North
Caucasus' South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions, as well as in some
African conflicting states.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Calls for Urgent Security Council Meeting on DRC Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has called on the U.N.
Security Council to convene an urgent meeting to discuss the
renewed fighting between its troops and Ugandan forces in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the 15-nation Council,
published here Wednesday, Joseph Mutaboba, the Rwandan permanent
representative to the United Nations, said, "Uganda should be
seriously condemned" for starting the fighting in the city of
Kisangani, which broke out Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan ambassador, in his letter, said that Rwanda wished
to see U.N. observers on the ground "taking the right positions or
actions, instead of trying to please the two sides or apportion
blame."
</P>
<P>
He said that Rwanda remains committed to the Lusaka peace
accord, which, he said, is the only feasible framework for the
settlement of the crisis in the DRC and the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no reaction yet from the Ugandan side.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met Tuesday and condemned the fighting.
In a statement read to the press after the meeting, the Council
president, Jean David-Levitte of France, said, "armed engagements
between the two foreign armies of Rwanda and Uganda on the
territory of the DRC" were incompatible with the Lusaka cease-fire
agreement, signed by six African countries in the Zambian capital
of Lusaka on July 10.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 civilians have been killed in fighting which
raged for a third day Wednesday between Rwandan and Ugandan
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials and aid workers put the death toll at more than
50 civilians, including at least 19 children, since the beginning
of the fighting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda used to be strong allies but now back
different rebel factions fighting in the DRC and have clashed
several times for control of Kisangani, a center of the vast
nation's diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting came as both sides were in the process of
withdrawing from Kisangani under the agreement reached last month
in which each was to pull troops and heavy weapons back 100
kilometers from the city center and leave 216 soldiers each in
town to guard strategic installations.
</P>
<P>
It began on Monday morning when Ugandan troops shelled Rwandan
positions in response to an attack on a Ugandan army vehicle by
unidentified assailants, reports said.

<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the end of the Balkan

MOSCOW, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday strongly

terrorists and bandits in the U.S., including the so-called
foreign minister of Ichkeria(rebels' Chechen Republic) Ilyas

Russia is especially perplexed by the fact that such practices

Ministry in a protest to the U.S. embassy in Moscow.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Wednesday condemned
trouble-makers along the border between the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
But the western military alliance stopped short of identifying
the ethnic nationality of the trouble-makers, only saying that it
condemned the recent attacks against the border guards of the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
It added that the alliance is committed to cooperating with the
authorities of Macedonia to strengthen security at the border.
</P>
<P>
NATO acknowledged receiving a letter from Macedonian President
Boris Trajkovski requesting further consultations with NATO-led
peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and possible NATO assistance on
border security matters.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia on Wednesday increased its military presence along
the border with Kosovo and the country is giving out an order on
June 15 for raised military readiness.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian government officials said that the Balkan nation has
to act after two Macedonian border guards were shot from inside
Kosovo, now a de facto protectorate of NATO and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It was the second incident in two months. In early April, a
group of Kosovar Albanians kidnapped four Macedonian border guards
who were later released.
</P>
<P>
NATO has promised to consider the issues in the coming days.
</P>

UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Two Working Groups of the Ad
Hoc Committee of the whole, which run parallel to the current
United Nations General Assembly's plenary session, are continuing
the negotiations on the outcome document of the special session on
women, Shirley Brownell, the spokesperson for the President of the
General Assembly said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The special session's final outcome document, titled "Further

<P>
The spokesperson said Working Group I, which is responsible for

on past achievements and current challenges, reached agreement
Tuesday on paragraph 31 of the document, dealing with science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Movement had been slower then the day before , but there was
progress, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
There had also not been much movement in Working Group II,
which is charged with agreeing on the initiatives needed to
improve the Beijing Platform's implementation, Shirley said.
</P>
<P>
However, by Tuesday afternoon, delegations had reached
agreement on a further 12 paragraphs relating to the role of the
family, agreeing to retain 6 of 12 paragraphs and to delete the
remainder, Shirley said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7(Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Wednesday called on Iraq to cooperate with the United
Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission(UNMOVIC)
in implementing U.N. resolution 1284.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council considered this
morning the first trimestrial report of UNMOVIC and heard a
briefing by its Executive Chairman, Hans Blix.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its support for the Executive
Chairman and his action in implementing Security Council
resolution 1284 adopted late last year. The resolution established
UNMOVIC and defined its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed that the cooperation of the
Government of Iraq is essential to implementing resolutions 1284
and before the Council can decide to suspend and, afterwards, lift
the sanctions against the country which has been in place since
1990.
</P>
<P>
The new arms regime for Iraq, UNMOVIC, was created to replace
the United Nations Special Commission( UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq days before the U.S-led military
strikes against Iraq in December 1998 and Iraq has barred it from
returning since then.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. resolution 1284, UNMOVIC will be in charge of
Iraq's chemical, biological and ballistic-missle programs.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to cooperate with UNMOVIC, saying lifting the
sanctions is the precondition for the U.N. arms inspectors to
return.

MAPUTO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- An 800-km-long pipeline project to
be built between the gas fields in the southern Mozambican
province of Inhambane, and South Africa, will be environment
friendly.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will cost 900 million U.S. dollars, is to
transport natural gas from the Temane and Pande fields, in
Inhambane, to South Africa, Wednesday's "Noticias" newspaper
reported,
</P>
<P>
The pipes will be buried one meter deep, and no building is to
be erected within a space of three meters on either side od the
pipeline, the newspaper quoted Marja Prinsloo, an environment
expert, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The pipe will be covered with a kind of material which will
prevent leaks that damage the environment", said Prinsloo, adding
that the quality of this material is guaranteed for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Prinsloo explained that the technology to be used to install
and operate the pipeline has been used successfully in several
other countries, including South Africa. She expected it to have
the same success in Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption in S. Africa Calls for New Moral Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A new moral order is the only
means of reversing corruption in South Africa, said Free State
Premier Winkie Direko on Wednesday at a public service
anti-corruption workshop held in the judicial capital of
Bloemfontein.
</P>
<P>
"We pledge action against corruption and those engaging in
corrupt practices -- and yet we still see the scourge of
corruption growing and growing like a giant snowball and
threatening to engulf us," she said.
</P>
<P>
She warned that "unless we succeed in bringing about a new
moral order in this country, no code of conduct or policy will
save us and we might as well give in to corruption."
</P>
<P>
Public servants should learn to put their own desires on hold
in the interests of the country and of a sound government, she
said, urging teachers to set a careful example to their pupils,
and parents to show their children that they abide by the law, pay
their dues and respect the constitution.
</P>
<P>
One of the first steps needed is to instil in children a
respect for the property of others, Direko said.
</P>
<P>
"Part of our struggle was to break whatever we came across --
anything from school windows to street lamps. Now has come the
time that we must teach our children to respect property," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Direko also urged public servants to blow the whistle on
corrupt colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Free State director-general Khotso de Wee told the
workshop that 345 cases of corruption have been reported in the
provincial education department since January of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 107 involved check fraud, 12 were related to the
alleged misuse of government vehicles, and seven involved alleged
fraudulent subsistence and travel allowance claims.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Southern Africa
Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization and Commissioner
Edgar Hillary of Swaziland Wednesday commended the achievements
the organization has made in combating cross border crime in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the results we have so far achieved in
combating cross border crime like drug trafficking and other crime
syndicates," he said, noting that "this shows that we are not
paying lip-service to crime, but we are being practical."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hillary pointed out that the organization is facing
problems with repatriating exhibits as the laws differ from
country to country.
</P>
<P>
"The other challenge we are facing is that of increasing
conflicts in the region like the war in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo," he said, adding that "this results in firearms
crossing borders and being used to commit crime."
</P>
<P>
According to Hillary, the Interpol sub-regional bureau to be
set up next year in Harare would enhance the organization's
activities.
</P>
<P>
Hillary started his visit to the region on May 28 and has been
to Mozambique, Malawi and Tanzania. From Zimbabwe he will visit
Zambia before returning to Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The southern African regional organization was formed in 1995
with the view to cooperate in combating cross border crime.

<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 300,000 Zimbabweans will
lose their jobs by the time when the country's parliamentary
elections are held on June 24 and 25 because of political
instability, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The labor-backed party said in a statement that a sagging
economy, Afro- pessimism, land invasions, and growing violence in
rural areas would see the present level of joblessness rising, the

<P>
Factories and other businesses, said the party, were closing
leaving at least 54,000 people jobless while 150,000 jobs in the

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan and Rwandan troops
managed to achieve a ceasefire on Wednesday in Kisangani, a
northeastern city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
after skirmishes between the two armies broke out on Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) and the Rwanda
Patriotic Army (RPA) agreed to cease fire in Kisangani at 00:45
a.m. local time Wednesday," Ugandan Army Spokesman Phinehas
katirima told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Katirima, both sides had agreed to pull out their
troops 700 meters off the Tchopo Bridge.
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda and Rwanda will continue to implement the
withdrawal plan and the demilitarization of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan armies went into clashes after a UPDF's
vehicle was attacked and destroyed in Kisangani Monday morning.
The UPDF had by Tuesday night repulsed RPA forces attacking UPDF
positions in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
According to the withdrawal plan, Kisangani is divided into
different zones and the demilitarization will be carried out in
different phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, which is supposed to take five days, involves
the demilitarization of zone one which includes Bangoka Airport,
La Forestiere and Lubutu junction areas.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which should have started on Monday, aims to
realize the pull-out from the town, Simi Simi Airport and
Kapalata.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have their troops stationed in Kisangani
where they have supported rival rebel factions fighting against
DRC President Laurent Kabila. The skirmishes on Monday and Tuesday
between the two armies are the latest following the clashes early
last May.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Desertification Trees Dried Up in Southwest Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,000 trees planted in the
past eight months in an area of about 14 hectares as a treatment
for the desertification in the Angolan southwest Namibe Province
have recently been found dried up.
</P>
<P>
According to Romao Kambuandi, who is responsible for the anti-
desertification project, the disaster was mainly due to lack of
irrigation as the irrigation workers stopped their work following
the cut-off of food provision for them.
</P>
<P>
Under the "work for food" program sponsored by the World Food
Program, the organization should offer food to the workers and
clerks employed by local public services.
</P>
<P>
The anti-desertification project, located in Tombua City, began
in 1985 with the help of the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization which invested 1 million U.S. dollars in the project.
</P>
<P>
The cultured forest covers an 8,000-meter-long and
300-meter-wide area along the edge of the desert in the southwest
region of Angola.

<HEADLINE> No U.S.-Israeli Agreement on Final Israeli Withdrawal: Erekat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat Wednesday said the U.S. Administration has denied the
existence of a U.S.-Israeli agreement on the size of the final
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Palestine radio, Erekat said
Washington denied the reported development in response to a
Palestinian request for explanation in this respect.
</P>
<P>
He added that Washington said it did not discuss this matter
with Israeli officials, including Foreign Minister David Levy, and
it would soon issue an official statement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Levy reportedly told Israel's army radio Tuesday that Israel and
the U.S. had agreed the pullout will cover 1 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the signed agreements between Israel and the Palestinians,
the final phase Israeli pullout should include all territories in
the West Bank, except Jerusalem, Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and the military areas.
</P>
<P>
On the opening of a new residential area in a Jewish settlement
near the West Bank town of Ramallah, Erekat said Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat handed U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who visited Ramallah Tuesday, a detailed list of the settlement
areas which have recently been approved by the Israeli cabinet for
building new residential units.
</P>
<P>
While terming the settlement activity as destructive to the
peace process, Erekat demanded immediate U.S. interference in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
He also echoed accusations by the Palestinian leadership that
Barak and his government should be held responsible for the
deteriorating situation in the peace process and the current
deadlock in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Thailand End Discussion on Border Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and Thailand Wednesday
ended three days of discussion on ways to resolve a protracted
border dispute and expressed their hopes to start demarcation by
next year, the head of the Thai delegation told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand Paribatra, the Thai deputy foreign minister who
leads the Thai delegation, said after the meeting that the
discussion, which was held in a constructive and friendly
atmosphere, was fruitful and produced tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia claims Thailand has encroached on some parts of its
803-km-long common border in northern and western Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"No one quite knows where the exact boundary is. If every one
of us knows where exactly the boundary is, then we don't have a
job," Sukhumbhand told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Cambodian-Thai Joint Commission on
Demarcation for Land Boundary was held in the middle of last year
in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the
survey and demarcation of the land boundary, and agreed minutes on
the Terms of Reference and a master plan for the joint survey and
demarcation of the common land boundary -- were signed.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
who is due to visit Cambodia on June 14-16, will continue to
discuss the border issue with Cambodian officials, but it is
expected that the MOU will be processed during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The MoU is aimed at surveying and demarcating the land boundary
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> UNIFEM Launches Biennial Report"Progress of the World's Women 2000"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua -- The United Nations
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on Wednesday launched here a
biennial report "Progress of the World's Women 2000".
</P>
<P>
The report assesses how globalization impacts women's lives
using three indicators: gender quality in secondary education
enrollment, women's share of seats in parliament, and women's
share of paid employment.
</P>
<P>
The report shows during the last decade, only eight nations
have successfully met goals agreed upon by governments at a series
of United Nations Conferences in the 1990s, to achieve both gender
equality in secondary education enrollment and at least a 30
percent share of seats held by women in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The report draws attention to the fact that there are no
globally agreed time-bound targets relating to women's economic
equality and recommends the adoption of such specific targets.
</P>
<P>
Its data relating to women's economic status reveals that
women's share of paid employment has increased in most regions,
with the exception of parts of Eastern Europe, and that women's
share of administrative and managerial employment has increased in
51 of the 59 countries for which data was available.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Noeleen Heyzer, Executive Director of
the UNIFEM and chief sponsor of the new biennial report, said "We
need to learn from countries where women have achieved 30 percent
of seats in parliament and participate in key decision-making,
particularly in the realm of government expenditures and the
formulation of economic policy."
</P>
<P>
"This report forcefully reminds governments and corporations
that more people will benefit from globalization if women are
active in setting agendas and reshaping global economic rules,
Heyzer said,
</P>
<P>
 "UNIFEM is urgently calling upon governments, international
financial institutions and corporations to renew their commitments
to women's economic status in the face of new constraints and
opportunities posed by globalization," Heyzer added.
</P>
<P>
UNIFEM is the women's fund at the United Nations that provides
financial support and technical assistance to innovative programs
promoting women's human rights, their economic and political
empowerment and gender equality.
</P>
<P>
 UNIFEM advocates within the U.N. system to link women's
interests and concerns to all critical issues on the national,
regional and global agenda.
</P>
<P>
Created in 1976 as an innovative and catalytic fund, UNIFEM
has 12 Regional Program Directors, and a growing network of
affiliated gender advisors and specialists in Asia and the Pacific,
Western Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the
Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Adopts New Ticketing System for World Cup 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- With a view to tackling distribution
problems experienced in previous World Cups, the FIFA Executive
Committee on Tuesday unveiled a new system designed to allocate
the tickets to the final competition of the 2002 FIFA World Cup
South Korea/Japan and also approved the prices for these tickets.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, FIFA
has complete control over ticket sales. Guided by its ticketing
sub-committee, FIFA has devised a revolutionary ticketing system
for the 2002 FIFA World Cup that will offer all football fans
throughout the world equal and fair access to tickets,
accommodation and other related services", FIFA President Joseph S.
Blatter was quoted in a FIFA press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
The face value of tickets in the lowest category range from USD
60 to USD 300 for the final match. For the highest category,
prices are from 150 U.S. dollars at group matches to 750 U.S.
dollars in the final game.
</P>
<P>
International ticket sales will be divided into three distinct
sales phases; Phase I from 2 October 2000 to 31 January 2001 (the"
Initial Phase"), Phase II from 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2002(
the "Intermediate Phase") and Phase III which will commence on 1
February 2002 (the "Final Phase").
</P>
<P>
Central to FIFA's 2002 ticketing strategy is the creation of
two different ticket products designed to meet the requirements of
football fans with an unprecedented degree of flexibility. Fans
will have the option to order tickets based on matches to be
played in a specific World Cup Venue, so-called "Venue Specific
Tickets" or"VSTs", or on a pre-qualification basis, tickets for
matches that may be played by the team of the client's choice, "
Team Specific Tickets"or "TSTs".
</P>
<P>
Demand from the domestic market is anticipated to be primarily
for VSTs while international demand for TSTs. FIFA anticipates
there will be approximately 3 million tickets available for sale
after providing for approximately 200,000 tickets for seat kills (
seats with obstructed view) and tickets for FIFA Officials, guests
and observers.Of the 3 million tickets, 50 percent has been
allocated for domestic sales through KOWOC and JAWOC with
approximately 750,000 tickets for each of the two host countries.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 50 percent will be sold internationally with 880,
000 tickets going to the international general public and the
participating National Associations and 620,000 to FIFA Commercial
Affiliates and Rights' Holders who in turn place a significant
proportion of their ticket allocations at the disposal of the
public through various consumer promotions, public contests,
lotteries, etc.

<HEADLINE> HKEx in Discussion of Global Equity Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
Ltd (HKEx) announced Wednesday that it is participating in
discussions with seven other bourses to explore the feasibility of
a Global Equity Market.
</P>
<P>
The discussion is aimed to inter-connect participant exchanges'
trading systems and to develop a market structure based on the
principles of transparency, self-regulation and agency auction
price discovery.
</P>
<P>
The seven bourses -- The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Australian Stock Exchange, Euronext, the
Toronto Stock Exchange, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores and the
Bolsa de Valores de Sao Paulo -- cover the three main time zones
of Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The market capitalization of the companies listed on these
exchanges exceeds 20 trillion U.S. dollars, of which the NYSE's
listed companies represent approximately half.
</P>
<P>
The Global Equity Market will seek to provide investors around
the world with a transparent, round-the-clock, trading mechanism
for the world's global companies, increasing the global liquidity
of their stocks as well as aiding global price discovery, said the
announcement of the HKEx.
</P>
<P>
Investor will be able to access the Global Equity Market
through their domestic stock exchanges, which will keep their
brands and individual standing while participating in a virtual
global pool of liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the Global Equity Market is open to all stock
exchanges that adhere to the principles of transparency, self-
regulation and the agency auction structure, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Global Equity Market will pursue opportunities and
economies of scale that will lower transaction costs for investors
and intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
HKEx Chairman Charles Lee said Hong Kong is committed to the
concept of a 24-hour global market linking the three main time
zones and is in close cooperation with international exchanges to
achieve this.

<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- An elderly Chinese man, wrongly
jailed for nine years during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976),
was in the Great Hall of the People today to discuss juvenile
crime prevention with the country's legislators.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old Guo Jianhua is now the head of Dongzhou
Children's Village in Sanyuan County, northwest China's Shaanxi
province.
</P>
<P>
The village, built by Guo and his brother four years ago with
an investment of 500,000 yuan, is China's first non-government
charitable cause set up specially for children behind bars. Now it
accommodates 48 children, ranging in age from 5 to 16.
</P>
<P>
"Despite crimes committed by their parents, the children are
innocent," Guo said. "The children should also enjoy the rights to
life, education and care."
</P>
<P>
Today's symposium was the first large-scale juvenile crime
prevention meeting since the passage of the juvenile crime
prevention law in June 1999. China now has 370 million juveniles.
</P>
<P>
Guo was imprisoned for committing "counter-revolutionary crimes
" during the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Guo declined a government post after his rehabilitation and
instead returned to his poor home village in Dongzhou. After years
of dedicated work, Guo has turned Dongzhou into an affluent
village, where per capita income reached nearly 6,000 yuan last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Reform and opening up made our village richer," said Guo, who
was given the honorary title of "outstanding township entrepreneur
" some years ago. "I hope to repay society and help the children
grow into healthy young adults."

After their parents have signed custody agreements with village
administrators, juveniles can stay in the village until they reach
age 16, and will be provided with free accommodation, health care,
and schooling. Measures will also be taken to guarantee the
legitimate rights and interests of the children, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Five-year-old Xiao Yan has lived in the village for some time.
Before her arrival, her father was jailed for accidentally killing
her mother. He attempted suicide several times. But the once-
desperate man has regained his optimism.
</P>
<P>
Statistics suggest that about 98 percent of those jailed were
granted leniency for their good behavior in the village.
</P>
<P>
The village plays a significant role in protecting the
legitimate rights and interests of special social groups and
preventing juvenile crimes, said experts.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time that I came to the Great Hall of the
People," Guo said. His last visit to the hall was in the summer of
1992 when he was cited by the central government for helping the
poor to lead a better life.
</P>
<P>
Guo returned to the Great Hall of the People today as an
outstanding representative who defends the human rights of the
jailed and their children.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China will set up a computerized
university diploma registration system to help stamp out the
distribution of fake college diplomas, the Ministry of Education
announced today.
</P>
<P>
A trial operation of the system is now underway in
municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Chongqing, and provinces
of Liaoning and Hubei. China will expand the system nationwide in
2001, and provide on-line consultation services.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Zhenyuan, director of the ministry's student department,
said that the measure will give universities more authority to
manage their own diploma distribution, and will safeguard against
the illegal distribution of fake university diplomas.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry will build a national university diploma
document database to provide information for on-line consultation.
The registration information for university diplomas must include
the registrants' name, gender, birth date, major, degree, and
diploma serial number.

electricity a year to Thailand by about 2013 and three million kw
by 2014.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Chief Shrugs Off Iranian Defector's Story on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Director General of Turkish Police
Turan Genc dismissed on Wednesday a coined story of Iranian link to
the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing in 1988, reported the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Genc said that "Sayyid Behbahani is not a very important
person." "He told us that he worked for the Iranian intelligence
organization for some time, but he didn't tell any important thing
except that. The issue will be solved from now on," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States CBS television aired in its "60 Minutes"
program on Sunday that an Iranian named Ahmad Behbahani, who is
currently in Turkey, claimed that he has evidence that it was Iran
that planned and financed the Lockerbie bombing, which killed 270
people.
</P>
<P>
The bombshell touched off a huge uproar in the local press. But
the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT) poured cold
water on the agitation saying in a statement on Monday that
Behbahani's allegations have to be verified.
</P>
<P>
MIT underlined that the circumstances surrounding the Behbahani
case were very dubious. "We are adopting a cautious policy in order
not to create speculation and provocations both in Turkey and
abroad," it added.
</P>
<P>
Genc told reporters that Behbahani entered Turkey's Baskale
township of eastern Van province adjacent to Iran in March and he
was questioned in Van and sent to a Guest House in the Refugee Camp
in Yozgat, central Turkey.
</P>
<P>
There was nothing important in his statements and the MIT was
questioning him, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the CBS story that its reporter visited and
interviewed the Iranian national, Genc said that "those who come to
the refugee camp are interviewed before settling in the camp. They
can visit the city and come back on permission. The guest house is
just like a hotel."
</P>
<P>
"But persons whose conditions are serious can't be permitted to
leave the guest house. Behbahani was not permitted to leave the
place. Even the American CBS television wanted to make interview
with him, but we didn't permit that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Prefers Exporting Products Instead of Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reassured
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) Wednesday that it will continue
to pursue long-term measures that would allow them to stay home
and seek job opportunities here instead of going abroad.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Jose Pardo of the Department of Finance said this is
one reason why government is concentrating on building up its
advantage in the electronics and exports sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We would not want really just pure exportation of labor
because it has social costs and other problems that it creates. We
would rather hope that they use the Philippines as a production
center," Pardo said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The government's reassurance coincided with the observance of
Migrant Workers' Day on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Pardo also said the government continues to pursue measures
and benefits for the OFWs, who he said make great contributions to
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said President Joseph Estrada is thankful to the OFW
sector for their remittances that keep the Philippine economy
afloat year after year.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from his department, he said some seven million
OFWs in different parts of the world remit 7 billion U.S. dollars
every year to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Pardo noted that the president has not forgotten his commitment
to attract investments into the country so the Philippines would
be exporting world-class products instead of labor.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government wants the OFWs to be part of the
bustling electronics industry, which forms the bulk of Philippine
exports.
</P>
<P>
Filipino workers, according to Pardo, are best suited for this
industry because of their high-skill levels and comprehension of
English.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Sri Lanka's War Heroes Day Marred by Bloody Bombing  By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankans on Wednesday were
holding procession to mark the country's first ever War Heroes Day
when a suicide bomber detonated himself to assassinate a hard-line
cabinet minister leading the parade.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industrial Development C. V. Gunaratne and 21
others were killed instantly in the bombing at Ratmalana in
southern suburb of Colombo, which was blamed on separatist rebels
of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Gunaratne, 65, is the first senior government official to be
assassinated by LTTE rebels since the People's Alliance government
led by President Chandrika Kumaratunga was elected to office in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bombing happened at 1:45 p.m. local time (0745
GMT) when the minister was leading a procession in his electorate
to commemorate the War Heroes Day which fell on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One eyewitness said he saw a man approach the minister as he
walked in front of the parade. The bomber then embraced the
minister before setting off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Body parts and shattered glass covered the blast site, one
kilometer from the Ratmalana airport which is used by the air
force. Police quickly cordoned off the area and reinforcements
were sent in.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 people including the minister's wife were injured,
15 of them seriously, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
Many vehicles were also damaged in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The procession, which set off from the southern suburb of Mount
Lavinia, was on its way to the southern town of Panadura, 25 km
south of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The state Lakhanda radio said the procession was part of a fund
raising campaign to improve the welfare of thousands of government
soldiers and their families.
</P>
<P>
Gunaratne attended the main ceremony held Wednesday morning at
the President's Secretariat here to mark the War Heroes Day.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the ceremony he drove away to his constituency in
the suburban Dehiwala to take part in the march as a mark of
respect to the security forces who fight the LTTE rebels in the
northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for 17 years to carve
out a homeland for minority Tamils, are known for setting off
explosions that target government officials.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Wednesday's attack was not totally
unexpected as the police recently discovered a large haul of
explosives and weapons, including a "suicide jacket" commonly used
by the LTTE, hidden in a cricket bag and buried north of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Gunaratne was the key minister who had been advocating the need
to put the country on a war footing since 1996 and the government,
with the escalation of the war, put the country on a war footing
on May 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan government had declared the June 7 as the War Heroes
Day which was designed to bolster morale among troops in the
northernmost Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Government forces have been fighting to stop LTTE rebels taking
the key northern town of Jaffna after the rebels launched an
offensive in April.
</P>
<P>
A countrywide two-minute silence was observed Wednesday morning
followed by the address to nation by the president, who thanked
the families of soldiers who had died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"Let us bow our heads in homage to those who are making the
supreme sacrifice, so that you and I may live in comfort and peace,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
She also said that she believed there could be no military
solution to the long-running conflict with the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to reiterate that our cherished dream of peace can be
achieved only through a political solution of giving space for
every citizen of this country to live in dignity and harmony," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The president said her government was working towards bringing
in a new constitution. It has proposed to devolve powers to
regions, including one run by Tamils, in an effort to share power
with the minorities who accuse the majority Sinhalese of
discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Managing Risks of Globalization -- Key Task for Asia: ESCAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) ended its 56th
annual meeting here Wednesday with all the members agreeing that
the overarching challenge facing the region is to manage the risks
and seize the opportunities of globalization.
</P>
<P>
With development through globalization and partnership in the
21st century as its theme, the commission noted that the
irreversible nature of globalization and interdependence requires
continuous national capacity building for all the countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The commission reaffirmed its strong commitment to a rule-based
multilateral trading system that operates in a non-discriminatory
and transparent manner and that ensures predictable and secure
market access.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the World Trade Organization (WTO) is of
paramount importance to the expansion of trade, continued economic
prosperity and all-round balanced development.
</P>
<P>
However, as a lot of developing countries in the ESCAP region
are not yet members of the WTO, the secretariat was asked to give
high priority to its technical assistance and advisory services to
enable these countries to integrate into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
With a nod toward strengthening its sub-regional programs, the
commission proclaimed 2000-2009 as the Decade of Greater Mekong
Subregion Development Cooperation to draw attention and encourage
support of the international community to intensify economic and
social development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been asked to mobilize the necessary
measures to provide technical assistance to the Greater Mekong
Subregion, particularly on such key sectors as human resources
development, trade and investment, transportation and
communication, poverty alleviation and social development.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP also underlined its support for phase two of the regional
space applications program for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Space technology and its applications, it noted, are important
for vital areas from food security and agricultural systems to
natural disaster reduction, health care and hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Human resources development is also considered a key issue for
alleviating poverty, especially for the enhancement of educational,
health and employment status in marginalized population groups.
</P>
<P>
The commission resolved to focus on investments in all areas of
human resources development, including education and training,
health and nutrition and sustainable livelihood.
</P>
<P>
During this first session in the new millennium, lasting from
June 1 to June 7, ESCAP welcomed Georgia as its 52nd member and
said farewell to its outgoing Executive Secretary Adrianus Mooy of
Indonesia. Kim Hak-Su from South Korea will take over as ESCAP's
new executive secretary on July 1.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Session on Women Makes Headway on Final Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua -- The United Nations General
Assembly on Wednesday entered the third day of its special session
to review the progress of women's rights, making headway in
approving the document that will pave the way for further
implementation of the Platform for Action approved five years ago
at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. official, meanwhile, the session's final
outcome document, titled "Further actions and initiatives to
implement the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action", is
the subject of intensive informal consultations in two Working
Groups of the Ad Hoc of Committee of the Whole, which runs
parallel to the Assembly's plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The Groups are mandated with reaching consensus on the final
declaration to be adopted on June 9, the last day of the special
session.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said the consultations in Working Group I,
which is responsible for reaching consensus on the document's
introduction and the chapters on past achievements and current
challenges, had not succeeded in clearing entire paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
Group II, which is charged with agreeing on the initiatives
needed to improve the Platform's implementation, was able to
approve 23 paragraphs, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Working Group I had problems with certain paragraphs on family,
health and armed conflict, and forwarded the contentious sections
to a "Contact group" whose task was to craft language on which
everyone could agree, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly special session on women,
under the theme of "Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and
Peace for the Twenty-first Century," is focusing on examples of
good practices, positive actions, lessons learned, obstacles and
key challenges remaining in implementing the Beijing Platform for
Action in the last five years.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
met here on Wednesday morning to be briefed by the U.N.
Secretariat on the latest developments in Sierra Leone, where
government army clashed with rebels overnight near the northern
town of Kabala.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
was reported to have told the United Nations that they would
release 21 Indian peacekeepers they were holding very soon.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) Tuesday
reported that the RUF rebels had transferred more than 20 U.N.
peacekeepers to an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told a press conference
Tuesday here that 21 of the 23 Indian peacekeepers, who had been
surrounded by the RUF in eastern town of Kuiva in Sierra Leone,
were transferred overnight to an unknown location by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the movement of the 21 personnel
could follow the same pattern as that of other peacekeepers, who
have been released first through Foya in Liberia and then to
Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Eckhard said that U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan had emphasized in a telephone call to Liberian
President Charles Taylor Tuesday that all restrictions on the
movement of U.N. personnel must be lifted and that anyone who
mistreated peacekeepers would be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
The call to President Taylor, who was entrusted by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to take the
lead in obtaining the release of all detainees, underscored that
the job to end the detainee situation through diplomacy had not
been completed simply because U.N. personnel did not enjoy the
freedom of movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Sierra Leone resumed in May when rebels took
hostage hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers, killed several more and
started marching towards the nation's capital of Freetown in
defiance of the July 1999 peace accord, under which the United
Nations can play a role in monitoring the peace process in the
West African country.

<HEADLINE> Namibian President Denies Possessing Diamond Mine in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma
vehemently denied Wednesday a local newspaper report that he owns
a diamond mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where
his troops are helping the government quell a rebellion, according
to South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued on Nujoma's behalf signed by acting Minister
of Foreign Affairs, Tuliameni Kalomoh, said the report in the
Windhoek Observer was "utterly false".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report on Saturday alleged that Nujoma owned a
diamond mine at Maji-Munene, 45 km from the town of Tshikapa in
central DRC.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which also published photographs of the mine,
claimed the operation was being run by members of Namibia Defence
Force.
</P>
<P>
Kalomoh said: "President Nujoma has denied the allegation with
contempt."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Namibia has stated time and time again that
our decision to send to troops to the DRC was not motivated by any
economic considerations," he added.
</P>
<P>
His statement also defended that the presence of Namibian
troops in the DRC had "created the necessary conditions for the
deployment of UN peacekeeping force in the Congo and allowing the
Congolese people to find a lasting political solution through the
democratic process".
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Namibia has sent troops, believed to
number about 2, 000, to help DRC President Laurent Kabila in his
fight against rebel groups backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Business Confidence Index Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African Chamber of
Business' (SACOB's) Business Confidence Index fell five points in
May, the largest drop this year and the fourth consecutive monthly
fall, SACOB chief executive officer Kevin Wakeford said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing here, Wakeford said the index has
been negatively affected by lower import volumes, the average U.S.
dollar gold price declining, headline inflation being up to 4.5
percent as well as the rand reaching a new low against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Wakeford said SACOB has called on the South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel, in conjunction with the Reserve Bank, to
urgently review inflation targets.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni recently stressed his
determination to fulfil his constitutional mandate to meet the
three to six percent inflation target by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
The chamber disagreed that the current range of three to six
percent is attainable, advising that a band of five to eight
percent should be set as a realistic target.
</P>
<P>
Wakeford added that the May 10 general strike against job
losses led by the Congress of South African Trade Union also
impacted on the business confidence.

<HEADLINE> Burundians in Camps to Be Release by End of July: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Burundians interned in
controversial regroupment camps will be released by July 31,
former South African president and chief mediator for the troubled
Great Lakes country Nelson Mandela and Burundi President Pierre
Buyoya agreed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also reached consensus that Burundi's troops
should be integrated on a half-to-half basis to include Tutsi and
opposing Hutu factions.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Buyoya also discussed the release of political
prisoners, some of whom have been held for seven years without
trial.
</P>
<P>
Although they did not reach a conclusion on this matter, the
two leaders agreed this issue will be discussed again when Mandela
visits Burundi next week.
</P>
<P>
"For people like us who spent 27 years in prison it is
difficult to remain calm when discussing prisoners and having
people in regroupment camps," said Mandela, adding that it has
taken a great deal of courage on Buyoya's part to reach
Wednesday's decisions.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela stressed that all agreements made at the
meeting at his residence will still have to be endorsed by
Burundi's cabinet, national assembly, judiciary, religious leaders
and the rank and file of the population.
</P>
<P>
On the controversial issue of a ceasefire between the
Tutsi-dominated government army and the mainly Hutu rebels,
Mandela said he has warned Burundian generals at the meeting not
to be in too much of a hurry.
</P>
<P>
"I told them about our experience in this country and that of
the Irish Republican Army. We said we will not sign a ceasefire
until we are convinced that the process is irreversible. A
ceasefire before a settlement is something impossible," he added,
warning that if the ceasefire accord is signed too soon, the
rebels will not agree to the peace process which takes its next
round in the Tanzanian town of Arusha in July.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said he has asked Mandela to request the rebels to
"cease attacking the population" while the regroupment camps will
be in the process of being dismantled.
</P>
<P>
"That is something very reasonable," responded Mandela, saying
he believed that the rebels will agree to a ceasefire at Arusha.
</P>
<P>
On the integration of the Burundian military, Mandela said the
rebels had previously wanted a 75 percent Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
"But I persuaded them against that. It will never work. The
proper way to start is 50-50," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 200,000 people, both Hutus and Tutsis, have been
killed since October 1993 when the conflict between Tutsi-led
government troops and Hutu rebels broke out.
</P>
<P>
Peace efforts have dragged on for two years with violence
continuing on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Hutus represent 85 percent of Burundi's population, who are
mostly peasant farmers.

<HEADLINE> Next Parliament Must Solve Land Issue: Zimbabwean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Wednesday said that the next parliament must take bold measures
to solve the land issue.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was addressing the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) parliamentary candidates at a
pre-election parliamentary caucus in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic progress in Zimbabwe was based on the
ownership and possession of land.
</P>
<P>
He said the revolutionary struggle to liberate the country was
not finished until land was given to the people.
</P>
<P>
"The next parliament must be a parliament to conclude this last
part of our revolution to own our resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in addition to the 804 farms that were gazetted for
acquisition, the government would look for more to add to the
list.
</P>
<P>
He said if Britain and the United States had not reneged on
their promise to fund land reform, the process would have been
concluded a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
War veterans of the 1970s liberation struggle for independence
from Britain started occupying white-owned commercial farms in
February this year, saying they wanted arable land.
</P>
<P>
The land issue generated interest throughout the world with
Britain and other European countries condemning Mugabe while
African leaders supported him.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government would only have formidable economic
policies if resources were owned by the majority.
</P>
<P>
He said it was surprising that issues such as high inflation
and interest rates were being blamed on the government when in
actual fact they were created by the minority who owned the
resources.

<HEADLINE> France Receives No Request for Arrest of Cote d'Ivoire Ex-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- France said Wednesday it has received
no request from the judicial authority of Cote d'Ivoire for
arresting Henri Konan Bedie, former president of the country who
is living in exile in France.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry Anne Gazeau-Secret
said the French embassy in Abidjan has been asked by Cote d'Ivoire
authorities to cooperate with four rogatory judicial commissions
in charge of investigating the alleged embezzlement of public fund
by Bedie as well as his family members and top aides.
</P>
<P>
"But our embassy in Abidjan has not received so far
confirmation relative to an international arrest warrant," she
said without giving more opinion on the decision by the military
junta of Cote d'Ivoire to prosecute Bedie.
</P>
<P>
France and Cote d'Ivoire have a bilateral agreement on judicial
cooperation which was signed in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Bedie and his entourage went into exile in France after a coup
was staged by General Robert Guei on December 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The junta has launched "an operation of clean hands" and
accused Bedie, former Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, and
former Finance Minister Niamien N'Goran of embezzlement of public
fund.
</P>
<P>
The General Prosecutor of Cote d'Ivoire issued an international
arrest warrant for them Tuesday, but he did not ask France to
extradite these men.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said France is not enthusiastic to cooperate
with Cote d'Ivoire over the affair, which Paris considers as an
internal problem connected with the next presidential election in
the country.
</P>
<P>
An extradition of Bedie will also mean that France will lose
its reputation as a country of exile for former African heads of
state or government who are toppled in coups or internal turmoil.

<HEADLINE> More Assistance Urged for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Atomic Forum (FORATOM)
Wednesday urged more international assistance for Ukraine that is
closing down its Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The forum, the trade association of the European nuclear
industry, said that with the closure date for Chernobyl now set,
the international community must now do its utmost to help Ukraine
tackle the resulting problems.
</P>
<P>
The problems are expected to emerge from the country's loss of
generating capacity. At present, almost 44 percent of the former
Soviet republic's electric power is nuclear-generated.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the loss of generating capacity resulting from
the Chernobyl closure, there is the threat of large-scale job
losses that could easily worsen Ukraine's existing socio-economic
problems," said the FORATOM in a written statement issued after
Ukraine announced its plan to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear
power station on December 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had pledged to close Chernobyl, where the world's worst
nuclear accident occurred 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine is fulfilling its pledge to close Chernobyl. Given the
pressing need for economic improvement in the region, the
international community is under an obligation to help minimize
the impact that the Chernobyl closure will have on Ukraine," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has so far provided Ukraine with 100
million euros (94 million U.S. dollars) as the Chernobyl shelter
fund. Closure of the power plant was among conditions for the
release of another 92 million euros (86 million dollars) as macro-
economic assistance from the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The FORATOM has promised Ukraine 1.5 billion dollars in loan as
part of a global package involving the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and other donors as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- FBI Director Louis J. Freeh bluntly warned Attorney General
Janet Reno that she faced an "irrevocable political conflict of
interest" in investigating allegations of fund-raising abuses
during President Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign, and he said
there was "compelling evidence" to justify requesting that an
independent counsel be named to investigate Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
-- With the clock running down on a timetable for peace,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators plan to intensify their talks
and shift them to the Washington Area next week, Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright said Tuesday. The negotiating teams,
led by Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Korei, are expected
to start the new round of talks Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Democratic Party said it was undertaking a 25 million
dollar television campaign to "redefine" Vice President Al Gore.
Breaking with Gore's own proposal to ban the use of unrestricted
contributions to pay for advertising, officials said soft money
would cover part of the costs.
</P>
<P>
-- By measuring the distances to 100,000 galaxies scattered
across billions of light-years of space, a robotic telescope in
eastern Australia has produced the first detailed, large-scale map
of the region of the universe inhabited by Earth and its own
galaxy, the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor cost climbed a revised 1.6 percent on an annual basis
in the first quarter, but the Fed warned that damage from the
prolonged tight labor market may have already been done.
Productivity rose at a strong 2.4 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Putin pressed his proposal for joint
development of a missile-defense system with the United States as
he continued an Italy tour that included talks with business
leaders. China and Canada warned the United States against
unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty to build a missile
shield.

<P>
Kono said the Japanese side is satisfied with the smooth
development of bilateral ties and vowed to make unremitting
efforts for the enhancement of such relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides also exchanged views on
strengthening and expanding the two countries' friendly
cooperation in various fields, and reached consensus on many
issues.

<P>
Dong Yanmei, 10,000m champion in the 1997 National Games, won
the 5,000m title with a time of 15 minutes 3.99 seconds, a far cry
from her training partner Jiang Bo's world record of 14:28.09, set
in the same National Games.
</P>
<P>
Yin Lili finished second in 15:06.30, Song Liqing third in 15:
18.62 and Lan Lixin fourth in 15:32.84.
</P>
<P>
This was the first overall victory for Ma's Family Army since
his students claimed three gold medals and two world records in
the National Games three years ago in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But Ma's runners suffered a surprise defeat in the 800m event
as Lin Na was overtaken just a few meters from the finish line
after leading most of the race.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuanping, who was not from Ma's training camp, took the
victory in two minutes 0.63 seconds. Lin finished second with 0.
04 seconds behind. Ma's another runner Yang Wei came in third
with a time of 2:02.82.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Thailand Plan for Power Station on Lancang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China and Thailand signed a letter
of intent here today on the joint building of the Jinghong Power
Station on the Lancang River, which also flows down to Thailand
and other five Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the power station, expected to cost about one U.
S. dollars, will begin in 2006. According to the letter of intent,
Thailand will hold 70 percent of the stakes, and China the
remaining 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The power station, in Xishuangbanna, is about 300 km from the
northern border of Thailand. It has an installed capacity of 1.5
million kw and is expected to generate 6.3 billion kwh of
electricity upon completion.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build a group of 14 power stations on the
Langcang River with a total installed capacity of 22.6 million kw.
At present, the Manwan Power Station on the river is in operation.
Construction of the Dachaoshan Power Station is well underway.
</P>
<P>
Owing to its rapid economic development, Thailand is
encouraging purchase of electricity from abroad and has adopted
preferential policies for private electricity firms.
</P>
<P>
The Jinghong Power Station is to transmit 1.5 million kw of
electricity a year to Thailand by about 2013 and three million kw
by 2014.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Huizhou city in south China's
Guangdong Province started today to drain polluted water from West
Lake and replace it with clean water from a nearby reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The lake has the same name as the more famous West Lake in
Zhejiang Province, known nationally for its scenic beauty and many
historical spots.
</P>
<P>
Huizhou's West Lake is 1,600 years old as a tourist resort.
Urbanization has contributed to the lake pollution, with some one
million tons of sewage discharged into it every year.
</P>
<P>
The city government said it will take 20 days to drain the 1.5
million cu m of silt-filled water from the lake, before the
reservoir water can be channeled in.
</P>
<P>
The city government has invested 12 million yuan (1.4 million
US dollars) this year to build an underground pipeline for the
drainage project.
</P>
<P>
The work should be finished by the end of this month, and is
expected to substantially change the appearance of the lake.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 350 business leaders
from Southeast China's Fujian Province and Hong Kong gathered here
Wednesday for a presentation to seek further cooperation in new
and high technology industries.
</P>
<P>
"High tech industries in Fujian have entered a new phase of
development, providing ample space and opportunity for investment,
" Xi Jinping, governor of Fujian, said at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The prospect looks brighter for a joint effort to speed up the
development of high tech industries in Fujjian, and Hong Kong has
become a key export destination and external capital source for
the province, Xi explained.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the governor said, Fujian planned a number of
steps to expand cooperation in science and technology between
Fujian and Hong Kong, including establishing a risk investment
mechanism and encouraging people from Hong Kong's business and
science circles to involve in research and development projects of
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Other major steps include attracting Hong Kong high technology
businesses to operate in Fujian, raising funds in Hong Kong's
capital market for Fujian's enterprises, and building a joint high-
tech industrial park in Fujian, according to Xi.
</P>
<P>
Fujian had 26,281 foreign invested enterprises by the end of
1999, involving a contractual investment of 59.58 billion U.S.
dollars, which put the province in the third place in the country
in terms of foreign investment, and the total foreign trade volume
hit 17.645 billion U.S. dollars in 1999.

<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Ph.D. candidates are
scheduled to work in China's countryside during their summer
vacation to assist with local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The program, jointly sponsored by the Central Committee of
Communist Youth League of China and the All-China Students'
Federation, will assign doctoral students to help out with more
than 400 badly-needed projects submitted by local governments.
</P>
<P>
Leading schools such as the universities of Beijing, Nanjing
and Jilin have shown great interest in the program, and have
assigned groups of Ph.D. candidates majoring in certain fields to
appropriate projects.
</P>
<P>
"China has some 40,000 Ph.D. candidates and five percent of
them have volunteered to work for rural areas. I'm sure their
special fields of study will help promote local economic
development," said an official with the Central Committee of the
Communist Youth League.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers will maintain communication with the local
governments after the two-month summer vocation is finished, and
they may also bring the projects that are not accomplished back to
schools for continued research, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Not to Attend ECO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmet Necdet Sezer will not
attend the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit scheduled
on June 10 in the Iranian capital of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that the
president can not attend the sixth ECO summit due to his "intense
work" in early days of his term in office.
</P>
<P>
It said Turkey attaches special importance to the ECO which has
constructive functions in globalization process, and State Minister
Mehmet Kececiler will represent Turkey at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Iranian President Muhammad Khatami
on Monday sent Deputy Foreign Mohammad Hossein Adeli to Ankara as
his special envoy to invite Sezer to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in 1985. It was
joined by Afghanistan and the Central Asian and Caucasian republics
of Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan after the collapse of former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he took office on May 16, Sezer declared that he
would not take part in the forthcoming summit. But both Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem reportedly
advised him to change his mind, because the summit has "great
significance for Turkey in terms of regional politics."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey have long been cool toward each other. Recently
their relations were marred by media accusation that Iran had been
involved in the murder of famous Turkish intellectuals. Tehran
denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Offers International Bid for Construction of High-Speed Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has started the process of
calling international tenders for the construction of a high-speed
railway to link Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast and the
southern town of Aswan, Transport Ministry spokesman said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is studying the terms of the tenders, which will be
up for bidding in December, Hassan Salah was quoted as saying by
the country's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The contract, which is being drafted with the help of an unnamed
Spanish company, is estimated to be worth around 10 billion
Egyptian pounds (2.85 billion U.S. dollars), Salah said.
</P>
<P>
Spain has agreed to help Egypt finish an evaluation of the
viability for the project to traverse almost the entire length of
the country and to cover part of the project fund in loans.
</P>
<P>
Salah said the first phase of 200 kilometers between Alexandria
and Cairo will take two years to complete at a cost of 4 billion
pounds (1.14 billion dollars). The final two stages will take
another three years to build, ending in the tourist resort of
Aswan, about 700 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The railway will follow the course of the Nile River valley and
pass through major tourist destinations including Luxor, the site
of pharaonic temples and tombs.
</P>
<P>
The current Alexandria-Aswan railway line, which will remain
intact, are in poorly maintenance and runs slow trains. The new
trains will travel at a speed of up to 300 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Ibrahim el-Demiri was quoted in Tuesday's
business daily Al-Alam Al-Yom as saying that the new railway will
provide a more secure and faster train transport for tourists.
Tourism is one of the four biggest foreign exchange earners for
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's state-owned railway, which runs 7,000 kilometers,
carries about 1 billion passengers a year and has received 11
billion pounds (3.14 billion dollars) in government subsidies since
1995.

<HEADLINE> Manila Refuses Foreign Interference on Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government ruled out
Wednesday any foreign interference in the ultimate solution of the
Sulu hostage crisis even in the event talks with the Abu Sayyaf
collapse.
</P>
<P>
"We will tell them to hold the line and not to interfere with
our negotiations. It will just make it harder for everybody,"
chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado made this remark in response to the reported foreign
interference relevant to monetary demands presented by the Abu
Sayyaf in exchange for the release of the 21 mostly foreign
captives who have been held in Sulu province since April 23.
</P>
<P>
He said the government negotiating team is at present in the
process of scrutinizing the viability of the counter-proposal
presented by the Abu Sayyaf following the government's resistance
to their three self-imposed demands.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine government is keen on yielding to the
Abu Sayyaf's desire to hasten development of fishing industry in
Basilan, Tawi-Tawi and Sulu waters thus upholding its legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The other two demands, the creations of an independent Islamic
state and a Sabah Commission, remain on status quo as the
government refuses to deal with demands beyond constitutional
limitations.
</P>
<P>
Press Undersecretary Mike Toledo, for his part, said the
government is hopeful that negotiations for the safe release of
the 21 hostages will resume Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government remains committed to fulfill President Joseph
Estrada's order to seek the safe release of the hostages, Toledo
added.
</P>
<P>
Gvernment panelists led by Aventajado held formal talks with
the Abu Sayyaf on May 27 but failed to secure the release of the
hostages.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Legislative Passes Bill on Niger Delta Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Senate has endorsed with a
two-thirds majority the long-delayed Niger Delta Development
Commission (NDDC) bill, overriding president rejection.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's voting confirmed an earlier approval of the bill by
the House of Representatives, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo, objecting to some of the revises
made to the bill, had declined to sign and returned it to the
National Assembly after the House's approval.
</P>
<P>
The NDDC bill and bill for the current anti-corruption act were
 submitted by Obasanjo administration immediately after its
inauguration on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Niger delta region, which accounts for about 90 percent of
oil production in Nigeria, the largest oil-exporting country in
Africa, is among the poorest areas in the country due to decades
of neglect by the northerner-dominated military regimes and
exploitation by the foreign oil firms.
</P>
<P>
The bill is designed to tackle the problems by setting up a new
 governmental body pooling efforts and resources at federal, state
and corporate levels.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye on Wednesday urged the judicial institutions in
Tanzania and China to enhance bilateral exchanges and strengthen
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a visiting delegation of the Chinese People's
Supreme Court led the court's Vice-President Zhu Mingshan, the
Tanzanian prime minister said although the two countries have
different judicial systems, judicial institutions in the two
countries should learn from each other.
</P>

"This visit should be the beginning of many visits in this
important sector, " said Sumaye.
</P>
<P>
He told the Chinese delegation, which also includes presidents
of the High Court of China's western Gansu Province and the
Military Court of the People's Liberation Army, that Tanzania
valued the long-term friendly relationship between the two
countries and insisted on the "one China" policy over the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved a great success in the building of market
economy and Tanzania wants to learn from China in the field, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told the Tanzanian prime minister that China is trying to
build a socialist democratic judicial system in conformity with
the market economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important part of the political reform in China,"
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the delegation met with the Tanzanian Chief Justice
Barnabas Samata.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and

Myanmar leader Senior General Than Shwe on the 50th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>

cooperation between the two countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>

"in the spirit of mutual understanding, mutual trust and active

<HEADLINE> EU to Outlaw Sexual Harassment at Workplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Wednesday
adopted a directive to ban sexual harassment at workplace.
</P>
<P>
Sexual harassment "is an unacceptable affront to the
individual concerned, normally -- but not always -- a woman," EU
social policy commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou said.
</P>
<P>
She added that very few legal systems had yet got to grip with
the notion of sexual harassment and it is partly attributable to
the inherent difficulty in defining it.
</P>
<P>
"But this should not deter us from our duty to send the
strongest possible signal that sexual harassment must be outlawed
from the workplace," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The commission directive, to be transformed into national
regulation or legislation by EU member states, considered that
sexual harassment is a form of sexual discrimination and thus
entails a risk of liability for employers who fail to provide a
workplace free of harassment.
</P>
<P>
Diamantopoulou said the main purpose of the commission
directive is preventive. "By establishing a community framework
for sexual harassment, we draw attention to the problem throughout
Europe and create momentum among employers to take their own steps
to stamp it out," she said.

<HEADLINE> Russian, Finnish Presidents Pledge to Enhance Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We agreed that we must treat with care what were achieved in
relations between the former USSR, then Russia and Finland. It is
a good base for the development of our future relations," Putin
told the press following his one-on-one talks with Halonen at the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed a wide range of issues at the meeting,
particularly bilateral economic and border cooperation and
development of the customs infrastructure at the Russian-Finnish
border, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The presidents also talked over the coordination of the two
countries' efforts in international organizations, international
security and cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Finland's position in international organizations is important
" for Russia, stressed Putin.
</P>
<P>
He declared that there are no territorial questions or disputes
between Russia and Finland, because "the question is settled and
closed completely in the sphere of international law."
</P>
<P>
Putin noted that debates on territorial claims are very
dangerous and capable of destroying the existing ties between the
two countries which "should develop their relationship and look
into the future."
</P>
<P>
For her part, Halonen said that the standard of bilateral ties
permits the discussion of any matters. "I also respect the work
done by our predecessors. And we, as practical people, have tried
to resolve questions that can be solved today," she said.
</P>
<P>
After the presidents' talks, the full delegations opened full-
scale negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Putin told the guests that Russia cherishes its relations with
Finland and attaches great significance to them.
</P>
<P>
Halonen, who arrived here Tuesday evening for a two-day working
visit, said she hopes to expand cooperation with Russia on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.

<HEADLINE> Trial of World Athletics Championships Distrupter Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Trial of a group of 10 people who
posed as mascots and held up signs supporting Basque separatists
during the opening ceremony of last year's world athletics
championships in Seville, Spain, began in Seville on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a bold manner, the eight men and two women embarrassed the
organizers who, fearing possible attacks by the armed Basque
separatist group ETA, had considerably tightened security.
</P>
<P>
The group entered the Seville stadium on August 20 with tickets
bought for the opening ceremony. After the ceremony got started,
two of the protesters donned fake mascot outfits and slipped onto
the main stage. They held pro-ETA banners and danced for about 20
minutes in front of an international television audience. Others
in the group also held banners.
</P>
<P>
The protesters are charged with disrupting public order and
prosecutors are seeking fines of 730,000 pesetas (4,700 U.S.
dollars) for each of them.
</P>
<P>
They also are seeking a one-year prison sentence for one of the
protesters who allegedly bit a police agent while being detained
during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
All 10 group members were released two days after the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Pipes Drinking Water from Distant River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Water from the Dongjiang River was
channeled through a 56.3-km-long pipe to the special economic zone
of Shenzhen today to ease the drinking water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the pipeline, which started in 1996, cost 1.67
billion yuan (about 200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project will supply Shenzhen with 350 million cu m of high
quality water from the upper stream of the river every year.
</P>
<P>
At today's test run of the system, the water flowed at 11 cu m
per second through the airtight pipe.
</P>
<P>
The system is operated through an advanced remote-control
program.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, a fast growing modern coastal city in south China,
has no river source of its own, and is expected to have a
shortfall of some one billion cu m of water by the year 2010 if
nothing has been done to preserve rainfall or channel water from
other sources, according to experts.

volume remains at a low level, progress has been made, said Jiang,
adding that the President Lucinschi's current visit will lend
impetus in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi said he hoped that bilateral trade and economic
relations would be deepened.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the government of Moldova will as always
adhere to the one China policy and support China in resolving the
Taiwan issue just as it did with Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation for the steadfast support of
Lucinschi and the government of Moldova toward China's
reunification cause and adherence to the one China policy as it
relates to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Jiang and Lucinschi signed a joint statement
on comprehensive cooperation in the 21st century, which will be
used to guide China-Moldova relations in the future.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Implement Law on Juvenile Delinquency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China will take a firmer hand in
the enforcement of the Law on Juvenile Delinquency, in a bid to
raise awareness of the law among young people and to protect their
rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a three-day symposium on
implementing the law, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by the National People's Congress (NPC)
Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs and the Central
Committee of the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC), was held
on the eve of the first anniversary of the law's approval, which
was June 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wan Chaofen, vice-chairwoman of the NPC Committee for Internal
and Judicial Affairs, called on departments concerned to intensify
legal education among China's juveniles, and combine the job of
curbing juvenile delinquency with the work of protecting their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang, first secretary of the CYLC Central Committee, said
in his speech that the CYLC, as the bridge between the Communist
Party of China and the Chinese younger generation, is responsible
for promoting the law.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from seven central government departments and
representatives from 16 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions aired their views during the past three days.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Approves Early Election in Preliminary Reading EDS-2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (Parliament)
Wednesday passed a motion proposed by opposition parties to hold
early elections in a preliminary reading, an event that may hamper
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to push forward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The motion, submitted by Knesset member Avigdor Lieberman from
National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu and Silvan Shalom from the major
opposition Likud party, was approved by a vote of 61-48, with
eleven Knesset members failing to show up on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The bill, calling for dissolving the Knesset and holding
elections within 90 days, only needs a simple majority in the 120-
seat Knesset in Wednesday's preliminary reading. It must be
reviewed by the Knesset Law Committee and go through three more
readings, during which at least 61 votes are required.
</P>
<P>
Several ruling partners of Barak's coalition government,
including the ultra-Orthodox Shas party who holds 17 seats in the
Knesset, voted along with the oppositions in Wednesday's
parliamentary showdown.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, officials in Barak's office spread news that
Barak and his confidants are trying to recruit Shinui Party,
Democratic List and Am Ehad into a new and narrow coalition,
according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The radio also reported that Barak planned to impose the
Transition Law on any ministers who voted in favor of early
elections, which means that they will be kicked out of the
government within a week after the vote.
</P>
<P>
Should Barak finally decide to do so, he will remain in power as
the leader of a minority coalition, relying on the Arab parties for
his future survival in office, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition crisis deteriorated after the breakdown of talks
between Shas, the Finance Ministry and the Education Ministry over
the fund allocation to Shas' educational system.
</P>
<P>
Shas had threatened to support the early election bill if it
could not get millions of additional dollars for its corrupt and
nearly bankrupt religious school network.
</P>
<P>
Barak ordered to stop the talks on Monday, saying he will not
act under threats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yisrael Ba'aliya, another junior party in the
coalition with four Knesset seats, also supported the early
election bill in Wednesday's voting.
</P>
<P>
The party attributed its defection to its opposition to the "
large concessions" Barak reportedly made to the Palestinians during
the Israeli-Palestinian back-channel talks in Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
National Religious Party, who had announced it will leave the
government if Barak transfers three Arab villages near Jerusalem to
the Palestinians, also voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
Party leader Yitzhak Levy said his party wants to warn Barak
against his "apparent intentions" to concede a large part of the
West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, Health Minister and Shas party leader Shlomo Benizri
suggested that his party may change its mind in the subsequent
reading of the bill if Barak agrees to resume talks with Shas.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to topple the government," Benizri said. "No one
wants to go to early elections, and the ball is now back in the
prime minister's court. ... If he wants to sit down seriously and
solve the crisis, then he is welcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the bill calling for early elections does not pass the third
and final reading, any similar motion will be forbidden in the
Knesset for six months.
</P>
<P>
The domestic government crisis may tie Barak's hands on the
negotiation table with the Palestinians as the peace talks have
just entered the "moment of truth."
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright managed just
on Tuesday to move Israeli and Palestinian negotiators back to
Washington to resume talks during her ongoing Middle East tour,
which began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams are aiming to resolve the thorny final-
status issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements,
the return of Palestinian refugees, border, water and security, and
reach a permanent accord by September 13, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Albright Expects No Breakthrough for Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday she does not expect any breakthroughs will
be made on the Syrian track of peace process during her meeting
here with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.
</P>
<P>
"I do not expect any breakthroughs," she told a press conference
after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed the door is open on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria and Israel broke down last January due
to disputes over the return of the Golan Heights that the Jewish
state seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here earlier in the day after two days of
visits to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, during which
she secured the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks in the
U.S. next week and a meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House on June
14.
</P>
<P>
Shareh is in Cairo for Arab foreign ministers meetings earlier
in the week. He told reporters on Tuesday that Syria must not fall
into the trap of "making unjustified concessions."
</P>
<P>
"To give Israel something that is ours or our right would not be
reassurance but a free and unwarranted concession. We must not fall
into such pitfalls," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, meanwhile, called on Syria to withdraw from Lebanon
after Israel pulled out of south Lebanon late last month, ending 22
years of occupation of a border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She praised Syria for having played a constructive and
cooperative role over Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
But she added it is "very important that all parties do in fact
follow through on their obligations. The Israelis have done so and
I think that the Syrians should do so also."
</P>
<P>
Syria stations more than 30,000 troops in Lebanon since 1976,
when it intervened to try to stop the Lebanese civil war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria maintain that the situation is different
concerning the Syrian troops and Israel's: the Syrian troops are "
peacekeepers" while Israel's were occupation forces.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Refutes Stories About Iranian Defector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Huseyin Onal, governor of the Turkish
central province of Yozgat, said most of the news about the alleged
Iranian agent Sayyid Behbahani, who recently defected to Turkey,
were mere fabrications.
</P>
<P>
Onal made the remarks after Iran's intelligence chief dismissed
allegations by the so-called defector that Iran was behind the 1988
Lockerbie bombing, Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States' Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) aired a
story recently, saying it had interviewed Behbahani who took refuge
in Yozgat refugee camp with a fake identification card.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, CBS said, the Iranian claimed himself to
be in charge of Iran's foreign terrorist activities and to have
plotted the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Onal said he has ordered an investigation into the refugee camp
and that it was impossible for anyone to enter the camp with a
false ID and talk to journalists.
</P>
<P>
However, while the U.S. Embassy in Ankara declined to comment on
the issue, Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MIT)
confirmed in an official statement that they had interrogated an
Iranian by that name, who illegally entered Turkey on March 7.
</P>
<P>
"Behbahani indicated that he had worked for a while in the
Iranian Intelligence Ministry, had been imprisoned in Evin Prison
after being indicted in 1998 for spying for a foreign country, and
had come to Turkey after fleeing from prison. He made contact with
a foreign news channel before coming to Turkey," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Behbahani, born in 1968 in Tehran and a high school graduate,
has asked for political asylum, the statement said, adding that he
has applied to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to
go to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The statement said he claimed that some terror activities in the
past were organized by Iran but has not given any indications that
Iran was involved in a series of political murders in Turkey in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The MIT said "all aspects of the subject are being investigated
by our organization. Until the allegations are verified, we are
adopting a cautious policy in order not to create speculation and
provocations both in Turkey and abroad."
</P>
<P>
Iran dismissed the Behbahani affair as a plot by the U.S. and
Israel, two of Tehran's arch foes.

<HEADLINE> China Tries to Plant Good Corporate Governance Into SOEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Bank of China (BOC) President Liu
Mingkang told the ongoing 2nd Asia Development Forum here that the
Chinese government has made unremitting efforts to plant good
corporate governance into Chinese enterprises in its state-owned
enterprises (SOE) restructuring drive aimed at enhancing their
competitiveness, business management and government-business
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who doubles BOC Board Chairman, said that the
restructuring of the state-owned enterprises has evolved three
phases since China's opening-up and economic reform started in
1978 and its initial reform from 1978 to 1993 focused on removing
the impact of the traditional planned economy on enterprises and
increasing the role of the market and granting enterprises more
autonomy in doing business.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase from 1993 to 1998 the Chinese
government focused its efforts on introducing modern mechanism
into the SOEs which assume core dimensions of clarification of
ownership and rights as well as obligations attached, separation
of government administration from business management and the
introduction of sound corporate management, he said.
</P>
<P>
From September 1999 on, the Chinese government has quickened
the reform and opening-up process to meet the challenges for
corporate governance that is the core of modern mechanism in
running enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that facing challenges from the New Economy and
globalization as well as China's upcoming accession into WTO,
there is an urgent need to plant into Chinese enterprises the good
corporate governance that ensures the checks and balances regime
between shareholders and management.
</P>
<P>
Defining the parameters of good corporate governance, the BOC
president highlighted six key elements that include a set of
clearly defined strategies with a broad vision, a transparent and
sound decision-making process, information disclosure arrangement
based on prudent accounting norm and practices, the establishment
of well-defined accountability, responsibility with strict &AMP;
explicit targets as well as relevant effective motivation schemes
and checking mechanism, a system ensuring independent, full and
good play by all board members and fairly protecting interests of
all shareholders, and education and cultivation of the staff at
all levels.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Lead: S.Lankan Minister Among 22 Killed in Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said the bombing happened at 1:45 p.m. (0745 GMT) at
Ratmalana in southern suburb of Colombo when the minister was
leading a procession in his electorate to commemorate the War
Heroes Day which fell on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One eyewitness said he saw a man approach the minister as he
walked in the parade in front of a big crowd. The bomber then
embraced the minister before setting off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 people including the minister's wife were injured,
15 of them seriously, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
The state Lakhanda radio said the procession was part of a fund
raising campaign to improve the welfare of thousands of government
soldiers and their families.
</P>
<P>
Gunaratne is the first VIP to be assassinated by the rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) since the People Alliance
government led by President Chandrika Kumaratunga was elected to
office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The government statement said Gunaratne attended the main
ceremony held Wednesday morning at the President's Secretariat to
mark the War Heroes Day.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the ceremony he drove away to his constituency in
the Colombo suburban Dehiwala to take part in the march to mark
the War Heroes Day as a mark of respect to the security forces who
fight the LTTE rebels in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Government forces have been fighting to stop LTTE rebels taking
the key northern town of Jaffna after the rebels launched an
offensive in April.
</P>
<P>
Gunaratne was the key minister who had been advocating the need
to put the country on a war footing since 1996 and the government,
with the escalation of the war, put the country on a war footing
on May 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan government had declared the June 7 as the War Heroes
Day and a countrywide two minutes silence was observed Wednesday
morning followed by the address to nation by the president.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga made an address thanking the families of soldiers
who had died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"Let us bow our heads in homage to those who are making the
supreme sacrifice, so that you and I may live in comfort and peace,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
She also said she believed there could be no military solution
to the long-running conflict with the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to reiterate that our cherished dream of peace can be
achieved only through a political solution of giving space for
every citizen of this country to live in dignity and harmony," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Sends Medical Team to Quake-Hit Bengkulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating Minister
for the People's Welfare and Eradication of Poverty Basri
Hasanuddin Wednesday said the government has sent a medical team
and medical supplies to the quake-hit Bengkulu province.
</P>
<P>
He said the governors of 24 provinces have also added 240
million rupiah (30,000 U.S. dollars) to the humanitarian aid for
Bengkulu, 536 kilometers northwest of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Financial losses in Bengkulu were estimated at 100 billion
rupiah (12.5 million dollars), according to the provincial office
of the coordinating unit for natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Hasanuddin said some countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore,
the Netherlands, Switzerland, China, Thailand, the United States
and Australia have expressed their readiness to send assistance to
the province.
</P>
<P>
The assistance was made in response to the Indonesian
government's request for international aid, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency reported that heavy rain on Wednesday
hampered quake rescue efforts in the province where a strong
earthquake has killed 120 people and injured nearly 2,300 others.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain forced some residents to put aside those fears of
aftershocks and move into their damaged houses. Others stayed in
makeshift tents.
</P>
<P>
The rains and poor communications have postponed efforts to
reach Enggano island which lies close to the earthquake's
epicenter. Initial reports indicated no deaths had occurred on
Enggano, where most housing is simple huts.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of Sunday's earthquake, measuring 7.9 on the
Richter Scale, was located 112 kilometers from Bengkulu.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's far-flung islands are regularly hit by earthquakes.
At least 45 people died last month when an earthquake measuring 6.
5 on the Richter Scale hit Central Sulawesi and some neighboring
islands.
</P>
<P>
The worst quake to hit Indonesia in the past decade was in 1992,
when 2,200 people died in a string of eastern islands.

<HEADLINE> EU Acts to Reduce Commercial Flight Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Air travelers may still have to
suffer from delays at European airports during this summer's
vacationing frenzy but they could expect more punctual take-offs
and transits next year as the European Union is redressing the
annoyance.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, heard on Wednesday a special report on measures that can be
resorted to reduce commercial flight delays across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Loyola de Palacio, European transport commissioner, told the
commission of the first encouraging sign -- a confirmation of
support from all countries in the program aimed at reducing flight
delays and growing consensus of the need for integrated management
of European airspace.
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by a special group of senior civil and
military representatives from different European countries who met
regularly since January this year to work out a proposal for
reform of air traffic management.
</P>
<P>
De Palacio, who chairs the high-level group, told the
commission that results should be achieved over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, air travelers in Europe suffered from
delays of their flights and delays varied from scores of minutes
to hours. As many as one third of the scheduled flights had been
delayed for one reason or another during this period.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Club Declines Gascoigne Offer for Being "Too Expensive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Finnish club FC Jokerit said on
Wednesday they had turned down a two-month loan offer from
Middlesbrough for former England mifielder Paul Gascoigne as it
was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
"Someone from the club called me and asked if we were
interested in Gascoigne," Jokerit Managing Director Mecki Kahre
was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The England club had asked for a price of 28,000 pounds (42,690
U.S. dollars) a week, but Kahre thought "that was too much, even
for a month."
</P>
<P>
Since breaking his arm in February in a match against Aston
Villa, Gascoigne did not play for the rest of the season. And
there have been reports that he would be loaned during the close
season to a number of clubs in Australia and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
Jokerit officials said they are still looking for high-profile
talent, but at a far cheaper price.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets S. African Defense Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here today that China and South Africa, both influential
developing countries, are facing the task of safeguarding peace
and stability, developing their respective economies and improving
people's standards of living.
</P>
<P>
They also share common ground and interests in international
and regional affairs, Hu said at a meeting with South African
Defense Minister Patrick Lekota.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said
that China is willing to work with South Africa to further promote
relations between the two countries and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people had once supported the South African people'
s just fight against apartheid and national liberation, he noted,
and the people of the two countries thus have a traditional and
deep friendship.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have developed rapidly since the
establishment of Sino-South African diplomatic relations in 1998,
and bilateral cooperation in various fields has expanded steadily.
</P>
<P>
He said during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to
South Africa, the two countries signed the Declaration on Sino-
South African Partnership, announcing the establishment of the Bi-
National Commission between the two countries, which raised
bilateral relations to a new high.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Spokesman on ROK's Limitation on Garlic Imports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman with the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Hu Chusheng
today commented on the decision of the Republic of Korea (ROK) to
adopt limitation measures on garlic imports.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the Finance and Economy Ministry of ROK issued its
No. 141 order on May 31, which declares that starting from June 1,
ROK adopts limitation measures on garlic imports and a tariff rate
as high as 315 percent will be levied on imported garlic.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that the ROK's assertion that "the increase of
garlic imports has caused a reduction in garlic prices and damaged
the garlic industry in the ROK" is not justified.
</P>
<P>
He said that the domestic output of garlic in the ROK increased
by 90,000 tons in 1999, while its import only increased by 1,200
tons, according to the ROK's customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
Any damage to the ROK's garlic industry is caused entirely by
the sharp increase of its garlic production at home, instead of
the minor increase of its garlic imports.
</P>
<P>
China is the major garlic exporter to the ROK, and the ROK's
limitation on garlic import is actually targeted at China, Hu
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> China Satisfied with Relations with Myanmar: Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
voiced satisfaction over relations between China and Myanmar,
stressing the two countries should join hands to safeguard their
own interest as well peace, stability and prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
China and Myanmar, as close neighbors and developing countries,
are faced with the common task of safeguarding peace, developing
economy, and upgrading people's living standards, Jiang said
during a meeting with Maung Aye, vice-chairman of the State Peace
and Development Council of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The president said Maung Aye's current visit, which coincides
with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties,
demonstrates the importance the Myanmese government places on
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past half a century, bilateral relations have withstood
tests. Through the efforts of both sides considerable progress has
been made, the president said. He expressed the belief Maung Aye's
current visit will contribute to the further advancement of
relations, citing the successful talks between Maung Aye and Vice-
President Hu Jintao and a joint statement issued yesterday.

On the present world situation, Jiang said national affairs of
each country should be decided upon by their own people in
accordance with their own specific situation. China opposes the
action of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries
in the name of "democracy" and "human rights".
</P>
<P>
On the issue of economic globalization, Jiang said such a trend
is inevitable, and all the developing countries should participate
in such a trend, reinforce unity, and jointly protect their legal
interests.
</P>
<P>
Maung Aye conveyed to Jiang the kind regards from Than Shwe,
chairman of the State Peace and Development Council of Myanmar. He
said this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic ties and both the Myanmese government and people are
happy about the smooth development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During the current visit, foreign ministers of the two
countries signed a joint statement providing a framework for the
future development of bilateral relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Maung Aye expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for its
long-term economic support, and stressed that Myanmar highly
treasures its friendship with China, and is willing to further
accelerate such relations.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Spokesman on ROK's Limitation on Garlic Imports (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the MOFTEC has publicized the
statement as follows:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the ROK's limitation measures on Chines garlic do not
reflect the reality of China's garlic exports to the ROK and
violate relevant conditions of adopting limitation measures
prescribed in the Agreement on Safeguards of the WTO. The ROK
action is obviously a discriminatory trade protection measure
which the Chinese government can not accept.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, according to the Article 7 of the Foreign Trade Law
of the People's Republic of China, in light of the ROK decision
against China's garlic export and the damage to China's trade
interests, the Chinese government has decided to temporarily
suspend from June 7 this year the import of mobile telephones (
including vehicular mobile sets) and polyethylene from the ROK and
preserves the rights to take further action.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Chinese government hopes that the ROK, taking Sino-
ROK trade and economic relations into consideration, will
seriously consider China's position and reverse its discriminatory
actions, and seek a solution acceptable to both sides through
bilateral consultations.

<P>
The ROK unilaterally adopted limitation measures without
consulting China and this action does not accord with the
regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO), said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the ROK report to the WTO on the damage of its
garlic industry interprets the matter out of context, and this is
extremely inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
China has 9.5 billion U.S. dollars of trade deficit to the ROK,
Hu said, stressing that the ROK does not keep its promise of
expanding import from China and reducing trade barriers, but
instead limits its import of Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
The ROK's action will only result in a deterioration of the
existing trade imbalance between the two countries, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China has always maintained that
problems in trade and economic relations should be solved in the
spirit of friendly consultation.
</P>
<P>
On the ROK's limitation on garlic imports, China has proposed
to discuss the issue and find a solution acceptable to both sides.
But the talks broke off because of ROK's insistence on its own
position, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The ROK's unilateral action of limiting garlic imports has
seriously hampered bilateral trade and economic ties between the
two countries, Hu pointed out, adding that the ROK should fully
bear all responsibilities.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The entry of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force is just a matter of time,
Executive Secretary Wolfgang Hoffmann of the Preparatory
Commission of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
Organization (CTBTO) said today.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the question is not whether but when we
will have entry into force," said Hoffmann at the Regional
Workshop for the CTBTO International Cooperation and National
Implementation/Ratification Procedures.
</P>

He said he was encouraged by the willingness of states in the
region to work together to resolve difficulties associated with
the development of national legislation to implement the CTBT.
"This is an essential step toward achieving the goal of
universality and entry into force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the workshop as a "useful forum" to exchange views on
possible benefits of CTBT participation and in promoting dialog in
developing a framework for future cooperation, he said that the
discussions in the workshop have shown the potential for
cooperation in the area of the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann said the preparatory commission is doing its best to
promote an early entry into force. He also praised the host's
efforts to arrange the three-day gathering.
</P>

AMMAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in the Amman Stock
Exchange (ASE) declined sharply in the first five months of 2000 as
compared with the same period last year, bourse sources said here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Net foreign investments in the ASE in the period were 5.3
million dinars (7.4 million dollars) as against 12.4 million dinars
(17.4 million dollars) in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The index of the market has been loosing ground for the past 18
months, plunging from 180 points to around 145 points in recent
trading sessions, although the kingdom is emerging from a decade-
old economic recession and is expecting a three-percent economic
growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Foreign shares in the shareholding companies listed on the ASE
accounted for 43.3 percent of the market value of these firms, with
non-Jordanian Arab investors taking the lion's share of some 36.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of foreign ownership in the firms listed on the ASE is

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Rejects Israeli Accusations of Foot-Dragging in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat on Wednesday refuted Israel's accusation that the
Palestinian side is foot-dragging in the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has done everything possible to push the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks forward and the Israeli side can
not blame the Palestinians for the slow progress made in the final-
status talks, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side is doing everything possible to reach a
peace agreement with Israel," Erekat told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, some Israeli officials, including Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, blamed the Palestinian side for foot-dragging
in the talks, saying Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is not ready
to make decisions on key issues that are being discussed in the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Such issues include the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements,
Palestinian refugees, border and water.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have set September 13 as the deadline for reaching
a final peace agreement, and the Palestinian side is totally
committed to that, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of holding another three-way summit in the United
States between Arafat, Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Erekat said the time is not ripe for that summit, at least in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has told the Palestinians that preparations should be
done for such a summit and it is premature to say such a summit
will be held soon in the United States, he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's House Rejects Results of Papua Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives(DPR) said here Wednesday that it rejected the
results of the "Papua National Congress".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after presiding over a
leadership meeting here, House Speaker Akbar Tandjung said, "the
DPR strongly refuses the results of the Papua National Congress
which have declared the province's independence."
</P>
<P>
It is the first official statement issued by the House
following the last week congress which was held in Jayapure,
capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we urge the government to take stern measures
through persuasive approaches to maintain the unitary state of
Indonesia," Tandjung added.
</P>
<P>
He asked the National Police (Polri) and the Indonesian
Military(TNI) "to show the seriousness in dealing with the Papua
issue and urge them to take anticipatory measures to prevent the
separatist movements in the province from spreading."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possible interventions from external forces,
he said that, "we can not say that there were foreign government
involvements (in this case) because we don't have any evidences on
such a thing. But if we talk about non-govermental organization (
NGO), it is clear that some international and local NGO's were
involved in separatist movements in Irian Jaya (Papua)," Tandjung
said.
</P>
<P>
The one-week long "Papua National Congress" which was attended
by about 3000 representatives from 14 districts in the province,
declared on Sunday that the province would be no longer a part of
the unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid had warned
security forces in Papua not to resort to violence in an effort to
quash separatism in the province.
</P>
<P>
But Tandjung stressed that, "firstly the security forces should
take persuasive measures. But they need not to hesitate to crack
down separatist movements there, in case."
</P>
<P>
Papua is the largest island in Indonesia. It integrated into
Indonesia in 1969.

<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
arrives in Sierra Leone on Wednesday to review Britain's military
support for the government of the war-torn west African country.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit follows Britain's announcement that its Royal
Marine Commando unit will pull out next week, leaving behind a
strengthened United Nations peacekeeping force and a 180-strong
British training team, reported the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, Cook is expected to discuss how Britain
can continue to help its former colony during talks with President
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
He will also seek guarantees that British-supplied weapons will
not go to child soldiers used by the Sierra Leone army.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Cook announced that Britain would seek a United
Nations resolution to ban trading in diamonds from rebel-held
areas of the war-torn African country.
</P>
<P>
He said diamonds had fuelled Sierra Leone's rebellion for the
past nine years while the country's people were among the world's
poorest, rebels could buy vast quantities of arms through the
trade of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 11,000 international troops will be under
UN command from next week, with a further 5,000 expected to arrive
in Sierra Leone over coming months.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Defends Petrol Price Hike Amid Nation Wide Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Tuesday defended the government's decision to raise the petrol
price by 50 percent, saying the money freed from subsidization is
badly needed for alleviating the country's poor.
</P>
<P>
He told Adams Oshiomhole, leader of the country's umbrella
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) on Tuesday that the annual subsidy
for a low petrol price may amount to about 202 billion naira (2.
02 billion U. S. dollars) this year, reported Nigerian newspapers
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president said in African largest oil-exporting country's
capital Abuja that average Nigerians did not really benefit from
the subsidy, which if reduced he would guarantee a 25 percent
wage increase next year, and quicker steps in poverty alleviation
at all levels.
</P>
<P>
He promised that he would consider alleviating measures for the
hike and will not hesitate in continuing to dialogues with trade
unions, students and other interest groups on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Oshiomhole, who led a 23- man NLC delegation to the meeting, on
the other hand, expressed his "disappointment" with the
president.
</P>
<P>
He argued that Nigeria's economy is "generator- driven" due to
the inefficiency of the country's power plants. As a result, the
petrol price increase may lead to a situation where goods
produced in Nigeria would be costly while imported goods will be
cheaper, thus leading to retrenchment of workers.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was held when the country is shocked by
protests against the petrol hike in almost all major cities,
including the capital Abuja and economic hub Lagos.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, protesting workers Tuesday blocked the main
access road to the presidential villa and barred government
workers from entering their offices.
</P>
<P>
Most of the gas stations in Lagos remain shut on Wednesday and
car petrol peddlers seem to be having their good time on the
streets of the largest city in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The nation wide "seat at home" strike, called up by the NLC
will take place from Thursday, if no breakthrough can be fostered
between the government and labor negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government last Thursday increased the country's
petrol price by 50 percent to 30 naira from 20 naira (100 naira
equals about one U. S. dollar) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision had met with mixed reactions in the country.
People in the business sector generally welcomed the move despite
the costs added to their operation, saying it is inevitable to
reduce the huge amount of money spent on subsidizing for a low
petrol price.

<HEADLINE> Kenya President Appeals for Aid to Combat Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moi told a press conference held at State House here that in
fact 80 percent of Kenyan population is current at risk,
appealing for local and International assistance to combat the
country's current drought distress.
</P>
<P>
He said due to circumstances which are beyond the government's
control, Kenya is in the grip of very worrying natural
calamities, which include extreme drought conditions, a spreading
and deepening famine and a devastating AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight year, Kenya has witnessed vicissitudes of a
dry spell in 1992, heavy rains and floods in 1997 and 1998,
followed again by the current dry spell in most parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
So far the country has 30 districts affected by the current dry
spell and 18 of which have been severely hit, resulting in both
food and water insecurity for man and animal.
</P>
<P>
About two weeks ago, President Moi appealed for international
community to help the country's 23 million people likely to face
famine due to the long- spell drought following the dismal failure
of short rains last year and long rains this year.
</P>
<P>
"The government acknowledges that earlier appeals have resulted
in a high level of positive response. Given the intensity of the
calamity we wish to further appeal for more help," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Kenyan government has been working in close
 consultation with the United Nations agencies.
</P>
<P>
He added, "the priority life saving requirements which my
government is appealing for, from the local and international
communities, have not been brought about by any conflict, civil
unrest or human displacements."
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is not at war with herself or with any other country.
The appeal for support is wholly due to natural calamities which
have befallen our beloved country," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The president estimated, "the cost of required commodities and
services will be in the region of 11.5 billion shillings (around
150 million U.S. dollars), of which food will take 85 percent,
while water and sanitation, health and nutrition, livestock,
agriculture and education will take the rest."

<HEADLINE> Nobel Laureate on Five Trends Influencing World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Lawrence Klein, who was awarded a
Nobel Economics Prize in 1980, said here today that five trends
are currently having a huge impact on the development of the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Klein, who came here to attend an international seminar on
development of western China, made the remark today while
delivering a lecture at Chongqing University, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The five trends include the advancement of technology and
telecommunications, the rapid development of products for civilian
use during the cold war, the high growth of economy with low
inflation, and the globalization of the economy. All of these
have made today's economy rather different from the past, said
Klein.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the change from industrial production
to service industry can not be called a "revolution," but only an
evolution.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that China's economy will have a new
development trend after joining the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Klein has become an honorary professor of the University.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Provide Report on Development of Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have recently
presented a report to the State Council on the sustainable
development of the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
In the report, experts put forward some key measures including
building water cellars, reverting slope farmland to forests or
grasslands and adopting advanced technologies for agriculture and
animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Covering seven provinces or autonomous regions with an area of
360,000 square kilometers, the Loess Plateau has little rainfall,
and environment deterioration such as soil erosion has hindered
the overall development of the plateau.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that building water cellars to collect rainwater
is an effective way to ensure farmland harvests so long as some
water-saving irrigation technologies are adopted.
</P>
<P>
Since slope farmland merely accounts for 4.5 percent of total
arable land, reverting slope farmland to forests or grasslands
wouldn't seriously affect the grain production, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested that livestock in the area should be fed in
stalls rather than grazing on the grassland. This will also help
improve water and soil conservation and stimulate the development
of the local feed processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Some experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering presented the report after in-depth
research on the Loess Plateau in the second half of last year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Backs Early Election in Preliminary Reading EDS-1st lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament)
Wednesday passed in a preliminary reading a motion proposed by
opposition parties to hold early elections, an event that may
hamper Prime Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to push forward the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The motion, submitted by Knesset members Avigdor Lieberman from
National Union, Yisrael Beiteinu and Silvan Shalom from the major
opposition Likud party, was approved with a vote of 58-47, with 15
Knesset members failing to show up on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The bill only needs a simple majority in the 120-seat Knesset in
Wednesday's preliminary reading voting.
</P>
<P>
Several ruling partners in Barak's government, including the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party who holds 17 seats in the Knesset, voted
along with the oppositions to dissolve the current 15th Knesset, a
move that is likely prompt Barak to reshuffle his coalition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, officials in Barak's office spread news that
Barak and his confidants are trying to recruit Shinui, Democratic
List and Am Ehad parties into a new and narrow coalition, according
to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The Radio also said the prime minister planned to impose the
Transition Law on any ministers who voted in favor of early
elections, which means that they will be kicked out of the
government within a week after the vote.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly (parliament)
Speaker Saadoun Hamadi left here for Rome on Wednesday for a visit
to Italy in a bid to improve relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hamadi is expected to discuss with Italian
officials on ways to improve bilateral relations, said the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi will also discuss the issue of the decade-old U.N.
embargo on Iraq with Italian officials and legislators, in addition
to the almost-daily aggressions by the U.S. and British warplanes
over northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent United Nations embargo since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The end of the embargo is still not in
sight due to the vehement opposition of the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes have been patrolling the two no-fly
zones in northern and southern Iraq and regularly bombing targets
inside the zones since December 1998, when the two countries
launched four consecutive nights of massive air strikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Italy is sympathetic with the Iraqi people, who have been the
hardest hit by the crippling U.N. embargo. On April 3, a European
plane carrying four people, among them three from Italy, landed at
Baghdad's Al-Rashed military airport to protest the U.N. embargo.

<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
on Wednesday with visiting United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to discuss the latest developments in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Cairo earlier in the day during a regional
trip which has taken her to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
She was expected to brief Mubarak on the outcome of her meetings
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in Israel on Monday in an attempt to help
Israel and the Palestinians meet a mid-September deadline for a
final peace deal. She announced after talks with Arafat in the West
Bank town of Ramallah on Tuesday that the Palestinians and Israel
will resume talks near Washington next week and that Arafat will
meet U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House on June 14.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have set September 13 as the target
date for agreement on what they call final-status issues such as
the borders of a Palestinian state and the fate of Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Before wrapping up the Mideast tour, Albright will also meet
with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, who is in the Egyptian
capital to attend Arab meetings, to discuss the possibility of
reviving the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which broke off last
January.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats in Cairo are sceptical about the chance of
resuming the Syrian-Israeli talks, which were stalled due to
disputes between the two countries over Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights and the control of water.

CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman's LNG Co. is scheduled to export nearly 60
cargoes of clean fuel to South Korea's Korea Gas Corp (Kogas) next
year.
</P>
<P>
The volume of each export cargo will range between 63,000 and
68,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Central Bank of Oman has introduced a new
regulation aimed at limiting the amount of credit senior bankers
can extend to companies they control.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move is aimed to prevent top bankers from
extending unjustifiable loans to finance their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the central bank reinstated a 13-percent interest
rate ceiling on personal loans after saying bankers "were taking
advantage of small borrowers" by charging them interest of up to 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- U.S. computer giant Sun Microsystems, the Peres
Center for Peace, the Palestinian National Authority, and five
Israeli and Palestinian universities on Tuesday signed an
unprecedented agreement to establish and upgrade computer
facilities for Palestinian and Israeli universities and promote
cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to promote dialogues between the Israeli and
Palestinian universities. The Israeli universities will help
academics at the Palestinian university to design curricula, set up
a computer security system and gain access to new technologies.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- About 24 percent of female entrepreneurs in start-
up companies in Israel are aged 55 or above, according to a survey
published by the Israel Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
Ronit Silon, chairwoman of the Female CEO Forum at the
association, said that the findings showed that 60 percent of
female entrepreneurs have doctorate degrees while only 8 percent do
not hold an academic degree.
</P>
<P>
Female entrepreneurs are mainly located in software development
companies and biotechnology, while there is a relatively low female
presence in managerial positions in companies in the fields of
telecommunications, information technology and wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- El Al Israel Airlines loses 55 million dollars a
year because it does not fly on Shabbat and holidays, according to
a study by Israeli account Yitzhak Swary, which was submitted to
the Ne'eman Committee preparing for the airline's privatization.
</P>

The committee will be meeting on Wednesday to discuss the

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Exchange Reserve Stands at 26.77 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign exchange
reserve at the end of May stood at 26.77 billion U.S. dollars, or
40 million dollars more than that of the previous week, a press
release issued by the central bank, Bank Indonesia, said.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to receipts from the export of oil and
other commodities, the press release was quoted by the Antara News
Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The release said the figure 26.77 billion dollars was computed
on current rate according to the concept of the International
Reserve and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which makes part of the
financial data publication based on the Special Data Dissemination
Standard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's net foreign exchange reserve was
registered at 16.01 billion dollars. It was computed according to
the foreign exchange reserves on constant rate, minus the gross
foreign obligation, plus the net forward position, and then minus
the minimum obligatory giro of foreign exchanges of commercial
banks at Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The figure, according to the central bank, is compatible with
the computation in the Letter of Intent agreed upon by the
Indonesian government and the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Police to Cooperate with ACA to Fight Against Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysia Police and
the Anti Corruption Agency (ACA) Wednesday agreed to set up a
joint graft prevention committee under a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) signed here.
</P>
<P>
The MOU was signed by Police Director of Management Mohamed
Bakri Omar and ACA Deputy Director General (operations) Ahmad Said
Hamdan and witnessed by Inspector General of Police Norian Mai and
ACA Director General Ahmad Zaki Husin.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zaki said on the occasion that the cooperation with the
police in the fight against graft will focus more on integrated
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether graft in the police force has reached
an alarming level for such cooperation to be instituted, he said
the problem was still under control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police chief said the setting up of the joint
committee is not a move to protect officers and members of the
police force, and will not affect ACA investigations against
members of the police force nor investigations by the police
against its own members.
</P>
<P>
Norian said all parties, including the public, must play their
part in the fight against graft so that the fight would be
successful.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on March 28, the ACA entered into cooperation with the
Road Transport Department in the fight against graft.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzania Unveils Tough Code for Upcoming Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian National Electoral
Commission (NEC) has issued a draft code of conduct for the
October general elections, barring government and ruling party
leaders from using their power for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The NEC Chairman Judge Lewis Makame told a meeting with leaders
of political parties here on Tuesday that the draft intended to
level the playing ground for the second multiparty elections
scheduled for October 29.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable issued by the NEC early this year, the
 registration of voters will be conducted between August 1 and 21
while nomination of candidates will be made on August 13, and
election campaigns between August 14 and October 28.
</P>
<P>
Makame said during the campaign period, the government and
ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) leaders are not allowed to use
state planes, vehicles, offices and government rest houses during
campaigning tours.
</P>
<P>
The draft said the government should ensure that state organs
provide security to all political parties during campaigning
rallies, demonstrations and elections.
</P>
<P>
The government is also required to ensure its state media
organs provide equal opportunity to all political parties and
assist the media in providing the public with correct and balanced
information.
</P>
<P>
The code also warned the political parties as well as religious
leaders against using churches and mosques for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The code prohibits the carrying of any kind of weapon in
political rallies, meetings, demonstrations and no party is
allowed to conduct meetings or demonstrations in areas close to
where another party is holding its meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CCM will convene a special congress at its
headquarters in central town of Dodoma later this week to chose
its presidential candidates for both the Union and Zanzibar
governments.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-day session of CCM Central Committee (CC) in
Dar es Salaam Tuesday, the CCM Secretary General Phillip Mangula
said that all four Zanzibar presidential candidates will be
forwarded to the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ruling
party which begins its two-day meeting in Dodoma tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The four candidates who have successfully sailed through the
crucial CC scrutiny are Zanzibar Chief Minister Mohammed Gharib
Bilal, Zanzibar Minister for Communications and Transport Amani
Abeid Karume, Zanzibar Minister for Finance Amina Salum Ali and
the Union Deputy Minister for Finance Abdisalaam Issa Khatib.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session, the CC also discussed President
Benjamin Mkapa's eligibility and qualifications as the sole
candidate for the Union Presidency which he won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the opposition Civic United Front (CUF)
is meeting in western town of Mwanza Wednesday to endorse its
candidates for the Union and Zanzibar presidencies.
</P>
<P>
CUF is expected to endorse its chairman Ibrahim Lipumba as the
sole candidate to run for Union presidency and the party's
Secretary General Seif Shariff Hamad for the Zanzibar presidency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Hamad who gave CCM a headache in the last general
elections is still the strongest opposition presidential candidate
in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had a single political party, the CCM, from 1965 until
1992 when the multiparty system was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The October elections will be the second multiparty elections
since 1995, but the first time in the country's post-independence
history for presidential, parliamentary and civic elections to be
held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 fully registered political parties run for the
elections which are likely to be dominated by the ruling CCM, at
least on the mainland as President Mkapa is expected to win a
second five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Awareness of Family Planning Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More and more Ethiopians,
particularly young people, have become aware of the importance of
family planning, a signed article on the Ethiopian Herald
newspaper said Wednesday
</P>
<P>
Population issues have become a common topic at hospitals,
schools, work places, factories, market place, and even churches
and mosques in Ethiopia,which has a total population of about 60
million, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Application of family planning, which was only four percent in
1993, has now reached 10 percent, the article said, noting the
percentage is expected to grow to 44 percent by 2015.
</P>
<P>
Today's increased demand for family planning methods is not the
result only of availability of services, but also a growing
number of young women wishing to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia officially launched its National Population Policy in
1993, two years after Mengistu Haile-Mariam's rule was overthrown
by the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.
</P>
<P>
Due to wrong premises and ideology of pre-1991 period, the
article said,
</P>
<P>
population issues and the consequence of rapid growth were given
little attention. No commitments were made to consider population
issues.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of population policy in the country,
population offices have been established in all states with most
of them doing remarkable jobs.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, the non-governmental organizations
and mass media in the country have also played important part to
promote the implementation of family planning policy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the problems in practice of family planning, the
article said that financial constraints and the shortage of
trained personnel are major obstacles to efficiently run the
government-sponsored programs.

PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Tuesday evening that a reinforcement of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is less necessary since
tension is easing on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
"As for what concerns the reinforcement of the UNIFIL, the
situation now is not the same as a few days ago. It seems that
there is less need to increase the UNIFIL," Vedrine said during a
yearly reception of high school and college students at the
foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
France is hesitating to join an expanded U.N. peacekeeping
operation, because Lebanon has not sent government troops to its
border area with Israel to take over control of the area from
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese government said Wednesday that it will fully
cooperate with the United Nations in implementing U.N. resolution
425, if the United Nations verifies that Israel has pulled out
from Lebanon's southern border area in conformity to the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has suggested the increase of
the peacekeepers in Lebanon from 4,500 soldiers at present to 7,
900.
</P>
<P>
France now has 249 soldiers serving in the UNIFIL, which was
deployed in the Middle East state in 1978.

<P>
GENEVA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has taken a
series of measures in recent years to ensure that the basic rights
and benefits of laborers be guaranteed, a Chinese official said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going International Labor Conference, China'
s Labor Minister Zhang Zuoji told a plenum that China has now
established a three-layer social security program with Chinese
characteristics, which will ensure basic livelihood and
unemployment insurance for laid off workers and minimum living
standards for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Zhang said, China has implemented a re-
employment project to help laid off workers get new jobs.
</P>
<P>
China is also speeding up reforms of the social security
systems in pension, unemployment and medical services and has
established certain systems that suit the national conditions of
China, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Chinese government is willing to
strengthen its cooperation with the International Labor
Organization and all of its members, to share and use for
reference their experience in improving the construction of labor
markets and the establishment of social security systems, in order
to jointly promote the development of the world labor insurance.

<HEADLINE> ILO Child labor Convention Ratified by 27 Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Up to 27 governments have ratified
an ILO convention on the abolition of the worst forms of child
labor since it was adopted in June 1999, according to the
International Labor Organization (ILO) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the child labor convention has achieved the fastest
ratification pace in the ILO history, ILO Director-General Juan
Somavia applauded the willingness of so many ILO member states to
expedite ratification. He reiterated his intention to make the
abolition of the worst forms of child labor "a global cause".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to delegates from the ratifying countries at the
International Labor Conference, Somavia said that "this rapid pace
of ratification is evidence of the growing support for global
action against child labor, particularly its worst forms and gives
us hope that the elimination of this scourge will become a reality
for millions of children who face exploitation today."
</P>
<P>
The convention requires countries to ban the worst forms of
child labor including those which have a debilitating effect on
the health, moral or psychological well-being of children and
which are likely to severely impede a child's normal growth into
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
Those activities include work in dangerous industrial
activities such as mining, or illegal activities such as
prostitution and drug trafficking, work under extreme conditions
of heat or cold, or work that involves exposure to chemicals or
other hazardous substances.
</P>
<P>
The ILO expects the child labor convention, which will come
into force on November 19, 2000, to get ratification from as many
as 12 new countries before the end of the current session of the
International Labor Conference on June 15.

</P>
<P>
Buildings in the rural areas of Cerkes and Orta towns, the

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Set to Form New, Narrow Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (XInhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is trying to set up a narrow coalition as a pre-emptive measure in
the face of a vote on three bills designed to dissolve the 15th
Knesset (parliament), Barak's office announced Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Barak had to take measures as three of his six-party coalition
have voiced support for the bills which are to be voted in the
Knesset as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The defective coalition parties include the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party which holds 17 seats in the parliament, the five-seat holder
National Religious Party and the Yisrael Ba'aliya headed by
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Shinui, a religious reform party which has six seats in the
Knesset, and Am Ehad, or One Nation party, are potential new
partners for the narrow-based coalition.
</P>
<P>
Though the two parties have indicated support for the bills,
they might change their stance if their respective demands are met.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset was originally scheduled only to vote on the early-
elections bill tabled by Knesset member Avigdor Lieberman on
Wednesday. Seeing that Lieberman appeared to have secured a
majority for the vote, the opposition Likud Knesset members Silvan
Shalom and Limor Livnat, who had proposed identical bills, decided
to put them to a vote on Wednesday too.
</P>
<P>
Barak broke off negotiations with Shas party Monday night after
Shas threatened to support the Lieberman bill. Shas has been
demanding millions of additional dollars for its bankrupt, poorly-
managed religious school system.
</P>
<P>
Barak said his government will not give in to threats, whether
external or internal.

JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament)
Wednesday passed in a preliminary reading a motion proposed by

The motion, submitted by Knesset member Avigdor Lieberman from

opposition Likud party, was approved with a vote of 58-47, with 15
Knesset members not attending the vote.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Water Quality Improves in Dongting Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The quality of water in the
Dongting Lake, in central China's Hunan Province, has been
improving, according to a local water inspection team.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team organized by the Hunan Provincial
Government, also inspected enterprises along the lake to ensure
that they are reducing pollutants according to state regulations.
</P>
<P>
Situated at the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the
Dongting Lake is China's second largest fresh-water lake. With an
water area of 2,700 sq km, Dongting Lake is also one of the most
important wetlands in Asia. Every year, more than 10 million
birds migrate to the Lake during winter.
</P>
<P>
The Central Chinese Government has initiated an environment
protection campaign by introducing a range of measures to clean up
pollution in Dongting Lake.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing businesses are required to treat industrial waste
water before discharging. Many enterprises around the Dongting
Lake, for instance, have spent more in purchasing advanced
environmental protection equipment.
</P>
<P>
The city of Yueyang has used Japanese loans to construct the
first urban sewage treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
The main part of the plant has been completed. The plant, with
a daily treatment capacity of 100,000 tons of sewage, will be
ready for trial operation later in the year.

<HEADLINE> Feature: 400 PLA Officers, Soldiers Give Blood in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hospital of Gun Club Hill
Barracks of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison
greeted some 400 officers and soldiers, who arrived here early
Wednesday morning to give blood.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Barracks Hospital and the Hong Kong Red Cross
Blood Transfusion Service, the blood donation is the third one
since the PLA troops were stationed in the Hong Kong SAR in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The officers and soldiers, from the ground, navy and air forces
of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, were all in high spirits and took
the blood test and transfusion with the help of the doctors from
the Blood Transfusion Service.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA troops organize the biggest number of donors and offer
the most amount of blood in Hong Kong each year," said Dr. Lin Che
Kit, hospital chief executive of the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood
Transfusion Service. "It is not easy to organize as many as 400
persons to give blood in such efficiency."
</P>
<P>
He said the PLA officers and soldiers are treated the same as
Hong Kong residents in giving blood, and each person whose weight
is over 50 kilograms gives 450 cc blood.
</P>
<P>
As blood supply in summer is usually less than other seasons,
the blood donated by the 400 PLA officers and soldiers will help
maintain a sound blood supply in Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Lin also spoke highly of the sound cooperation between his
blood bank and the PLA troops. On behalf of the Hong Kong Red
Cross Blood Transfusion Service, he sent an inscribed board to
express gratitude to the PLA troops for giving blood to Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Borong, deputy commander of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison,
came to see those who were giving blood. He told Xinhua that the
PLA officers and soldiers all regard it as their duty to delicate
their love to the community in Hong Kong and they are active to
participate in giving blood.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the number of officers and soldiers who enter their
name to give blood is much more than the required number of 400,
he said, adding that over 1,100 PLA officers and soldiers have
given blood in Hong Kong in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
After giving blood, Cao Han, a PLA solider from Shandong
Province, said he feels well after blood transfusion, and he has
no worry at all as he has learned it is good for the health to
give blood.
</P>
<P>
Cao, 21, said it is the second time that he has given blood,
and he will continue to take part in the activity to dedicate
himself to the community.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A bill calling for an early election of the Israeli Knesset
(parliament) is poised to win a parliamentary majority Wednesday,
assuming its supporters will follow through on their stated
intention to vote for it on preliminary reading.
</P>
<P>
Knesset member Aivgdor Lieberman, sponsor of the bill, said he
has secured a "solid majority" of 66 votes for his bill to dissolve
the 15th Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak met late Tuesday night with the ruling
party One Israel's leading figures to discuss the potential crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's One Israel party leaders Tuesday advised Barak to
launch a political pre-emptive strike and fire the maverick
coalition ministers before Wednesday's vote on dissolving the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
They suggested he form a new government based on 62 Knesset
members, including Shinui and One Nation, who earlier announced
support for the early-elections bill and are critical for the vote.
</P>
<P>
Barak vowed that the government will not bend to threats of any
kind, whether direct or indirect.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Chairman of Israel's Histadrut, or Jewish Labor Federation,
Amir Peretz agreed Tuesday to meet Finance Minister Avraham Shochat

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Police Detain 10,000 Illegal Foreign Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian police have detained some
10,000 illegal foreign workers since the start of this year in a
nationwide campaign to streamline the labor market, police said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the number of foreign workers questioned by police was
believed to be merely the tip of an iceberg given the size of the
illegal foreign labor force. Some 1 to 1.5 million foreigners are
working without permits in Jordan, most of them are Egyptians,
Iraqis and other Arab nationals.
</P>
<P>
Only 25,000 of the foreign labor force have obtained valid
working permits from the labor ministry, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The illegal workers were given a week to rectify their legal
status or face deportation, an official with the interior ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the illegal workers live in the capital city Amman,
Zarqa, Irbid and the Jordan Valley, the most populous areas of the
desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Successive governments in the kingdom, for fear of offending
Arab countries, have been reluctant to curb the inflow of illegal
foreign workers and implement the labor law which allows for
foreign labors in only four sectors, namely agriculture,
construction, domestic work and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The interior and labor ministries launched a nationwide campaign
from the second half of 1999 to check out illegal foreign workers
as part of the government's efforts to streamline the labor market
and to create more jobs for Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanians have shunned low-income jobs currently done
by illegal foreign workers, though the unemployment rate in the
kingdom stands at 14 to 15 percent by official statistics, if not
the 27 percent by independent estimates.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Halts Troop Withdrawal From Kisangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defence Forces
(UPDF) has halted its withdrawal from Kisangani, a northeast city
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), due to the
skirmishes with the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA).
</P>
<P>
"The UPDF has stoped its troop withdrawal from Kisangani,"
Ugandan Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan armies clashed after a UPDF's vehicle was
attacked and destroyed in Kisangani Monday morning. The UPDF had
repulsed RPA forces which by Tuesday night attacked 18 UPDF
positions in Kisangani, according to army sources.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was committed to the troop withdrawal plan, but would
not go ahead without an immediate cease-fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the withdrawal plan, Kisangani was zoned and the
demilitarization was to be phased, said a press statement signed
by James Wapakabulo, chairman of the committee on the region.
</P>
<P>
"The first phase involved the demilitarization of zone one
which is Bangoka Airport, La Forestiere and Lubutu junction areas
supposed to take five days, and then zone two, which was due to
have started on Monday, included the pull-out from the town, Simi
Simi Airport and Kapalata," said Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
He accused the RPA of withdrawing only 20 miles (about 32
kilometers) from the Kisangani center instead of 100 miles (160
kilometers).
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have their troops stationed in Kisangani
where they have supported rival rebel factions fighting against
the DRC President Laurent Kabila. The skirmishes on Monday and
Tuesday between the two armies are the latest following the
clashes early last May.

LUANDA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola Telecom will spend some three
million U.S. dollars to repair and expand telephone network in the
war-ravaged central province of Huambo, the official news agency

</P>
<P>
The projects include expanding the telephone network of the

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality started two projects involving 5.5 billion yuan (662.
2 million U.S. dollars) to improve its urban environment.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned that more than 50 percent of the total
investment has come from the World Bank and the Japanese
Government.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing urban environment project, funded by the World
Bank, is aimed at disposing waste water in Chongqing and in the
Three Gorges Reservoir area. The Sino-Japanese urban
environmental pilot program will focus on air pollution in the
city.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, only 27.8 percent of the city's major
polluting industrial enterprises discharged waste water according
to state requirements. Only 8.27 percent of the city's domestic
waste water was treated. The annual economic losses caused by air
pollution was 1 billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the two projects will help reduce discharged
sulfur dioxide by 195,000 tons annually and carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbon by 20,000 tons. The economic loss caused by air
pollution will be reduced by 300 million yuan (36.14 million U.S.
dollars) annually.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Rainfall is expected in most parts
of north China in the next three days, but not enough to alleviate
the month-long drought, according to the Central Meteorological
Station.
</P>
<P>
From June 7 to 9, 3 to 15 millimeters of rainfall is forecast
for the eastern pasts of northwest China, the central and northern
parts of north China and most parts of northeast China. Two to ten

Drought in south China will be greatly alleviated as torrential
rains and rainstorms hit most parts south of the Yangtze River
from June 5 to 7. Heavy rain will continue in the next three days.
However, drought in Shanxi, Henan and Hebei provinces, the
northern parts of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and the areas around
Beijing and Tianjin municipalities will continue.
</P>
<P>
Since early spring, most parts of north China and some parts of
south China have been suffering from a severe drought due to

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China will release 126 million fish,
104 million shrimps and 429 tons of seashells into the South China
Sea from June 8 to the end of the month, a senior Chinese fishery
official said here today.

This will be an important step to increase marine fishery
resources, said Zhang Hecheng, deputy director of the Fishery
Bureau under the Ministry of Agriculture.

<P>
China's marine fishery resources have been declining for a long

China has taken a series of measures including releasing
artificially-bred fish into the sea and imposing summer fishing
bans in the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea and South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China will continue to limit its marine fishing
output and release more artificially-bred fish, shrimps and

<HEADLINE> Three Bills Approved by Philippine Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives has approved on third reading bills on e-commerce,
investment and the election in the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM), a senior legislator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three bills -- the E-Commerce bill, the resetting of ARMM
election next year and the amendment to the Omnibus Investment
Code of 1997 -- "were finally passed by the House members after a
lengthy and thorough consideration," said House Majority
Floorleader Eduardo Gullas.
</P>
<P>
According to Gullas, the E-Commerce bill provides for a legal
framework to facilitate domestic and international exchange of
information, dealings, transactions, arrangements and contracts
through the utilization of network.
</P>
<P>
Gullas said the approved measure would also penalize any person
who shall hack, alter, forge, inflict damages, violate secrecy,
misuse, or other illegal use of electronic documents sent,
received, stored or complied.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to Omnbus Investment Code would make the
Philippines mere competitive with its neighbors to attracting
foreign investments, Gullas said, adding the amendments will give
the country's fighting chance to attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Gullas also said the resetting of the ARMM elections -- the
third time since 1998, the elections of the ARMM -- would be moved
from September this year to May 2001, coinciding with the next
simultaneous senatorial and local elections.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Four Kenyan police officers have

on the orders of Police Commander Philemon Abong'o, local

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Youth Complain of Selfish Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of young people have
complained to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi that a majority of
elected leaders were only pursuing selfish interests.
</P>
<P>
Moi stopped in the street of the capital Nairobi on his way to
office and listened carefully to them on Tuesday, Kenyan
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although politicians claimed to yearn for advice during the
current difficult economic times, most politicians avoid people
to concentrate merely on their personal matters, young people
asserted.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that it was wrong for a section of the opposition to
preach against resumption of aid to Kenya and it was this
heartless attitude that had stalled economic growth and creation
of more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The president emphasized the need for unity among all Kenyans
in tackling the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a motion was passed in parliament to equip
parliamentarians with guns after lawmakers from the ruling party
and opposition took a common stand.
</P>
<P>
The passage has drawn massive criticism from Kenyans since
insecurity poses a menace to all Kenyans, not just lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Gets Loan Pledges to Build New Power Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has received pledges of loan
from several international financiers and other partners for the
construction of new hydro-electric power stations in the country,
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Energy Minister Celestino Chibamba confirmed the
development but could not disclose details regarding the
financiers and the total pledges.
</P>
<P>
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
recently challenged Zambia to take advantage of an impending power
shortage in South Africa by investing in new power stations.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Chibamba as saying that Zambia would
exploit the situation by expanding its power generation base by
rehabilitating existing hydro-electric stations and building new
ones.
</P>
<P>
According to Chibamba, the country is currently undertaking a
power rehabilitation exercise that is expected to cost about 210
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 75 million dollars has already been released by the
International Development Agency of the World Bank to start
implementing the Power Reform Program (PRP).
</P>
<P>
The government administered program is financed by the
Development Bank of Southern Africa, the Finnish International
Development Agency, the European Investment Bank and some other
countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least six international groups has expressed
interest in developing Zambia's 80 megawatt Itezhi Tezhi
Hydropower project.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the project would boost the country's capacity
to export electricity to Tanzania, Zimbabwe, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Athens to Be Focused on Task for 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CANBERRA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Athens Mayor Dimitris
Avramopoulos said Wednesday the city is focused on the task ahead
for the 2004 Olympic preparation, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
In April, Juan Antonio Samaranch was highly critical of 2004
host city Athens, saying he had never seen a Games with so many
organizational problems as Athens in his 20 years as International
Olympic Committee (IOC) president.
</P>
<P>
But in Sydney on Wednesday en route to Uluru in central
Australia for Thursday's start of the Olympic torch relay,
Avramopoulos said Athens was back on track.
</P>
<P>
"When Mr. Samaranch came out (to Athens) and made those
comments I went to visit him in Lausanne," Avramopoulos told a
gathering of mainly Greek-language journalists. "We had a long,
sincere and cordial talk."
</P>
<P>
Avramopoulos, a member of the Athens 2004 organizing committee
(ATHOC), said since the comments were made, Athens had taken swift
action.
</P>
<P>
"We all gathered and we talked about it, we accepted that
certain things had not been done and there was some very important
political decisions made," Avramopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
"The first change to the organization of ATHOC assures that we
are on a good and positive track and things will go very very well
in the future."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis'
appointment of 44-year-old lawyer Gianna Angelopoulos to the
position of ATHOC president. Angelopoulos was the architect behind
Athens' successful 2004 bid.
</P>
<P>
Avramopoulos, 47, said the Olympics would be a unique
opportunity to improve one of Athens' biggest negatives _ its
appearance.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic and believe that by the end of 2003
Athens will be among the best cities in Europe," he said.

<HEADLINE> South America To Back South Africa for Cup Host </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South America is set to support
South Africa's bid to host the 2006 soccer World Cup, a British
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a pact in which African countries would
back a Brazilian bid to host the World Cup in 2010, said the
Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which is due to be finalised next week,
Brazil would ensure South Africa gained the votes of the three
South American members of FIFA's 24-man executive committee, which
meets to choose the 2006 host country next month.
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is competing with England, Germany, South Africa and
Morocco for the right to hold the event. But the Financial Times
said the South American country might consider withdrawing its
candidacy as part of the agreement with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The deal was brokered by South Africa's campaign director
Danny Jordaan, the head of the Brazilian football federation
Ricardo Teixeira and former FIFA president Joao Havelange,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Teixeira is one of the three South American members of the
executive committee. Argentina's Julio Grondona and Paraguay's
Nicolas Leoz are the others.

<HEADLINE> More Fossils of Dinosaur Found in Yuanmou Man's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 7 (Xinhua)-- Archaeologists recently excavated
two more complete sets of dinosaur skeletons in the county of
Yuanmou, the "home of Yuanmou Man, in the Yi Autonomous Prefecture
of Chuxiong, in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The excavation began in late April after a villager in the
county discovered a fossil in last November which was later
confirmed as a fossilized dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that the finding is another major
archaeological discovery following the find of the first Yuanmou
Man in 1965 at Shangnabang Village in Yuanmou County.
</P>
<P>
Yuanmou Man which dates back to around 1.7 million years ago is
the earliest homo sapien found in China.
</P>
<P>
The latest three fossils which belong to the Cretaceous Period
(some 135 million and 60 million years ago) may help explain
possible reasons for the extinction of dinosaurs and the origin of
human and the relationships between dinosaur and human beings.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is abundant in various pithecanthropus fossils.

GUANGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- When people talk about pastures,
they often refer to the grasslands in such areas as Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region. But this time, they mean Guangdong province in
south China.
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, Guangdong enjoys a good
consumer market. Since 1980s, the province has opened its animal
husbandry and livestock market.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has attracted 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of
investment in the fields of animal raising and related products
processing.
</P>
<P>
In order to adapt to the development of market economy,
Guangdong has focused on developing grain-saving and fast-growing
varieties of poultry.
</P>
<P>
The total number of poultry raised in the province rose to more
than one billion in 1999, compared with some 100 million in 1980,
accounting for nearly a quarter of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to feed more vegetarian and muscle
livestock in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
To meet domestic demand, Guangdong has begun to export
livestock products such as chicken and pig to Hong Kong, Macao and
overseas market.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province reported a total animal husbandry
output worth 21.9 billion yuan, with exports amounting to one
billion yuan.

<P>
But if rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are
not willing to talk the government will not give in to their
terror tactics, said Kumaratunga in her address to the nation to
mark the War Heroes Day which fell on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have invited the LTTE for discussions several times, but
they have proved that they are not interested in peace," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
She said, "They are not even interested in peace for the Tamils.
It is clear that the LTTE and the Tamils are two different
entities."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been long plagued by ethnic conflicts between the
majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. The conflicts have
escalated into a civil war since 1983 between government troops
dominated by Sinhalese and LTTE rebels who are fighting for a
separate Tamil state in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga made her address to the nation at a
ceremony held at the Presidential Secretariat to pay tribute to
the war heroes.
</P>
<P>
She asked the nation to unite in the need of the hour and
explained to the nations of her government's plans to protect the
families of the fallen war heroes and the soldiers at the
battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka observed two minute silence at 9:30 a.m. in memory of
the countries' fallen heroes. The country has organized several
events to pay tribute to their soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Huge Fund for Improving Lake, River Water Quality in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province have
been carrying out a program under which World Bank loans are used
to improve the quality of water in six local lakes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, dubbed as a "province with 1,000 lakes", abounds in
water resources. But the quality of water in most lakes and
rivers has been worsening as a result of random discharge of
sewage and industrial waste water.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Jiazhi, head of Hubei provincial
environmental protection bureau, the program, initiated in early
1998, has pooled a total investment of 1.9 billion yuan (about 229
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Beneficiaries are Donghu, Moshui lakes in Wuhan, the provincial
capital, and Cihu Lake in Huangshi, another industrial city in
eastern Hubei, and Xiaoqing, Zhupi and Fuhe rivers in the province.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a great number of sewage treatment plants
and works to hold up and treat industrial waste water have been
built so that sewage and industrial waste water will be discharged
into lakes and rivers only after treatment.
</P>
<P>
Some 884 million yuan ( about 107 million U.S. dollars) has so
far been spent in constructing various waste water treatment works,
including the use of 40 million U.S. dollars loans from World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Facilities to hold up sewage and industrial waste water for the
three lakes will be completed at the end of this year and by then,
the water quality in the three lakes will turn for the better,
said Yang, adding that pollution harnessing works for the three
rivers are expected to be finished in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Hubei Province has implemented regulations on
preventing and harnessing water pollution in the valley of the
province's Hanjiang River, a major tributary of the mighty Yangtze
River, as of May 1.

<HEADLINE> Thai Group Mapping out Strategy to Counter Chinese Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Saha Group, Thailand's largest
consumer product conglomerate is working out a new strategy to
counter low-cost products from China in the face of the country's
imminent entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
When China becomes a member of the WTO soon, it will no longer
face as many trade barriers from WTO member countries as before,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We worry about this issue because our products will lose the
advantage when comparing with Chinese products in the
international market. China has very low production costs, so we
are thinking about a new strategy to compete with products from
China," Boonsithi Chokwatana, the group's chairman, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Boonsithi said he could not estimate how much financial impact
sales of Chinese-made products would have on sales of similar Saha
Group goods, especially clothing and footwear marketed under
several brands.
</P>
<P>
The Saha Group intends to make the selling point of its
products clearer and the priority area will be niche markets. It
will also develop new products to meet global trends, especially
in areas that are difficult to enter.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that Saha will form partnerships with local
companies in some Southeast Asian countries to sell its products.
However, it has no business plan for investment in production in
China because it is not easy to build Thai brands that would be
accepted by Chinese consumers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Boonkiat Chokwatana, a director of the group, was quoted as
saying that the first two businesses to be affected by Chinese-
made products would be textiles and shoes because 80 percent of
their production costs went to labor.
</P>
<P>
However, Narong Chokwatana, another director, was quoted as
saying that, the superior efficiency of Thai plants compared with
Chinese counterparts would help overcome price differences.

<HEADLINE> OAS Ends its 30th General Assembly with Dozen Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 6 (Xinhua) - Foreign Ministers from 34 members of
the Organization of American States (OAS)concluded their three-day
general assembly Tuesday in Canada's southern auto town of Windsor
with a dozen resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on children and armed conflicts urges member
states to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution on corruption and corporate social
responsibility, the OAS will take specific measures for member
states to implement the Inter-American Convention on Corruption.
The resolution for the first time puts corporate social
responsibility on the OAS agenda.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on parliamentary network of the Americas notes
the decision of legislators to hold a meeting of the "Inter-
parliamentary Forum of the Americas" in Canada in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Other resolutions include those on the OAS mission to Peru,
civil society, small arms and light weapons, anti-personnel mines,
peace fund, democracy fund, indigenous issues, women's rights, and
gender equality.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting also decided to hold the next OAS general
assembly in Costa Rica in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 30th OAS general assembly opened late Sunday amid a clash
between anti-free-trade protesters and police, who have made more
than 40 arrests to ensure order during the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Internet Consumer Rules Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To build confidence in the online marketplace, consumer
protection "is as critical ... as traffic lights and rules of the
road to traffic on a concrete highway," the so-called Electronic
Commerce and Consumer Protection Group said.
</P>
<P>
Given the Internet's borderless nature, many Web merchants face
"an unworkable hodgepodge of local regulations" in multiple
jurisdictions, said the "e-commerce" group, which also includes AT&AMP;
T, International Business Machines, Dell Computer, Network
Solutions and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
"We are proposing a model that can now be evaluated by all
companies doing business online, consumers and governments around
the world," said Ron Plesser, a lawyer with Piper Marbury Rudnick &AMP;
Wolfe who coordinated the group's work.
</P>
<P>
The plan suggests the use of third-party online dispute
resolution mechanisms that would not interfere with existing legal
recourse or consumer rights to dispute a credit card charge.
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to resolve these issues in a manner that reflects
the monetary value of these disputes, which is important to
individual consumers, but often small in amount,'' the working
group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, traditional court-based solutions, including small
claims courts, particularly for people who live in different
countries, are by and large impractical," it said.
</P>
<P>
The group said online dispute resolution would cut companies'
compliance costs, allowing for greater choice and more competition.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception less than a decade ago, the online
marketplace has grown dramatically with as many as 90 million
Americans now regularly using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Of those, 69 percent -- or more than 60 million people --
shopped online in the third quarter of last year, according to
figures cited by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in a report
last month on online privacy. Figures on worldwide Internet usage
vary widely.
</P>
<P>
In its May 22 report to Congress, three of the five FTC
commissioners favored new laws to protect consumers' privacy
online. The industry has argued that self-regulation alone can do
the job.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Reaches 117 in Earthquake in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the dead and injured have come from the provincial
capital of Bengkulu, about 536 kilometers northwest of Jakarta,
and surrounding districts.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they had yet to assess the full impact of the
earthquake because of cut communications with outlying areas of
the province.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, Sunday's earthquake,
measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale, has damaged thousands of
houses in the province, with financial losses estimated at 30
billion rupiah (about 3.8 million U.S. dollars). In South Bengkulu,
the quake has reportedly damaged an irrigation system worth 7.5
billion rupiah and roads worth 4.5 billion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
But relief efforts have been hampered by the closure of the
provincial airport and bad weather, with supplies of food,
medicine and plastic sheeting only trickling in.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Bengkulu city have been struggling with a shortage
of beds, medicine and blood. They have resorted to treating
victims in hospital parking lots.
</P>
<P>
An information officer with the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies Jessica Barry was quoted as
saying that a team of experts would arrive in Bengkulu on
Wednesday to assess damage and deliver medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Many Bengkulu residents spent Tuesday in makeshift tents, as
minor tremors played havoc with jittery nerves. Seismologists said
more than 500 light tremors have been recorded since the temblor
hit. The aftershocks were going down in magnitude but they would
continue through the week and expected to vanish only in two or
three weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has appealed for help from around the
world, and the international community has been quick to respond.
Australia, the United States, Japan, Singapore and Thailand have
pledged emergency aid to help survivors of the quake in Bengkulu,
home to 1.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's far-flung islands are regularly hit by earthquakes.
At least 45 people died last month when an earthquake measuring 6.
5 on the Richter Scale hit Central Sulawesi and some neighboring
islands.
</P>
<P>
The worst quake to hit Indonesia in the past decade was in
1992, when 2,200 people died in a string of eastern islands.

<HEADLINE> Intel delays release of Timna processor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest semiconductor maker, said it has delayed by several months
the launch of its integrated processor, code-named Timna, because
it needs to develop a new method to connect the integrated
processor to standard memory.
</P>
<P>
The delay, from the second half of this year until the first
quarter of 2001, is related to problems with a component known as
a memory translation hub (MTH) that allows Intel processors
designed for specialized Rambus memory to use traditional
synchronous memory instead, according to reports from the chip
giant Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Intel recalled nearly one million motherboards that
used an MTH and Intel's 820 chipset because signal problems with
the MTH could cause systems to crash and potentially lead to data
loss.
</P>
<P>
The Timna processor is Intel's first so-called integrated chip
that combines the central processor unit core, memory controller
and a graphics controller. It was developed for personal computer
systems that cost 800 dollars and below.
</P>
<P>
Timna will be pitched as a lower-cost product than the Celeron
chip, the Pentium-class processor aimed at low-cost PCs. Intel
will announce by the end of the month Celeron chips that run at
700 megahertz, up from 600 megahertz currently.
</P>
<P>
Analyst Peter Glaskowsky of MicroDesign Resources said the woes
with the MTH appear to reflect deep flaws in the physical design
of that component. Reworking the physical design of a chip
typically takes four or five months, he said, adding that Intel
may have already begun that process.
</P>
<P>
The delay also could put additional pricing pressure on Intel.
The chips needed for, say, a 600-MHz Timna-based computer were
expected to cost 7 to 10 dollars less than if PC makers used a 600-
MHz Celeron with a chipset containing integrated graphics. Such a
discount could reduce the retail price of PCs by 30 dollars, noted
one analyst.
</P>
<P>
Intel has been struggling to keep up with strong demand for
Celeron and Pentium III processors since last year's holiday
season. Other analysts believe that the Timna delay could free up
enough capacity to help Intel avoid a similar crunch this year.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reiterates Cautious Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the world's
largest software maker that has been battling a government
antitrust suit, reiterated its outlook on Tuesday for lowered
revenue growth despite seeing stronger PC demand, according to
reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
Chief Financial Officer John Connors said the company sees
industry-wide personal computer sales growing 12 to 15 percent for
its fiscal year beginning July.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, which has a wide view of the computer industry
because it sells operating systems for most personal computers,
cited slow PC growth as one reason it had lowered its outlook in
April for year-to-year revenue growth to 15 percent from 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Connors reiterated Tuesday that 20 percent revenue growth rates
were not within reach, despite a recovery in the business PC
market and the release of the Windows 2000 operating system, which
he said was on track.
</P>
<P>
Another reason behind the cautious outlook, according to
Connors, is because the twists and turns of the government's
antitrust lawsuit against the Redmond, Wash.-based company had
taken its toll on the spirits of employees.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be accurate or honest to say that a
lawsuit like this -- and the continuous negative stories -- does
not have an effect on morale," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicted that in fiscal year 2001 the company
expects to achieve 15 percent year-over-year revenue growth rates,
which he called "a lot of dough."
</P>
<P>
"Once we get the legal volume turned down and the DOJ (
Department of Justice) case goes into the appeals process, I think
we can have the kind of growth we feel good about and the people
in this room can feel good about," he told investors at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Microsoft had not yet begun to map out how a breakup
would be carried out, though a ruling in the antitrust suit, which
could force a break-up of the company, is expected as early as
this week.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Opens Olympics 2008 Bid Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A shower before Tuesday's opening
of Bangkok's Olympics 2008 Bid Office here, was considered by Thai
people as a good indication to suggest that Bangkok was on the
right road to achieve success.
</P>
<P>
This was observed by many local people before the ceremonies
began to bless the opening of the office.
</P>
<P>
"We have not bid for the Games of the Olympiad before, and many
were surprised why we have been so modest. Now that we have come
forward, we are naturally earnest to win the bid," said Deputy
Bangkok Governor Tirachai Vuthitham before the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
As the Hosts of four Asian Games and five Southeast Asian Games,
Bangkok has also staged many international events. In 1978, sports
leaders in the continent had proposed the Metropolis as permanent
headquarters for the Asian Games, when the continent was fighting
hard to maintain continuity of the quadrennial celebration.
</P>
<P>
The beats of traditional Thai drum heard, shouts of "chaiyo" (
Thai word for "long live") rent the air as the President of the
National Olympic Committee Chettha Thanajaro cut the ribbon and
declared open the office.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said, "The signs as of today are very good and we are
convinced we will pass the first stage and qualify as a bidding
city. That's our next step."
</P>
<P>
All 10 cities bidding to be hosts: Bangkok, Beijing, Cairo,
Havana, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Osaka, Paris, Seville and Toronto
must first graduate from the applicant status, and that depends on
the answers they provide to the 22 questions which the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) have set out.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the answers is June 20. Each city must provide
50 bilingual copies in French and English. The IOC executive will
examine the replies June 21-August 27. The results will be
announced August 28, either in Lausanne or Sydney.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Miss Thailand added charm and beauty to the
Olympic campaign with her presence. She has already accepted to
serve as Public Relations Ambassador for the bid and will address
meetings scheduled to be held to build momentum for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Other build-up ceremonies are to be held at the Rajamangala
Stadium here. and free concerts for Bangkok's Olympics bid are to
be staged in Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen, Hat Yai and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Australian bid expert, Rod McGeoch who was behind the
successful bids of Sydney and Athens and who saw the potential of
Bangkok to host the Games is expected to make television addresses
to the country, outlining the reasons why the Metropolis should
make an excellent host city.

<TEXT>
<P>
The people are required to observe two minutes silence at 9:30
a.m.local time (0330 GMT) as tribute to the fallen war heroes.
Traffic also came to a standstill at this time as a mark of
respect to them.
</P>
<P>
A national ceremony to mark the day was held here under the
patronage of President Chandrika Kumaratunga at the Presidential
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
It began with a bevy of school girls reciting a special song
dedicated to the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Later the national flag was drawn full mast and the president
accepted donations to the National Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year-old civil war between
the government and Tamil Tiger rebels who are fighting for a
separate state for minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The war has escalated as the rebels were engaged in a ferocious
assault in a bid to retake their former stronghold of the northern
Jaffna peninsula since overrunning a strategic base in April.
</P>
<P>
The government has vowed to defend Jaffna and taken various
steps to boost the morale of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
While government institutions were issued directions how
ceremonies should be conducted at their workplaces, most private
establishments and individuals joined hands to make the
countrywide program a success.
</P>
<P>
The government's Independent Television Network and Lak Handa
radio jointly organized a motorcade from Nugegoda to Panadura,
south of Colombo, to collect funds for the National Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
A commemoration ceremony organized by Airport and Aviation
Services was held a the Ratmalana Airport. Similar ceremonies were
conducted at several towns in the provinces sponsored by various
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the occasion, President Kumaratunga called
on the people to join the government in saluting the members of
the Sri Lanka armed services and police who are dead, missing in
action,disabled and those who are fighting a valiant battle to
keep the nation together.
</P>
<P>
She asked the people to assist the families of the soldiers by
conducting religious observances and blessing on the forces and
their relatives and ensure them that society has not forgotten
them.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said, "our cherished dream of peace can be achieved
only through a political solution of giving space for every
citizen of this country to live in dignity and harmony."
</P>
<P>
She said to achieve this end a consensus is being reached by
all political parties to forge ahead with a new constitution which
will spell out a new vision for nationhood.

The AAP quoted Solomon Islands' Minister for State Alfred
Sasako as saying the national parliament would be recalled to
resolve the current security and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It has been agreed the parliament will convene on Thursday
next week to activate the constitutional procedure for the removal
of the prime minister," Sasako said.

He said the attempted coup leader Andrew Nori and spokesman for
the government caucus Paterson Oti had agreed, in a joint
statement, that the 48-hour notice of resignation of the PM was
not necessary.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. CIA Involved in Montegegrin Official's Murder, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) plotted and was directly involved in the
assassination of a Montenegrin presidential security advisor, a
Yugoslav cabinet minister said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Goran Matic told a news conference that
the CIA was directly involved in the assassination of Goran Zugic,
security adviser for Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
The assassination was conducted in Yugoslav territory in order
to destabilize the country and plunge it into chaos, Matic said.
</P>
<P>
The CIA also attempted to alienate Montenegro and Serbia, the
two republics forming Yugoslavia, he added.
</P>
<P>
A telephone conversation, reportedly recorded 20 minutes after
the assassination between two staff persons from U.S. agencies
based in Yugoslavia, was replayed at the news conference. One
person reportedly told another that "the task was successfully
executed 20 minutes ago."
</P>
<P>
Goran Zugic, 45, was murdered on May 31 in front of his home in
Podgorica, capital of Montenegro. He was the fourth highest-
ranking Yugoslav official murdered since the February killing of
Pavle Bulatovich, the federal defense minister, at a restaurant in
Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Reduces Soil Erosion By 5,000 Sq. Km </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The province planted 280,000 hectares of trees and 80,000
hectares of grass since last winter. As a result, the improved
environment has helped reduce the amount of sand washed into the
rivers of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, China's two largest
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the provincial government of Shaanxi adopted
measures to encourage farmers to turn farmland into forest and to
plant trees to increase vegetation coverage in its western regions.
</P>
<P>
By April, 2.1 million hectares of barren hills and land have
been contracted by farmers, enterprises, institutions and
individuals for afforestation. Some one million hectares of land
have been reclaimed thus far, involving a total investment of 460
million yuan (55.4 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The province aims to reclaim nearly 100,000 sq. km of soil
erosion in the next 12 years. The province had suffered from soil
erosion affecting 130,000 sq. km, or 60 percent of its land area.
Each year, 900 million tons of sand are washed into the Yangtze
and Yellow Rivers.

<P>
CHONGQING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 91 percent of the
misappropriated fund, or 430 million yuan, allocated for the
settlement of the Three Gorges Dam project has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the Auditing Administration in 1998 found
that 473 million yuan (57 million US dollars) allocated for
relocating people living in the area was misused. The money was
spent on building office buildings, dormitories and setting up
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
State Council, have paid great attention to the problem and urged
the governments of Hubei Province and Chongqing Municipality to
adopt measures to recover the misused funds before the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The relocation project will involve 1.13 million people in 20
counties and prefectures by 2009 when the Three Gorges Project is
expected to be completed.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges hydro-electric power project on China's
largest river, the Yangtze, is the largest hydro-electric power
project in the world. It is expected to help control floods and
increase power generating capacity. The project started in 1993
and will cost an estimated 50.09 billion yuan (6 billion US
dollars).

</P>
<P>
Quails, crested myna and some other birds are already extinct

<P>
Experts attributed the decline and extinction mainly to the
expansion of city and environmental pollution, which have greatly
damaged the surrounding habitat for the wild life.

Local people have eaten large numbers of snakes, frogs and
birds, posing a threat to the survival of wild animals.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Warns Against Violence in Papua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said the country could not afford to have a repeat of the
sort of violence that occurred in the province of Aceh over the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Aceh, a province with the special autonomous status
in northwestern Sumatra, have been fighting for 25 years for
independence, a greater share of oil profits, and the right to
impose Islamic religious laws. More than 5,000 people have died in
the violence.
</P>
<P>
"We must not act like we did in the past. Our soldiers were
sent to Aceh and they attacked the people. It must not happen
again. Soldiers must be polite. I believe the people are not the
enemy," the president was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said resorting to violence will only make matters worse.
He appealed to all parties including the Papuans to understand
each other so the problems will be resolved smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The Papua National Congress declared on Sunday that the
province will be no longer a part of the unitary state of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated his statement that the independence
movement does not represent the majority of people living in Papua,
so it won't receive support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commander of the Indonesian Defense Forces Admiral
Widodo A.S. said the military won't send additional troops to
Papua, despite the assertion by separatists that the province
independent.
</P>
<P>
"The number of personnel in Irian Jaya is adequate; therefore,
for the time being we will not send in additional troops," he said.

<P>
The death toll of the quake, measuring at 7.9 on the Richter
Scale, rose to 103 on Tuesday and local authorities said they
expected the number of casualties to climb further. More than 500
people had been injured by the quake.
</P>
<P>
According to the Meteorological Office here, more than 500
light tremors have been recorded since the temblor hit although
only 22 could be felt by people. The after-temblors were going
down in magnitude but they would continue through the week and
expected to vanish only in two or three weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Bengkulu province on Sumatra island would
possibly return to normal only after the aftershocks had stopped,
said Suharjono, the office's coordinator for national earthquakes'
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the earthquake has damaged thousands of
houses in the province, with financial losses estimated at 30
billion rupiah (about 3.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
People began to face scarcity of clean water and fuel oil. The
authorities had to cut-off power in Bengkulu city as 70 percent of
its power installations was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Fearing further tremors, most people living in Bengkulu and the
surrounding areas spent the night outside their homes in makeshift
tents and shelters.
</P>
<P>
Bengkulu Governor Hasan Zein has said the hardest hit region is
the island of Enggano where about 90 percent of structures were
damaged. Telephone lines in the island had been cut off, prompting
the authorities to send two naval boats to the island. Enggano
lies close to the earthquake's epicenter and is home to 1,500
people.
</P>
<P>
Relief supplies, including food and medicine, began to trickle
in after an international appeal for aid was issued on Tuesday
morning. Teams of doctors were also racing to reach the area.
</P>
<P>
Acting Coordinating Minister for Political Affairs and Security
Surjadi Soedirdja said that he would coordinate with the military
to airdrop medical aid, probably by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"Relief could come too late because the airport and the sea
port are both damaged so it may hinder the handling of aid.
Although medical aid is highly urgent, its dispatch has been
hindered ," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also appealed for help from around the world. The
international community has been quick to respond.
</P>
<P>
Japan announced a 14.99 million yen (140,000 U.S. dollars)
emergency grant to help survivors of the Bengkulu quake. A 19-
member Japanese medical team will be dispatched on Wednesday, with
medicine and medical equipment, for a two-week stay.
</P>
<P>
Singapore announced it would join relief efforts in Bengkulu. A
20-member Singapore Armed Forces medical team, together with
emergency supplies and tents worth 29,000 U.S. dollars, was
airlifted on Tuesday to Bengkulu.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also announced it would donate 20,000 U.S. dollars
through Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty
Eradication Basri Hasanuddin to help those most affected by the
earthquake.

<HEADLINE> Multi-ethnic Border Police Inaugurated in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia launched unified national
border police on Tuesday when 85 Muslim, Croat and Serb officers
began functioning at the Sarajevo international airport, the
Oslobodjenje newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The national border service will be made up of 3,000 members,
responsible for the security of the country's 1,665-kilometer
border line.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted U.N. special envoy to Bosnia Paul Klein as
saying that the national border service is crucial for fighting
against trafficking and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling and illegal importation have caused loss worth
several hundred million convertible marks, Klein said during the
inaugurating ceremony at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's joint presidency described the border service in its
congratulatory message as a very important force in helping build
an integrated market for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The multi-ethnic police force is to replace two separate police
forces from Bosnia's post-war entities -- the Serb republic (
Republika Srpska) and the Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Wolfgang Petritschan, high representative of
the Peace Implementation Council of Bosnia, Bosnia decided to
establish the joint police force in January.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns KFOR for Wounding Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslavian government on
Tuesday made a strong protest regarding the United Nations'
mission in Kosovo and the international peacekeeping force KFOR
for wounding Serbian residents.
</P>
<P>
British troops in the KFOR shot and injured four Serbs,
including a child, in the village of Gracanica Tuesday, said
Stanimir Vukicevic, the chairman of the Yugoslav committee
cooperating with the UN mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).
</P>
<P>
Albanian extremists also wounded five Serbs in the village the
same day, with British troops on the scene, Vukicevic said in a
protest letter sent to the UN mission.
</P>
<P>
The actions of the peacekeeping forces show they are now
standing at the side of Albanian extremists, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 Serbs have been killed by Albanian extremists in the
past 10 days, Vukicevic said. He pointed out that the reasons for
the surge in anti-Serb attacks are because the UN mission and KFOR
have failed to implement the Security Council's resolution 1244
and disregard the violence of Albanian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1244 ended NATO's 78-day bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia last June and set up the UNMIK.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Conservative academic Ferenc Madl
was elected Hungary's new president Tuesday in the third round of
voting after failing twice to secure enough support.
</P>
<P>
Madl, the 69-year-old sole candidate, was finally elected with
a simple majority of 243 votes out of 351 deputies present. He
failed to win the required two-thirds majority either in the first
round Monday or second earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hungarian Constitution, only a simple majority is
needed in the third round of voting.
</P>
<P>
He will be sworn in on August 4, succeeding President Arpad
Goencz, who has served the maximum two terms.
</P>
<P>
Madl was backed by the ruling conservative majority but also
enjoys support from the leftist and liberal opposition. Many
people were astonished at his failure to secure the post in the
first and second rounds of voting.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1931, Madl studied law in Budapest. He held ministerial
posts in Hungary's government between 1990 to 1994. In 1993, he
was elected into Hungary's Academy of Sciences as an academician .

<HEADLINE> Closer Polish-Chinese Parliamentary Ties Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Poland's House of
Representatives Maciej Plazynski Tuesday called for closer ties
between the parliaments of Poland and China to promote bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
"The Polish parliament is willing to step up exchanges and
cooperation with China's National People's Congress (NPC) and to
strengthen cooperation in political, economic, scientific and
technological, and cultural fields," Plazynski told Buhe, deputy
chairman of the NPC's Standing Committee, at a meeting in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Poland and China have quite different
national conditions, he said, bilateral relations and cooperation
between the two parliaments should not be affected.
</P>
<P>
Poland hopes to draw on the successful experience of China's
economic reforms, Plazynski said. "Poland cannot neglect China, a
huge potential consumer market," he added.
</P>
<P>
With the expansion of bilateral ties, the two countries have
witnessed better contacts between Poland's National Assembly and
the NPC, China's legislature, Buhe said. He hoped that Chinese-
Polish parliamentary ties will be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, who arrived here Monday on a five-day goodwill visit,
also held separate talks with Stanislaw Zajac, deputy speaker of
Poland's House of Representatives, and Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek.
</P>
<P>
Geremek told Buhe that parliamentary exchanges are a vital part
of bilateral political dialogue, and Buhe's current trip marks a
good start of a Chinese leader's visit to Poland.
</P>
<P>
Buhe is scheduled to leave Poland Friday for the Czech Republic
to continue his four-nation European tour, which will also take
him to Hungary and Romania.

<HEADLINE> UNSCEAR General Assembly Report Focus on Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Apart from an increase in thyroid
cancer, there is no evidence of a major health problem
attributable to radiation exposure as a result of the Chernobyl
incident, said a report approved by the United Nations Scientific
Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There have been about 1,800 cases of thyroid cancer found in
children who were exposed at the time of the accident, and there
may be more such cases during the next decades, said UNSCEAR in
its 2000 report to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this increase, there is no additional scientific
evidence of a major public health problem due to radiation from
the nuclear accident, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The risk of leukemia, one of the main concerns due to its short
latency period, does not appear to be elevated, not even among
recovery operation workers, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although those individuals most exposed are at an increased
risk of radiation-associated effects, the great majority of the
Chernobyl population are not likely to experience serious health
consequences from exposure, the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
Chernobyl is the site of the world's worst nuclear accident. A
reactor caught fire and exploded in April 1986, spewing a cloud of
radioactive dust over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and parts of
western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government announced Monday that it will close
the Chernobyl power plant on December 15.

<HEADLINE> World's Longest Ancient City Wall To Apply For World Heritage Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Cultural relics researchers in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu province, are busy
preparing for a local ancient city wall built in Ming Dynasty (
1364-1644) to be listed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
The wall was 33.676-km long in perimeter and is believed to be
the longest ancient city wall in the world. The wall was first
built in 473 BC and was extended several times in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang built the
largest section of the city wall which took more than 20 years to
complete. More than 200,000 workers and many skillful craftsmen
across the nation were enlisted to build the city wall.
</P>
<P>
The ancient wall was 14 to 21 meters tall, 14 meters thick at
the bottom and 4 to 9 meters thick at the top. All the bricks
used for building the city wall were engraved with the date and
place as to when and where they were fired, as well as the name of
craftsman who made them. The bricks weigh 10 to 20 kg each.
</P>
<P>
Among the 31 gates at the wall, the most splendid is the
Zhonghua Gate, which was once used as a military stronghold and
could accommodate more than 3,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
This city wall has been repaired several times. Massive repair
work on the wall was done in 1990, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
As a renowned historic city, Nanjing was once the capital of 10
dynasties in ancient China.

URUMQI, June 7 (Xinhua) --More than 2 million hectares of land
in northern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China,
have been plagued by locusts, according to Xinjiang's locust
control headquarters.
</P>
<P>
This is the third largest locust plague in the region since
1990. Eight prefectures and counties in northern Tianshan Mountain
are being plagued by locusts.
</P>
<P>
There are over 10,000 locusts per square meter in some of the
worst hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The disaster is mainly attributed to the impact left over by
the locust plague in Xinjiang and in neighboring Kazakhstan and
Russia last year.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said that the possibility for the plague to
spread to neighboring provinces is very low. Xinjiang has made all
preparations to fight against the plague.

<HEADLINE> Former Tour de France Champion Pantani to Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Tour de France champion Marco
Pantani was ordered on Tuesday to stand trial on charges of
sporting fraud in relation to high red blood cell levels recorded
in a 1995 race.
</P>
<P>
Investigating judge Stefano Celli ruled there were grounds to
send the Italian rider, who won both the Tour de France and the
Giro d'Italia in 1998, to trial.
</P>
<P>
Pantani was not in court in the northeastern town of Forli to
hear the decision, which related to a blood test in October 1995
during the Milan-Turin race in which his hematocrit (red blood
cell) level was found to be 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Riders are automatically suspended if they have red blood cell
counts of more than 50 percent. A high hematocrit reading can
indicate use of the banned performance-boosting substance
erythropoietin (EPO).
</P>
<P>
Pantani was originally sent to trial in April on the same
charge, even though public prosecuters had recommended the case be
shelved and the Italian Olympic Committee had decided to drop it
almost a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The April ruling was then reversed on a technicality before
being upheld again on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pantani, who helped his Mercatone Uno team mate Stefano
Garzelli to win this year's Giro and is looking forward to the
Tour in three weeks' time, was sensationally expelled from the
1999 Giro after failing a blood test.
</P>
<P>
With just two stages to race and victory within his reach, he
was found to have a hematocrit level of 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pantani walked away from the sport for almost a year but
returned at the eleventh hour to take his place on the starting
line of this year's Giro.

</P>
<P>
Japanese organising committee chairman Sho Nasu said on Tuesday:
"From an operations point of view, this is a welcome development.
However, it has little effect on our preparations, and we will
continue with our work to welcome the world in 2002."
</P>
<P>
Under the FIFA plan, three games per day will be the norm.
</P>
<P>
The opening game is due to be held in Seoul, with the final at
Japan's Yokohama International Stadium on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Prices for the opening match in Seoul will range from $150 to $
500 while the final in Yokohama on June 30 will cost $300 to $750.
</P>
<P>
Fans will be able to buy up to four tickets per match.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said it anticipated that about three million tickets will
go on sale, with 50 percent going to the Japan and Korean
organising committees.
</P>
<P>
The remaining tickets would be sold internationally with 880,
000 going to the general public and participating national
associations.
</P>
<P>
Some 620,000 others would go to FIFA commercial affiliates and
rights holders, who in turn place a significant proportion of
their allocation at the disposal of the public through various
promotions, contests and lotteries.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Reinforced in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The coastal Zhejiang province in
east China will further develop and promote its tourism industry,
said Wang Yongming, vice-governor of the province at a symposium
recently.
</P>
<P>
The province made 40.9 billion yuan (4.9 billion US dollars)
from tourism last year, accounting for 7.3 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Wang said that more and more people have brief getaways on the
weekends and holidays, offering big business opportunities for the
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The province is also targeting people from overseas. In 1999,
about 948,000 overseas tourists traveled around the province,
generating 410 million US dollars. The provincial government will
further improve shopping, accommodation and transportation
facilities to meet the increasing needs of tourism, Wang noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China is strengthening cooperation
with other countries in the area of energy, said Chinese officials
at a conference held here by the World Energy Council.
</P>
<P>
China has great potential market for energy products, services
and technologies. It will become the largest energy importer in
the following two decades with daily petroleum imports estimated
at more than 8 million barrels, according to the International
Energy Association sources.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Agriculture has developed energy
cooperation with American, Britain, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China has opened its electricity market to foreign investors
since 1990s. Overseas funding accounts for 10 per cent of the
country's total power investments. And the government is yet to
raise the rate to 20 percent in the future. By 1999, 24 million kw
of electricity was generated by foreign-funded plants.
</P>
<P>
More solely-funded electricity plants or joint ventures are to
be set up to increase power generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the environment, China is making efforts to
develop renewable energies to replace coal, which still serves as
the major source for power generating. The World Bank and the UNDP
have funded many renewable energy programs in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is also planning to import natural gas
from Russia and Central Asia, said Chen Heping, an official from
the State Development Planning Commission.

<HEADLINE> EU Supports Education Institutions in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The "Socrates" program of the
European Union (EU) has been supporting since 1995 the improvement
of Romania's educational system by establishing direct contacts
between educational institutions in Romania and similar ones in
the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a Wednesday report of the official Rompres news
agency, the EU sent in Romania in the past six years 19 million
euros only for solving some education-related problems such as the
change of the national education curriculum, descentralization of
the educational system, bringing the latest IT technologies in
universities, and transformation of the vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
Over 7,000 Romanian educational institutions benefited from the
EU's financial support. This year only, more than 2,000 Romanian
students study in Western universities on the basis of the "
Socrates" program. The study periods performed abroad are
recognized in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission decided this week to extend this
program, now called "Socrates II," until 2006 in 30 countries both
from Western and Eastern Europe. The total budget worth 1,885,000,
000 euros will allow an annual allocation worth 270 million euros.
</P>
<P>
The respective funds have been divided depending on the number
of citizens in each country. Romania will benefit as early of this
year by 8 million euros and next year other 18 million euros are
to be allotted.
</P>
<P>
The "Socrates II" program will be officially launched in
Romania on June 16 and will comprise several main destinations.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria: Eradicating Poverty, Improving Education and Health for Women Still Top Developing Countries' Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 7 (Xinhua )-- For developing countries
today, the quest for poverty eradication and improvement of
education and health for women and girls remains a top priority,
Nigeria said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China at the United
Nations General Assembly special session on women, Aisha Ismail,
Minister for Women's Affairs and Youth Development of Nigeria,
said in pursuit of these goals, developing countries have reviewed
and strengthened policies and programs with a special focus on the
needs of women.
</P>
<P>
Since the Beijing Conference, the world has witnessed a lot of
radical transformation in the area of computer and information
technology and the one word that captures that transformation is
globalization, the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
While the benefits of globalization have been recognized, the
reality is that developing countries have been at a disadvantage,
the Minister noted.
</P>
<P>
More important for this conference, it must be acknowledged
that the negative impact of globalization is felt by women in
developing countries, and it is therefore, necessary to critically
examine how the issue of globalization is impacting on the
empowerment of women in the developing world, to enable the
development of appropriate programs and harness the opportunities
presented by this new trend, the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
A further impediment to the global commitment for gender
equality is the debt burden, and the painful implementation of
structural adjustment programs, which hang like millstones around
the necks of many countries in the developing world, she pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Despite the willingness and cooperation of some countries of
the developed world to relieve or cancel bilateral debt, and
through such measures as the Heavily Indebted poor Countries
Initiative, the debt burden of the developing world, particularly
in Africa, still remains very high, she said.
</P>
<P>
Certainly debt cancellation can release much needed vital
resources and enable developing countries to commerce the process
of rehabilitating the totally destroyed social sector, and freedom
from the debt burden will provide the means to positively impact
on the provision of basic social services to the people, the
Minister added.

<HEADLINE> Romania Increases Exports to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Romania's exports to the area of
Asia-Oceania increased by 11.3 percent in 1999 as against the
previous year, amounting to over one billion U.S. dollars, the
local daily Curentul reported Wednesday, quoting State
Undersecretary in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Mihai
Berinde.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increases were registered last year in the exports
to Thailand, the Philippines and Pakistan. The daily stressed that
the increase in exports to these areas is relevant, taking into
account the financial crisis in that part of the world in the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, Romania wants to further develop the
commercial relations with China, to strengthen the partnership
agreement with Japan and to intensify the cooperation with all the
countries in the Asia-Pacific area, Mihai Berinde said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the implementation of this strategy has already
borne fruit: for the first four months of this year, Romania's
exports to this area increased by 18.5 percent as against the same
span of time in 1999 .The most important increase has been
registered in the commercial exchanges with China, South Korea,
Japan, Pakistan and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The daily also said that Romania's imports from this area of
the world are about four times bigger than the exports.

WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp. split into two
companies, prescribing the biggest corporate breakup since AT&AMP;T
while harshly rebuking the software giant for stifling computer-
age competition.
</P>
<P>
Jackson has gone along with the government recommendation that
the software giant be split into two companies, one that would
sell operating systems, and another that would develop and market
Microsoft's popular Office software and Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
Potentially monumental, the ruling by Jackson was not the last
word in a case that could define the limits of companies operating
in a high tech economy.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has promised to appeal in the case, which had been
pressed by the Justice Department and 19 states. The case could go
to the U.S. Court of Appeals or directly to the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Teachers Support Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-five percent of the 300,000
Colombian state teachers supported the 48-hour strike called
Wednesday by the Colombian Educators Federation (FECODE), said the
leaders of that organization.
</P>
<P>
The strike that left without classes seven million students of
basic education and high schools, was called by the labor
organization to protest against a state plan. The teachers say
that the plan will cause the collapse of public education and will
promote privatization.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Gina Magnolia Riano said that her office will
inspect the schools where the classes were suspended and did not
dismiss the possibility that the strike will be declared illegal,
if regional governors ask for it.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "The rights of the children prevail over
those of the teachers, and to take from them the right to
education is a very serious violation of the law."
</P>
<P>
FECODE president Gloria Ines Ramirez explained that the strike
was called to protest against a series of courses the teachers
must attend during their mid-year vacation, which reduce the
resting time for the FECODE members.
</P>
<P>
The FECODE said that the reforms the government is promoting in
education are part of "impositions" of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to the Colombian government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Judge Orders Microsoft Split in Two EDS-Updates with more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge ordered
Wednesday Microsoft Corp. to be split in two separate companies to
correct antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has gone along
with the government recommendation that the software giant be
split in two, one that would sell operating systems, and another
that would develop and market Microsoft's popular Office software
and Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
If the judgment is upheld, it would be the harshest antitrust
penalty leveled against a U.S. corporation since AT&AMP;T agreed to
spin off the "baby bell" regional phone companies in 1982.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft, as it is presently organized and led, is unwilling
to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order
amending its conduct," Jackson said in his 23-page remedy order.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past," Jackson said,
citing its failure to comply with a court ruling earlier in the
1990s that preceded the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after the ruling
that, as expected, the company would appeal. "We have a very
strong appeal," Gates said.
</P>
<P>
Since its 1975 founding, Microsoft has grown to become the
world's most valuable software company with annual revenues of
over 20 billion U.S. dollars a year. With 60 foreign offices and
its software used around the world, a breakup would eventually
affect computer users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department and 17 of the states that sued
Microsoft proposed the split after Jackson concluded on April 3
that the firm violated U.S. antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent the
Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers,
from being used to force companies and consumers to use other
Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
Breakup of the company could also encourage development of
alternative operating systems and prompt versions of programs like
Microsoft Office to run on those systems, the government says.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, which expects to win on appeal, says a breakup would
harm consumers by preventing it from developing integrated
products.
</P>
<P>
The company's appeal could bypass the normal appeals court
process and go straight to the Supreme Court under a mechanism
available in major antitrust cases. But several legal experts said
they believed the high court would decline to receive the case on
an expedited basis.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Meaningful Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council looked forward to the talks, it said
in a press statement issued after hearing a briefing by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special adviser for Cyprus Alvaro
de Soto Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Council members welcomed the fact that the first two rounds of
talks had been conducted in a positive and constructive atmosphere,
and without preconditions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They commended the commitment shown by the participants, and
encouraged all concerned to continue their efforts towards a
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus question on the basis of
the relevant resolutions of the Security Council," it added.
</P>
<P>
The Council promised to take early action to renew the mandate
of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus by six months until
December 15.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks, originally scheduled for May 23, was
postponed due to President Glafcos Clerides' colon surgery.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island country, has been
divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek
Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive pro-Athens military coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has tried to reunite the island but talks
between the two communities have produced no tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Under a renewed call from Annan, the two sides held two rounds
of talks, first in New York last December and then in Geneva early
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side has maintained that the only way out of the
issue is to establish a confederation on the basis of two states,
an idea rejected by the Greek state and the international
community at large.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which follows the matter "with the
closest of interest," hopes that the proximity talks will prepare
the ground for meaningful negotiations leading to a comprehensive
settlement, it said Wednesday, noting that "the status quo in
Cyprus is unacceptable."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Land Crisis not to Spill Over to S. Africa: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki Wednesday dismissed jitters that land occupation by blacks
would happen in his country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the occupation of white-owned farms by war
veterans in Zimbabwe where at least 30 people have been killed
since the crisis began in February, Mbeki said his government
would not allow the same situation to happen in his country.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to worry that a violent claim for land
restitution could happen in South Africa, where the transition
from apartheid to democracy has largely been peaceful since the
1994 all-race elections ended the system of minority white rule,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no basis to assume that what is happening in Zimbabwe
must necessarily happen in South Africa," he stressed, assuring
that "there will be no spillover in South Africa."

<HEADLINE> Accord to Boost Cultural Exchanges Signed Between Italy, PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) -- An accord aimed at boosting bilateral
cultural, scientific and technological cooperation between Italy
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was signed here
Wednesday between the two parties, the Italian Foreign Ministry
said in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The accord, signed by Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
and Palestinian International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath,
specifically targets increased collaboration between universities
and resources such as archives and libraries.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry also said that the evaluation and research
of archaeological sites and cultural patrimonies, as well as
exchanges between experts, researchers and training ventures, were
high up on the list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
The accord also stipulates the establishment of linguistic,
cultural and teacher exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The accord reinforces past and existing Italo-Palestinian
exchanges, such as a project started three years ago by the
Italian Consulate in Jerusalem, which brought Italian language
courses to the Bir Zeit University, as well as current
negotiations to transmit Italian television programs on
Palestinian networks.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry communique stressed the success of past
joint archaeological projects, such as an Italo-Palestinian dig in
Tell es-Sultan (the Biblical Jericho) organized by Rome's La
Sapienza University and the Palestinian Ministry for Tourism and
Antiquities.
</P>
<P>
The Jericho dig, the communique read, opened opportunities for
researchers to explore the site, study the urban and social
structures of the ancient town, evaluate its potential for the
tourist industry and train future archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the two ministers discussed the Middle
East peace process, and Dini said he hoped peace would be
established as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said that the cultural cooperation accord would help
boost dialogue between Italy and the Palestinian territories, and
thanked the Italian government for the support it has lent to the
PNA.

BOGOTA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 4,400 bullets of
different calibers were found by Colombian authorities, official
sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ammunition, hidden in a cargo of corn flour donated to the
victims of the rains in the northeastern department of Norte de
Santander, was discovered by the mayor of the El Carmen village,
Jorge Ortega, to whom one of the 120 corn flour bags, which had
been confiscated to smugglers and sent to the rain victims, broke
accidentally.
</P>
<P>
The municipal official explained that the commodity, which
arrived illegally from Venezuela, was confiscated on March 15
together with automotive parts, and donated to the victims of the
rains by the Norte de Santander department government.
</P>
<P>
The corn flour cargo was given to the El Carmen residents
together with more than 20 boxes of shampoo, canned sardines, and
toothpaste, said Ortega, adding that the group of criminals who
were supposed to receive the ammunition was not identified.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Shrimp Industry Imperiled by White Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran shrimp industry has a
serious problem with the increase of mortality in the nursery
ponds for this crustacean caused by two viruses and the effects of
the economic crisis in the country, National Aquaculture Chamber
sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "El Comercio" newspaper said that while in December of 1999
the mortality in the ponds was 70 percent, now it nears 90 percent
because of the white spot.
</P>
<P>
But shrimp production is also affected now by the yellow head
virus, said Sandro Coglitore, Aquaculture Chamber chairman.
</P>
<P>
The shrimp industry sector estimates having lost 660 million
dollars during the last year because of the white spot.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank statistics show that income from shrimp exports
between January and March of this year was 48.6 million U.S.
dollars, compared with 186.1 million dollars in the same period of
1999.

<HEADLINE> German Parliamentary President: German-Chinese Ties in Good Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Wolfgang Thierse, president of the
German parliament Bundestag, told Chinese lawmakers Wednesday that
the German-Chinese relationship was "developing in a very good
trend" and it would continuously move forward in the future.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with a delegation of the Chinese National People
's Congress (NPC) in Berlin, Thierse said the friendly contacts
between the two parliaments in recent years had best proved that
German-Chinese ties were developing positively.
</P>
<P>
Germany "highly esteemed" China, first because of the latter's
progress in the era of reform and opening, and second because of
the great potential that the Chinese people had showed, Thierse
told Zeng Jianhui, chief of the the NPC's foreign affair sub-
commission, who led the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
Germans also admire the traditional civilization of China,
Thierse told the Chinese legislators.
</P>
<P>
Zeng agreed with Thierse's positive remarks on the German-
Chinese relationship, and thanked Germany's support for "one China,
" saying that Germany had never tried to develop official ties
with Taiwan; nor had it sold weapons to the island.
</P>
<P>
Zeng briefed the German side on China's recent progress in
economy, law making and enforcing, and human rights affairs.
</P>
<P>
Naturally Germans and Chinese hold deferent viewpoints on some
issues, said Thierse, stressing that both sides should raise
common sense through more contacts and dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Before this meeting, the Chinese delegation had talked with
the sub-commission for foreign affairs of the German parliament.
The two meetings were held at the historical Bundestag building in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said these "friendly and frank" talks were
beneficial to enhancing mutual understanding and propelling
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese legislators who arrived in Berlin Tuesday said
they would further meet with their German counterparts and high-
ranking German officials.

<HEADLINE> Italy-Spain Summit Aims to Boost Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Premier Jose Maria Aznar will
arrive in Italy's Naples Friday for the annual two-day summit
between Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The summit aims to reinforce the two countries' cooperation in
the Mediterranean, the European Union and on the world stage, the
Italian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A sign of the importance Aznar attaches to the event is the
fact that he is bringing, at his request, not three ministers as
at previous summits, but five.
</P>
<P>
After his dazzling election win, this will be the first
international outing for the second Aznar administration and he
will be keen to put on a good show.
</P>
<P>
Topping the agenda of the bilateral talks will be the fight
against organized crime, which was not originally slated.
</P>
<P>
Italy is expected to address the problem of the hundreds of
Italian Mafiosi and other criminals who, according to Italian
prosecutors and judges, are prevented from being extradited
because of fine legal distinctions.
</P>
<P>
Italian sources cited by the Madrid daily El Pais say there are
over 1,000 Italian criminals, including most wanted Mafiosi, who
have found a "golden refuge" in Spain.
</P>
<P>
But Madrid judicial sources have claimed the numbers are much
lower and the reason for extradition refusals is the lack of
guarantee that the criminals will receive a fresh trial in Italy.
</P>
<P>
On Europe, the two countries have similar positions on the
Intergovernmental Conference, enlargement, the euro, and Balkan
policy, Italian diplomats say.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Maintain Focus on Technology, Customers As Appeal Proceeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft said it will appeal
immediately after U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson made
the ruling Wednesday that the software giant should be broken into
two companies.
</P>
<P>
"We will be appealing this decision, and we have a very strong
case on appeal," Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said in a
videotaped response. The appeal would be filed within "a very few
days," the company said, and it could tie up the case for two or
more years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the breakup, Jackson imposed restrictions on
Microsoft's business practices that go into effect in 90 days
unless an appeals court blocks the action.
</P>
<P>
"Today's ruling represents an unwarranted and unjustified
intrusion into the software marketplace," Gates said. "The ruling
says to creators of intellectual property that the government can
take away what you've created if it proves too popular."
</P>
<P>
Gates said Microsoft is confident that the judicial system
would overturn Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers know that healthy competition in the software
industry is delivering great products, low prices and rapid
innovation," he said. "And consumers know that Microsoft's efforts
to drive the Windows platform forward have helped to make personal
computers easier to use and more versatile."
</P>
<P>
The company said its appeal would focus on legal and factual
errors in the District Court ruling, as well as procedural
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
"We have built a solid legal record, and we are confident the
judicial system will ultimately agree that our actions were
completely lawful and that they resulted in more rapid innovation
and better choices for consumer," said Microsoft general counsel
William Neukom.
</P>
<P>
The case pitted Microsoft against the U.S. Justice Department
and attorneys generals from 19 U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
Over the two-year trial of the antitrust case, American tech
executives, lawmakers and ordinary consumers have taken sides
cheering or condemning the government's attacks on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft backers argue that the company has fueled the rapid
growth of the industry by creating a widely accepted standard
operating system. Detractors acknowledge that benefit but fault
Microsoft for ruthlessly crushing competition and ultimately
reducing consumer choice.

WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
condemned a bombing that took place earlier in the day and killed
at least 21 people in Sri Lanka, saying it was a "barbarous
terrorist bombing."
</P>
<P>
"The United States strongly supports the territorial integrity

Reeker said this was terrorist method which "has been used
frequently in the past by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam."
