<HEADLINE> Arab League Urged to Help Stop Turkish Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday called for
intervention by the Arab League to pressure Turkey to halt its
military incursion into its territories.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, Iraqi Deputy Premier Tareq Aziz denounced the
repeated Turkish troops' military operations in northern Iraq as
violation of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called on the chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum to
interfere in the issue to urge Turkish withdrawal of its troops
from the Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently entered northern Iraq over the recent
three years in an attempt to wipe out the rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), who took shelter there.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On September 28, more than 5,000 Turkish troops, backed by
aircraft and tanks, crossed into northern Iraq to attack the
militants.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Monday denounced the latest Turkish incursion
as violation of Iraq's territorial integrity and called on Turkey
to pull back troops from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the message delivered by Iraqi permanent representative to
the league Sultan el-Shawi, Aziz asked Abdel-Meguid to help "stop
Turkey's aggression on Iraq," which he said contradicts the
relations of good neighborhood, the principles of the
international law and the United Nations Charter.

<HEADLINE> Ailing Tanzanian Leader Nyerere Escapes Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian founding
President Julius Kambarage Nyerere has overcome the critical stage
after experiencing another relapse Thursday night, an official
statement said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors treating him at the St. Thomas' Hospital in London
Friday described his condition as stable although he is still in
high fever, his jaundice complications increase and his kidney is
becoming weak.
</P>
<P>
His lungs can take the oxygen much more efficiently and the
support systems are working well, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctors, some elderly patients take a long
time to awake and they intend to perform appropriate brain tests
on the revered patient no matter he shows signs of waking up or
not.
</P>
<P>
The doctors also confirmed that his heart is still working and
strong.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 77, was diagnosed with chronic leukemia last year and
was hospitalized two weeks ago. He was transferred to the
intensive care unit on October 1 after some of his internal organs
started to weaken.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere is revered as the founding father of Tanzania. He led
the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in 1961 and
masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks since 1996.

<HEADLINE> German Businessman Acquitted of Adultery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- German national Helmut Hofer
jailed in Iran for about two years was acquitted of adultery
Saturday for insufficient proof, Tehran Justice Department
announced in a press release.
</P>
<P>
But the German businessman was found guilty of illicit
relations with an Iranian woman, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to pay 100 million rials (about 33,000
U.S. dollars) in fine in lieu of flogging, which is the normal
statutory punishment for that offense in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The press release also said that Hofer still stands additional
charges for which he would be tried at competent courts later. But
it did not mention the charges against Hofer.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September 1997 for illegal sexual
relations with an Iranian woman and was sentenced to death in
January 1998. Iranian laws prohibit affairs between a non-Muslim
man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer argued that he had converted to Islam before
having an affair with the Iranian woman. The death sentence was
then rejected by Iran's Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial.
</P>
<P>
He was released on bail in April, but was again put behind
bars in August after being accused of having contacts with foreign
elements.

KHARTOUM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's ruling National
Conference party on Saturday unanimously nominate the sitting
president, Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, as its candidate in the
coming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,000 members of the National Conference attended
the meeting which made the decision, the Sudanese News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also elected al-Bashir chairman of party, and
Hassan Abdulla al-Turabi, the parliament speaker, its secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
The party members also endorsed the amended party manifesto at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Despite reports on differences between al-Bashir and al-Turabi
over al-Bashir's chairmanship of the party, the two leaders are
"an inseparable unified entity," according to al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
The discussion and approval of the party manifesto was delayed
in order to secure a consensus among the party members, informed
sources of the party said.
</P>
<P>
The National Conference stressed in the general session that
the ruling party is now opening door to all Sudanese. Political
analysts here pointed out that this move aimed at rallying more
support for the ruling party to encounter a strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
Al-Turabi said the party was being unified to bring together
people all walks of life on a single track.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Turkey to Take Steps to Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece Saturday called on Turkey
to take specific moves to improve the relations between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a visiting Cypriot youth delegation here Saturday,
Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister Christos Rokofyllos said that
a better climate in Greece's relations with Turkey should be
accompanied by specific moves on the part of Ankara in order to
attain real progress, the Greek Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Inactions did not solve problems, Rokofyllos said, adding that
only initiatives, movement and the use of international interest
could create opportunities and offer ways out.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
A good climate in relations between Greece and Turkey have been
created following the recent two powerful earthquakes which hit
the two countries, and Greece has since softened its stance on
Turkey's accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Greece supported Turkey's European
orientation if Ankara conformed to European values of democracy,
justice, human rights, minorities and respect for international
law.
</P>
<P>
He noted that part of Turkey's commitment in order to approach
the EU would also be a substantive contribution to resolution of
the problem of Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem stated Saturday his rejection to British justice decision
about Chilean lifetime senator Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Menem said the decision that granted Pinochet's extradition to
Spain violates the territoriality principle with the intervention
of Spanish and British judges in Chile's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"By all means I am not defending Pinochet, but Spain's judicial
power has not any kind of basis to act in this manner," said the
Argentine president.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to establish once for all a legislation with
the agreement of all the countries of the world on this matter" to
prevent any judge from committing true disasters."
</P>
<P>
He said that with this standard, anywhere in the world where
there are victims, a judge could demand the presence of U.S.
President Bill Clinton, or of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

MADRID, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Navy decided that the
"Esmeralda" school ship, now in the Mediterranean Sea, should

diplomatic sources said on Saturday.

The school ship, that has visited the Canary Island on many

<HEADLINE> Sudan Lauds Egypt's Decision to Deport Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudan Saturday lauded Egypt's
decision to deport two members of an opposition group accused of
involvement in bombing a Sudanese oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's decision to expel Abdel-Rahman Saeed and Abdel Aziz
Khaled "mirrors its keenness on helping preserve Sudan's unity and
its wealth," Sudanese Ambassador in Cairo Ahmed Abdel Halim said
after a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Saeed is the spokesman of the National Democratic Alliance
(NDA) and Khaled heads the military wing of the group, which
comprises southern Sudanese rebels and northern Muslim
parties. The NDA has set up an office in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place in the town of Atbara, 300 kilometers
northeast of Khartoum on September 20, temporarily interrupting
oil flow through the 1,610-kilometer pipeline to Port Sudan. The
NDA has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Moussa denounced the bombing and Sudan formally requested Egypt
to extradite Saeed for trial at the end of last month. Egypt,
which did not announce when it expatriates Saeed and Khaled,
obviously did not meet the demand of its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan became tense in 1995
after Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination
attempt on President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In the recent two years, the two Arab countries are striving to
normalize the bilateral relations by issuing positive statements
and taking concrete steps, including exchanging visits by senior
officials.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Nuke Pact Critical to America's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Saturday that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is
critical to the security and future of all Americans and the
Senate must pass it.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton again urged the Senate to
delay the vote after admitting that there are not enough votes for
the approval of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on whether to ratify
the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine a world in which more and more countries obtain
nuclear weapons in more and more destructive varieties. That may
be the single greatest threat to our children's future," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"And the single best way to reduce it is to stop other
countries from testing nuclear explosives in the first place.
That's exactly what the test ban treaty will do," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that "the test ban treaty gives us our
best chance to control this threat."
</P>
<P>
The treaty has been signed by 154 countries and ratified by 21
countries. It takes effect only after it is ratified by all 44
members of the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Senate to postpone the vote. "A week is not
enough time for an issue of this profound importance. That's why
I've said I want to see the vote postponed, so we can have a
thorough debate that addresses all the legitimate concerns."
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are high. If our Senate rejected this treaty
outright it would be the first time the Senate has rejected a
treaty since the Treaty of Versailles, which established the
League of Nations after World War I.
</P>
<P>
"If our Senate rejected this treaty it would be a dangerous
U-turn away from our role as the world's leader against the spread
of nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
He also argues for the reliability of the treaty, citing that
32 American Nobel Prize-winning physicists and other leading
scientists said America doesn't need to test more nuclear weapons
to keep a safe and reliable nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
"After all, we stopped testing back in 1992. And now we are
spending four and a half billion dollars a year on proven programs
using our advanced technology to maintain a superior nuclear force
without testing," Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's about preventing other countries from nuclear testing,
about constraining nuclear weapons developments around the world
at a time when we have an overwhelming advantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he promised to the Senate that the
United States will withdraw from the treaty if its national
security needs more nuclear tests in the future.

BAGHDAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry Saturday
criticized the U.S. and British representatives at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking contracts it signed with
foreign companies under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry said in a statement
that the U.S. and British envoys at the Sanctions Committee
suspended nine new contracts during the committee's sessions held
on September 29-30 and October 1.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said those blocked contracts included four
signed in the fifth phase and five in the sixth phase of the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
He added that those contracts were signed with companies from
Germany, France, Jordan, India, Belgium and Lebanon for the
purchases of medical appliances, electricity generators,
laboratory materials and oil and electricity spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Ministry of
Defense is currently restructuring its technology arm so as to
maintain the technological edge of the Singapore Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense Tony Tan Keng
Yam made the revelation in his addenda to the President S. R.
Nathan's address at the opening of the second session of the
Ninth Parliament on October 4, 1999. The addenda were released by
the government Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the Singapore Armed Forces will harness technology as
a force multiplier to maintain its strategic edge and his ministry
is currently restructuring its technology arm, the Defense
Technology Group or DTG.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will allow the ministry to concentrate on
giving strategic direction while devolving the other functions to
a new statutory board called the Defense Science and Technology
Agency or DSTA, Tan added.
</P>
<P>
Tan emphasized that the restructuring, which will be completed
by April 1, 2000, will enable his ministry to better anticipate,
respond to and exploit the future trends and challenges in the
technology sector in order to maintain the technological edge of
the Singapore Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that a strong defense is the best guarantee of
Singapore's survival, security and continued success, Tan reminded
Singaporeans that they cannot take their peace and security for
granted and must make the armed forces vigilant, ready and able to
face the new security challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
After President Nathan made his maiden President's Address,
which highlighted the policy of his government, ministers of the
cabinet have presented their addenda to the president's address to

<HEADLINE> Child Sexual Abuse Rages in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Child abuse, especially child
sexual abuse, is rising alarmingly in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Republic
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a Child Abuse Awareness Campaign organized
here by the National Movement of Catholic Students (NMCS), Chihuri
called on the whole society to seek solutions to the rising cases
of child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most disturbing aspect is that most of the
abusers are people who are known to the child victims and who are
supposed to offer protection to the most vulnerable members of the
society.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that most of the cases have gone unreported
and thousands of victims keep quiet about their abuse, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner condemned customs and practices within some
sects of society which tend to promote child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
"For example, under our African customary law, there is no age
limit below which marriage cannot be contracted," he said, adding
that some religious sects also practice the bad habit of marrying
off young girls to much older men of the sect.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with the raging AIDS pandemic, nearly half
of the sexual assaults are perpetrated against children under 16
years.
</P>
<P>
In tackling the problem, Zimbabwe has introduced laws to
protect children and is working closely with member states of the
International Criminal Police to combat child prostitution and
pornography, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the Zimbabwe Republic Police, he said, has introduced
victim friendly units which offer professional support to victims
of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
"We have also embarked on outreach programs in schools to
educate children on how they can help themselves to avert becoming
victims," he said, adding the police are also in touch with
hospital staff so that they would bring to their attention cases
of child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's campaign against child abuse was part of a
nation-wide awareness event and involved marches at major centers
across the country.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Hit Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Two earthquakes hit Greece
Saturday, but no damage or injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The first tremor measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale rocked the
Greek capital of Athens before 1 a.m. local time Saturday, with
its epicenter being in the Mount Parnitha region, some 20
kilometers northwest of Athens, the Athens Observatory's
Geodynamic Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The second quake registering 4.5 on the Richter scale occurred
on Saturday afternoon in the Gulf of Corinth. The epicenter in the
western Gulf was situated 150 kilometers northwest of Athens, in
waters off the town of Egio in northern Peloponnesos, southwestern
Greece.
</P>
<P>
On September 7, a powerful earthquake measuring 5.9 on the
Richter scale hit Athens and its epicenter was in the Mount
Parnitha region.
</P>
<P>
A total of 143 people were killed and more than 2,000 injured
and some 60,000 left homeless in the earthquake, which is
estimated to cost Greece more than 200 billion drachmas (about 645
million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> AL Slams Intensified Israeli Settlements in Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Saturday
denounced Israel's recent decision to intensify its settlements in
the Golan Heights the Jewish state captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Israeli decision as illegal, Ahmed Ben Helei,
assistant secretary general of the league, said in a statement
that it violates the United Nations Charter and the relevant U.N.
Security Council resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
It also violates a recent U.N. General Assembly resolution
which describes as null and void the Israeli decision to annex the
heights, Helei said.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced on Friday that it will continue granting tax
breaks and subsidies to Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights
it seized from Syria. About 17,000 Israelis have settled in 33
communities in the strategic plateau since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at the Israeli decision, saying it harmed
the efforts aimed at reviving the peace talks. Damascus even
threatened to shut the door before all mediations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision contradicts the proclaimed readiness of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to resume peace negotiations
with Syria, Helei said.
</P>
<P>
The official of the 22-nation pan-Arab organization urged Barak
to restart the talks on the Syrian track from where they were left
off in l996.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were suspended in early 1996
after a series of suicide bombings in Israel. Now leaders of the
two countries have said they are interested in resuming them.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiations have yet to materialize due to disputes
over the future of the heights. Syria insists that the re-start of
the talks be based on a promise by late Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin that Israel would withdraw the entire plateau.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, has denied that there was such a promise.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 9 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister
Alain Richard arrived in the Saudi capital Riyadh Saturday for a
two-day visit to boost bilateral defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
French diplomatic sources in Riyadh said Richard will hold
extensive talks with his Saudi counterpart Prince Sultan Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on defense cooperation, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the London-based Arabic daily Asharq
Al-Awsat before his visit, Richard said Paris hopes to sell
French-made IFCIFRC tanks to Saudi Arabia, underlining "equipping
the Saudi army with the French tanks would give a new boost for
cooperation" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The French sources said Richard and Sultan will also discuss
the situation in the Gulf region and the current international
efforts aimed at solving the Iraqi problem.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council are currently holding contacts in order to reach a new
consensus on how to deal with Iraq, and possible suspension of
U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad following its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also cover the latest development of the
peace process on the Israeli-Palestinian track and the current
efforts employed to revive the negotiations on the Israeli-Syrian
and Israeli-Lebanese tracks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Saudi defense chief will visit
Paris early November for talks with French leaders on a number of
issues of mutual interest and means to promote bilateral relations
in political, economic and defense fields.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Balanced IT Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has called for more balanced development of information
technology between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Three days from now, the world's population will pass the six
billion mark. Five out of those six billion live in developing
countries," Annan said here Saturday at the opening ceremony of
Telecom 99 + Interactive 99. "For many of them, the great
scientific and technical achievements of our era might as well be
taking place on another planet."
</P>
<P>
"These people lack many things: jobs, shelter, food, health
care and drinkable water," he pointed out. "Today, being cut off
from basic telecommunications services is a hardship almost as
acute as these other deprivations, and may indeed reduce the
chances of finding remedies to them."
</P>
<P>
A quarter of all countries have not yet achieved even a basic
level of access to telecommunications -- a teledensity of 1, or 1
telephone for every 100 people, said the UN chief. Half the
world's people have never made or received a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
"My fear is that we are adding a new divide to the already
well-entrenched one between rich and poor: a digital divide
between the information-rich and the information-poor," Annan told
the audience from governments and the IT industry.
</P>
<P>
"Access is crucial," he stressed. "The capacity to receive,
download and share information through electronic networks, the
freedom to communicate freely across national boundaries -- these
must become realities for all people."
</P>
<P>
The event organized by the International Telecommunication
Union has attracted nearly 1200 exhibitors around the world to
Palexpo in Geneva with 22 countries setting up their national
pavilions. High on the agenda at this year's show from October 10
to 17 will be the huge growth and influence of mobile
communications and the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Flaws in Britain's Rail Network Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Railtrack, the company
responsible for track safety on Britain's railways, has withheld
information from passengers showing how it has secretly classified
a series of potential disaster black-spots.
</P>
<P>
Internal Railtrack documents obtained by The Sunday Times
newspaper revealed that senior company bosses have identified a
number of high-risk junction incidents as potential death traps
after near-miss collisions.
</P>
<P>
Railtrack's latest internal safety performance report shows
that the areas where the highest risk or "grade four" incidents
have occurred are at Ardwick in Manchester, Harrow and Wealdstone
in north London, York and Southhampton.
</P>
<P>
All of these locations are identified as being of greater
danger than Paddington, where a Thames Train on Tuesday passed a
red light and collided with an InterCity 125 express, killing
dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
The paper said data recovered from the train's black box showed
the driver of the Thames train did slow down as he approached a
yellow warning signal and prepared the train to stop at the
signal. However, for some reason he then accelerated and pass
through the red light.
</P>
<P>
So far, 30 bodies have been recovered. Latest reports said the
death toll is expected to reach at least 40.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott announced that a team of safety inspectors would
begin an urgent inquiry into Railtrack's role ensuring the safety
of the rail network. Whitehall sources said that ministers were
preparing to strip Railtrack of its responsibility for safety.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Government to Seek Pinochet's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government
announced Saturday it will present to British authorities
humanitarian and international political reasons to get the release
of its former military ruler Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"We have explained to the British authorities our juridical
logic, because we think we are right in matters of international
law," said Chilean Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes in
statements to national television.
</P>
<P>
"We have said that Pinochet, 83, detained in house arrest in
London since October 16 of last year, is in no condition to stand
a trial that will last two years," said Valdes.
</P>
<P>
A London judge authorized Friday Pinochet's extradition to
Spain, where a Spanish judge wants to try him for crimes against
humanity committed during his 1973-1990 military regime in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Valdes said he trusts that British Home Secretary Jack Straw
will grant Pinochet's release for humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government said it will sue Spain before the The
Hague International Court of Justice because of the Pinochet case.
</P>
<P>
The Pinochet defense did not counter immediately the judge
decision, because it is studying the strategy for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
British judge Ronald Bartle said in his decision that
Pinochet's extradition to Spain for the 34 counts of torture and
one of criminal association to commit torture presented by Spanish
magistrate Baltasar Garzon fulfilled all legal requisites.

TIANJIN, China, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The partisan spectators
were excited and the Chinese men's team was doing well.
</P>
<P>
Roosted for by the local crowd, the host gymnasts, heavily
favored for the team title, lived up to the expectation with well-
executed routines, collecting a runaway 230.546 total points to
lead the qualifiers of the 34th world championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China's men's squad, three-straight-time world champions, well
executed their tricks to invite waves of ovation from the stands.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Huang Yubin was satisfied with his students'
performance though they met problems with judging.
</P>
<P>
"They are true to their form. The only regret is Li Xiaopeng
who didn't qualify for the floors finals for some errors in
executing routines, for this is his specialty," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's piled up big early lead in the wake of their
women counterparts' failure to make the top three which included
Romania, Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine men's team finished second on a total of 224.322 points,
followed by the Germans with 224.245.
</P>
<P>
Romania, whose women's side stamped superiority in earlier
women's qualifier, placed fourth with 223.831 points, ahead of
Spain and France.
</P>
<P>
With a flying start made on both women's and men's sides,
Ukraine's coach Oleg Ostapenko kept calmness throughout the
dramatic competition, saying this was just the beginning of a big
fight.
</P>
<P>
"Well, the competition is over, our team performed well and
there is still a lot ahead. It is better to keep cool and watch
what happens next," he said.
</P>
<P>
Six more groups competition will be held on Monday as China's
arch rival Russia attempts to take over the host team.

<HEADLINE> New Survey Rules for Overseas Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Overseas individuals and
organizations that fail to obey a mid-November deadline for new
rules on conducting surveys in China will be "handled seriously,"
and their agents in the country will not be granted a license for
conducting such surveys, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to an NBS news release, the new rules prohibit
overseas individuals and organizations from directly conducting
surveys in China. They must entrust licensed agents in the country
to carry out these surveys and have the surveys approved
beforehand. The survey results should be examined before they are
handed over.
</P>
<P>
The NBS promulgated the provisional regulations on social
surveys involving overseas organizations on August 15.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are not designed to restrict normal conduct of
social surveys by overseas individuals and organizations, but to
regulate the organizing style and legitimacy of such surveys, an
NBS official said.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will not affect normal conduct of surveys by
overseas investors in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there have been incidents of surveys being
used against the national security and public interests, and false
data have sometimes damaged the interests of the consignor.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the survey industry that involves
overseas interests has developed rapidly in China. Survey agents
include enterprises, non-profit institutions, social groups and
non-government institutions. The surveys cover every part of the
country, and involve all aspects of the political, economic,
cultural and social life of China.
</P>
<P>
The NBS official said that overseas-funded enterprises in China
are still allowed to directly conduct surveys on products and
services within the scope of their legitimate operation.
</P>
<P>
Since they have always relied on agents in China to conduct
marketing surveys in the fields outside their operational scope,
the new regulations will not affect their activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, 2000, relevant departments will review the
qualification of these survey agents, and will issue licenses to
those passing the appraisal.
</P>
<P>
The NBS official said that during the transition to the new
rules, overseas individuals and organizations have to report for
approval of their surveys in China by November 15.

</P>
<P>
But two minutes later, Li, China's ace striker, equalized on a
scrambled goal. He found the ball kindly rebounded to his feet in
a melee in the box, and made no mistake from a blank-point range.
</P>
<P>
Li scored again in the 24th minute, this time on a corner, to
put the home side 2-1 ahead.
</P>
<P>
A quarter into the second half, China substituted Wang Peng for
Zhang Yuning, a towering striker who appeared sluggish on the
waterlogged pitch. At the same time, the jaded left midfielder
Huang Yong was replaced by Zhang Xiaorui, a playmaker who now
sports a bald-shaved head.
</P>
<P>
Keyed by Zhang, China stepped up their attacks and created
several scoring chances, but all in vain before Bahrain's tight
defense.
</P>
<P>
China's coach Bobby Houghton said he was pleased to see his
players could quickly shake off the disappointment ensued after
they conceded a goal.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough start as we were one goal down," the Englishman
said. "But our players quickly walk out of the disappointment and
hit in two goals."
</P>
<P>
Salman Sahreddh, Bahrain's coach, blamed his team' inability to
adapt to Shanghai's drizzly weather.
</P>
<P>
"This is a close match and we can't adapt ourselves to the
humid circumstances here," he said. "We hope we will offer a
satisfactory play against China when they visit us next time."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Protests to Israel Over Hebron Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Ambassador to
Israel Omar Rifai lodged a protest to the Israeli foreign ministry
on Sunday over the way a Jordanian parliamentary delegation was
treated by Israeli security forces and Jewish settlers in Hebron,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The protest said the Jordanian delegation, led by Speaker of
the House of Representatives (lower house) Abdu Hadi Majali, was
humiliated Saturday in Hebron by Israeli security forces and
Jewish settlers there, urging Israel to take steps to prevent such
incidents from happening again.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member delegation had planned to pray at the Ibrahim
Mosque in Hebron, the last stop of their four-day visit to the
Palestinian territories, but turned back when Israeli security
forces demanded that they pass through metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
On leaving, they were heckled by about 15 Jewish settlers who
shouted in Arabic "Abu Jihad is dead," referring to the military
chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) who was
assassinated in 1988 in an operation widely attributed to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers pushed the settlers away and Majali's
bodyguard rushed him into his black Mercedes. Several settlers
followed Majali, surrounded his car and banged on it with their
fists.
</P>
<P>
At that point, local Palestinian residents began scuffling with
the settlers and Israeli security forces. Three Palestinians were
detained by Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Majali reportedly said that Jordan's trust in the
peace process has been shaken by the incident.
</P>
<P>
Majali added that he believed the settlers has targeted his
group because they do not like the close relationship between
Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has given a different version of the incident,
saying that the delegation did not contact Israeli authorities
about the visit to the mosque.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 Jewish families living under heavy protection of
Israeli troops in Hebron, the Palestinian-controlled city in
southern West Bank with a population of 130,000.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Underlines Reform of State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
called on all parties concerned to redouble their efforts to speed
up the reform and development of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Ending a three-day inspection trip to the northern city of
Tianjin today, Jiang urged Party and government officials and
workers in the SOEs to reflect on the decisions made at the Fourth
Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, which was held three weeks ago, and carry out the
spirit of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"China has made great progress in its socialist modernization
drive, which has laid a solid ground for further development,"
Jiang said, "but there is still a long way ahead and we face a
heavy task."
</P>
<P>
He said that as China is building a socialist market economy,
the state sector will have a good opportunity to grow, while at
the same time it faces a number of new conditions and problems.
</P>
<P>
Both the central and local governments as well as enterprises
themselves should take a vigorous action to find ways and solve
the problems in line with law of economy and market demand, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked officials and managers to pay close attention to
market changes, learn more about modern science, finance and
management so as to improve the operation of SOEs, enhance quality
of their products and make them more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the Party plenum has made important decisions
on reform and development of state-owned enterprises, which should
be implemented to the letter by governments at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Being confronted with the new conditions in developing a
socialist market economy, state-owned enterprises must tighten
their management, improve product quality, renovate their
technology, strengthen marketing and establish a new management
system conforming to the needs of the market, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three days, Jiang visited a number of enterprises
in Tianjin, one of the country's industrial bases. He also
inspected a community service center and stressed the importance
of improving urban management.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Unity Among Anti-Israeli Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday underlined the need for solidarity and unity
among all groups and countries opposing Israel in order to
realize "the common goal."
</P>
<P>
Receiving Hassan Nasrollah, secretary general of Lebanon's
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and members of the movement's central
council, Khatami said that "freedom of Qods (Jerusalem) is our
common goal and we should not let aliens hatch plots to sow
discord among us."
</P>
<P>
Terming Hezbollah as a group "defending freedom, Islamic and
Arabic dignity of the occupied land (Israel)," he called on the
group to continue its activities with more patience in order to
achieve its goal while preserving its unity.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also called for solidarity among all
anti-Israeli forces and groups in Lebanon and their cooperation
with the Lebanese government, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nasrollah and his delegation came here to attend celebrations
marking the 100th birth anniversary of the late Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been leading a guerrilla war
trying to oust the Israeli troops from south Lebanon,
where Israel carved up in 1985 a self-styled "security zone" with
the claimed aim of protecting its northern territories from
cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Food Safety Checks Disclose Substandard Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Food safety inspection workers
in China have discovered a number of everyday foods failing to
meet state standards.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health (MOH), which is responsible for food
safety supervision, said today that during the latest inspection,
some products were found to be contaminated by microorganisms or
pesticides, even though more than 80 percent of the sampled food
passed the strict test.
</P>
<P>
Out of 85 kinds of food collected from Beijing markets, some
tea products were found containing the heavy metal lead and DDT, a
type of pesticide, while some instant noodle products were
contaminated by the bacteria coliform, according to an MOH report.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide action also disclosed evidence of fraud by some
dealers of tonics which claim to have curative powers they do not
have.
</P>
<P>
Seven brands out of 46 health foods tested illegally
exaggerated their functions and applications, said the report.
</P>
<P>
China enforced a regulation on the management of tonics in 1996,
prohibiting businesses from claiming or suggesting these products
have healing functions.
</P>
<P>
"We have urged relevant public health administrations to deal
with those substandard products. The MOH will even ban the tonic
food dealers if they continue to violate the regulation," said an
official with the MOH's department of health legal affairs and
supervision.

<HEADLINE> Late Premier Zhou Enlai's Work on Forestry Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held in the
Great Hall of the People today to celebrate the publication of the
late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's work on forestry.
</P>
<P>
The book is a collection of 73 of Zhou's articles, speeches,
instructions, letters and documents on China's forestry. Most of
them are going public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
As the first premier of New China, Zhou took a special interest
in the development of the country's forestry. During his 26 years
as premier, Zhou wrote extensively on many major issues concerning
China's forestry.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dezhan, chairman of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs
Committee of the National People's Congress, said that to study
Zhou's thoughts on forestry will help to further establish
forestry's major role in ecological environmental development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the publication of the book will encourage the
people of the country to support the cause of forestry build-up.
</P>
<P>
The book was jointly compiled by the State Forestry
Administration and the Party Literature Research Center of the
Chinese Communist Party of China.

<HEADLINE> Confucianism Enriches World Civilization, Overseas Scholars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Overseas scholars attending an
ongoing conference marking Confucius' 2,550th birthday agree that
Confucianism enriches the world's philosophical debate and makes a
great contribution to civilization.
</P>
<P>
Reginald Little, of Bond University in Australia, said that
Confucianism "demonstrates a sense of traditional values,
community cohesion and a capacity for rapid economic and
technological transformation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that ideas on managing change are a part of the
Confucian tradition, and are highlighted in several of the classic
philosophical writings.
</P>
<P>
Tong Yun-kai, from the Hong Kong Confucian Institute, said that
Confucianism is the major component of the traditional cultures of
both China and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Missionaries in the late 16th century introduced the philosophy
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Confucianist classics have been translated into many foreign
languages. And Confucius took the top spot among the world's ten
greatest thinkers in a U.S. edition of "World's Who's Who", which
was published in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Tong said that the finest ideas from Confucianism will stand
the test of time, and are applicable anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Its idea of harmony could help reconcile conflicts between
existing civilizations," he said.

Thomas Metzger of the Hoover Institute at Stanford University
said Chinese scholars, who pay close attention to academic areas
of interest in the West, are more open-minded, Metzger said.
</P>
<P>
Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who is also honorary
chairman of the International Confucian Association, said in a
written speech, "The Confucian instinct of placing the community
above self, for instance, was amply demonstrated at the height of
the economic crisis in the Republic of Korea, when South Koreans
queued up to donate gold jewelry and knick-knacks to save the
country from bankruptcy."
</P>
<P>
While this gesture did not solve ROK's massive economic
problems, outsiders viewed the South Koreans as "a close and
resilient community," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
As the region begins to recover from the effects of the Asian
financial crisis, Confucian values of hard work, thrift, sacrifice
for the future, respect for education and learning have helped
Confucianist countries to recover sooner than they would have
otherwise, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Join Efforts in Building Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Sunday called on all Kenyans to work together to build a
strong and united nation.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the turbulence around us, Kenyans have continued
to enjoy unrivaled peace and stability," Moi said in capital
Nairobi on the occasion of the 21st Moi Day which falls on October
10.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to Kenyan citizens to work hard to increase
productivity in all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The success of Kenya's newly-launched economic recovery plan
will depend on joint efforts by all citizens, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
While farmers and factory workers strive to redouble their
efforts in boosting productivity, public sector employees must be
dedicated to their duty and give honest and efficient services,
Moi said.
</P>
<P>
"Moi Day provides an opportunity for Kenyans to reflect on the
challenges of nation-building", Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Moi Day, now a public holiday, is designed to mark the day when
Moi took power 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Noting many problems such as weak economic performance, high
poverty levels and serious unemployment that the east African
country is still facing, Moi assured the audience that the
eradication of poverty and the creation of more jobs remain a
priority concern of his government.
</P>
<P>
He said Kenya, as one of the developing countries, is aware of
what it is in terms of its economic status.
</P>
<P>
The president unnamingly accused some foreign countries of
interfering in other countries' internal affairs, stressing that
Kenya has never criticized other countries.

<HEADLINE> AFC to Strengthen Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The executive committee of
the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Sunday decided to
strengthen the organization at its meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The meeting chaired by AFC President Sultan Ahmad Shah decided
that Peter Velappan will stay on as the AFC General Secretary
until the year 2002 in the face of speculation that he would quit
the post next May, AFC said in a press release here.
</P>
<P>
This is because Velappan has been appointed by FIFA as the
chief coordinator for the 2002 South Korea-Japan World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful to the committee and the president. I am honored
and as you know after 22 years, it's not my intention to just
leave the AFC without a successor. In the next three years, I hope
I will groom a successor and establish a highly competent
secretariat," Velappan told a press conference after the AFC
executive committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee also decided to appoint a deputy
general secretary to assist him in running AFC's affairs,
providing him more time for the 2002 World Cup chief coordinator's
post, Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
The AFC will appoint the deputy general-secretary as soon as
possible, he said, adding the deputy will take over most of his
secretarial management.
</P>
<P>
He said "The candidate must be a high caliber person in order
to play a very important role in the administration and management
of the AFC secretariat."
</P>
<P>
Velappan said the manpower of the AFC secretariat would be
sized up from 16 to 32 next year and they would be divided into 10
divisions to enable them meet strong challenges in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Velappan has been appointed the AFC general secretary since
1978 and his term is supposed to expire at the AFC Congress
meeting in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AFC President Sultan Ahmad reportedly said Saturday:
"AFC must have a full time general-secretary and not one who is
always moving around as there is much to do in Asia".

<HEADLINE> Southern Safe Passage to Open Next Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) have agreed to open the southern safe
passage on October 17, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted government sources as saying that the
agreement was reached earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed here Tuesday an agreement on opening the
safe passage linking the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, after
solving all differences concerning the passage operations Monday
night. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat approved the agreement prior to its signing.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, all Palestinians and foreign visitors to
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank areas will be allowed to travel
between the two Palestinian territories across Israel.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage consists of two routes. Individuals will use
the Eretz-Tarkumiyah (near the West Bank city of Hebron) road
while the passage of goods will be allowed to take the
Karni-Tarkumiyah route.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians wishing to travel via the passage must apply to
the PNA. Once the applications are examined by the PNA, a list of
applicants will be transferred to Israel. Israel will return to
the PNA the approved list within two days.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians wishing to cross the passage on private vehicles
must attach their driver's license, vehicle registration and
insurance policy to their applications. Israel will examine the
applications before returning them to the PNA within five days.
</P>
<P>
Those Palestinians denied entry into Israel will approach the
passage from the Palestinian regulation station, where they will
undergo a security check and depart for the passage on a bus
escorted by police. At their destination, they will be re-checked.
</P>
<P>
Under the Interim Agreement signed in 1993, all those using
the passage route will be subject to the laws of Israel, and law
enforcement will remain the responsibility of Israeli police.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli team on
final-status negotiations with the Palestinians will be formed
soon, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his cabinet on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the cabinet on the peace talks with the Palestinians
over the opening of the southern safe passage linking Gaza Strip
and the West Bank and the release of Palestinian prisoners, Barak
said he will name the Israeli team this week.
</P>
<P>
He told the cabinet ministers that the peace process on the
Israeli-Palestinian track is moving ahead, but that with Syria
has not been re-started.
</P>
<P>
He said the Syrian side has not responded to his initiatives
for reopening the talks, partly due to the fact that Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa is hospitalized in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Whether the peace talks with Syria make progress or not, the
prime minister said he will pull out Israeli troops from south
Lebanon next July.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh peace deal reached by the two sides
in September, Israel and the Palestinians launched their
final-status talks on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has already named its negotiating team
headed by Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo, but the Israeli
side till now has not finalized the team list.
</P>
<P>
The release of Palestinian prisoners was originally slated for
Friday, but was postponed by Israel due to its dispute with the
Palestinian side on who should be freed.
</P>
<P>
Under the new peace deal, the two sides should reach a
framework agreement on final-status by next February and a full
lasting peace accord Next September.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have to solve such thorny issues as the status of
Jerusalem, return of Palestinian refugees, the Jewish settlements
in occupied territories and Palestinian-Israeli borders, during
the final-status talks.

</P>
<P>
Deiss will visit South Africa at the invitation of his South
African counterpart Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the South African
Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Deiss, also Swiss Federal Councillor, will be accompanied by a

Agency for Development and Cooperation and the State Secretariat
for Economic Affairs, and members of the Swiss media.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Prime Minister Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai said he had raised the issue of Bhutanese
refugees during the 54th U.N. session not to internationalize the
issue but to inform the member countries about the problem Nepal
is facing.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said this on his return here from the 54th U.N.
session Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he wished to inform the participating
countries about the difficulties Nepal has in resolving the issue
and the grievances the refugees are facing.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been living in eight
U.N.-run refugee camps in eastern Nepal since they were evicted
from Bhutan around the 1990s. Eight rounds of ministerial level
talks have so far failed to repatriate the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said that on his way back he visited the United
Kingdom and discussed with British Prime Minister Tony Blair about
the lifting of pensions for Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Blair had agreed to increase the salary and pensions according
the British soldiers, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 450,000 Nepali soldiers had fought for Britain during the
first and second World Wars, and 3,000 soldiers are still serving
in the British army. After retirement, a Nepali soldier gets only
32 dollars for pension per month, while his British counterpart
gets 760 dollars per month.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's army on Sunday
marked the 50th anniversary of its founding here with a massive
military parade amid tight security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parade, President Chandrika Kumaratunga highly
commended the army for its contribution towards safeguarding the
national unity and territorial integrity by fighting the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 soldiers and officers marched towards Colombo's
seafront Galle Face Green for President Kumaratunga, who is the
commander-in-chief, as thousands of soldiers and police sealed off
the venue.
</P>
<P>
Navy craft patrolled the waters of the Indian Ocean while roads
leading to the venue were open only for invitees.
</P>
<P>
Among the invitees were Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, Bangladeshi Chief of Army Chief Lt. Gen.
Muhammad Mustafizur Rahman and Indian Vice Chief of Army Staff Lt.
Gen. Chandra Shakhar.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the 50th anniversary celebration, security has
been tightened in the capital of Colombo as dozens of checkpoints
had been set up and more than 50 suspected LTTE guerrillas had
been held to ensure the success of the parade.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the Sri Lankan army has developed into
a professional force after a baptism of fire during the last
16-year-old war against the LTTE rebels who demand a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew today told a conference marking the 2,550th birthday of
Confucius that the core values of Confucianism will help foster a
sound society characterized by harmonious relationships within
families, and between families and government.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who is also honorary chairman of the International
Confucian Association (ICA), was speaking at the ongoing
commemoration meeting and the Second Congress of the ICA.
</P>
<P>
"With quantum leaps in telecommunications and innovations in
information technology like the Internet, the world has become a
much smaller place," Lee said. "Physical distance, time
differences and national borders are no longer barriers to the
free flow of information."
</P>
<P>
He said that this trend will alter the nature of societies, and
"transform the way we live, learn, work and use leisure time."
</P>
<P>
The IT phenomenon can bring profound changes to long-
established social norms, such as its impact on the relationship
between parents and children, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Confucianism places importance on the "Wulun" -- five
relationships -- between ruler and subject, husband and wife,
father and son, brothers and sisters, and between friends, he said.
</P>
<P>
Confucianism, which has prevailed in the orient for hundreds of
years, values benevolence, dignity, diligence, thrift, sacrifice
for the future, and respect for education and learning.

"For better or for worse," he said, "we have to seize the
opportunities offered by the IT revolution, but try to minimize
its harmful side effects."
</P>
<P>
He said young Chinese must grow up with "strong, well-tested
core values, like the importance of family bonds."
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that the Asian financial crisis provided the
West with the opportunity to point to the weaknesses of Asian
value systems, including Confucian values.
</P>
<P>
"However, Confucianist traditions which have withstood the test
of 2,550 years, have proved once again that they are still
relevant in this day and age," he said.
</P>
<P>
Born in 551 B.C. in what is now Qufu, in east China's Shandong
Province, Confucius organized a large-scale education system and
gradually formed his ideology, which greatly influences China and
many other Asian nations.

Nigerian Minister of State for Communications Alhaji Elewi said

The lines will be made up of two million fixed lines and five
million mobile telephone services, the Guardian newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By the time the lines are available, the telephone lines in the
most populous African country would be increased to an acceptable
level and in conformity with what obtains in advanced countries of
the world, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said telephone is a necessity particularly in Nigeria where
it can be used to frustrate the activities of social miscreants
who hide under the cover of lack of telecommunications facilities
to operate freely.
</P>
<P>
"Telecommunications is also important in rural communities
especially in places where there are no good roads that ease
movement of goods and services," he added.

"goods listed in the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement are exempted
from customs duties, with no other fees levied except a 13 percent
sales tax."

Nigeria visit focusing on economic reforms in the country, media
reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
If Nigeria continues its socio-economic reform, "I am
optimistic that the creditors will be favorably disposed to the
calls" made by the country to magnanimously cancel its
29-billion-dollar external debts, New Nigerian newspaper Sunday
quoted Wolfensohn as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wolfensohn also urged Olusegun Obasanjo's government
to focus on poverty alleviation, prudent use of resources and
anti-corruption, the Punch newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the World Bank chief signed a deal with
Nigeria on behalf of the International Finance Corporation to
advise on the restructuring of state-owned Nigeria Airways ahead
of its planned privatization.
</P>
<P>
He met most of the high-ranking officials of the Nigerian
government and visited the World Bank sponsored projects in
Nigerian capital Abuja, commercial hub Lagos, and northern city
Cano.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank official described the bank chief's Nigeria tour
as very successful. Wolfensohn left Abuja Saturday for a visit to
South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Returned Students Gain Contracts at High-tech Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Chinese
returned students snatched a business transaction value worth 2.1
billion yuan at the First China High-tech Fair, which closed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Daxi, chairman of Chinese Association for Science and
Business (CASB), said the fair gave the group a good opportunity
to serve the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our technology would yield good results in China and
we will bring more new technologies back to the motherland in
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IPPS computer uninterrupted power source system and smart
technology developed by Zheng Xueguang and Guan Chuquan, two
returned students who studied in Canada, obtained orders with a
total value of 60 million U.S. dollars at the fair.
</P>
<P>
The CASB signed a letter of intent with an investment company
in Shenzhen on establishing a Sino-American science venture
supporting high-tech development by Chinese students living abroad.
The first phase is to cost an investment of 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The CASB also signed a contract with the Great China
International Investment Groups Ltd. on forming a worldwide
medical corporation.
</P>
<P>
Over 140 returned students from a dozen countries brought to

<HEADLINE> UK May Strip Railtrack Company of Safety Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government may take
away safety powers from the company that hitherto takes charge of
Britain's railway safety after last Tuesday's train crash that
claimed at least 40 lives, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
Railtrack, which owns and operates the infrastructure including
tracks and stations, could lose its role as safety inspector
because this appeared to conflict with the company's commercial
interests, a Reuters report quoted the sources as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for safety reportedly could be taken by an
independent regulator as opposed to reverting to the government,
but these were among details still to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion seemed to follow a meeting on Saturday between
Prime Minister Tony Blair and senior rail figures about last week'
s crash in which one of the trains exploded into a fireball.
</P>
<P>
British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who is also
secretary for environment and transport, announced after the
meeting that the government-run Health and Safety Executive had
recommended stripping Railtrack of safety role.
</P>
<P>
But a Railtrack spokesman was quoted as saying the company had
not been informed that the government planned to strip it of its
safety role. He noted that Railtrack decision against installing
the Automatic Train Protection system which could have prevented
the disaster was taken in 1995 when it was still a nationalised
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's accident has sparked fury in Britain with calls for
immediate safety improvements to the creaking railway system, and
demands for resignations of rail bosses, along with a debate as to
whether the railway industry should be re-nationalised.

<HEADLINE> EU, S. Africa Fail to Reach Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled signing
ceremony of a free trade accord between the European Union and
South Africa would not be materialized because the two sides
failed to solve certain problems.
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Matti Ahtisaari has cancelled his trip to
South Africa next week during which he was to sign the free-trade
agreement, the South African Press Association reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, designed to sweep away barriers to more than 90
percent of the trade of the two parties, will liberalize about 86
percent of EU imports to South Africa over 12 years, retaining
protection on some items, including automotive components and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Finnish source as citing "complications in
the final phase of trade accord" as the reason for cancelling the
trip, which had been scheduled to begin in Pretoria Monday.
</P>
<P>
As Finland holds the EU presidency, Finnish president is
required to sign the agreement with his South African counterpart
Thabo Mbeki. Ahtisaari, however, will send his Foreign
Ministry Secretary Jukka Valtasaari to Pretoria Monday instead in
order to observe the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary signing of the long-negotiated free trade
agreement was concluded last March, and the final formality was
set for October 11. The deregulation was to take effect January
1.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation was due to failure by the 15 EU countries and
South Africa to reach agreement on the designation of certain wine
and spirits exported from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Portugal, supported by France, Greece and Italy, have
demanded that South Africa be prohibited from using the names
"sherry" and "port" on its exported strong wines. In return for
abandoning those labels, Pretoria would receive an export quota
for its wines and also aid in restructuring its vineyards.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, backed by several more, required a written
confirmation from South Africa that it would comply, but South
Africa has up until the eve of the signing not been willing to
take the final step.
</P>
<P>
And the European group said they would not sign Monday if they
did not have the requested South African compliance in written
form in hand by Monday morning.

<P>

</P>
<P>

are a good channel for increasing mutual understanding and
friendship between the two countries and their armed forces.

<P>
He noted that China and Australia are two influential nations
in the Asian-Pacific Region, and that developing friendly
cooperative relations is in the basic interest of the two peoples.

two armies have conducted frequent two-way visits and built up
mutual trust.
</P>
<P>

the peace and development in the region.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> American Gymnastics Expects Magnificent Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Though Magnificent Seven has
distanced themselves from the gym, American gymnastics is sending
a signal that a Magnificent Six is in the making.
</P>
<P>
The Magnificent Seven, who pushed American gymnastics to a new
high with an Olympic gold medal in their home ground in 1996, have
been bygone with six of them retired and Dominique Moceanu
skipping the event to nurse her injury.
</P>
<P>
Among the six girls for the 34th world championships which
kicked off on Friday here, there are only two world championship
veterans.
</P>
<P>
But the Americans, who placed fifth after the women's qualifier
on Sunday, voiced their dream for glory although they had rated
themselves a long shot for medals.
</P>
<P>
"I definitely want a medal," said Vanessa Atler, a 17-year-old
girl who entered the finals in individual all-round and floor. "I
will try my best."
</P>
<P>
Atler's teammate Kristen Maloney said they felt pretty good
about it and they still can do better in the following competition.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have thing that we can do better-go in tomorrow and
work on it - and hopefully we can come back stronger the next day,
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority was coming in with the team and doing
strong and hopefully getting a medal contention for Worlds and
then to focus on the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Not only gymnasts are dreaming of color medals, but also the
coaching staff who look forward to the finals with confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the performance. Although we struggled a
little (in the qualifier), we still have time to work out. We will
be fine in the days to come," said women's team head coach Hill
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the aim for the 2000 Olympics, the coach said
without hesitation: "To win the gold of course."
</P>
<P>
It is not only a pep talk as the country has developed its
gymnastics on an effective program although this is a country
taking great fancy to action-packed sports such as basketball,
football and ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
Colarossi Bob, head of the American delegation, said that
gymnastics actually has begun to gain ground in America and
gymnastics has gained more exposure than ever.
</P>
<P>
"National Broadcasting Corporation will broadcast our
competition. The reason they do that is that people have quite a
lot of interest in the sports," Bob said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, who boasts 3,600 clubs and 85,000
competitive athletes who registered in the U.S. Gymnastics
Federation, will have a bright future for gymnastics, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have a broad and basic program. The government supports us
financially and physically, and we select athletes from very young
children. We also have training camps for our national team. " Bob
said.
</P>
<P>
Maloney think there will be a big fight to make the Olympic
team for there is so great depth in their country.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think we have a very deep team...I think there is
going to be a real dog-fight to get on the Olympic team. I think
we will field the top three team," Maloney said.

<HEADLINE> China Raises Gold Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, the
nation's central bank, announced that both the purchasing and
selling prices of gold on the domestic market will be raised
effective today.
</P>
<P>
According to bank officials, the adjustments have been made in
accordance with the price changes on international gold market.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing price of gold will increase by 21.89 percent to
85.20 yuan (10.26 U.S. dollars) per gram from the current level of
69.90 yuan per gram. The selling price will be up 21.88 percent,
from the former 71.30 yuan per gram to 86.90 yuan per gram.

<P>
The central bank has lowered gold prices three times before, in
a move to narrow the gap between domestic and international market
prices.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the use of price controls to adjust
gold prices is actually a way of adapting gold prices to the
market, and that this will have a good effect on the gold industry
and state-owned gold businesses in particular.

<HEADLINE> China Red Cross Offers 200,000-U.S. Dollar Donation to Taiwan Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of China
(RCSC) today announced it has supplemented its aid to Taiwan
earthquake victims with a 200,000 U.S. dollar donation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the RCSC said that the just-pledged relief funds,
following offerings of 100,000 U.S. dollars and 500,000 yuan-worth
of relief materials extended soon after the massive quake on
September 21, has been sent to the Red Cross organization of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The strong earthquake and aftershocks have so far claimed more
than 2,200 lives and destroyed thousands of homes on the island.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed the willingness of the Chinese Red
Cross to provide aid to Taiwan, saying that two RCSC medical teams
composed of epidemic-prevention and rehabilitation experts are
ready to head for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the situation of the disaster in Taiwan,
and have established hotlines to receive donations, prepared for
relief materials and organized medical teams," he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Witnesses Flourishing of High-Tech Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 900 new high-tech
ventures settled down in the Beijing Zhongguancun Science and
Technology Park in August, half of which are engaged in software
development.
</P>
<P>
This means that the park has become the country's most brisk
high-tech development zone in terms of new ventures, according to
today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the number of newly established high-tech
ventures in Zhongguancun in June and July increased by 243 percent
and 385 percent, respectively, from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, quite a number of high-tech ventures from
other provinces and municipalities have rushed to open branches in
Zhongguancun.
</P>
<P>
The State Council decided in June this year to speed up the
building of the Zhongguancun park with Chinese characteristics and
demanded the park become a model for the country's high-tech
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the development plan, the Zhongguancun park is to
strive to rank among world first rate science and technology park
in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The park will focus on electronics information, biological
engineering, new pharmaceuticals, new materials, environmental
protection and some other high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
China has established 53 high-tech development zones with a
number of over 15,000 ventures and the Zhongguancun park has
registered over 5,000 of them.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Output Expected to Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce
slightly less grain and cotton this year than last year, but more
oil seeds, vegetables, fruits and aquatic products, says an
official report on the government efforts to streamline the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the report released by the Ministry of Agriculture,
China's summer grain and early rice output increased 5.5 million
tons from last year, but autumn grain output will be lower, mainly
due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Since this summer, droughts and high temperature hit
northwestern and northern regions, while rainy days and low
temperature prevailed in the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze River as well as southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The planned cut in grain acreage is another factor for the drop
of grain output, the report says. In recent years, China has
stepped up efforts to readjust its agricultural product mix and to
this end, the government abandoned the protective price for poor
quality grain early this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a drop in output of cotton, sugar and
tobacco is also projected as the acreage of these crops has been
reduced, with cotton output sliding some ten percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the acreage of oil-bearing crops and vegetables
increased 800,00 hectares and one million hectares, respectively,
with their output expected to grow nine percent and 3.9 percent on
an annual basis. The output of fruits is likely to chalk up 9.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China's township enterprises have
maintained the momentum of steady growth so far this year. From
January to August, they reported a total output value added of 1,
621.3 billion yuan, up 16.8 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the average cash income of farmers
reached 998 yuan, up 2.1 percent year on year, or 4.7 percent in
the real terms. The farmers' net income this year is expected to
almost the same as last year, the report says.
</P>
<P>
However, farmers still have to pay heavy taxes and various
kinds of fees, which increased 3.8 percent for the first half this
year. And the ministry has called on authorities in all localities
to take vigorous measures to alleviate the farmers' burden.

<HEADLINE> FINA Approves Full-body Swimsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Swimmers will be allowed to race
in full-length bodysuits after a ruling by the sport's world
governing body said the suits did not break its rules.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) said in a
statement issued at its Lausanne headquarters on Saturday that its
executive bureau, meeting in Kuwait, had on Friday approved the
use of the suits.
</P>
<P>
The "long john" suits cover everything apart from head, hands
and feet.
</P>
<P>
FINA had invited the sportswear companies Adidas and Speedo to
present their respective reports on the research, design and other
aspects of the suits.
</P>
<P>
"The FINA Bureau ruled that the use of these swimsuits does not
constitute a violation of the FINA Rules. The Bureau leaves up to
the swimmers the choice of their swimsuits," the FINA statement
said.
</P>
<P>
British swimmer Paul Palmer wore an Adidas full-length bodysuit
and won the 400 meters freestyle event at this year's European
championships in Istanbul in July.
</P>
<P>
He became the first swimmer in the world to wear the suit in
competition at the Commonwealth Games trials in Sheffield, England,
in July last year.
</P>
<P>
FINA also said it would send a delegation to China in December
to investigate and advise on an anti-doping program established
with the Chinese Swimming Association.
</P>
<P>
FINA said it had established a commission with representatives
from various continents to unify rules on doping applied by
regional organizations. The commission's proposals are to be
presented to FINA's pre-Olympic general congress in Sydney next
September.
</P>
<P>
The world governing body called on its member federations to
improve the distribution of information on their doping programs "
to avoid misunderstanding and diffusion of misleading information
in their own countries".

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Needs More Competitive Accountants, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If better placed, the two kinds of professions would ensure
efforts towards resuscitating the economy bear the right fruits,
Vice-President Omar Ali Juma said in capital Dar es Salaam
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Juma made the remarks when he awarded certificates to 221
accountants and auditors at the 21st graduation ceremony of the
National Board of Accountants and Auditors.
</P>
<P>
"Accountants and auditors can play an instrumental role in
assisting members of the public on how they can get access to
funds for business undertakings for their own well being," mass
media quoted the vice- president as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is endowed with vast natural resources which, if
utilized properly, would propel the country into higher heights of
development," Juma added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president pointed out that the accountants and
auditors could effectively assist the government in fighting
graft, theft, embezzlement and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
But unfortunately, he said, although Tanzania required a total
of 2,815 accountants, at the moment it has only 1,550.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore imperative to ensure the big gap that exists
presently is sealed so that the nation could fulfil its
development obligations in various fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
Juma called on the National Board of Accountants and Auditors
to ensure that the necessary professional standards were
maintained.
</P>
<P>
The dire need for more professionals should not be an excuse
for producing half-baked personnel, the vice-president stressed.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Asks Indians to Be Prepared for Hard Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sunday
asked Indians to be prepared for "hard" decisions while seeking
"constructive cooperation" from opposition parties in tackling the
issues facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his re-election as leader of the BJP parliamentary
party, Vajpayee said that the BJP had widened its reach and people
had given a clear-cut mandate as sought by the National Democratic
Alliance (NDA) following the defeat in the Lok Sabha by a single
vote.
</P>
<P>
The results put on the NDA a greater responsibility and people
are not prepared to wait longer for development and their
upliftment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new government will make all efforts to
fulfill the program laid out in the National Agenda for Governance
and that the NDA was not just a political entity but also
representative of all areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The NDA was committed to the upliftment of the weaker sections
of society as well as those areas which have been neglected, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the manner in which his government was brought
down had left a "deep imprint" in the minds of the "people who
wanted us to complete our full tenure in office."
</P>
<P>
"Now the people have given us an opportunity to complete the
unfinished task and therefore it was imperative for us to work
hard towards meeting these aspirations," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Home Minister L. K. Advani, Vajpayee is scheduled
to be sworn in as prime minister on October 13.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Second Private EPZ Starts in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Sunday laid the foundation stone of the country's second
private export processing zone (EPZ) in southeastern Chittagong
district, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong Industrial Park Limited at Rangunia, some 30
kilometers from the port city Chittagong, will be built at a cost
of 540 million U.S. dollars and provide modern infrastructural
facilities such as hotel, hospital, bank, golf course, jetty and
container yards and a recreational center.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all investors to take all the special government
incentives for the private EPZ... We will extend all possible
assistance," Hasina said at the ground-breaking ceremony of the
EPZ, which begins its operation with 10 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure the continued progress of local industries
and under the policy we have been providing all facilities to
promote the private sector. It is a matter of hope that taking the
advantage of our policy, a strong and organized private sector is
emerging gradually," she said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the EPZ, which is to be constructed initially on
47 hectares of land on the northern bank of the Karnaphuli River
and would later be extended to 405 hectares, would accommodate
agro-based and information technology units on priority basis.
</P>
<P>
The EPZ would house 80 small and 20 large units and create a
direct employment for 50,000 people and indirectly provide
livelihood to 120,000 people, they said.
</P>
<P>
The 100 percent export-oriented industries would establish a
link to Myanmar, the seven northeastern states of India, Bhutan
and Nepal, according to Qayoom Chowdhury, managing director of the
Chittagong Industrial Park Limited.
</P>
<P>
The first private EPZ, a Korean export processing zone, is
being constructed on the other side of the Karnaphuli River.
</P>
<P>
There are two EPZs in the country at present, one in the
capital city Dhaka and the other in Chittagong, employing more
than 81,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ITU, World Telecommunications Exhibition and Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) was founded in Paris in 1865 as the
International Telegraph Union.
</P>
<P>
The organization took its present name in 1934 and became a
specialized agency of the United Nations in 1947. It moved to
Geneva from its previous headquarters in the Swiss capital of Bern
in 1948.
</P>
<P>
As of May 1999, the ITU comprised 188 member states and 560
sector members (scientific and industrial companies, public and
private operators, broadcasters, regional/international
organizations), making the ITU the largest and most influential
telecommunications organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1971, the World Telecommunications Exhibition and Forum
has become the leading telecommunications event worldwide,
organized on a four-year cycle. It is also known as the Olympics
of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 event from October 10 to 17 in Geneva's Palexpo,
Telecom 99+Interactive 99, has attracted nearly 1,200 exhibitors,
compared with less than 300 exhibitors in 1971. This year's theme
is the "third generation of personal mobility and the Internet."
</P>
<P>
The sizable exhibitions by major manufacturers and service
providers offer an opportunity to evaluate the market, as well as
for competitors to see what others are doing.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Stresses Stand on Not Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has said that he would only step aside from the ruling party
Kenyan African National Union (Kanu) if he was sure the country
was peaceful and stable.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Nation quoted Moi as saying that it would be morally
wrong for him to leave the political scene when the situation was
precarious and gloomy.
</P>
<P>
His interest was to leave a legacy of peace and ensure a stable
future for prosperity, Moi said at a high-school fund-raising
function Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"No one should assume I will retire until there is unity and
prosperity in Kanu. Where would I be going to leave these
children suffering?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that although he was happy with the
cooperation between Kanu and some opposition parties, Kanu was
the only party with a national outlook that would lead the east
African country to further development.
</P>
<P>
Moi also dismissed the democracy preached by the Western world
to Africa as destructive, claiming that foreign donors had been
dashing out money to the opposition and non-governmental
organizations to destabilize the continent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years opposition leaders have strongly demanded
President Moi' s resignation after his current term expires in the
year 2002 or even earlier. Moi has expressed his intention to
step down after 2002.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poll Results Send Indian Stocks Historic High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A comfortable majority for
the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the 13th Lok
Sabha (House of the People) elections has sent market averages to
a historic high on the bourses last week.
</P>
<P>
An astonishing performance by software and pharma shares during
the current rally lifted the BSE-30 share sensitive index on the
Bomby Stock Market to breach the magical 5,000-mark and zoomed
further to an all-time high of 5,091.24 on the last day of the
week.
</P>
<P>
The bullish fervor got a further fillip when the International
Rating Agency, Moody's, upgraded India's Ba2 sovereign rating
outlook from stable to positive on foreign and domestic currency
debt.
</P>
<P>
Bull operators and speculators greeted the clear majority for
the NDA by a frenzied buying spree, and with local funds and
Foreign Institutional Investors also joining the buying bandwagon,
share values virtually hit the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The euphoria in the market was of such high pitch that the
announcement of a 40 percent hike in diesel prices took a
backseat.
</P>
<P>
Equities opened the week higher but later surrendered the early
gains on selling by operators as they were not satisfied by a
simple majority given to the NDA by a major exit poll telecast by
the Development and Research Services.
</P>
<P>
After news of the NDA getting a clear majority, the Sensex
zoomed by over 265 points in a single session on Thursday, making
it the seventh largest jump in the history of the BSE and the
first after it gained 344.76 points on May 13, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Sensex also crossed the previous high of 4,965.79 recorded
on August 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index moved in a very wide range of 5,091.24
and 4,627.04 before closing the week at 4,981.74 against last
weekend's close of 4,702.31, displaying a hefty gain of 279.43
points or 5.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts expect a substantial increase in the inflow of
portfolio funds if the new government could create a sense of
political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the markets are not on the path of roses from here,
perceivable bullish trend may continue for at least a couple of
weeks, traders said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Output Cuts Unchanged: Iranian Oil Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has respected its pledged cuts in
September, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said in a
press release on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
OPEC member countries' rate of compliance with their pledged
cuts for the month of September 1999 has remained unchanged as the
previous month, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh, also chairman of the OPEC ministerial monitoring
sub-committee, said that the price declines in recent days can
only be attributed to activities in the markets.
</P>
<P>
The price decline can in no way be attributed to reduced
compliance by OPEC for the month of September as some reports
have suggested, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The recent price development indicates that the decisions of
OPEC to maintain its production ceiling at least up to end of
March 2000 was correct and it further shows that we are yet to
achieve a stable market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also confirming Iran's full compliance, Zanganeh said that the
high spirit of cooperation and responsibility which persists among
OPEC member countries ensures continued implementation of their
pledged cuts up to at least end of March 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister noted that OPEC would even extend its
current production ceiling beyond March 2000 if the fundamental
of the market warrants.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: High-Tech Projects Need Injection of Venture Capital (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Venture capital is the most
often mentioned phrase at the week-long China High-Tech Fair held
in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
A Tianjin-based entrepreneur rushed to the fair with company
brochures printed in both English and Chinese. "I hope I can find
an overseas venture capital fund which will not only provide my
company with needy credit, but also lead us to the international
capital market," said the entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
Patrick McGovern, President of IDG, which has been active in
China's high-tech investment market, said his company planned to
increase IDG's investment in China to one billion U.S. dollars, as
he predicts the returns of the ventures in China is very high.
</P>
<P>
Su Chichong, General Secretary of Taiwan Venture Investment
Association, said he sees signs that the Chinese mainland will
become a paradise of venture investors in the next century.
</P>
<P>
With the worldwide acknowledgment of knowledge-based economy,
competition of national strength has evolved into one that tests
comprehensive strength of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
However, China's competitiveness in science and technology lags
far behind its economic growth. Statistics show that China ranked
the seventh in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product)
in 1996, but the country's competitiveness of science and
technology fell from the 23rd place in 1994 to the 28th in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the reason to the fact that science and
technology has not been transferred into productivity fast enough.
</P>
<P>
The application rate of China's patented technologies is around
ten percent, and the proportion of scientific research results
being turned into commodities and producing benefits of scale is
less than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many scientific professionals have had to place their research
results on the shelves for having difficulty in finding venture
capital to finance their projects. A great number of small and
medium-sized high-tech companies also have been shut down in the
middle of the development process because of a shortage of funds.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian, Palestinian Legislatures to Join Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Parliament and the
Palestinian Legislative Council have agreed to set up a joint
committee to address issues of common concern in the Middle East
peace process, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The move was apparently part of the efforts by the two sides to
coordinate positions for the upcoming final status talks between
Israel and the Palestinians, particularly with regards to the
Jerusalem issue, refugees and water sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during the just-concluded visit to the
Palestinian self-rule areas by a Jordanian parliamentary
delegation headed by Speaker of the Lower House Abdu Hadi Majali,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, Majali held talks with Palestinian
officials and parliamentarians and listened to complaints by the
Palestinians about Israel's malpractices and Judaizing measures in
the Holy City, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued at the end of the visit reiterated
Jordan's support for the Palestinians in their struggle for an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It also condemned Israel's violations of the Palestinian
rights, the expansion of Jewish settlements in occupied
territories and attempts to Judaize Arab Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, and Amman has
been trying to narrow the differences between Israel and the
Palestinians to promote the peace process in the region.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Fine Chemical Industry Park to Be Built in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Fine Chemical
Industry Park will be built in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu
Province, at a cost of more than 100 million U.S. dollars,
according to an agreement signed here recently.
</P>
<P>
The first project in the new industry park will be a 58-million-
dollar expansion project launched by the Jintong Petrochemical Co.,
Ltd., a joint venture between the Taiwan Hetong Chemical Company
and the local Jinling Petrochemical Company.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the expansion project, Jintong will be
able to produce 172,000 tons of alkylbenzene a year, adding
Nanjing's total annual alkylbenzene production capacity to nearly
300,000 tons, the second largest in the world, according to
company officials.
</P>
<P>
The 53-hectare park will be built in the Nanjing Cross-Straits
Science and Industry Park, which was launched last year and now
embraces more than 670 enterprises, including over 30 Taiwan
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Big multinationals like Sharp of Japan, LG of the Republic of
Korea and Philips of the Netherlands have also set up ventures in
the science park.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: High-Tech Projects Need Injection of Venture Capital (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Establishment of a sound venture capital mechanism is necessary
to help get China's research results out of the lab and onto the
market. Small and medium-sized high-tech companies will benefit a
lot from such measures.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of factor, experts say venture capital is a
combination of non-governmental capital fund and governmental
policy support. In the process, it is necessary to encourage the
enthusiasm of non-governmental investors, and the government
should take such tilted measures as providing subsidies and tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
China has insufficient venture capital, so the country's listed
companies have played a leading role in this regard. Statistics
show that listed Chinese companies pumped in about seven billion
yuan into high-tech businesses in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Formation of the venture capital mechanism requires relaxed and
practical policies regarding laws, systems of finance, accounting
and taxation so that multiple funds may enter venture capital
market.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to have a capital organizational form
which accords with common legal and investment practices, a
thorough channel to draw venture capital out when needed, as well
as an intermediary service setup. Risk-taking and innovative
spirit, trustworthiness in operations and the tradition to respect
personal value, rights and interest are also important for the
formation of the mechanism, experts point out.
</P>
<P>
Su Chichong warned that mainland should not fully copy the
experience from overseas in establishing the venture capital
mechanism, strong points should be given a play, with the
priorities going to industries bearing advantageous development
potentials.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, seven ministries of the State
Council, China's highest governing body, have been jointly working
on a draft entitled "opinions regarding establishment of venture
capital mechanism in China" which is expected to come out later
this year.
</P>
<P>
While hoping Chinese Government to build up a venture capital
mechanism compatible with the international practices soon and
creating a relaxed, favorable investment environment for investors,
John S. Wadsworth, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Asia
Limited, emphasized it is about the best time to make venture
investment in China.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Earnings from Coffee Export in Decline: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian coffee, nicknamed
"Green Gold", generated less foreign exchange in exports in its
1998 fiscal year as compared to the previous year, the Capital
weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's coffee export earnings decreased from 2.81 billion
birr (350 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 2.21 billion birr (275
million dollars) in 1998, declining by a rate of 24.5 percent, the
weekly quoted industrial sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The volume of Ethiopian coffee supplied to the world market
also fell by 16.7 percent, from 121,366 tons in 1997 to 101,000
tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The price of coffee per ton also dropped by nine percent from
23,070 birr (2,850 dollars) in 1997 to 20,990 birr (2,600 dollars)
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Surplus supply from the world's leading coffee producer Brazil
was attributed to the remarkable decline of coffee price in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the third largest coffee producer in Africa,
producing about 2.5 percent of the world's marketable coffee.
Coffee export accounts for around 60.5 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's coffee industry directly or indirectly provides
employment for about 25 percent of the population, according to
the industrial sources.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Villagers Demand Probe of VOA's Dumping of Toxic Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 3,000 villagers in central
Sri Lanka have demanded that the government carry out a full scale
inquiry into the alleged dumping of toxic waste by the Voice of
America (VOA) relay station in the island country, environmental
activists said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They said the waste brought in 10 large containers was first
dumped one month ago few meters away from a temple in the village
of Thaniwellagama, close to the VOA relay station in Iranawila,
140 kilometers southeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The dumping was carried out on September 10 under a written
agreement between the chief monk of the temple Ven. Wimalawansa
Thera and Marconi Communications Inc., the company involved in the
construction of the VOA relay station.
</P>
<P>
Two days later at least 12 pet dogs living around the temple
died and later four cows that had drunk water from a location
close to the dumping site also died, environmental activists
said.
</P>
<P>
People in the area have also begun to feel the side effects of
the waste. Several people were complaining of throat irritation,
swelling of joints, tearing and other complications.
</P>
<P>
Angry villagers have lodged protests against the dumping and
wanted to know what is contained in the waste matter which has
been dumped into the huge pit -- 100 feet long, 40 feet wide and
six feet deep.
</P>
<P>
According to the dumping company's report, the disposed waste
contains small quantities of arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium,
lead, mercury and selenium.
</P>
<P>
The activists and villagers said they had consulted the
government Analyst's Department and found that though the
chemicals were in small quantities, they could be harmful if the
process continued.
</P>
<P>
The VOA has been dumping the waste in the temple premises for
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and the U.S. embassy officials in Colombo
are not yet available to comment on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Visa to CNN Reporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The American Cable News
Network's famous correspondent Christina Amanpour has been denied
a visa because of remarks by her husband, the U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin, against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Amanpour applied for a visa at the Iranian Embassy in
London, but her application was turned down," an official from
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Tehran Times quoted the official as
saying that Amanpour was supposed to be in Tehran on October 13,
but she was recommended by Iranian officials not to go on with the
visit.
</P>
<P>
This was after her husband made threatening statements against
Iran, said the official in charge of press affairs, whose name
was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said on Tuesday that the U.S. had information, but no
proof, on Iran's role in the bomb attack on the U.S. military base
in Khobar, Saudi Arabia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Khobar explosion was the second deadly terrorist attack in
seven month in Saudi Arabia, killing 23 U.S. servicemen and
wounding 345 others.
</P>
<P>
Robin urged Iran to help in the probe of the Khobar case, but
warning that a conclusion of Iran's involvement in the bombing
case would leave Iran open to a U.S. response, including possible
U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times on Sunday slammed the U.S. and Israel for their
anti-Iran propaganda, saying that the U.S. raised the Khobar case
because Washington could not find fresh charges to bring up
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied any role in the Khobar case and refused to
cooperate with the U.S. in the investigation, saying that the case
was an internal affair of Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Plateau: Possible Cradle of Mankind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, October 10 (Xinhua)-- Cultural relics exhibited in the
newly opened Tibet Museum in Lhasa show that the Tibet Plateau in
southwest China and its surrounding areas might be one of the
cradles of mankind, some Chinese archaeologists say.
</P>
<P>
Collected from two historical sites in Qamdu and Lhasa of Tibet,
more than 160 cultural relics aged between 1,000 to 5,000 years
reveal the traces of Paleolithic human activities, they say.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits include weapons and tools made of stone, bone and
pottery, copper mirrors and arrowheads and carbonized grains
dating back to 5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Discoveries of five historical sites in north, west and central
Tibet indicate that people lived in many parts of Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau during the Paleolithic Period, including some high-
altitude areas where human activities have vanished, according to
the experts.

<HEADLINE> hke101015- Philippines to Cooperate with Earthquake-Prone Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is establishing
linkages with other earthquake-prone countries to provide
immediate mutual assistance in case of a major earthquake, a
senior official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said that these linkages should help offset the financial handicap
Philippine authorities face in conducting rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government plans to tap the experiences of
Filipino teams sent to help in the rescue efforts in other
earthquake communities such as Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who is also head of the National Disaster Coordinating
Council (NDCC), said that the NDCC will continue doing its best to
train citizens to prepare for earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Since a pre-dawn killer quake struck China's Taiwan Province on
September 21, the Philippine government has taken precautions to
minimize the damage to life and property in the event of an
earthquake hitting the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said that while his office faces a huge handicap in
terms of finance and equipment, there are enough people willing to
pitch in for rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that authorities have started conducting earthquake
drills and inspecting school buildings and other public structures
to make sure they can withstand earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists say that the Philippines is hit by an average of
six earthquakes every day but most are too weak to be felt.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy is leaving for Europe later Sunday for a three-day trip
to Belgium and Luxembourg, said the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Levy's trip will be highlighted by his meetings with a number
of foreign ministers of the European Union (EU) in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Levy is also scheduled to meet members of the EU Commission,
the executive arm of the 15-member EU.
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats in Europe are pinning high hopes on the trip,
which comes at a time when relations between Israel and the EU are
warming up, said a senior Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also on the heels of a successful trip by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to France and Germany in September, and most
particularly, after the replacement of the EU Commissioner for
international affairs, Manuel Marin, who was never well-liked in
Jerusalem, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be discussed include Israel's juice export to Europe;
customs tax rights for various Middle East countries, including
the question of customs duties on goods manufactured in the
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; and the ratification
by EU members of a wider cooperation agreement between Israel and
the EU, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A joint scientific agreement had been set into motion, but the
wider agreement was halted shortly after Benjamin Netanyahu was
elected Israeli Prime Minister in 1996 and France and Belgium held
back their ratifications of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Levy canceled his planned trip to Japan to attend the
Palestinian donors' conference.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has decided to attend the
conference, which is expected to discuss the main issues on
whether the donor countries have lived up to their promises
regarding funding for Palestinians, Israel's commitment to
transferring tax revenues to the Palestinian side and whether the
Palestinians are maintaining an adequate level of transparency
with regard to how the money is used.

<P>
SHENZHEN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- High-tech businesses in
Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone in the southern
coast, have made rapid progress in developing products with their
own intellectual property right in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 243 new and high technological projects presented by
companies based in Shenzhen at the six-day China Technology Fair,
which closed here today, about 90 percent enjoy intellectual
property right.
</P>

intellectual property right generated an output value of 28.78
billion U.S. dollars last year, accounting for 43.9 percent of the
total of the city's new and high-tech industrial sector.

<HEADLINE> Comprehensive Agro-Development in Qinghai Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A decade-long agricultural
development in Qinghai Province, northwest China, has enabled some
one million poor farmers and herdsmen of Han, Hui, Mongolian,
Tibetan and Sala nationalities to have a better life.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai provincial government invested 930 million yuan
over the past 10 years in building 135 agricultural projects in 30
counties and state farms.
</P>
<P>
The funds have been used in opening up 36,900 ha of farmland,
improving 80,000 ha of low-yield fields, building 38 irrigated
areas and transforming 140,000 ha of grazing land.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has built 13 reservoirs, 26 electric
pump stations, and an irrigation system with 4,660 kilometers of
ditches.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, half of the added grain and edible oil output in
Qinghai in the past few years came from the comprehensive
agricultural development, a provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the per capita income of local farmers rose by 477
yuan to 1,347 yuan and that of herdsmen went up by 500 yuan to 2,
300 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Fertilizer Subsidy Reaches 24.4m U.S. dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh will
have to spend more than 1.22 billion taka (about 24.4 million U.S.
dollars) to give price support to the purchase of imported
fertilize by the farmers this year, up from only 170 million taka
(about 3.4 million dollars) a year ago, The Financial Express
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The industries ministry estimated that it would need to import
500,000 tons of urea fertilizer during the year to meet local
demand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The total demand for fertilizer in the country during the year
will be around 2.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But the six fertilizer factories controlled by the Bangladesh
Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) aim to produce only 1.8
million tons, which will lead to a shortfall of 500,000 tons
during the year.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the industries ministry said the BCIC had to suffer
a loss of more than 1 billion taka (20 million dollars) each year
because of the selling of fertilizer at the subsidized rate.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Falls Below 2 Percent Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- After hovering a little over
the two percent mark for a couple of weeks, India's inflation
again dropped to 1.88 percent for the week ended September 25,
mainly on account of a decline in price of manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), declined by
0.14 percentage points to 1.88 percent from 2.02 percent in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the inflation rate was sharply higher at 8.84
percent during the same period last year due to a spurt in prices
of agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a record agricultural production this year, prices
have been ruling much below last year's levels.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, however, is expected to move up sharply in the next
couple of weeks due to the 40 percent hike in diesel price
effected this week.

KATHMANDU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- There has been no record of
any polio case in Nepal in the last two years, the Rising Nepal

</P>
<P>
Nepal is to organize the fourth National Immunization Day (NID)

The crippling disease can be prevented by giving oral
vaccination to children under the age of five.

Dr. Yadav said at a national seminar on NID Saturday that
public awareness was the best preventive measure Nepal can rely on
for health.

All of the 3,913 village development committees in Nepal are
being mobilized to spread awareness to the general public in rural
areas about NID and the polio elimination program.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's External Current Account Deficit Rises to 819m U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The external current account
deficit of Bangladesh, excluding grants, widened to 819 million
U.S. dollars in the 1998-99 fiscal year as compared to 520 million
dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit of the country increased by 519 million
dollars in 1998-99, The Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the latest review of macro-economic
indicators recently prepared by the International Monetary Fund as
saying that the country's overall exports rose by only 2.9 percent
in the 1998-99 fiscal year which is substantially less than the
growth performance in the preceding years.
</P>
<P>
The export growth was significantly negative in the first half
of the fiscal year, but strengthened to some extent in the second
half of the year, reflecting the modest upturn in industrial
activity.
</P>
<P>
Imports, on the other hand, have continued to increase in
recent months. Overall imports in July 1998-May 1999 period were
10.5 percent higher than those during the same period in the
previous year with buoyant food imports. Non-food items, however,
have remained slack.
</P>
<P>
According to the review, exports of garments and knitwear rose
by 6.3 percent over the year compared with the annual average of
about 22 percent in the previous two years. But exports of jute,
leather, tea and frozen food products declined substantially.
</P>
<P>
The review attributed the reasons to slow recovery in external
demand and in prices of major export items behind dismal
performances.
</P>
<P>
The recent deterioration in external competitiveness,
deficiencies in financial inter-mediation, power shortage and port
congestion also contributed substantially to the weak
performances.

<HEADLINE> Iliescu Voted as Candidate of Presidency for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Ion Iliescu, chairman of the
biggest opposition Romanian Social Democratic Party (SDP), was
voted unanimously as candidate of presidency for the year 2000 at
the party's National Congress Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Public surveys conducted over the past year have shown that
Iliescu, who had been presiding over the country since the
political upheaval in December 1989 till 1996 when he failed in
seeking for reelection, has got top public ratings together with
his party and his popularity has swollen in a steady manner.
</P>
<P>
The SPD's taking the lead in selecting a candidate one year
ahead of the general election attracted public attention. Analysts
here believe that the move kicked off the campaigns for the
election, which will take place at the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu and other SDP leaders posed themselves in the race by
stressing in reports read to the congress that only the SDP could
lead Romania out of economic difficulties and poverty.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australians Ponder Historic Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- With four weeks to go before
the November 6 republic referendum, the Australians are weighing
the country's last big choice in this century.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the constitutional monarchy or to choose a republic
as the political pattern, the voters will have a chance to shape
the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
The referendum question put before them is whether they approve
a "proposed law to alter the constitution to establish the
Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with the queen and
governor-general being replaced by a president appointed by a
two-thirds majority of the members of the commonwealth
parliament?"
</P>
<P>
In their hearts, most of the Australians are inclined to
support what they regard as a logical step in the nation's
progress - breaking the last link with the empire by substituting
an Australian president for the queen.
</P>
<P>
For example, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, also a
monarchist, does not think it appropriate for the queen to open
the 2000 Sydney Olympics, though it is an occasion which is
assiged by the Olympic rules to the head of state of the host
country.
</P>
<P>
Or, if he does, he realizes that most of the Australians would
not agree with him.
</P>
<P>
After five-year build-up that began when former prime minister
Paul Keating included his support for a republic in his 1993
election policy speech, the referendum was endorsed at the
Constitutional Convention in Canberra in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The convention, constituted by 152 delegates either directly
elected or appointed by the federal government, supported, in
principle, Australia becoming a republic.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that a referendum for change to a republic
or for the maintenance of the status quo be held in 1999. If the
referendum is in favor of a republic, the new republic will come
into effect on January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Parliament of Australia finalized the referendum question on
last August 12, a compromise between political parties, paving the
way to the referendum.
</P>
<P>
But the desire of the Australians does not definitely lead to a
republic. Becoming a republic involves altering the constitution.
Australians are very cautious constitutional reformers, and only
eight of 42 referendums to change the constitution in the
country's history have been successful.
</P>
<P>
At least in the past, the monarchists said, significant
opposition has spelt doom for a referendum proposal.
</P>
<P>
For the country's last referendum in this century, what is the
hot issue that really matters to the voters?
</P>
<P>
As the republic debate entered the final stage, the Australians
are focusing on the compromise republican model, which defines
that an Australian head of state will be appointed by a two-thirds
majority of the members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Those advocating a yes-vote believe that a century is long
enough to wait to have an Australian as head of state.
</P>
<P>
Those opposed have fallen into two camps: those who maintain if
the system is not broken, it does not need fixing, and those who
say the only real republic is one with a popularly or directly
elected president.
</P>
<P>
A special Newspoll survey, published in the Weekend Australian
newspaper on October 9, found that only 14 percent of the
Australian voters favor the "parliamentary-appointment" republican
model.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that an overwhelming majority of the
republicans and 50 percent of all voters still prefer a directly
elected presidency.
</P>
<P>
After all, they hope that the election of a president will be
their own business, and they are unhappy that politicians will
play king-maker.
</P>
<P>
It showed that the continued strong support for direct election
represents the main stumbling block for the success of the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Nick Minchin, the monarchist federal minister for
industry, science and resources, recently used the words of the
pro-republican federal Treasurer Peter Costello to push the case
against a republic.
</P>
<P>
At an address to a No Republic lunch in Sydney, Minchin said
Costello was right when he described the republican model as a
"flawed compromise."
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy
Kerry Jones said: "Many people will be dreadfully disappointed
when they wake up on November 7 and discover that they won't get
to vote for the president."
</P>
<P>
"We say the republicans haven't got the model right," she said.
</P>
<P>
Being aware that the republic model could backfire on the
republic itself, opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley called
on the Australians to look at the bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the country headed toward the end of the
century, there was a pressing need for an Australian head of
state.
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, with half of the voters favoring a president
elected by themselves, the challenge for the yes campaigners is
either to sway them against direct election or to persuade them to
believe that a yes-vote offers the best prospect of establishing
an elected system in the future.
</P>
<P>
In other words, seeking compromise is probably a workable way.
</P>
<P>
Republican campaign director Greg Barns believed that there
would be a dual focus to the yes campaign in the final month.
</P>
<P>
That is reinforcing the positive message about an Australian as
head of state and reassuring the voters that the model is "a safe
and workable proposal for a republic," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's "Yes" Committee Chairman Malcolm Turnbull said
there had been plenty of criticism of the proposed model, but that
if everybody waited for the perfect republican model, there would
never be a republic.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the yes camp Saturday launched its
advertising campaign, which will be followed by the no camp the
other day.
</P>
<P>
A yes camp television advertisement features ordinary
Australians saying "our history will always be linked to the
crown and the queen but they're not part of our future dream."
</P>
<P>
Looking at future, the Australians are approaching a crossroad.
Compromising or not, they will make their historic choice during
the forthcoming November 6 republic referendum.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Causes 277 Deaths in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 277 people were
confirmed dead in the flooding last week in central and south
Mexico but local press reports put the figure at 340.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry communique said Saturday 202 bodies have
been found in the most affected state of Puebla. The largest toll
was in the city of Teziutlan, where a hillock slide buried some 60
houses, killing at least 160 people.
</P>
<P>
The rains damaged 5,690 houses in Puebla, forcing some 500
families in Teziutlan to be relocated, and some 1,200 houses
rebuilt, it said.
</P>
<P>
More than 240,000 hectares of crops have suffered damage in
rural areas, and 90,000 agriculture producers and cattle raisers
have been affected by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The official death toll in Veracruz state is 72, but local
authorities said that it is difficult to know the exact figure
because of poor communications in many communities, where many
people are still stranded.
</P>
<P>
A total of 173 municipalities in the state have been affected
by the heavy rain, and only 80,000 out of 265,000 victims have
found shelter in some 444 sites, where temporary houses have been
built.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Zedillo has called several cabinet meetings
to evaluate the damage and give instructions for rescue work.
</P>
<P>
Authorities established operations of vigilance to prevent
rapine and looting, and they have started to supervise stores to
prevent storeowners from abusing the necessity of the people by
increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
A "state of natural disaster" has been declared in the State of
Puebla and in wide areas of the states of Hidalgo and Veracruz and
the federation government will allocate resources from special
funds to repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
The rains have also hit the states of Hidalgo and Oaxaca, where
thousands of people have been trapped because of road damages.
</P>
<P>
In Hidalgo, state authorities have reported three deaths, more
than 20,000 suffering damage and 15,000 stranded in isolated zones.

the reconstruction of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"Europe and the west have watched the Balkans passively for too

"We cannot repeat these mistakes, and we are here precisely in
order that they are not repeated," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Serbs should once again become

<HEADLINE> Twelve Squads Take Spots in Euro 2000 Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Twelve teams including world
champions France and reigning European champions Germany have
secured their places for the finals of the European Championships
which will be co-hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands next summer.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's qualifiers, including Italy, Romania, Yugoslavia and
Portugal, joined already-secured Norway, Sweden, Spain, the Czech
Republic and the finals co-hosts -- while seven of the eight teams
in the play-offs confirmed their places on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The seven names definitely going into the hat for Wednesday's
play-off draw taking place in Aachen in Germany, are Denmark,
Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine, England, Ireland and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The eighth country will be either Israel or Cyprus depending on
the outcome of Sunday's final group six matches between Spain and
Israel and Austria and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
But while all those countries are still involved, there was
heartbreak for Russia and Croatia -- the big losers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia were eliminated after allowing Ukraine to equalize three
minutes from time to force a 1-1 draw in their crunch group four
match in Moscow -- a result that meant Russia finished third
behind France and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Croatia also went out on an emotional night in Zagreb where
they allowed Yugoslavia to escape with a 2-2 draw, which was good
enough to see Yugoslavia take first place ahead of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, semi-finalists in last year's World Cup, finished
third.
</P>
<P>
The Irish were not happy either, but at least they survived to
fight another day.
</P>
<P>
They lost their automatic qualifying spot when Macedonia scored
in the last minute of their match in Skopje to force a 1-1 draw.
The victory, so tantalizingly close, would have seen Ireland into
the finals. Instead they are in Wednesday's draw.
</P>
<P>
In many ways the biggest winners of the day were France, who
avoided the humiliation of not qualifying for the European finals
just 15 months after winning the World Cup, with a 3-2 win over
Iceland in Paris.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time France had been top of group four in the
entire qualifying campaign but they needed a late winner from
substitute David Trezeguet to beat the Icelandic side who fought
back from 2-0 down to level at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
In Munich, reigning champions Germany edged out Turkey to win
group three after a 0-0 draw.
</P>
<P>
A win would have given the Turks first place but instead they
have the consolation of a place in the play-offs.
</P>
<P>
Italy also got the single point they needed to win group one
ahead of Denmark. They drew 0-0 with Belarus in Minsk. It wasn't
pretty but they weren't crying into their cappuccinos in Como.
</P>
<P>
Romania won group seven after a comfortable 3-0 win over
Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
Portugal qualified as best runners-up after their 3-0 win over
Hungary in Lisbon guaranteed them top spot among the nine runners-
up.
</P>
<P>
Among the eight teams included in the play-offs are England,
who scrapped through without kicking a ball on Saturday as Sweden
beat Poland 2-0 in Stockholm to round off their successful
campaign in Group Five.
</P>
<P>
Poland needed just a point to finish in second place ahead of
England, but failed to make any real impression on the Swedes who
won with a 64th minute goal from Kennet Andersson and a last
minute strike from Henrik Larsson.
</P>
<P>
Although it was a fateful day for many of the teams involved in
the championship, it was also a day of personal triumph for Bosnia
's Elvir Baljic who plays for Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
His was the outstanding individual performance of the day as he
scored all four goals in his team's 4-1 win over Estonia.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Has Sigh of Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan breathed a sigh of relief after Sweden helped England into
the Euro 2000 play-offs on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Swedes beat Poland 2-0 in Stockholm to make sure England
will be in the draw to decide the European Championship play-off
pairings in Germany on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A delighted Keegan, who had watched the game at Sunderland's
Stadium of Light where England play Belgium in a friendly on
Sunday, said: "I said before we should not be in this position
with the players we have. It's a reprieve ... like being found
guilty and waiting for the judge to pass sentence."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Sweden did fantastic for us. It was raining, and
the players had a problem controlling the ball.
</P>
<P>
"But the Swedes were resilient, giving nothing away. They have
done us proud.
</P>
<P>
"They did it professionally. I think football is the
straightest game in the world.
</P>
<P>
"They only had pride to play for. They went out and after a
difficult first half they did us so proud.
</P>
<P>
"We were all England managers today. We all wanted the result
to go our way. With the talent and players - it's a lovely mix of
youth and experience - we should do okay.
</P>
<P>
"I thought we might have to wait for two years before we had a
real game. But we have two play-off games now.
</P>
<P>
"We could look back at things that could have gone better. We
had to rely on Sweden, and they have done well for us all. We
have gone in through the back door. Who is to say we won't come
in through the front door at the European Championships?" he said.

<HEADLINE> Brown: We Fear No-One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Scotland manager Craig Brown has
insisted his nation have nothing to fear from any of the nations
they might face in the Euro 2000 play-offs - including the Auld
Enemy England.
</P>
<P>
A comfortable 3-0 win over Lithuania at Hampden Park sets the
Scots heading towards next month's play-offs in upbeat mood as
they bid to clinch a place at next summer's finals.
</P>
<P>
Brown said: "It doesn't really matter who we have to face in
the play-offs because over the last 18 months we have played
quality opposition so we don't fear England or anyone else."
</P>
<P>
"We have had close games with France in November 1997 when we
lost out to a penalty, we were beaten by an own goal against
Brazil at the World Cup and we defeated Germany in a friendly this
year.
</P>
<P>
"Without getting carried away, because we do need to be more
consistent, I don't see any need for us to be pessimistic however
difficult our task. It's all on the night and we've done it
before."

this is my life.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw what I did on television I did not feel it was me.
It is the first time in my life I have done anything like that.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Misses Another Day in Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks have
decided to fine the missing Latrell Sprewell, who stayed absent
from training camp till Friday with no explanation.
</P>
<P>
The team will returning to New York after Saturday's training,
and it now appears Sprewell will miss the entire camp.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks can fine Sprewell 2,500 U.S. dollars for his first
two missed practices and 5,000 U.S. dollars for every missed
practice thereafter. If the team fines him the maximum for every
missed practice since Wednesday, Sprewell will have to pay a fine
of 30,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Discipline is an important part of any team, and obviously it'
s a real important part of this team," coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
"It's not about anybody making an example of anybody, it's about
doing the right things, doing what you're supposed to do."
</P>
<P>
Sprewell was excused from the first two days of the camp, so he
could attend to the close of a civil trial in California stemming
from a traffic accident he admittedly caused. Sprewell's agent,
Robert Gist, last told the team that Sprewell would arrive by
Wednesday night or Thursday morning, but there has been no sign of
Sprewell or any word from him.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell is entering the final season of his contract and will
earn nine million U.S. dollars this season. The Knicks are eager
to begin negotiating an extension, which makes Sprewell's
unexplained absence all the more mysterious.
