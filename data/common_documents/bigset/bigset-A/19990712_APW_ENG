<HEADLINE> Boston Globe Publisher Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A senior vice president at The New York Times was  
named publisher of The Boston Globe on Monday, ending one family's 
126-year reign at the New England newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard H. Gilman succeeded publisher Benjamin B. Taylor, who  
will remain chairman of the Globe Newspaper Company Board. The New 
York Times is the Globe's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was made by the New York Times Co. because of a  
``difference in approach to management,'' said Globe spokesman 
Richard Gulla, who declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe was sold to the Times in 1993 in a $1.1 billion deal  
that guaranteed the Boston paper independence in news and 
management for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though such a move had been rumored in the industry since the  
Times bought the Globe, officials from both papers said no other 
major changes -- including layoffs -- were planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other shoe to drop,'' Gilman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of The New York Times Co., said  
Gilman will bring ``vision and leadership'' to the Globe, adding 
that, ``Under Rich, The Globe will remain the voice of New 
England.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sulzberger also praised Taylor, whose family has lead the  
publication for four generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ben Taylor has made many important contributions to the Globe  
during the past 27 years. His commitment to the newspaper, service 
to the community and dedication to quality journalism are 
unquestioned,'' Sulzberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Morton, media consultant and columnist for the American  
Journalism Review, said the Times likely wanted a Globe publisher 
with more experience on the business and management side. 
</P>
<P>
	``The paper is now controlled by the Sulzberger family, and it's  
inevitable that the Boston Globe ... is eventually going to be run 
by people who are in the New York Times culture,'' Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've been very respectful of the Taylor family,''  
he added. ``But clearly it is now a Sulzberger newspaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman, 48, has been senior vice president of operations for The  
New York Times since 1993. He has, at various times, overseen 
production, systems and technology, the development of plant 
facilities and circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his business experience, he worked as a newspaper  
reporter and editor for more than a decade, starting his career as 
a reporter at The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson. During his tenure 
there, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	At The New York Times, Gilman is credited with overseeing the  
newspapers' largest circulation growth since 1992. He also 
introduced color printing to the newspaper's weekday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 52, has been with the Globe since 1972 and was named  
publisher in 1997. In between, he worked as a general assignment 
reporter, a political reporter in the paper's Washington bureau, 
assistant business editor, assistant managing editor for local news 
and executive editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he was named chairman and chief executive officer of  
the Globe Newspaper Company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit of a sad day, I have to admit,'' Taylor said. ``But  
I'm focused on looking forward.''

<HEADLINE> Trucker Charged in Amtrak Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE LAKE, Texas (AP) -- The truck driver who is blamed for the  
crash of an Amtrak train that injured several people was charged 
Monday with failing to stop for the train. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bubela faces a maximum fine $200 if convicted of the  
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bubela, 21, told officials he did not see a stop sign posted in  
front of the rural crossing Thursday when the Orlando, Fla.-bound 
Sunset Limited slammed into his truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact derailed 13 cars and left 21 people injured.  
</P>
<P>
	Bubela will not be charged in connection with the tanker truck's  
faulty brakes or missing log book, violations that apparently 
played no role in the accident, said Tom Vinger, a spokesman for 
the state Department of Public Safety.

<HEADLINE> GM Victims To Donate Half of Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Recalling her anguished struggle to get help  
for her children after a fiery car crash, a mother said Monday that 
nearly half of a $4.9 billion product liability judgment against 
General Motors Corp. would be used to help other burn victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Anderson, her four children and family friend Jo Tigner  
were severely burned when their car was struck from behind and 
exploded in flames in a Christmas Eve 1993 collision. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday awarded the family $107 million in compensatory  
damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages -- the largest amount 
ever awarded in a defective product case, legal experts have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the punitive damages, which totaled $4.8 billion, will  
be donated to the state of California to help build new burn 
centers or expand those already in operation, Ms. Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this never happens to anyone else, but we want to help  
others get better medical care if it does,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts expect courts to reduce the award.  
</P>
<P>
	If the award were to stand, the verdict could have a serious  
impact on General Motors. The amount exceeds GM's profits of $3.1 
billion in all of 1998, a year in which earnings were hurt by 
strikes. In 1997, the company earned $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the verdict has had little effect on GM stock. The price  
of GM shares dipped slightly on Friday, after the announcement, but 
climbed almost 4 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, 
closing up $2.56 1/4 at $68.68 3/4 a share and above its preverdict 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you look at a $5 billion damage award you have to see  
if the award is reduced and how long will the appeal take,'' said 
Steve Garrity, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, Ms. Tigner and the children were on their way to a  
candy store after attending a Christmas Eve church service when 
their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu was rearended and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn centers were already crowded on the busy holiday night, so  
the six victims were taken to five different hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors at four of the hospitals would not treat the  
children without Ms. Anderson's signature, she told The Associated 
Press in a telephone interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With her head swollen and her hands wrapped mummy-like in  
bandages, she left the emergency room less than two hours after 
arriving and traveled to each of the four hospitals to sign the 
necessary forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said she has no complaint about the quality of care  
her friend and family received, but she doesn't want other families 
to face a similar ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awful. No one was able to sign a release for my kids to  
be treated. I had to check myself out. I went home to get the 
(insurance) cards and had to go to the hospitals to sign for the 
kids,'' she said. ``I didn't really think about it. I just did 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said she also wants some of the money to go to the  
Ronald McDonald Foundation. She stayed at the Ronald McDonald House 
near a Fresno hospital where two of her children were transferred a 
few days after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The four children are in school now, but face additional surgery  
and other treatments to remove or soften scar tissue. Alisha, 11, 
has trouble moving one arm because of scar tissue around the elbow, 
and Ty-Shon, 6, has limited movement of his ankle and foot because 
of scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	When times are rough, she tells her children they are beautiful  
despite their scars, and can accomplish what they want in life. 
</P>
<P>
	Faith helps them get by, she said. ``Just prayer, basically,  
just getting strength from the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 10-week trial, attorneys argued that GM knew its  
gasoline tanks were unsafe, but believed it was cheaper to settle 
claims than recall the cars for safety upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors contends the car was safe, and the accident was  
the fault of a drunken driver who hit the car while going 70 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not uncommon for recipients of large awards to give some  
of the money away, said Tom Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly 
USA. In a 1997 Texas case, the family of a man killed in an 
oil-well accident agreed to forego $30 million in punitive damages 
if the company, Esenjay Petroleum Corp., would install safer 
equipment. The company agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a settlement tactic,'' he said. ``It's a way of  
saving face by saying you'll give up something you're probably not 
going to get anyway.''

<HEADLINE> US Women's Team Leaves Lasting Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The three-week joy ride to the World Cup  
title isn't over for the U.S. women's team. The celebrations have 
only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The critical question, though, is what lasting effect the most  
celebrated team and most successful event in women's sports history 
will have. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the legacy of the women's team be ``establishing this  
Women's World Cup as the event responsible for the development of 
women's sports,'' as tournament organizer Marla Messing predicted? 
</P>
<P>
	Might soccer no longer be relegated to the back pages of  
America's sports section, or not included at all? 
</P>
<P>
	Could what all of those impressive grass-roots numbers -- as many  
under-12s playing the game as any other sport -- finally translate 
into more popularity on a general level for soccer in the United 
States? 
</P>
<P>
	``The legacy I want to leave is that no longer can anyone take  
women athletes lightly,'' U.S. forward Tiffeny Milbrett said. 
``There are no more excuses for not embracing the game. You can't 
say it will not draw; we proved that wrong from the first game of 
this tournament. You can't say it is not marketable and you can't 
say it is not popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. women's team ever has been embraced by the public the  
way this squad was on its way to the final, which it won Saturday 
5-4 on penalty kicks after a 0-0 tie through 120 minutes. Ever 
since Brandi Chastain's kick won it, the women have been on a 
whirlwind tour that took them to Disneyland, to downtown Los 
Angeles and, today, across the continent for television appearances 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	More personal appearances are scheduled, with several players  
appearing in golf pro-ams preceding PGA and LPGA events. Television 
and print ads are upcoming. Adulation is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing to see the difference in attention,'' U.S.  
veteran Kristine Lilly said. ``It's hard to be normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody expects normal. On Saturday, the final was the  
most-watched soccer game ever on U.S. network television, with ABC 
estimating an audience of 40 million. The game posted a 13.3 
overnight rating and a 32 share for the network, 4 percent more 
than the previous record, a 12.8 for the 1994 men's World Cup 
final, also played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they were the guests of honor at Disneyland, the  
centerpieces of a parade attended, naturally, by hundreds of young 
girls and boys. Then they were honored at a rally in downtown LA, 
where they were told their bonuses, originally set at $12,500, were 
raised to between $40,000 and $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Queen Mother doesn't have enough money to pay these women  
what they deserve right now,'' Hank Steinbrecher, general secretary 
of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said. 
</P>
<P>
	After some deserved time off, most of the champions likely will  
gather for a victory tour, followed by the U.S. Women's Cup in 
early October. Several veterans, including 33-year-old Michelle 
Akers, who left the final after regulation time due to exhaustion 
and a slight concussion, might skip that event. 
</P>
<P>
	There also might be an international tour for late this year and  
early 2000. By next March, the buildup for the Sydney Olympics will 
have begun. This time, the women won't go unnoticed the way they 
generally did leading up to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the game,'' said Joy Fawcett, who balances being the  
mother of two girls with playing soccer fulltime. ``We love to play 
soccer. We're very competitive. The Olympics is fun. We all enjoy 
playing in the Olympics. The time off is so short ... you don't 
even think about not playing. You just stay in that routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the U.S. women team members want a professional league  
of their own. And despite startup costs as high as $50 million, 
they sound determined to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time,'' Millbrett said. ``And it will happen.''  
</P>
<P>
	Not before 2001, though. By then, will what Messing called ``a  
seminal event'' have lost its impact? 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected anything like what this World Cup turned  
into,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It has been wonderful 
for soccer and it has been wonderful for the women athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to think anyone can recreate this is unfair. This was just  
a very special, very memorable event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. But not in the minds of the women who won it and the  
people who watched it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to take what we've learned about women's equity,  
what we've learned about women as equal partners and not 
subordinates, and export it around the world,'' Steinbrecher said. 
``I think we're on the cutting edge of a revolution.''

<HEADLINE> Cruise, Kidman Sues Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge has given the green light to a  
lawsuit brought against the Star newspaper after it reported Tom 
Cruise and Nicole Kidman had help from sex therapists in filming 
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actors, who are married, are seeking unspecified damages.  
Phil Bunton, editor of the Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Star, said the 
tabloid stands behind its story. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 30 article in the weekly supermarket tabloid was  
headlined: ``We had to teach Tom and Nicole how to make love.'' It 
claimed sex therapists Tony and Wendy Duffield said they were hired 
to teach the actors how to perform in love scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said the Duffields signed affidavits saying they  
were never hired to coach Cruise or Miss Kidman for the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal suit, filed April 22, also claims pictures  
accompanying the article represented commercial misappropriation of 
Cruise and Miss Kidman's names and likenesses.

<HEADLINE> Schnellenberger To Coach New Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Howard Schnellenberger, who built the  
Miami Hurricanes' football program into a national powerhouse in 
the early 1980s, was appointed coach of Florida Atlantic's new 
program today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Owl's are scheduled to play their first game on September 8,  
2001, against Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnellenberger led the Hurricanes to the first of their four  
national championships in 1983. He later coached at Louisville and 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	He became director of football operations at Florida Atlantic in  
May 1998, and his hiring as coach had been widely anticipated. He 
agreed to a seven-year, $150,000 per year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old war horse has risen again, and he is ready for  
battle,'' the 65-year-old Schnellenberger said at a news conference 
attended by about 200 boosters and members of the school's faculty 
and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me this is the most important thing I have ever undertaken  
in my life, because the people it's going to affect is going to be 
so long-lasting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school north of Fort Lauderdale also announced today that  
1966 graduate Tom Oxley, president of the Royal Palm Polo Club, has 
pledged $4 million for a new athletic complex and practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	The donation pushed Florida Atlantic's football fund-raising  
campaign to $8 million, all of it brought in by Schnellenberger. 
</P>
<P>
	School president Anthony Catanese said no one else was  
interviewed for the coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that Howard Schnellenberger is the right man to  
lead our team on to the field and into the 21st century,'' Catanese 
said.

<HEADLINE> 'American Pie' Leads Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``American Pie'' took a huge, gooey slice of  
the weekend box office as gross-out comedies served up strong 
business, estimates show. 
</P>
<P>
	The raunchy comedy about high school guys trying to lose their  
virginity opened at No. 1 over the weekend with $18.1 million in 
ticket sales, according to estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures were to be released today.  
</P>
<P>
	``Wild Wild West'' was knocked into second place with $16.7  
million. The loose remake of the old TV spy series lost 40 percent 
of its audience in its second week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arlington Road,'' the only other movie opening in wide  
release, debuted with a disappointing $7.4 million to tie for sixth 
place with ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' The new 
thriller stars Jeff Bridges as a college professor who suspects his 
suburban neighbor, Tim Robbins, is a terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody expected 'American Pie' to do well and it did,''  
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc. ``It boasted no big stars and succeeded purely 
on the strength of its advertising campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crude comedies have held a grip on audiences this summer, with  
Adam Sandler's ``Big Daddy'' in third place, the ``South Park'' 
feature in eighth and the ``Austin Powers'' sequel in ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Dergarabedian said that success is due, in part, to the  
popularity of last summer's blockbuster, ``There's Something About 
Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That movie raised the bar for crude humor, and its success has  
gotten not only audiences interested but also studios, who are now 
willing to take chances,'' Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy,'' which features Sandler and a little boy urinating  
in public and brutalizing in-line skaters at a park, earned $16.3 
million in its third week for a total of $116.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Unapologetically obscene, ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and  
Uncut'' has drawn critical raves. The film earned $7.1 million in 
its second week. However, it fell from fourth to eighth place, 
losing 37 percent of its audience. That may be due to tougher 
enforcement of the R-rating, which could have kept young fans away. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Disney's child-friendly animated ``Tarzan'' continued  
drawing respectable crowds by deliberately targeting older 
moviegoers, said Chuck Viane, president of distribution at Disney's 
Buena Vista pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 'Tarzan' audience is actually broadening to more teens and  
more adults. That's what's keeping it up there,'' Viane said. The 
vine-swinging apeman earned $11.3 million for a total of $129.5 
million in its fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
	John Travolta's thriller, ``The General's Daughter,'' held on to  
fifth place with $8.1 million, defying mediocre reviews and a 
crowded box office. 
</P>
<P>
	Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' about the sweltering months when  
serial killer David Berkowitz terrorized New York City, drew large 
crowds in urban areas but played to mostly empty suburban and rural 
theaters, Viane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The film fell to 10th place in its second week with a paltry  
$3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales have routinely broken box office records this  
summer, but receipts from the weekend were down 6.9 percent from 
the same time last year, when ``Lethal Weapon 4'' opened at No. 1 
while ``Armageddon,'' ``Small Soldiers,'' ``Doctor Dolittle'' and 
``Mulan'' were still in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are the estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at  
North American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``American Pie,'' $18.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Wild Wild West,'' $16.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Big Daddy,'' $16.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Tarzan,'' $11.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The General's Daughter,'' $8.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Arlington Road,'' $7.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $7.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' $7.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $6.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Summer of Sam,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Missing Financier Had In-House Harem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHIRLEY, N.Y. (AP) -- Martin R. Frankel roamed his Greenwich,  
Conn., estate in his pajamas like the Hugh Hefner of high finance, 
keeping a live-in retinue of young women he met through personal 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel described some of them as ``ex-girlfriends,'' but it  
isn't clear how many of the women he had sexual relationships with. 
At least some of the women performed office work at Frankel's 
unlicensed securities brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old bachelor is believed to be hiding in Europe  
after vanishing in May with perhaps billions of dollars in other 
people's money. He is accused of looting insurance companies and a 
phony charity he set up in the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unidentified sources, The Hartford Courant reported  
Tuesday that Kaethe Schuchter is believed to be traveling with 
Frankel. Before he disappeared, he reportedly wired nearly $1 
million to a New York City travel agency, where he kept an account 
in her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before Frankel disappeared and the international manhunt  
began, police got a glimpse of his personal life, including his 
alleged penchant for sadomasochistic sex, while investigating a 
suicide at the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 8, 1997, Frances Burge was found hanged with a rope from  
the back deck of one of two mansions on Frankel's compound. The 
death was ruled a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burge, 22, was Frankel's houseguest. She had responded to an  
ad in the Village Voice in the summer of 1996. Frankel sent a 
limousine to pick her up in Shirley at the small house with the 
crumbling front porch where Ms. Burge lived with her father, 
Clarence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Burge has declined to comment on his daughter's death.  
Ms. Burge's mother, Gabriella, who lives nearby, said that the 
young woman's life was never the same after she answered the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Frankel, that first meeting was rocky.  
</P>
<P>
	``Frances did not look as I expected,'' he told police after her  
death. ``She was overweight but was a nice person. During that 
evening, Frances had taken her clothes off and wanted to have sex. 
I did not want to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burge told her mother that Frankel had asked her to strip.  
</P>
<P>
	In any event, Ms. Burge became part of Frankel's circle and  
later moved into one of his two Greenwich homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said that he had met somebody, and he was, like, telling  
her that she was so smart. She just loved that,'' Mrs. Burge said. 
``I said, `You have to be careful about people conning you, people 
who tell you you're so special.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of Frankel's followers, Ms. Burge appeared to have  
light duties, if any. Frankel told police Ms. Burge was a ``general 
helper.'' She told her mother she was working as an office 
assistant. She told friends that she was giving him investment 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's bodyguard, David Rosse, told police that his employer  
was a benefactor to numerous women he met over the Internet and 
through personal ads. Many were allowed to stay at the mansions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these girls think that they might be my girlfriend  
someday,'' Frankel told police. ``The girls do not get paid a 
salary, but I give them money as they need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exact number of Frankel's women is unknown. A former  
housekeeper put the total number of workers at the residences at 
100, including office and domestic staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Paladino, a friend who worked with Ms. Burge at a Shirley  
video store, said Ms. Burge came back to town one day and announced 
that she had found a new job. Ms. Burge said she was working for a 
wealthy older man who wandered the two estates in his pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression was that he was a Hugh Hefner type,'' Ms.  
Paladino said. ``His money was spent on the people who worked for 
him, and she could do whatever she liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By all accounts, Ms. Burge was a confused and complicated woman  
before she became one of Frankel's attendants. Her father told 
police his daughter had been hospitalized twice for depression. 
Friends said she was taking medication, seeing a psychiatrist, and 
sometimes told distressing tales of a suicide attempt and a lost 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ms. Burge's suicide, police searched her room on the  
Frankel estate. They found a film and literature on sexual bondage, 
a leather riding crop and ropes. They also found a pad with a 
handwritten draft of an ad that began: ``Young woman looking for a 
special relationship with that special kinky fun erotic person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Burge told The New York Times that her daughter was trying  
to learn about sadomasochism. The young woman had said she had gone 
with some of Frankel's other girlfriends to a racy New York 
nightclub called The Vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Burge's family nor police blame Frankel for her  
death. But friends such as Ms. Paladino are surprised that Ms. 
Burge would kill herself. Ms. Paladino recalled that her friend had 
stopped by the video store shortly before her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``She definitely had changed,'' Ms. Paladino said. ``She had  
lost weight. She had a brand new car, a beeper, a (cellular) phone. 
She said she loved her job. She said she loved where she was.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Court Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from recent Supreme Court decisions.  
</P>
<P>
	From Justice David H. Souter's majority opinion in Ortiz vs.  
Fibreboard Corp.: ``This case turns on the conditions for 
certifying a mandatory settlement class on a limited fund theory 
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(B). We hold that 
applicants for contested certification on this rationale must show 
that the fund is limited by more than agreement of the parties, and 
has been allocated to claimants belonging within the class by a 
process addressing any conflicting interests of class members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens' majority opinion in NASA vs. Federal  
Labor Relations Authority: ``Congress enacted the Federal Service 
Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), which provides certain 
protections, including union representation, to a variety of 
federal employees. The question presented by this case is whether 
an investigator employed in NASA's Office of the Inspector General 
(NASA-OIG) can be considered a 'representative' of NASA when 
examining a NASA employee, such that the right to union 
representation in the FSLMRS may be invoked. Although certain 
arguments of policy may support a negative answer to that question, 
the plain text of the two statutes, buttressed by administrative 
deference and Congress' countervailing policy concerns, dictates an 
affirmative answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's majority opinion in Ruhrgas AG vs.  
Marathon Oil: ``This case concerns the authority of the federal 
courts to adjudicate controversies. Jurisdiction to resolve cases 
on the merits requires both authority over the category of claim in 
suit (subject-matter jurisdiction) and authority over the parties 
(personal jurisdiction), so that the court's decision will bind 
them. ... We hold that in cases removed from state court to federal 
court, as in cases originating in federal court, there is no 
unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy. Customarily, a federal court 
first resolves doubts about its jurisdiction over the subject 
matter, but there are circumstances in which a district court 
appropriately accords priority to a personal jurisdiction inquiry. 
The proceeding before us is such a case.''

<HEADLINE>  Green Monster Focus at Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. wants a piece of the Green  
Monster. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the All-Star focus clearly on Fenway Park's famous  
left-field fixture, Junior has a plan for Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chip some paint off the wall, put it in a bag and take it  
home,'' Griffey said Monday. ``There's something I will take from 
this ballpark before I leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll let Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire try to clear the  
37-foot-high wall -- after all, Griffey has hit only eight of his 
379 career homers at Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll let Ted Williams and Carlton Fisk look out toward the wall  
and reminisce -- they spent many years playing in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior just wants a keepsake.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a classic,'' the Seattle center fielder said. ``There are  
certain ballparks that have a lot of tradition behind them, and 
this is one of them. And before they tear it down, they've having 
an All-Star game here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a recent run in which many of the majors' newer stadiums  
got to play host, baseball returns to its roots for the final 
All-Star game of the 20th century. Fenway opened in 1912, the same 
week the Titanic sunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one old park I haven't played in,'' San Diego  
outfielder Tony Gwynn said. ``I saw what Wade Boggs used to do 
here. I'm looking forward to doing it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, tied with Boggs at 2,982 career hits, won't be able to  
help the National League try to extend its 40-28-1 edge. Hobbled by 
injuries, he'll sit out as Boston ace Pedro Martinez starts for the 
AL against Philadelphia's Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gwynn wanted to take batting practice Monday and maybe  
field a few balls off the wall. How excited was he about seeing 
Fenway? He had a book detailing the history of the ballpark in his 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	NL manager Bruce Bochy of the Padres was equally enthused.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in Fenway. You step on the field, it's  
hallowed ground,'' he said. ``I hate to age Carlton, but I was a 
Reds fan and now I get to walk in there and see where it really 
went out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk's down-the-line, 12th-inning shot that won Game 6 of the  
1975 World Series remains one of baseball's most enduring images. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Green Monster, when you talk about it, everybody knows  
where the Green Monster is,'' said Fisk, the AL's honorary captain. 
``There are plans that they're going to build a brand new, 
old-fashioned ballpark. That doesn't cut off your memories and the 
stories that have taken place in the old ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who will throw out the ceremonial first ball, put on a  
one-man show in the 1946 All-Star game at Fenway. He hit two 
homers, including a drive off Rip Sewell's ``eephus'' pitch, in 
going 4-for-4 with five RBIs in a 12-0 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the 80-year-old Williams claimed he won't miss  
Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm not sentimental about it. I want to see a new ballpark  
where the seats are bigger,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot of fans say, `Oh, geez, I wouldn't even think  
about going anyplace else.' It wasn't that great. The park is just 
an old park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a lot of history wrapped up in that wall.  
</P>
<P>
	At times, it was made of wood, brick, concrete and sheet metal.  
Now, the side facing the hitters is all tin. And it became known as 
the Green Monster in 1947 when ads for Lifebuoy, Gem Blades and 
other products were covered up with green paint. 
</P>
<P>
	One other fact about the wall: The initials of former owner  
Thomas Austin Yawkey and his wife, Jean Remington Yawkey, appear on 
it in morse code. Easy to overlook, a series of dots and dashes for 
``T-A-Y'' and ``J-R-Y'' show up in the vertical white lines to the 
left of pitchers' numbers on the out-of-town scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Bradley of the Red Sox hit the first shot over the wall on  
April 26, 1912 -- ``Few of the fans who have been out to Fenway Park 
believed it was possible,'' the Boston Herald reported the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his first major league homer over the Monster off Roger  
Clemens in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me real proud of myself,'' the Chicago Cubs slugger  
said. ``After I did that, I knew I could play in the major 
leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit 18 home runs at Fenway, most of them to left. Rocky  
Colavito connected for the AL in the 1961 All-Star game at Fenway, 
stopped by rain after nine innings for a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Listed at 315 feet down the line in left, many believe the wall  
isn't even that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's right on top of you,'' Anaheim reliever Troy Percival  
said. ``It's much too close for comfort when you're on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust ol' Ted Williams on this one.  
</P>
<P>
	``The wall's 290 feet,'' he said. ``When I first got there in  
left field, they had a rise out there to let you know you're 
getting near the fence. But that was taken out. 
</P>
<P>
	``But still I knew the wall was only 290 feet. And I had a good  
conception of how close I was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Can Accident Burns Home, Injures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A man used a cigarette lighter to peer  
inside a gasoline can, setting off a fire that destroyed a mobile 
home and critically burned a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Marvin Tompkins, 30, was trying to determine whether  
there was water in the gasoline can yesterday, said Fire Capt. 
Gregory Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ignited the fumes that were escaping the gas can,'' Summers  
said. ``Once he ignited the fumes, he dropped the gas can -- he 
slung it really -- and threw gas on the floor, and that gas 
ignited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tompkins suffered only minor burns on his hand. The home's  
owner, Donna Harrington, and her son escaped the blaze, but Ms. 
Harrington, 43, was severely burned when she went back inside to 
rescue a dog, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog died.

<HEADLINE> NYC Pressured Over Police Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pressure mounted Monday for the police  
department to revamp its disciplinary practices after a federal 
investigation confirmed what critics have long contended: brutal 
cops often go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
	City and federal officials acknowledged that secret negotiations  
are underway to reach a settlement on what reforms the nation's 
largest police department should adopt. The talks -- aimed at 
avoiding a court battle -- stem from a two-year investigation of the 
New York Police Department by the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Zachary Carter, U.S. attorney for Brooklyn's Eastern District,  
reviewed thousands of allegations of abuse and reportedly has 
concluded the department has not properly policed its 40,000 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the usual suspects who are criticizing the department  
now; it's the federal government and that's significant,'' said 
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties 
Union. ``This is long overdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir refused to comment on the  
federal probe, saying media reports of negotiations were 
speculative. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, we are cooperating with the Eastern District of  
New York in their investigation, and have been from the 
beginning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators were believed to be focusing on a plan to create an  
independent panel that would review brutality complaints and 
oversee the department's response to them. The current Civilian 
Complaint Review Board, which is controlled by the mayor, is viewed 
by some as ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter began his investigation in 1997 after a Haitian  
immigrant, Abner Louima, was beaten in a police station bathroom 
following his arrest in a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's office prosecuted the case, which resulted in the  
conviction last month of two officers on charges they tortured 
Louima by sodomizing him with a broken broomstick. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor noted that the department has driven down crime at  
record rates while reducing the number of police shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYPD ``is the most restrained large-city police department  
in the country,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police critics have repeatedly cited statistics showing that of  
the roughly 5,000 reports of police misconduct received by the CCRB 
last year, only 300 were found to be substantiated and forwarded to 
the police commissioner. Less than half of those cases resulted in 
disciplinary action.

<HEADLINE>  Khrushchev's Son Becomes US Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Nikita Khrushchev's son became a U.S.  
citizen Monday, choosing the material advantages of captalism 40 
years after his father vowed communism would easily surpass the 
American way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling like a newborn. It's the beginning of a new  
life,'' the 64-year-old Sergei Khrushchev said after taking the 
oath of citizenship inside a Roman Catholic school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	At his side was his wife, Valentina Golenko, who also took the  
oath to defend the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	They became American citizens 40 years after Nikita Khrushchev  
told then-Vice President Richard Nixon on July 24, 1959 during the 
famous Kitchen Debate in Moscow: ``In another seven years we will 
be on the same level as America. When we catch you up, in passing 
you by, we will wave to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another time, the Soviet leader said his country would ``bury''  
the United States. Khrushchev has said his father's ``we will bury 
you'' remark was misunderstood. The remark meant that capitalism 
would die and that the Soviet economic system would outlive it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Khrushchev, once an important missile engineer for the  
Soviets, and his wife have been living in the United States since 
he came to the United States in 1991 as a visiting instructor in 
Cold War history at Brown University in Providence, where he still 
teaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Khrushchev has become American as a Buick or a  
Pontiac -- in fact, he owns one of each. Khrushchev lives in a ranch 
house in Cranston, a suburb dotted with lawn sprinklers and grills. 
The home has central air, a Jacuzzi and an entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
	Khrushchev and his wife have grown accustomed to the American  
way of life, so they decided to make the arrangement a permanent 
one by becoming U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with 242 others, Khrushchev and his wife stood up from  
their seats and said, ``I do'' when U.S. District Judge Ronald R. 
Lagueux asked if they promised to be good citizens. Then all 244 
recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Most of them, including 
Khrushchev, held miniature American flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he feared that his relatives back in Russia could face  
hostility because of his decision, he replied: ``No, no! You're 
still living in the Cold War. It's a different Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are some in Russia who see Khrushchev's decision to  
become an American as a betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
	His son Nikita, named after the Soviet leader, still lives in  
Russia and had been helping his dad gather material for books he 
writes about the Cold War era. The son said some Russian officials 
have been hindering him because of his father's move. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the Cold War. But it's not normal peace, either,''  
the young Nikita wrote in a commentary published about two weeks 
ago in the liberal weekly Moscow News.

<HEADLINE> Mir Must Be Set for Unmanned Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Unless a supply ship can be sent quickly, the Mir  
space station will have to be evacuated and could eventually fall 
out of control and come crashing to Earth, a space official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space officials planned to leave the aging Mir unmanned  
when the current crew returns to Earth in August. But before 
departure, the crew was to prepare the orbiter for safe unmanned 
flight -- using equipment that was to be delivered by a Progress 
cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
	A Progress carrying that equipment along with food has to be  
launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan before July 20, 
said Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev. After that date, the 
Mir will shift into an orbit that can't be easily reached by the 
cargo ship, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kazakstan banned all Russian flights last week after a  
Proton booster rocket carrying a Russian military satellite 
exploded shortly after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 13-year-old Mir is not prepared for unmanned flight, the  
140-ton station will become uncontrollable from the ground and 
could come crashing down on Earth at an unpredictable place and 
time, Koptev said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to make our Kazak colleagues understand the  
importance of this launch. Without it we could be drawn into a very 
difficult situation that will affect all of us,'' Koptev told a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chances for all are equal of being hit over the head by  
bits of the space station, whether you are Russian or Kazak or 
indeed any other nationality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Progress flight misses the July 20 window, it could still  
make it to the Mir in its less accessible orbit, but it would have 
to leave behind a lot of crucial equipment to make room for extra 
fuel needed for the longer trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Or it could wait another month, when the Mir becomes easily  
reached again. But by that time the three-man crew will have run 
out of food and been evacuated, Koptev said. The crew -- cosmonauts 
Viktor Afanasyev, Sergei Avdeyev and French astronaut Jean-Pierre 
Heignere -- can get back to the ground aboard an escape craft that 
is now docked to the Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baikonur Cosmodrome was built when Kazakstan was still part  
of the Soviet Union. Now that the Central Asian nation is 
independent, Russia has to rent the launch pad, on which it still 
relies heavily for commercial launches and flights to the Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazak Deputy Premier Alexander Pavlov, who is leading the  
investigation into the July 5 satellite crash, said Sunday it was 
possible the ban would be lifted, Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects remained uncertain. Kazak Prime Minister Nurlan  
Balgimbayev said Monday that Russia hasn't addressed the crash 
seriously enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regrettably, we do not feel that proper concern has been shown  
by the Russian side,'' his press service quoted Balgimbayev as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	No casualties were reported from the crash, but Kazak  
authorities said rocket fuel has damaged the environment and that 
some people have reported health problems.

<HEADLINE>  Not Your Mother's Role Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They definitely were not your mother's role  
models. 
</P>
<P>
	But they will be your daughter's.  
</P>
<P>
	And maybe your son's too.  
</P>
<P>
	The lasting image of the women's World Cup is game-winning goal  
scorer Brandi Chastain sliding on her knees near the penalty spot, 
celebrating victory with a full-throated roar and waving her jersey 
instead of wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was the same one she made last month by posing for  
a magazine wearing nothing but a soccer ball and cleats -- daring 
anyone to suggest beauty, brains and athletic ability couldn't be 
bundled in one package. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment at least, there were no takers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We caught lightning in a bottle,'' Hank Steinbrecher, general  
secretary of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said Sunday. ``The Queen 
Mother doesn't have enough money to pay these women what they 
deserve right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrecher spoke just minutes before Chastain and her  
teammates swept past during a parade through Disneyland's Main 
Street, showered with confetti as they rode a float and rubbed 
elbows with Mickey and Minnie Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities marked the start of a two-day, two-coast  
whirlwind tour that will put the team in front of the cameras that 
missed them the first time around -- when they crisscrossed America 
en route to winning the 16-nation, 32-game tournament that 
concluded Saturday with a 5-4 victory over China on penalty kicks 
following a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' thrilling triumph produced the most-watched  
soccer game ever on U.S. network television, with ABC estimating 
that 40 million viewers tuned in. A few million more woke up in 
time to catch Chastain on the Sunday morning news programs 
bantering with fellow guests First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	For all that, the lingering question is how much a nation that  
fell under the spell of a sport and the female athletes who played 
it will value them both by next week. After all, the United States 
played host to the men's World Cup in 1994, but the men's national 
team and the professional league created soon afterward are still 
struggling for attention in a crowded sports landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the U.S. women team members are adamant about getting  
a professional league of their own, it is far from becoming a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is about making things happen,'' Chastain said. ``If  
it takes each one of us knocking on doors to get that, we'll do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Soccer Federation, which developed the business plan  
for Major League Soccer before turning the enterprise over to 
private investors, has launched a feasibility study for a women's 
league. And while Steinbrecher was cautious about whether the World 
Cup generated enough momentum to launch and sustain a pro league, 
he had no doubts about its success in another, more important 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to take what we've learned about women's equity,  
what we've learned about women as equal partners and not 
subordinates, and export it around the world,'' he said. ``I think 
we're on the cutting edge of a revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmation of that was practically at Steinbrecher's elbow,  
where Jeff Marquis and his family, from nearby Corona, sat along 
Disneyland's Main Street, waiting for the U.S. team to go by. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquis came into possession of two tickets for the final only  
last week, no small feat after the U.S. team packed stadiums in New 
Jersey, Chicago, Boston, Washington and Palo Alto, Calif. He 
decided to take his 15-year-old daughter, Brittany, because she 
plays on her high school team. And besides, he already had tickets 
to take his 13-year-old son, Bryce, to the Dodgers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were growing up, I don't think I ever imagined that  
they'd have equal opportunities to play sports,'' Marquis said. 
``But even before this thing exploded, she had many of the same 
things he got out of sports -- a network of friends, the confidence, 
the power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he could envision his daughter playing  
professionally as easy as his son, Marquis paused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody always ties it to that,'' he said, ``but I'm not  
sure that's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may be right. Brittany said the most important thing to her  
was how good she and her friends felt to be on a soccer field, 
knowing that their boyfriends had come to see them play -- instead 
of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, her younger brother was one of those boys watching  
the girls play and he admitted loving every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see any difference,'' Bryce said, ``except at the  
end, the ripping-off-the-shirt part. I haven't ever seen that 
before.''

<HEADLINE> Canseco May Be Facing Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Canseco can't help but wonder  
if he's played his last game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay Devil Rays designated hitter said Monday that he  
will do everything he can to try to return to the team after back 
surgery, but conceded that retirement is an option he might have to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
	``My body has failed me again,'' Canseco said during a telephone  
conference call from his hospital bed in Fort Lauderdale, where he 
had a 90-minute operation Sunday to repair a herniated disc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This to me is a nightmare with the year I'm having, the  
consistency I've had ... The timing couldn't be worse,'' he added. 
``I was given all the ability in the world. Not to be able to use 
it is one of the worst things that can happen to a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco leads the AL with 31 homers and was selected as the  
league's starting designated hitter for Tuesday night's All-Star 
game in Boston. He apologized to fans who voted for him and who 
were also hoping to see him in Monday night's home run derby 
competition at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm depressed,'' his weakened voice reflecting his  
disappointment as well as the medication given to him following 
surgery. ``I can't believe this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco and the Devil Rays are not certain what caused the  
intense pain that left the 35-year-old no alternative than to 
undergo surgery similar to the operation he had for a ruptured disc 
on his left side in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Although doctors said he could have opted for non-surgical care,  
Canseco said he was in such discomfort that he was almost certain 
that he had the same type of injury that had forced him to undergo 
surgery the last time. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference was, this time, the bad disc was on his  
right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just happens. There aren't too many indications,'' said  
Canseco, who left in the eighth inning of Friday night's game 
against Florida in Miami because of stiffness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I compare it to a high-performance car,'' he added. ``One  
little spark plug can be loose, and the whole car won't run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco sat out Saturday night's game, then had an MRI Sunday  
that revealed a severely compressed nerve was causing weakness in 
the toes of his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco said surgery had eliminated the pain, but that it will  
be several weeks before the scar tissue from the incision in his 
back heals enough for him to start rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who expect a full recovery, said he will be sidelined  
up to six weeks. Canseco recalled it took about two months to 
return from back surgery three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can come back ... I'm just trying to take one day  
at a time,'' said Canseco, who signed a one-year contract with the 
Devil Rays last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his mention of retirement was out of frustration or if  
it was a serious consideration, Canseco emphasized that he wants to 
continue to play -- preferably in Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely frustration. But you have to consider it if  
you can't come back and play the way you want to. ... I don't want 
to hurt a lineup,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My future is unsure right now. And it's not because of a lack  
of ability, but a lack of health. There are not a lot of guys in my 
shoes who can say they have the ability to hit 50 or 60 home runs, 
but won't get a chance to do it because they can't stay healthy. 
Still to today, I don't know what I could do if I stayed healthy 
all year round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who has 428 career homers, missed 12 games in June and  
July last year with back spasms but didn't miss a start following 
the All-Star break. He took six cortisone shots during spring 
training this season, and appeared in 82 of Tampa Bay's first 86 
games.

<HEADLINE> Prestigious Law Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The partners of two prestigious U.S. and British  
law firms have approved a merger and have plans to add a third, 
German, partner to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of New York-based Rogers &AMP; Wells and Britain's  
Clifford Chance, the first marriage of major U.S. and British law 
firms, was approved overwhelmingly by the firms' partners over the 
weekend, Rogers &AMP; Wells said in a statement issued yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	They also announced an agreement in principle to merge with a  
leading German law firm, Punder, Volhard, Wever and Axster. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners of all three firms are to vote in September on the  
three-way combination, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2000, will 
result in one of the world's largest law firms with 2,700 lawyers 
and 30 offices worldwide, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will succeed because all three firms share a strong  
commitment to developing a single, integrated culture, drawing on 
the best of each, that is dedicated to excellence in client 
service, teamwork and training,'' said Larry Cranch, managing 
partner at Rogers &AMP; Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined firm will be known as Clifford Chance Rogers &AMP;  
Wells in the United States, Clifford Chance in England and Clifford 
Chance Punder in Germany and other European countries, Rogers &AMP; 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mergers are expected to spark similar unions between firms  
amid a trend of consolidation in the increasingly international 
field of law.

<HEADLINE> Holland Considers Minnesota Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Virginia athletic director Terry  
Holland has discussed the possibility of becoming Minnesota's next 
head basketball coach, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minnesota athletic director Mark Dienhart and I have talked on  
several occasions about his search process,'' Holland told the 
Daily Progress of Charlottesville. ``One of the many options we 
discussed was whether I was interested in a return to coaching. My 
answer was that it would take a lot more time to think through for 
both of us than I believe Mark has right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dienhart said Saturday that he hoped to hire a successor for  
Clem Haskins by Thursday, the start of the summer recruiting 
period. Another option is to hire an interim coach who likely would 
be replaced after next season. If Minnesota sticks to the Thursday 
deadline, Holland apparently would not be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported Monday that three other  
coaches are being considered for the job: Gonzaga's Dan Monson, 
Wake Forest's Dave Odom and Northwestern's Kevin O'Neill. Dienhart 
confirmed that Monson and Odom are candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Minnesota spokesman Marc Ryan, citing standard  
procedure, would neither confirm nor deny whether talks took place 
with any of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland, Virginia's winningest coach before retiring in 1990,  
has been the Cavaliers' athletic director since 1995. As Virginia's 
coach from 1974-90, Holland led the Cavaliers to a 326-173 record 
that included two Final Four appearances, nine NCAA tournaments and 
Virginia's only ACC tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins coached the Gophers for 13 years before the school  
bought out his contract for $1.5 million this summer after the 
program was enmeshed in numerous charges of academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom is in Portugal and is expected to let Dienhart know soon if  
he is interested, according to the Star Tribune. Monson and 
Dienhart have talked on the phone, and Dienhart wants the coach to 
visit, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Block St. Louis Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Several hundred workers and activists formed a  
human barricade Monday morning across a major highway to demand 
that more minorities be hired for state construction jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't take it anymore,'' said Cleo Willis, an unemployed  
welder who sat cross legged in the middle of the highway. ``We're 
ready to go to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured and there were no scuffles with police, but  
125 people were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Those arrested, including New York activist the Rev. Al  
Sharpton, were immediately released but ordered to appear Aug. 17 
on charges of impeding the flow of traffic and failing to obey a 
police order. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of MO-KAN, a group representing minority contractors,  
staged the protest on Interstate 70, the site of a construction 
project. MO-KAN has been pressuring the state to increase the 
number of minority firms working state jobs, especially road work 
done in minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	``How dare they build a highway down the middle of north St.  
Louis and have no minority contractors,'' said Marcus Hindmon, 
MO-KAN president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rick Grebel, president of KCI Construction Co., said his  
company has a goal of hiring 20 percent minority workers and was up 
to 15 percent prior to Monday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to keep a qualified work force and qualified workers  
come in all colors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the chief contractors on the I-70 project said they would  
add another $500,000 in subcontracts to minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law requires 10 percent minority participation on  
projects throughout the state. In the St. Louis transportation 
district, minority and women contractors make up 14 percent of 
projects, said Linda Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Missouri 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	But MO-KAN said it was not good enough. The group wants 25 cents  
of every dollar spent on the I-70 reconstruction project to go to 
minority-owned firms and for 35 percent of the work force to be 
minorities.

<HEADLINE> Court Producing Pedantic Prose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court justices are nine smart men  
and women. But when it comes to writing, there's not a Shakespeare, 
Hemingway or even John Grisham among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to pick between the justices in majority opinion  
writing is rather like asking me whether I prefer Miracle Whip or 
mayonnaise,'' says Indiana University law professor Charles Geyh. 
``You will rarely see what I regard as good writing in Supreme 
Court opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most notable writing examples in the court's recently  
ended 1998-99 term was Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent in June 
when the court threw out a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance aimed 
at street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia borrowed from ``West Side Story,'' spinning out a  
scenario in which members of the Jets street gang are arrested 
after telling a policeman, ``Gee, Officer Krupke, krup you.'' 
Taking aim at the majority's conclusion that the Chicago ordinance 
was too vague, Scalia added, ``I find it hard to believe that the 
Jets would not have known they had it coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that tale was a rarity. Most of the justices' opinions were  
no threat to the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and other great 
opinion writers of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider this gem, also by Scalia, in a decision in January  
involving the Federal Communications Commission's regulation of 
local telephone business: 
</P>
<P>
	``Respondents argue that avoiding this pari passu expansion of  
commission jurisdiction with expansion of the substantive scope of 
the act was the reason the `nothing shall be construed' provision 
was framed in the alternative: `nothing in this act shall be 
construed to apply or to give the commission jurisdiction' 
(emphasis added) with respect to the forbidden subjects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Got that?  
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court does not allow television coverage of  
its decision announcements. The justices speak through their 
writing. But why is it often so dense? 
</P>
<P>
	The decisions ``are not intended to be great literature,'' says  
Pepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec. ``They are 
writing plainly in the sense of not aspiring to great literature 
but to common results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court opinion is supposed to explain a ruling to the  
people involved in the case, as well as to the public and lower 
courts that must apply it in future cases. The most creative 
writing usually turns up in dissents, because the writer of a 
majority opinion must please at least four other justices to keep 
them on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices use their law clerks to varying degrees in  
researching and writing their opinions. Decisions sometimes top 100 
pages, counting the majority and dissenting opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can skim if you have to,'' suggests Michael Dorf, a  
Columbia University law professor who once clerked for Justice 
Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorf credits Justice Clarence Thomas with ``the closest thing to  
moving rhetoric'' during the past term. Writing in the Chicago gang 
case, he dissented from Justice John Paul Stevens' majority opinion 
that threw out the anti-loitering law. 
</P>
<P>
	The people who will be harmed by the ruling, Thomas said, are  
``people who have seen their neighborhoods literally destroyed by 
gangs and violence and drugs. They are good, decent people who must 
struggle to overcome their desperate situation, against all odds, 
in order to raise their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By focusing on gang members' rights, Thomas wrote, ``the court  
today has denied our most vulnerable citizens the very thing that 
Justice Stevens elevates above all else -- the 'freedom of 
movement.' And that is a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens provided an example of clear writing in a majority  
opinion in May, when the court barred states from paying lower 
welfare benefits to new residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the  
right to choose to be citizens of the state wherein they reside,'' 
Stevens wrote. ``The states, however, do not have any right to 
select their citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis lawyer William Domnarski's 1996 book, ``In the  
Opinion of the Court,'' listed the court's 1954 decision that 
outlawed racial segregation in public schools among 11 opinions 
that could be considered great literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion was simple, not flowery:  
``We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of 
'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities 
are inherently unequal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kmiec suggested it would be interesting to have a seminar with  
the justices to find out how important the quality of writing is to 
them. As for reading pleasure, he said, ``I suppose lay people 
would say just go get a good book at the airport.''

<HEADLINE> Painting Looted by Nazis Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A painting by a German artist has been returned  
to its Jewish owners, 60 years after it was stolen by the Nazis and 
ended up in a museum in Adolf Hitler's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Holocaust Claims Office on Monday turned over ``The  
Seamstress'' to Michael Loewenthal, whose grandfather, art 
collector Louis Loewenthal, lost everything when he fled Berlin at 
the beginning of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	A pro-Nazi art dealer falsely claimed years later that ``The  
Seamstress'' had been destroyed in an Allied air raid. After the 
war, he sold it to the municipal museum in Linz, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Linz City Council voted recently to give the painting to  
Loewenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough decision, but a very brave one,'' said  
Loewenthal, who lives in Franklin Lakes, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewenthal declined to estimate the painting's monetary worth,  
saying its value to his family was sentimental and he planned to 
give it to a museum of Judaica for display. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil painting is by Lesser Ury, who lived in a tiny Berlin  
garret in the 1930s. While Ury was regarded in his time as a master 
of pastels, ``The Seamstress'' depicts its subject in mostly dark 
colors, highlighted by sun through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewenthal, who was born in Israel and raised in New York City,  
asked the Holocaust claims office about the painting months ago, 
after learning it had been in the Linz museum since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holocaust office said the painting was part of a collection  
confiscated by the Nazis from Louis Loewenthal in 1939-40 and 
acquired by Berlin art dealer Wolfgang Gurlitt. Gurlitt later 
played a key role in Nazi efforts to sell ``degenerate art'' -- 
works by Jews -- abroad and set up a ``Fuhrermuseum'' in Linz, 
Hitler's boyhood home. 
</P>
<P>
	When Louis Loewenthal's son Fritz asked Gurlitt in 1950 to  
either make a supplementary payment for his father's art or return 
it, Gurlitt insisted the paintings had been destroyed in a 1943 air 
raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurlitt survived the war and moved to Linz, where he eventually  
sold more than 160 paintings, including ``The Seamstress,'' to the 
Linz museum. It hung there from 1956 until a few weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Records Opened in Tobacco Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Three law firms that represented Wisconsin  
in its lawsuit against the tobacco industry charged $3,032 an hour 
for each of the 24,733 hours they spent on the phone, in meetings 
and sifting through papers, documents released Monday show. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office released the information in  
an attempt to end an open records lawsuit filed by three newspapers 
seeking to learn details on work the firms performed in winning the 
state a $5.9 billion settlement with cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco lawsuit was settled in November as part of a  
multistate agreement that would give Wisconsin $5.9 billion over 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys had resisted releasing their records, citing  
``ethical issues,'' but agreed to release them to Attorney General 
James Doyle, who then gave them to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The hundreds of pages detail how the law firms spent their time  
working on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Between Oct. 23, 1998, and Jan. 25, for example, two of the  
firms -- Whyte Hirschboeck Dudek of Milwaukee and Brennan, Steil, 
Basting &AMP; MacDougall of Janesville -- spent more than 1,820 hours 
reviewing 39,000 previously secret tobacco documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Scott, an attorney at Whyte, declined to comment, except  
to say ``I considered the final chapter when we settled the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also provide details about $2 million that the law  
firms spent on the case. Robert L. Habush of the Milwaukee firm 
Habush, Habush, Davis &AMP; Rottier, frequently traveled in style, 
including limousine trips and a $7,818 chartered flight to 
Washington, D.C., that would have cost $906 if he had flown coach, 
the records said. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms said the tobacco industry would pay them $75 million  
over five years. Based on 24,733 hours of work, that equals about 
$3,032 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin State Journal of Madison, The Capital Times of  
Madison and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel sued the state in May 
for the records.

<HEADLINE>  Chinese Soccer Squad Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Banging drums and singing the national anthem,  
Chinese fans gave a hero's welcome Monday to their women's soccer 
team that returned home from the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't lose because of spirit or strength. We lost because  
of luck,'' defender Zhao Lihong said as the team walked through 
Beijing airport to the applause of airport employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Chinese sports officials met the United Airlines flight  
bringing the team from San Francisco. In the receiving line was the 
top U.S. diplomat in China, William McCahill, who gave captain Sun 
Wen a bouquet of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire Chinese people are extremely happy!'' Wu Shaozu,  
director of the state sports commission, said at a brief news 
conference for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival was featured prominently on the national evening  
television news. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the title at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,  
Calif., beating the Chinese 5-4 on penalty kicks after a scoreless 
regulation and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome was bitter for Chinese fans, many of whom regarded  
it as a grudge match with political overtones. Sun hinted at such 
sentiments but remained upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only when you are very powerful can you win respect,'' she  
said. ``Through our good performance we won the respect and love of 
American soccer fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters jostled with fans and airport personnel to get  
pictures of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 fans gathered outside the airport, some banging  
cymbals and drums, while others waved flags and sang the national 
anthem. One banner declared, ``The Chinese women's soccer team are 
national heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Chinese fans had complained of a conspiracy by U.S.  
organizers, saying their team was sabotaged by too much travel, 
lack of decent Chinese food and hot weather. But others were proud 
the team had gone so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel that they lost,'' said Xin Yan, 32, who stood  
with 20 fellow employees of the Beijing Haidian Agricultural 
Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Gao Hong, beaten on the winning kick by Brandi  
Chastain, already was looking toward her next encounter with the 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the Olympics next year, if we have this kind of  
competition, I won't let one ball in,'' she said. ``I have 
confidence in this,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Out Six Weeks After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jose Canseco is expected to make a full recovery  
from back surgery and could be back on the field for the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The slugger, who leads the AL with 31 homers, underwent a  
90-minute operation Sunday to repair a herniated disc. Doctors said 
he will not be able to resume baseball workouts for at least a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL announced Baltimore's Harold Baines will replace Canseco  
in Tuesday night's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old designated hitter, elected to the All-Star team  
for the first time in seven years, has been hampered by back 
trouble much of his career. He had surgery for a ruptured disc on 
his left side in 1996, but had remained healthy enough this year to 
play in 82 of Tampa Bay's first 86 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tom Tolli and Dr. Gary Giesseke removed two fragments from  
Canseco's lower right back Sunday in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect a full recovery,'' Tolli following the Devil Rays'  
3-2 loss to the Florida Marlins. ``Jose had the option of 
non-surgical care but the amount of pain he was in was the deciding 
factor. He wanted it done as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco left Friday's game against the Marlins in the eighth  
inning with intense back pain. He had an MRI that revealed a 
severely compressed nerve was causing weakness in the toes of his 
right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear when or how Canseco, a six-time All-Star, did  
something to cause the pain to flare. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him and he can't pinpoint anything,'' manager  
Larry Rothschild said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it came on a little bit. He took one swing Friday he  
thinks might have had some effect on him but he really didn't know. 
He slid into third on the one play when he got thrown out, but 
really couldn't pinpoint anything. He felt more that it was just 
coming on over time and it got aggravated enough and that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco also missed the All-Star game because of injuries in  
1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of injuries this season, but obviously this is  
a big one,'' Rothschild said. ``There's nothing we can do about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who turned 35 on July 2, missed 12 games in June and  
July last year with similar back spasms but didn't miss a start 
following the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big surprise,'' Devil Rays closer Roberto Hernandez  
said. ``He's in the starting lineup on the first day (of the 
series), and the second day he's not here. On the third day, he's 
getting operated on. He's a tough guy to replace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, who has 428 career homers, had two stints on the DL due  
to back ailments in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Architect Cited for Congress Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The architect of the Capitol failed to  
maintain the fire alarm system and electrical equipment in a main 
Library of Congress building, omissions that endangered lives when 
a fire broke out, congressional investigators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' workplace safety agency, the Office of Compliance,  
issued five ``serious'' citations against the architect after an 
April 30 fire caused evacuation of the Madison Building, parts of 
it in total darkness. Police officers who should have been aiding 
the evacuation instead had to run around the building pulling 
manual fire alarms, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker was burned as the fire started, but there were no other  
injuries and no damage to the library's rare documents, which 
include a rough draft of the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``serious'' citation is reserved for violations ``likely to  
cause serious injury or death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Architect officials had a warning of problems two days before  
the fire, when officials in the Madison Building, a main research 
facility, had to cancel a planned fire drill because the alarm 
system failed to activate. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the citations said an important circuit breaker  
implicated in the fire had not been serviced since 1993, ``creating 
a danger of fire for employees ... and a danger of shock or 
electrocution for employees who work on the equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The architect's office didn't return a telephone call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators, charged with making Congress follow the same  
workplace safety rules that lawmakers have imposed on private 
businesses, previously have issued numerous citations against the 
architect for improper storage of chemicals and allowing an unsafe 
working environment, The Associated Press has reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the House inspector general said late last year  
that the Capitol and House offices were seriously deficient in fire 
safety and had installed a defective brand of sprinkler. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Green, general counsel for the Office of Compliance, said  
the architect's office ``does not share the same attitude that 
Fortune 500 companies share about safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has only been obligated to follow federal safety  
rules since 1995, and trying to force compliance ``is a little bit 
like turning an ocean liner around,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to failing to maintain circuit breaker equipment,  
the citations said the architect: 
</P>
<P>
	--Left the alarm system in ``a mode for servicing,'' preventing  
activation of the full building alarm from the building's control 
console. It may have been left in that condition for several months 
and resulted in the canceled fire drill. 
</P>
<P>
	The system was reset the morning of the fire, but a faulty  
circuit prevented the alarm from sounding in the vicinity of the 
control room when the fire broke out. Because of that problem, 
officers were sent to activate manual alarms throughout the 
building to ensure no other areas were missed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Failed to cut power to electrical parts before employees tried  
to perform maintenance work that resulted in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began when an electrician's tool came in contact with  
an energized conductor. Electrical distribution equipment failed, a 
nonfunctioning circuit breaker overheated and a flash fire began, 
burning and temporarily blinding the worker, who was saved by a 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	--Failed to train employees proper procedures for working on such  
equipment. The two electricians working in the Madison building on 
April 30 ``had received no training and were not familiar with the 
safety-related work practices required ... when performing work 
that poses a danger of electric shock,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Did not install equipment that would have allowed a blocked  
duct to open automatically in case of fire. On April 30, the 
blocked duct prevented smoke from leaving the building, and it 
spread throughout the structure. 
</P>
<P>
	During the fire evacuation, when the faulty circuit breaker  
finally tripped, power was cut to one-fourth of the building. Some 
people were in darkness in rooms without windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Opened in 1980, the Madison building's collection includes rare  
musical instruments, one-of-a-kind maps and historic manuscripts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Runs $6B Seafood Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- At America's largest seafood restaurant chain,  
that red lobster probably comes from the Bahamas or Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	That shrimp cocktail? Thailand. Those crab legs? Canada.  
</P>
<P>
	Red Lobster Restaurants depends on foreign fishermen to feed its  
130 million annual customers. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because American fishermen can't meet the domestic demand  
for certain species and the strong dollar and lower wages elsewhere 
makes foreign fish less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really become such a global market,'' said Andrew Dun,  
marketing director for the 669-outlet chain. ``There just isn't 
enough here to meet our needs. You have to go where the supply 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, more than ever, that supply was in foreign seas and  
foreign fish farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States imported nearly four times more seafood than  
it exported last year, running up a record $5.88 billion trade 
deficit, according to Seafood Market Analyst, a market research and 
forecasting group. 
</P>
<P>
	That is 16 percent -- or $800 million -- higher than 1997 and  
marks at least the 28th consecutive deficit in the seafood trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish shortage is so prevalent that restaurant customers  
ordering regional specialties -- lobster and cod in New England, 
crab cakes in Maryland, salmon in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska 
-- likely are served imports from Canada, Iceland, Venezuela and 
Chile, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``These days in mainstream restaurants, probably more than half  
of the fish on the menu is going to be imported,'' said James 
Anderson, editor of SMA's Seafood Trade Reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely the biggest food category. We import more fish  
than we do coffee and alcohol put together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States imported more than $8 billion in seafood in  
1998, mostly from Canada, Thailand and China. That is 6 percent 
more than 1997 and the highest amount this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Japan imports more seafood.  
</P>
<P>
	The top imports -- by value -- were shrimp and prawns at a  
combined $3.1 billion. Most of that came frozen from Mexico and 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. seafood exports dropped 17 percent last year to  
almost $2.2 billion, the lowest amount this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The top individual exports were frozen Alaska pollock surimi, or  
minced pollock, at $167 million and lobster at $160 million. The 
top collective export was salmon products at about $360 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary destinations for U.S. fish were Japan, Canada and  
China, although exports to Japan were down 30 percent and to China 
down 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the trade gap is widening because Asia's economic  
slump makes U.S. fish more expensive, American fishermen aren't 
catching enough popular entrees like Alaska sockeye salmon and New 
England cod and flounder, and the American fleet can't produce the 
right products at the right time at the right price for American 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Year-round, high-quality, fresh, farmed salmon from places  
like Chile, Canada, Norway and Scotland out-competes the seasonal, 
mostly frozen, and often poorly handled salmon from Alaska,'' said 
Anderson, a visiting professor at the College of William and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing trade deficit is not bad in itself -- cheaper imports  
mean better prices for American consumers. But there are ripples 
beyond the dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the handling and production practices in foreign  
countries may not be up to U.S. standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seafood eaters should be aware that fisheries management  
practices in foreign countries may not be sustainable and that the 
U.S. demand, in some cases, is contributing to environmental 
degradation,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Red Lobster was accused of buying Honduran  
lobster from suppliers who abused divers and bleached coral reefs 
to force the crustaceans out of hiding. Red Lobster denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	Dun said recently that the chain has an office in Singapore  
making sure its seafood purchases are harvested responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our quality standards for our seafood apply globally,'' he  
said from the chain's Orlando, Fla., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the environmental and transportation problems often  
associated with foreign fish, many restaurants build their menus 
around locally farmed fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as it's delicious, who cares?'' said Patrick  
O'Connell, chef at the upscale The Inn at Little Washington in 
Washington, Va. ``I'd rather have an impeccably fresh, farm-raised 
fish than a wild fish that's been sitting around an airport for 
three days.''

<HEADLINE> USDA Sees Lower Prices for Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department today predicted  
lower prices for wheat, corn and other major crops, bad news for an 
agricultural economy mired in its worst slump in over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA lowered its projected prices for wheat by 15 cents and by 5  
cents for corn and soybeans because crops are doing better than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Such price declines usually have little effect on consumers, but  
the forecast is likely to intensify pressure on Congress to approve 
another bailout of the farm economy. Farm groups already are asking 
for at least $8 billion in aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``These prices are so low they're confiscatory,'' said Sen. Kent  
Conrad, D-N.D., who wants to put $9 billion in farm assistance in a 
USDA spending bill that's pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have said it's too early in the  
year to know how much federal aid farmers will need. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is going to have to act. ... I don't think they can  
wait any longer,'' said Tom Buis, a lobbyist for the National 
Farmers Union. ``The pressure is too great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While farmers will benefit from the good crops, the higher  
yields won't offset the low prices, said analyst Don Roose, 
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. Corn prices could drop another 
20 cents a bushel as the growing season progresses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said today it expected farmers this year to harvest 1.7  
billion bushels of winter wheat, 4 percent more than was forecast a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are getting a record 47 bushels per acre despite heavy  
rainfall last month that delayed the harvest in Kansas, the heart 
of winter wheat production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices are now expected to average $2.45 to $2.95 a  
bushel. Two years ago, before a worldwide glut of grain drove 
prices down sharply, wheat was selling for an average of $3.38 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Good weather in the Midwest led USDA to raise its forecast of  
corn production to 9.7 billion bushels, up from 9.4 billion, last 
month's projection. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices are expected to average $1.95 a bushel this year,  
compared to $2.43 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices are expected to be as low as $3.90 to $4.70 a  
bushel, the lowest level since the early 1970s and down from an 
average price of $6.47 in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Congress Faces Summer of Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress faces a summertime clash of agendas,  
with majority Republicans determined to craft a tax cut while 
tending to routine spending bills and Democrats eager to emphasize 
health care and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen months before the national elections, neither side wants  
to dismiss the potential for bipartisanship on these or other 
issues such as Medicare. ``There will be plenty of time for 
politics in the months to come,'' President Clinton declared 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, he met top lawmakers of both parties the White  
House as Congress returned from a week-long break. Participants 
said the hour-long session was amiable and that while no 
differences were bridged the president stressed his willingness to 
work on Medicare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans express skepticism about Clinton's motives,  
fearing he will try to outmaneuver them rather than make a deal. 
They also take for granted that the Democrats, striving to gain 
control of the House in 2000, oppose significant legislation. ``The 
coming weeks offer many challenges for House Republicans as we work 
to provide tax fairness and relief and reduce the size and scope of 
the federal government,'' Republican leader Dick Armey wrote his 
colleagues during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, House Democrats are perpetually fearful that  
Clinton will compromise with the GOP, to their disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend in both the House and Senate is for politically driven  
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying higher taxes today than at any time since  
World War II,'' says Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, who will preside 
this week over a Ways and Means Committee tax cut drafting session. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason for this (budget) surplus is because taxpayers  
are paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the details of Archer's tax cut are known, Democrats  
are studying the outlines, the better to charge that it would 
benefit the wealthy to the detriment of priorities such as Social 
Security, Medicare, health care and education. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly sworn in treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, said  
over the weekend that a 10-year tax cut in the range of $700 
billion to $800 billion, roughly what Republicans are weighing, 
would face a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the  
tax-writing committee, said the centerpiece of the GOP proposal, a 
10 percent across-the-board cut, would deny any break to about 45 
million families. Those taxpayers don't make enough to pay income 
tax, he said, ``even though they work hard and endure a high tax 
burden in the form of payroll and excise taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, Republicans will do their best to focus  
public attention on tax cuts, an issue where they fare well in the 
polls. The bill will be drafted in House committee this week, and 
begin making its way through the Senate in different form next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP high command hopes to have a compromise bill through  
both houses of Congress by the time lawmakers leave Washington for 
a month-long break on Aug. 6. They would send it to the White House 
after Labor Day and give Clinton a choice of signing it or 
explaining a veto in a time of enormous federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	If Democrats are playing defense on tax cuts, they hope to use  
their July to focus attention on gun control and health care, two 
issues where the polls give them an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Health care was the first post-recess order of business in the  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic bill on the floor would expand the rights of  
patients in HMOs, affecting millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bill lets health care professionals make medical decisions  
about your health, not insurance company accountants,'' Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle told a news conference during the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues to be debated include the right to see a specialist  
and the right to sue for non-coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans oppose the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic bill would add 4.8 percent to the cost for  
patients and HMOs, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on 
Sunday. ``And for every 1 percent, about a million people will lose 
their coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome on the Senate floor is unpredictable, and under the  
rules in effect, Democrats could win the first several skirmishes 
only to see many or all of their early victories wiped out on a 
final vote on a GOP-drafted measure. 
</P>
<P>
	But several Democrats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
there was a political objective as well. With a large crop of 
freshman Republican senators facing the voters in 2000, Democrats 
were eager to force them to vote on amendments favored by the 
public but opposed by traditional Republican business allies. 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign finance measure is also likely on the Senate floor  
later in the month, an issue that most Democrats favor and most 
Republicans oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also intend to renew their push for gun control  
legislation, with polls showing strong support for such measures in 
the wake of this spring's high school shootings in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	With the House Appropriations Committee scheduled to draft a  
routine spending bill on Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers readied 
amendments to deal with child safety locks for guns, the 
importation of high capacity ammunition and a requirement for 
background checks for sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic advocates of gun control hope for a public relations  
boost later in the week. That's when Colorado high school students 
are to come to the Capitol and lobby. Some of those making the trip 
are from Columbine, where last spring's shootings occurred.

<HEADLINE> Church Split Over Same-Sex Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- The members of Wesleyan Fellowship are  
religious nomads, attending services in borrowed churches and 
dutifully checking e-mail to make sure they know at which sanctuary 
to meet each week. 
</P>
<P>
	Services are held Sunday evenings -- when churches are available.  
</P>
<P>
	They once belonged to the 5,000-member First United Methodist  
Church, where the elite families of this Atlanta suburb have 
worshiped for generations. Gov. Roy Barnes is among those in the 
pews every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, about 900 people -- including Republican Rep. Bob  
Barr -- split from the church. They left with their pastor, the Rev. 
Charles Sineath, after two years of protesting what they see as 
growing acceptance of same-sex marriages by state and national 
Methodist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sineath, the church's pastor of 22 years, fell out of favor with  
state Methodist leaders by criticizing a decision to allow same-sex 
marriages in chapels at Emory University, a Methodist school in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes -- a Democrat who has been a member of the church for 30  
years and was married there -- said he decided to stay because of 
close ties to the church and to friends, not because of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Same-sex marriages are prohibited by the law of this state and  
the discipline of the Methodist Church,'' he said. ``I agree with 
abiding by the law and I agree with the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barr said his family left the church out of loyalty to Sineath.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our congregation and our pastor should not be punished for  
doing what he and the Bible believes is right and for what we 
always have stood for,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate has divided neighbors and friends, many of whom have  
worshiped at First United Methodist for over 50 years. Most in the 
congregation say they oppose same-sex unions, but not enough to 
break with the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't easy to leave,'' said Ginger Harris, who had been a  
member of First United since 1956. ``But the decision -- biblically 
and standing on your convictions -- was pretty clear cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sineath said: ``It's kind of like when the doctor says, `You  
need chemotherapy' and another one says, `No, you need radiation.' 
Both of them agree there's cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split underscores the difficulty some Methodist churches  
have in welcoming homosexual parishioners without endorsing their 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``If homosexuals want to worship here, they're welcome. All  
people are welcome in these doors,'' said Sam Storey, the First 
United's associate pastor. ``But we don't believe that lifestyle is 
compatible with Christian teachings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who joined the Wesleyan Fellowship are generally younger  
than those who remained at First United. 
</P>
<P>
	The departing members also were among the church's heftiest  
donors. The split will cost the church about $1 million annually, 
about a third of its budget, said Jack Miller, chairman of the 
church staff parish committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over homosexuality within the Methodist church  
exploded nationally in 1997 after Jimmy Creech, a Methodist 
minister in Omaha, Neb., performed a lesbian marriage in defiance 
of his bishop. A church jury acquitted Creech of disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech's actions prompted the church's Judicial Council in  
August 1998 to take a Methodist guideline prohibiting gay marriages 
and make it church law, meaning pastors who violated the rule could 
be defrocked. 
</P>
<P>
	While nearly 1,000 people turned out for the Wesleyan Fellowship  
on a recent Sunday, an equal number of worshipers filled the pews 
at Marietta First to hear the first sermon from their new pastor, 
the Rev. Joe Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
	His topic? Forgiveness.  
</P>
<P>
	``If forgiveness doesn't happen in church, where will it  
happen?'' Peabody asked.

<HEADLINE> Big Mac Conquers Green Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Green Monster met its match Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire didn't just conquer The Wall. He embarrassed it,  
making it look like little more than a picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't even dent the 86-year-old icon. He sent one soaring  
off the light tower, about 100 feet above the field and 60 feet 
above the wall's top. Clearing Lansdowne Street wasn't impossible. 
A few seemed to soar over the Mass Pike toward the Citgo sign in 
Kenmore Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on an official off-day, McGwire set another home run  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ken Griffey Jr. repeated as Home Run Derby champion  
Monday night, it was all anticlimactic. Fenway Park was buzzing 
about McGwire's 13 home runs in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	All the other All-Stars were on their feet, applauding him. Just  
like all of baseball last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's 13 homers off Tim Flannery broke the one-round record  
set by Cal Ripken in 1991 at Toronto's SkyDome. Big Mac's attack 
totaled 5,692 feet -- more than a mile -- and a lot more than he hit 
one mile up at Denver's Coors Field last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I didn't do so good in the home-run contest,'' said  
McGwire, who hit four at Coors. ``In these home-run contests, it's 
up to the pitcher. Tim got me in a good grove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit 18 home runs at Fenway while he played for the  
Oakland Athletics, got just three in the second round and didn't 
make it to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting and waiting tired me out,'' he said. ``I probably  
tried a little too hard. I was more relaxed in the first round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, like Ted Williams showing left-handed hitters can flash  
power at Fenway, hit 10 homers in the second round, including a 
460-foot shot to the back of the center-field triangle and an 
opposite-field drive over The Wall and into the screen. Milwaukee's

<HEADLINE> Accor S.A. To Buy Red Roof Inns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The owner of the Motel 6 chain moved to  
strengthen its hold of the low-end lodging business Monday with an 
offer to buy Red Roof Inns Inc. for $673 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris-based Accor S.A. plans to merge the two chains to create  
Accor Economy Lodging, a new subsidiary with about 120,000 rooms in 
more than 1,100 motels. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, the two chains will make Accor the No. 2 player in the  
``limited services'' category of the hotel industry, said John 
Rohs, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Days Inn, based in Parsippany, N.J., is the industry leader with  
more than 1,800 motels and more than 160,000 rooms worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision has not been made to base the new subsidiary in  
Dallas, home of Motel 6, or in the Columbus area, where Red Roof is 
based in suburban Hilliard, said Francis ``Butch'' Cash, Red Roof 
chairman, chief executive officer and president. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will reward shareholders by providing financial  
assistance to pursue more aggressive expansion plans, said Cash, 
who said he would step down after the deal is completed. Accor is 
buying the company to boost growth more quickly, he said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Roof, which reported revenue of $375.3 million in 1998,  
operates 322 hotels with more than 37,000 rooms, mainly in the 
Midwest, East and South. Despite lower fourth-quarter earnings, the 
company posted a $38.1 million profit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Accor said it plans to acquire all 29.6 million outstanding  
shares of Red Roof for $22.75 a share. In addition, it will assume 
about $500 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer represents a premium of 27.5 percent over the stock's  
average price over the past 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and other investors who  
together own 68.3 percent of Red Roof shares have agreed to the 
deal, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, the two chains complement each other, Cash said. Red  
Roof charges roughly $50 a night and attracts an equal number of 
business and leisure travelers. Motel 6, which is generally in the 
under $40 category, gets about 65 percent of its business from 
leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Red Roof probably could have continued to operate as  
an independent entity, the takeover by Accor will allow the chain 
to grow more quickly, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Accor also operates the Novotel and Sofitel hotel groups in the  
United States. It has 130,000 employees at hotels, travel agencies, 
car rental companies and corporate service organizations in 140 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement boosted Red Roof shares by $4.25, to $22.56 1/4,  
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange Monday.

<HEADLINE> Quebecor Printing Acquiring US Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Quebecor Printing Inc. plans to acquire  
World Color Press Inc., creating the world's largest commercial 
printer. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.4 billion cash and stock deal, announced Monday, will  
create a company called Quebecor World Inc. that will serve 
customers in magazines, catalogs, books, retail inserts and 
circulars and direct mail printing. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, a subsidiary of Quebecor Printing will  
acquire World Color Press through a tender offer to purchase World 
Color shares for $36.09 a share in cash or stock. 
</P>
<P>
	That represents a 30 percent premium over the average trading  
price of World Color shares since July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebecor Printing said about $840 million of the purchase price  
would be for cash and the rest for stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Quebecor is assuming $1.3 billion in World Color  
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer is subject to 50.1 percent of World Color shares being  
tendered to the offer and regulatory approvals. Both the tender 
offer and the merger are expected to be completed within four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebecor Printing, based in Montreal, is the largest printer in  
Europe and the second-largest printer in North America and South 
America, with 1998 revenues of $3.8 billion and 26,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	World Color, headquartered in Greenwich, is one of the leading  
commercial printers in the United States. The company has 16,000 
employees and had revenue of $2.5 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of World Color rose $5.18 3/4 a share, or 17 percent, to $35  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> USDA Sees Lower Prices for Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices for wheat, corn and other major crops  
are heading down, according to a government forecast that is 
certain to increase pressure on Congress to approve another big 
bailout of the agricultural economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops are doing so well that on Monday the Agriculture  
Department lowered its projected prices for wheat by 15 cents a 
bushel from a month ago and for corn and soybeans by 5 cents. 
Soybean prices will be the lowest they've been since the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``These prices are so low they're confiscatory,'' said Sen. Kent  
Conrad, D-N.D., who wants to include $9 billion in farm assistance 
in a USDA spending bill that is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices are now expected to average between $2.45 to $2.95  
a bushel this year because of the oversupply. Three years ago, 
before a worldwide glut of grain drove prices down sharply, wheat 
was selling for an average of $4.30 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, wheat sold for $2 a bushel, or $13.67 a bushel in 1998  
dollars. A pound of bread cost 14 cents in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The slump in commodity prices is expected to have little impact  
on consumers because raw commodities generally account for only a 
fraction of the price of food. For example, farmers receive 7 cents 
of each dollar consumers spend on baked goods and cereal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect commodity prices to drop further, especially if  
the weather remains good. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher yields won't offset the low prices, said analyst Don  
Roose, president of U.S. Commodities Inc. Corn prices could drop 
another 20 cents a bushel as the growing season progresses, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The normal seasonal pattern would indicate we would get some  
more declines. Prices are typically lowest at harvest,'' said Mike 
Singer, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress gave farmers $6 billion in emergency aid last year to  
compensate for low prices and weather-related crop losses. This 
year, farm groups are asking for at least $8 billion more. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican congressional leaders have said it's too early in the  
year to know how much federal aid farmers will need and they want 
the Clinton administration to propose an aid package before 
offering one of their own. The chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, Texas Republican Larry Combest, said earlier this month 
he wants to hold hearings before Congress decides how much money to 
distribute and in what form. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is going to have to act. ... I don't think they can  
wait any longer,'' said Tom Buis, a lobbyist for the National 
Farmers Union. ``The pressure is too great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USDA said Monday it expected farmers this year to harvest 1.7  
billion bushels of winter wheat, 4 percent more than was forecast a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are getting a record 47 bushels per acre despite heavy  
rainfall last month that delayed the harvest in Kansas, the heart 
of winter wheat production. 
</P>
<P>
	Production is also up in Europe, China and Australia, more than  
offsetting declines in other wheat-growing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Good weather in the Midwest led USDA to raise its forecast of  
corn production to 9.7 billion bushels, up from last month's 
projection of 9.4 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of corn, which is used primarily for livestock feed,  
is expected to average between $1.65 and $2.05 this year, down from 
$2.43 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices are expected to be between $3.90 and $4.70 a  
bushel, down from an average price of $6.47 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ugly business right now,'' said Bill Flory, president  
of the National Association of Wheat Growers. ``We are going to 
survive and we are going to prosper, but it's going to take a 
while.''

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Could Miss 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, England (AP) -- Michael Schumacher could be  
sidelined for at least three months after breaking his leg in two 
places during a high-speed crash in the British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ferrari driver, who was recovering today in Northampton  
General Hospital following surgery on his right leg, is almost 
certain to be out of contention for the Formula One drivers' 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he is expected to make a return before the end of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was lucky to escape more serious injury after his  
Ferrari crashed head-on into a tire-wall after the brakes appeared 
to jam about 30 seconds into Sunday's race at Silverstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder what would have happened years ago with such an  
accident,'' Ferrari team manager Jean Todt said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar accident killed Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna in 1994  
at the Monza track in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Northampton General Hospital chief executive David Wilson today  
said Schumacher had spent a comfortable night, his wounds were 
healing and he was moving his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently he is having his dressings changed and will be  
starting physiotherapy,'' Wilson read from a statement. ``He will 
be staying at the hospital until at least tomorrow (Tuesday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon Dr. Bill Ribbans described the 90-minute operation on  
Schumacher as a standard procedure, and that some pins were placed 
in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials and surgeons declined to comment on how long  
Schumacher will be out of racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, however, said: ``I think surgeons would normally say 12  
to 16 weeks for a normal everyday person like you or me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Syd Watkins, an F1 medical delegate, estimated  
Schumacher would be out of action for six weeks in a period which 
includes upcoming races in Austria, Germany and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian GP is August 15. The two following races, in  
Belgium on Aug. 29 and Italy on Sept. 9, also would be in jeopardy. 
The remaining three races of the season are the European GP in 
Germany, the Malaysian GP on Oct. 12 and the Japanese GP on Oct. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	Todt said he was ``confident'' that Schumacher would be back  
before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the case, Schumacher's bid for his third World Drivers'  
Championship looks in doubt, as does his bid to bring Ferrari its 
first drivers' title in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's race, the eighth of the season, Schumacher shares  
second place in the standings with Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine on 
32 points. McLaren's Mika Hakkinen leads with 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Todt said Schumacher is ``in good spirits'' and his wife,  
Corinna, arrived at the hospital on Sunday night. Racing fans sent 
dozens of floral arrangements to the hospital to help cheer the 
German driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is all right,'' Todt said. ``Racing sometimes gives  
joy, sometimes gives sadness. Yesterday it was sadness. We can 
always see that things could be worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todt said team officials still can't explain what caused the  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know precisely yet what happened,'' he said. ``Brake  
problems probably. (Schumacher) felt he lost the brakes in the rear 
of his car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luca Badoer, who drove for the Minardi team at Silverstone, is  
on contract to Ferrari and was expected to test drive today and 
Tuesday. Todt declined to comment whether he would be the permanent 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Another named mentioned to step in for Schumacher is former F1  
driver Mika Salo.

<HEADLINE> IBM Buys Sequent for %810 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM announced today it would pay $810 million  
for Sequent Computer Systems Inc., a struggling maker of powerful 
business computers, in a cash deal that aims to fill an important 
slot in IBM's product line. 
</P>
<P>
	Sequent is a leading seller of high-end computers and software  
that use Intel Corp.'s microprocessor chips. IBM, the world's 
largest computer maker, plans to use Sequent's specialized 
technology in networked machines it will pitch as an inexpensive 
substitute to traditional mainframes that handle the biggest 
computer jobs, such as tracking inventories or millions of bank 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Intel chips are not widely used as the brains in the  
heaviest-duty computers, that could change next year, when the No. 
1 chip maker releases a long-awaited next-generation chip called 
Merced intended to work with big business machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Sequent's leading technology, the company has succeeded  
only in attracting a handful of big corporate customers. Its 
financial results have been viewed by Wall Street as mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM already is allied with Sequent and Santa Cruz Operation Inc.  
to produce a new version of the Unix operating system for Intel's 
high-powered Merced computer chip. That work helped spark IBM's 
interest in buying the company, said Robert Stephenson, an IBM 
senior vice president who heads its server division. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM plans to sell Sequent's computers as well as integrate  
Sequent's technology into its own machines. Beaverton, Ore.-based 
Sequent has about 2,500 employees. No job cuts are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM will pay $18 cash for each of Sequent's outstanding shares,  
plus additional cash. It hopes to complete the transaction this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM shares were down $1.43 3/4 share at $135.93 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange this morning. Sequent's shares were down 18 3/4 cents a 
share at $17.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Lott Predicts Holbrooke Will Be OKed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority leader Trent Lott says he  
expects his chamber will eventually confirm Richard Holbrooke as 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations despite the roadblock that 
Lott and three other senators have placed on a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that he  
didn't know when the vote on Holbrooke would occur, but ``I think 
he will'' be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's chief deputy, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., agreed there  
will be a vote to confirm Holbrooke, a veteran diplomat whose 
nomination received the unanimous recommendation of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is we'll eventually get around to a vote, but  
certainly ... all senators have a right to discuss nominations at 
length if they want,'' Nickles said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``Some 
people have some problems with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate procedures allow members to keep a nomination from the  
floor for unrelated reasons as a pressure tactic against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have placed holds, without  
publicly acknowledging them, on the Holbrooke nomination to force 
President Clinton to nominate Bradley A. Smith, a university 
professor from Ohio, to the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The other holds are by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who is  
trying to reverse a State Department disciplinary action against a 
former department employee at the U.N. mission; and Sen. George 
Voinovich, R-Ohio, who is protesting administration policy in the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Smith, who has said Clinton's administration is  
probably the most corrupt in American history, Lott seemed not to 
recall his name but said it ``sounds familiar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley Smith is your candidate ...,'' interviewer Tim Russert  
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh. Brad Smith. Right,'' Lott said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, first of all, I think a little too much has been made of  
that,'' he said. ``I suspect the nomination of Holbrooke to go to 
the U.N. will be confirmed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he couldn't say when, because others also had holds on  
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., appearing with Nickles on Fox,  
expressed irritation with the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I wanted to say is let's debate these issues in  
the light of the day, not in the back room in our cloakrooms,'' 
Reid said. ``We're the most powerful nation in the world, (and) we 
don't have a representative in the United Nations. That's not 
right.''

<HEADLINE> Hometown To Celebrate Hemingway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK PARK, Ill. (AP) -- Ernest Hemingway's hometown is marking the  
100th anniversary of his birth with a weeklong celebration, 
including scholarly discussions, a $250-a-plate dinner and an 
ersatz running of the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Oak Park clearly thinks the world of Papa, it's not  
clear what Hemingway thought of Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nobel Prize winner wrote extensively about other places he  
lived and worked, such as Paris, Cuba, Spain, Italy, Key West and 
Africa, but he never wrote about the town where he was born and 
raised, at least not by name. And in a famous quotation, he is said 
to have called the Chicago suburb a place of ``broad lawns and 
narrow minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But no one can really pin down where Hemingway said that, or to  
whom, and many now believe he did not say it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually never said that. I'm so positive of that,'' says  
Kim Quarles, a board member at the Ernest Hemingway Foundation of 
Oak Park, which is organizing the birthday celebration. Then, 
slowly and with emphasis added to each word, she adds: ``He never 
did say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even if he did, they're going to celebrate his life anyhow.  
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has planned a pricey dinner called La Fete  
Ecrivain (``The Writer's Feast'') Wednesday at Chicago's Four 
Seasons Hotel. The rest of the week includes a premiere of a play 
based on Hemingway short stories and written by his 
daughter-in-law, swing dancing, a literary conference, Spanish food 
and an event in which replica bulls on wheels will chase runners 
through the suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration culminates on July 21, Hemingway's birthday,  
with the rededication of the house where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career as a writer, Hemingway traveled extensively  
and gained a reputation as a macho hunter, fisherman, boozer and 
womanizer. He was married four times. His descent into psychosis 
and his suicide in 1961 only added to the legend, which for many is 
so large it obscures Hemingway's art. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, merchandisers have begun using Hemingway's  
name or image to sell everything from home furnishings to duck 
decoys. The centennial has also been marked by the publication of 
another Hemingway book, a mixture of autobiography and fiction 
called ``True at First Light,'' which his son Patrick assembled 
from unfinished manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's overshadowed by Hemingway the star,'' says Alfred  
Appel, an English professor at Northwestern University who calls 
Hemingway ``probably the most influential artist of the century.'' 
``All this -- the birthday parties, the T-shirts and fishing hats 
for sale -- is a whole other area that I think compromises 
Hemingway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Hemingway Foundation, they say it's Hemingway the writer  
that interests them most. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we celebrate a little of the man -- the legend -- but  
the artist is what draws me to him,'' says Scot Schwar, executive 
director of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hemingway's best-known works are probably the novels ``A  
Farewell to Arms,'' ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' ``The Sun Also 
Rises'' and ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' Appel cites the book of 
short stories ``In Our Time'' as the author's finest work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see in there the main thing of Hemingway, which is the  
sustaining of wounds, psychic and actual, and how a sensitive 
person -- Nick Adams -- manages in the modern world,'' Appel says. 
``That's his great theme.''

<HEADLINE> Kasich Might Be Getting Out of Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich's latest campaign swing  
through New Hampshire could be his last, with rumblings that he may 
be ready to abandon his quest for the Republican presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to rumors that he planned to endorse another  
candidate this week, the Ohio congressman did not deny the 
possibility Sunday as he campaigned in the state for the 10th time 
since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether a decision had been made, Kasich only reiterated  
that when he wanted to talk about it, he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get to the point where we've made a decision and are  
going to talk about it, we'll let you know,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokesman, Todd Harris, stressed that unlike some other  
Republican hopefuls who are certain they will run, Kasich has an 
exploratory committee and he is doing just that -- exploring his 
chances. He said he didn't know how much more exploring Kasich had 
to do before announcing a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kasich were to give up his shot at the nomination, he would  
be the first dropout among 12 Republicans. He has lagged far behind 
the clear GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, with about 3 
percent support in a recent poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts believe that field will be reduced significantly  
following next month's straw poll in Iowa, if not before. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican analyst Tom Rath of Concord said that at a recent  
Republican National Committee meeting in Philadelphia, he heard 
that Kasich and other cash-strapped candidates may be close to 
dropping out. But he said he did not know of any final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money and political reality are going to force a lot of these  
people to take a look at where they are,'' Rath said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich met with a dozen residents at a historic carriage house  
in Concord on Sunday and portrayed himself as a down-to-earth guy, 
telling stories of speaking with voters who didn't realize they 
were talking to a candidate.

<HEADLINE> Schilling To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Curt Schilling's latest triumph was yet  
another tough loss for Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling was officially announced today as the starter for the  
National League in Tuesday's All-Star game, with NL manager Bruce 
Bochy choosing the Philadelphia ace over Arizona's Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Randy's numbers are not indicative of how he's  
thrown,'' Bochy said today, referring to Johnson's 9-7 record. 
``Curt has had a tremendous year. Their ERAs are close. I feel that 
with Curt, with the extra day's rest he was gettting, I could count 
on two innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling has 13 victories, one fewer than Kent Bottenfield of  
St. Louis. He is tied with Johnson for the major league lead with 
seven complete games and is second in the NL to Johnson in 
strikeouts. On Sunday, Schilling declined to confirm he was Bochy's 
choice -- although he was seen accepting congratulations in the 
clubhouse after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know who's starting,'' said Schilling, named to his third  
straight All-Star team, on Sunday. ``I've got a pretty good idea 
who will have the ball when the game starts. The manager is going 
to announce it tomorrow, and we'll all have fun talking about it 
tomorrow. It's not my job to announce it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just more than a week ago, Bochy was leaning toward starting  
Johnson on Tuesday at Fenway Park. But the Arizona left-hander has 
been victimized by his own offense. Arizona hasn't scored a run in 
the last 34 innings Johnson has been on the mound. Johnson is 0-4 
in his last four starts despite allowing a total of five earned 
runs and striking out 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Pedro Martinez will start for the American League.  
</P>
<P>
	Schilling was selected to the All-Star team in 1997 and '98 and  
pitched two scoreless innings two years ago at Jacobs Field in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his career in the Red Sox organization, but was  
traded to Baltimore with Brady Anderson for Mike Boddicker in 1988. 
He was dealt to Houston with Pete Harnisch and Steve Finley for 
Glenn Davis in 1991, and then traded to Philadelphia for Jason 
Grimsley in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Sting Fire Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Sting, expected to vie for  
the WNBA Eastern Conference title but off to a mediocre start, 
fired head coach and general manager Marynell Meadors on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadors was fired the day after the Sting's record fell to 5-7  
with an 82-56 loss to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Dan Hughes was named interim coach. Charlotte  
Hornets general manager Bob Bass will assume managerial 
responsibilities for the Sting. 
</P>
<P>
	``With two-thirds of our schedule left, we feel like there is  
still enough time for use to make a run at the championship,'' said 
Sting executive vice president Sam Russo. ``But given our record 
and our inconsistency over the last calendar year, we needed to 
make a change at the top to get us back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the presence of several marquee players -- including  
Olympic gold medalist Dawn Staley, WNBA rookie of the year Tracy 
Reid and Stephanie White-McCarty, who led Purdue to the 1999 NCAA 
title over Duke -- the Sting is mired in third place in the Eastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all believed at the beginning of the season that we had a  
team with enough talent to win the Eastern Conference championship 
and make a run for the WNBA title,'' Hughes said. ``We still 
believe that. This team can play a lot better than it has of late, 
and we need to prove that to the rest of the league, as well as to 
ourselves, beginning tomorrow night against Washington.''

<HEADLINE> Martinez, Schilling To Start Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Not many hitters have given Pedro Martinez trouble  
this season. So he's not about to worry now that he has to face 
Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and the rest of the NL's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``What should I do, start crying?'' he said with a laugh Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	No, just keep pitching the way he's been doing all season. He's  
15-3, the most wins in the majors, with a 2.10 ERA. He'll be the AL 
starter in Tuesday night's All-Star game in his home park against 
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pitch the only way I know. I'm not going to switch  
anything,'' said Martinez, chosen for his fourth straight All-Star 
game, the last two with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	That can't be good news for the National Leaguers, who had to  
face Martinez in his two seasons with Los Angeles and four with 
Montreal before he was traded to Boston before the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	NL catcher Mike Piazza was with the Dodgers in Martinez's rookie  
season in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Catching him, I knew he was going to be an outstanding  
pitcher,'' Piazza said. ``He can make you look bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of American Leaguers would agree. In 132 2-3 innings,  
Martinez has allowed just five homers, struck out 184 and walked 
only 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I have a hit against him yet,'' said AL second  
baseman Robbie Alomar of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He throws so many pitches. His ball moves,'' said Cleveland's  
Kenny Lofton, the starting left fielder. ``He can throw one ball 70 
(mph) and the next one 96. You don't see that every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has a chance to become baseball's first 30-game winner since  
Denny McLain won 31 in 1968. That's a longshot since starters 
usually work on four days rest instead of three as they did 31 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not impossible.  
</P>
<P>
	``The chances are there if you get the outings,'' said Martinez,  
who has a decision in all 18 of his starts. Then he added, with a 
smile, ``After getting 25 (wins) I'll probably ask to pitch every 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was little doubt he would start Tuesday night because of  
his outstanding record and the site of the game at Fenway Park, 
which ``makes it really special,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the only choice,'' AL manager Joe Torre said.  
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Schilling as the starter didn't come until  
Sunday when he got a call from NL manager Bruce Bochy. The other 
leading candidate was Randy Johnson. He was 9-3 before losing his 
last four decisions despite striking out 54 and allowing just five 
earned runs. Arizona hasn't scored in Johnson's last 34 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to be chosen to get the start,'' said Schilling  
(13-4) ``but seeing the lineup they're throwing out there, it might 
not have bothered me throwing second or third.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, on his third consecutive All-Star team, said, ``I'm  
as nervous for this as I've been for any game I've ever pitched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Martinez, Schilling has a link to the Red Sox, although  
that was severed more than a decade ago. They drafted him in 1986 
before trading him and Brady Anderson to Baltimore for Mike 
Boddicker in 1988. He went to Houston in 1991 and has been with the 
Phillies since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said, when asked if he had any bad feelings about  
leaving Boston, ``because I think everything that's happened to me 
happened for a reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling takes a five-game winning streak into the game. In his  
last start, he allowed eight hits in his seventh complete game, a 
4-2 win over Baltimore on Friday. He is tied with Johnson for the 
major league lead in complete games and second in the NL to Johnson 
in strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is Curt the starter?'' AL backup catcher Brad Ausmus of  
Detroit said. ``That's a full concentration at bat right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez has been even tougher.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's somebody I've always watched with a little bit of  
admiration,'' Schilling said. ``Watching him this year, for me, has 
been like a Triple-A player watching the big leagues. He's on 
another level.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP To Sue Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP plans to sue handgun manufacturers,  
distributors and importers, seeking restrictions on the marketing 
and sale of firearms in hopes of keeping guns from criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The formal announcement was expected today from President Kweisi  
Mfume at the 90th annual convention of the National Association for 
the Advancement of Colored People, said sources within the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would put the nation's largest civil rights group in  
league with cities like New Orleans, Chicago, Cleveland and Boston 
which have sued the firearms industry in hopes of curbing street 
and schoolyard violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit will seek no monetary damages, said the sources, who  
spoke on condition of anonymity. Instead, it will seek injunctions 
to force gun makers to better monitor where guns are distributed 
and to limit multiple purchases by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a federal jury in New York returned a $4  
million verdict based upon a new strategy by plaintiffs -- that the 
industry's negligence in marketing and distribution allowed weapons 
to flow illegally to states with strict anti-gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Last February, Mfume said the NAACP was considering such a suit.  
``We represent a significant constituency that is 
disproportionately affected by gun violence,'' he said then. ``The 
time has come for us to look at the proliferation of handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's intention to sue reflects a widespread frustration  
among policy makers with gun proliferation and lethal shooting 
attacks in schools, most recently in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	During the recent U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in New  
Orleans, a bipartisan group called on House leaders to enact a 
strict gun safety bill. More than 100 mayors signed a letter to 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., asking that Congress raise 
the minimum age for gun purchases and require background checks for 
all gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the suits said recent government studies show that  
greater oversight by the gun industry could help keep firearms out 
of criminal hands. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  
found that 51 percent of the guns used in crimes by people aged 18 
to 24 were purchased illegally over the last three years from 
licensed dealers by people acting as intermediaries for the real 
owners.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Votes To Cut F-22 Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over Pentagon objections, the House is nearing  
a vote to eliminate funds for building the advanced but costly F-22 
stealth fighter, proposing to use the money instead to expand the 
fleet of older F-15s and F-16s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Appropriations defense subcommittee, in closed session  
Monday, voted to divert $1.8 billion from the program intended to 
buy six of the high-tech aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that development of the F-22 was based on ``assessments  
made during the Cold War,'' Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., the 
subcommittee chairman, told reporters. ``It seems timely for the 
Air Force to pause in its pursuit of the F-22 and reassess if world 
events have warranted a change in course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the F-22 ``made sense when we faced enemies who had  
the expertise to develop advanced aircraft and the ability to 
produce large numbers of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The full Appropriations Committee was expected to take up the  
issue this week or next as part of a $263 billion Pentagon spending 
bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Lawmakers involved in 
defense spending said the full committee would likely go along with 
the subcommittee's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	When it gets to the full House, the proposal will have important  
support from House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. The shift 
in funds would mean eight new F-15s to be built at Boeing Co.'s 
plant in St. Louis, instead of the four included in a Senate-passed 
bill, and would help keep that production line running through 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real issue for the future for us domestically is, do we go  
to the F-22 or do we do the research here and make this keep 
going,'' Gephardt said in an interview. ``It's a very 
cost-effective alternative. The F-22 is estimated to cost as much 
as $300 million per plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However the F-22 matter plays out, the measure would have to be  
reconciled with a Senate-passed bill that includes the full $1.8 
billion for the six F-22s. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration requested an overall $3 billion for the F-22  
program, including $1.2 billion for research and development. The 
House panel left the $1.2 billion in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the panel's action would freeze the program in place,  
but he did not rule out its resumption in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon contends the F-22 fighter, which uses stealth or  
radar-evading technology, is needed to replace aging F-15s and 
F-16s in the coming century. The plane is intended primarily to 
combat enemy fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	House defense appropriators questioned the overall $62.1 billion  
price tag on the program to produce the entire line of 339 F-22s. 
The Air Force now has two of the planes. The program has been 
plagued with delays and cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Jay DeFrank, an Air Force spokesman, said, ``We are  
currently evaluating the impacts of this action on our tactical 
aircraft modernization program.'' He said production money for the 
F-22 is needed to meet ``the Air Force requirement to maintain air 
superiority into the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work with the House Appropriations Committee to  
address the concerns that led to their action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon later issued a statement saying it was ``surprised  
and disappointed'' by the subcommittee action. ``The department 
remains convinced that the F-22 is the revolutionary advance in 
fighter design that is needed to maintain air superiority in the 
next century,'' the statement said. ``The department does not 
believe that the facts justify this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill includes money to pay for a 4.8 percent  
military pay increase, up from the 4.4 percent requested by the 
administration, and increases spending on equipment and weapons 
modernization by $9 billion over this year's level.

<HEADLINE> US Women's Team Leaves Lasting Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The three-week joy ride to the World Cup  
title isn't over for the U.S. women's team. The celebrations have 
only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The critical question, though, is what lasting effect the most  
celebrated team and most successful event in women's sports history 
will have. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the legacy of the women's team be ``establishing this  
Women's World Cup as the event responsible for the development of 
women's sports,'' as tournament organizer Marla Messing predicted? 
</P>
<P>
	Might soccer no longer be relegated to the back pages of  
America's sports section, or not included at all? 
</P>
<P>
	Could what all of those impressive grass-roots numbers -- as many  
under-12s playing the game as any other sport -- finally translate 
into more popularity on a general level for soccer in the United 
States? 
</P>
<P>
	``The legacy I want to leave is that no longer can anyone take  
women athletes lightly,'' U.S. forward Tiffeny Milbrett said. 
``There are no more excuses for not embracing the game. You can't 
say it will not draw; we proved that wrong from the first game of 
this tournament. You can't say it is not marketable and you can't 
say it is not popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. women's team ever has been embraced by the public the  
way this squad was on its way to the final, which it won Saturday 
5-4 on penalty kicks after a 0-0 tie through 120 minutes. Ever 
since Brandi Chastain's kick won it, the women have been on a 
whirlwind tour that took them to Disneyland, to downtown Los 
Angeles and, today, across the continent for television appearances 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	More personal appearances are scheduled, with several players  
appearing in golf pro-ams preceding PGA and LPGA events. Television 
and print ads are upcoming. Adulation is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing to see the difference in attention,'' U.S.  
veteran Kristine Lilly said. ``It's hard to be normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody expects normal. On Saturday, the final was the  
most-watched soccer game ever on U.S. network television, with ABC 
estimating an audience of 40 million. The game posted a 13.3 
overnight rating and a 32 share for the network, 4 percent more 
than the previous record, a 12.8 for the 1994 men's World Cup 
final, also played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they were the guests of honor at Disneyland, the  
centerpieces of a parade attended, naturally, by hundreds of young 
girls and boys. Then they were honored at a rally in downtown LA, 
where they were told their bonuses, originally set at $12,500, were 
raised to between $40,000 and $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Queen Mother doesn't have enough money to pay these women  
what they deserve right now,'' Hank Steinbrecher, general secretary 
of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said. 
</P>
<P>
	After some deserved time off, most of the champions likely will  
gather for a victory tour, followed by the U.S. Women's Cup in 
early October. Several veterans, including 33-year-old Michelle 
Akers, who left the final after regulation time due to exhaustion 
and a slight concussion, might skip that event. 
</P>
<P>
	There also might be an international tour for late this year and  
early 2000. By next March, the buildup for the Sydney Olympics will 
have begun. This time, the women won't go unnoticed the way they 
generally did leading up to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the game,'' said Joy Fawcett, who balances being the  
mother of two girls with playing soccer fulltime. ``We love to play 
soccer. We're very competitive. The Olympics is fun. We all enjoy 
playing in the Olympics. The time off is so short ... you don't 
even think about not playing. You just stay in that routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the U.S. women team members want a professional league  
of their own. And despite startup costs as high as $50 million, 
they sound determined to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time,'' Millbrett said. ``And it will happen.''  
</P>
<P>
	Not before 2001, though. By then, will what Messing called ``a  
seminal event'' have lost its impact? 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected anything like what this World Cup turned  
into,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``It has been wonderful 
for soccer and it has been wonderful for the women athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to think anyone can recreate this is unfair. This was just  
a very special, very memorable event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. But not in the minds of the women who won it and the  
people who watched it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to take what we've learned about women's equity,  
what we've learned about women as equal partners and not 
subordinates, and export it around the world,'' Steinbrecher said. 
``I think we're on the cutting edge of a revolution.''

diagnosed with diabetes is climbing and their lifestyle may be at 
fault.

	Since her diagnosis, Ms. Johnson has been an advocate of  
diabetes education. She said she regularly hears from people who 
were tested for the disease after she brought up the issue.

<HEADLINE> Showdown Expected at Venator Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It changed its name from Woolworth, lost its  
five-and-dime image, closed thousands of stores and built itself 
into a sporting goods giant. 
</P>
<P>
	But retailer Venator still seems to be limping along. Sales and  
profits are down, and its stock price -- while improved this year -- 
still stands at under $10 compared to more than $28 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, its biggest shareholder, Greenway Partners, is charging  
that the company's management isn't doing enough to get the 
troubled retailer back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	A big showdown between the sides is expected this Friday, when  
Venator holds its annual meeting in Florida -- an event that many 
think will be nothing less than downright nasty. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Venator's contention that its turnaround is on track,  
Greenway, a New York-based investment firm, will try at the meeting 
to snatch away four director seats. Greenway also will try to 
convince shareholders to change the corporate name back to 
Woolworth and loosen the company's defenses against a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name Venator was an ill-chosen name to begin with. The  
company's value continues to be in question and the whole 
turnaround seems to be taking an awfully long time,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, president of the retail newsletter Barnard's Retail Trend 
Report. ``No wonder Greenway is aggravated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough few years for Venator, which has attempted to  
boost profits by reducing costs and closing more than 4,000 stores 
-- including the entire chain of Woolworth dime stores and all of 
its Kinney Shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now mostly a sporting goods chain, with stores including  
Foot Locker and Champs Sports. It also runs Northern clothing 
stores, the San Francisco Music Box and Afterthoughts, which sells 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	But Venator -- which means hunter in Latin -- continues to  
struggle, and analysts think it is unlikely that its business will 
turn around soon given the prolonged slump in the sporting goods 
market -- with shoppers buying far fewer sneakers than earlier in 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The NPD Group, a market research firm, athletic  
footwear revenues fell by 6.3 percent in 1998 from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their core product -- athletic footwear -- is going downhill, so  
how can they really even think that they will be able to revive 
this company soon,'' Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenway owns more than 14 percent of Venator's stock and has  
been one of the company's most vocal critics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Greenway will ask shareholders to elect its four  
nominees to the 11-member Venator board instead of the four 
nominated by the company. It is the first time that Greenway has 
sought board representation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to be on the inside to see why this company has  
done so poorly,'' said Alfred Kingsley, senior managing director at 
Greenway. ``We have a lot at stake here and want to get some 
answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In asking to have the Woolworth name reinstated, Greenway  
executives say giving up such a well-known name shows a lack of 
marketing savvy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Greenway wants Venator to scrap its ``poison pill''  
-- a provision that discourages hostile takeovers -- and put any 
future poison pill proposals to a shareholder approval vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenway has been aggressive about publicizing its troubles with  
the company. It mailed out letters to shareholders attacking 
corporate performance and management perks. Greenway also 
distributed buttons saying ``Bring Back Woolworth'' at the 
company's New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	A Venator executive expressed frustration Monday about what the  
company sees as interference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had hoped after four years of massive restructuring behind  
us that we could finally focus our intentions on running the 
business and rebuilding value for our shareholders,'' said Juris 
Pagrabs, vice president of investor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the company had been willing award Greenway two  
seats on its board this year, but negotiations broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June  
21, the company said that its stock is up sharply this year, and 
its executives ``believe it is very important to continue the 
momentum Venator's strategic plan has generated.'' Venator shares 
have gone from a low of just under $4 in February to about $10 now. 
</P>
<P>
	Venator said that it doesn't find Greenway's ``suggestions to be  
beneficial to the company or the value of its shares. In fact, in 
some cases, we believe their proposals could be detrimental to the 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the name change, Venator said in a July 2 filing that 80  
percent of its shareholders voted for the name change last year and 
that Greenway's proposal is indicative of its ``limited viewpoint 
and lack of strategic focus.''

<HEADLINE> Writers Finding Muse in Dreams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) -- Stephen King had written about 700  
pages of the novel ``It'' when he got stuck. He went to bed 
frustrated, thinking about what should happen next. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer emerged in a nightmare as scary as the horror story  
he was writing. 
</P>
<P>
	King dreamt he was the little girl in the book, trapped in a  
creepy dump with discarded refrigerators that had leeches hanging 
inside. One flew out and sucked the blood from the girl's hand. The 
dream found its way into the novel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up and I was very frightened,'' he recalled in Naomi  
Epel's book, ``Writers Dreaming.'' ``But I was also very happy. 
Because then I knew what was going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A literary publicist who has listened to the dreams of countless  
authors, Ms. Epel is no stranger to the mysterious messages of the 
unconscious. It was one of her own dreams that inspired the 1993 
book, and now she shows aspiring artists how dreams can nurture 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we have the dreaming brain that thinks in images and  
is not linear and then the critical brain. You have to have both,'' 
she explained while taking a break at last week's annual conference 
of the Association for the Study of Dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most creative people at least trust that information when it  
comes up,'' she added. ``Many people don't remember their dreams 
every day. When a big dream happens, they listen, they go with 
their process of exploration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Styron listened. One morning he woke up with the image  
of a beautiful young woman with concentration camp numbers tattooed 
on her arm carrying a book. 
</P>
<P>
	That very morning, Styron recalled in Ms. Epel's book, he wrote  
down the first words of ``Sophie's Choice'' exactly as they appear 
in the novel. 
</P>
<P>
	But writers can do more than transcribe their dreams. The images  
are so powerful that many writers, Ms. Epel found, try to get into 
a dreamlike state to generate new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Maya Angelou said she plays solitaire to hypnotize herself back  
in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how this is like dreaming but it is,'' Ms.  
Angelou told the author. 
</P>
<P>
	During a writing workshop at the conference, Ms. Epel gave Ms.  
Angelou's use of cards a new twist. In 50 cards Ms. Epel created to 
jumpstart writing, artists are offered strategies ranging from 
``change your point of view'' to ``zoom in zoom out'' -- reminiscent 
of Amy Tan's practice of focusing on an image that will take her 
into a scene whose details gradually emerge in the writing it 
inspires. 
</P>
<P>
	Lily Myers, who attended the workshop, was impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``These people have started here, so I can too,'' said Ms.  
Myers, 45, of Oakland, Calif. ``I've written about my dreams but 
never thought of using my dreams to write about other things. That 
seems like a juicy new possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Epel, who in 1979 spent a year working in Berkeley at a  
now-defunct home for schizophrenics who would interpret one 
another's dreams ``and all sorts of wild things would happen,'' 
never imagined how far a single dream several years ago would take 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dream, she was in a basement, watching a man who clearly  
didn't want to be disturbed working at a table. She was quiet, so 
he let her stay. They didn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
	A fellow dream buff Ms. Epel described it to recommended that  
she spend some quiet time alone. She made her way to the word 
processor and ``Writers Dreaming'' emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was because of that dream that I went from dreaming of  
success to having some kind of success,'' Ms. Epel said. ``It was 
definitely transforming.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 10.44 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed in early trading  
today as investors awaited the flood of second-quarter earnings 
reports expected over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 10.44 at 11,204.14, taking the blue chips further into record 
territory. The Dow had a new closing high Friday of 11,193.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was off 1.16 at 1,402.12 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
0.45 to 2,783.52. 
</P>
<P>
	With quarterly profit reports beginning in earnest this week,  
traders were hesitant to make any big bets. Most stocks traded in a 
narrow range in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks were among those making big moves. Gateway rose  
1 3/16 to 68 13/16 and Sun Microsystems rose 1 1/16 to 74. 
</P>
<P>
	But Internet stocks were lower. Yahoo! was off 4 1/4 at 155 3/4, and  
Infoseek was down 4 5/16 at 47 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing and declining issues were about even on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 94.52 million shares, modestly 
ahead of Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was off 0.16 at 657.52, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was unchanged at 812.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.88 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.63 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.77 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> Canal Break Causes Utah Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERDALE, Utah (AP) -- The earthen wall of a century-old  
irrigation canal ruptured on a hillside, flooding about 80 homes 
and spreading mud that buried mailboxes and oozed into basements. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 300 residents were evacuated yesterday after the  
canal gave way on the slope above their homes. No serious injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews worked into the night to dig out streets.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty significant mud and water damage,'' said police  
Lt. Paige Ansley. ``It was up 3 and 4 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the collapse has not been determined. The area had  
not gotten any heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	An inspector examined that section of the canal 10 minutes  
before the rupture, canal manager Floyd Baham said Monday. He said 
the canal is inspected daily during irrigation season. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate estimate of the cost of the damage. Most  
of the affected homes are new and were worth $200,000 to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal, built 115 years ago, carries water to 30,000 acres of  
crops.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Romero To End Career Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARENCRO, La. (AP) -- Randy Romero's last day as a jockey was  
spent preparing to ride a 10-1 longshot at the southern Louisiana 
track where he won his first race in 1973, Evangeline Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to give something back to the people of Acadiana and  
Evangeline Downs,'' Romero said prior to Monday night's race. ``I 
think they deserve it. I just want it to be something a little 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romero, almost as well-known for an injury-marred career as for  
his 4,294 wins and more than $74 million in purses, is beginning a 
new career as a jockey agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven friends who also started their riding careers at  
Evangeline came back to Louisiana to compete against him in the 
$30,000 Cradle of Jockeys Invitational. Affirmed Success was to be 
his final mount at Evangeline Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other riders include Corey Lanerie, Shane Sellers. Marlon St.  
Julien, the rider Romero will represent as an agent, is also in the 
race, along with Mark Guidry, Ronald Ardoin, E.J. Perrodin and Ray 
Sibille. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Romero won three Breeders' Cup races and set  
records at three separate tracks for most victories by a jockey in 
a single meet. Romero has also been the leading rider at 10 
different tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Romero has been one of racing's most frequently injured  
riders, suffering through countless spills, 23 operations, plus a 
series of skin grafts after a light bulb exploded in the jockey's 
``hot box'' at Oaklawn Park, setting the rubbing alcohol on his 
body on fire, nearly burning him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in 1990, Go for Wand broke down, throwing Romero during  
the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Belmont Park. He broke eight ribs and 
his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Other injuries followed before a brief retirement. After that,  
Romero passed the 4,000-win mark, one of only 27 riders to achieve 
that record. He stands 26th on the all-time win list.

<HEADLINE> Meet Ralph the Wearable Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- It's not much on fashion, but its wearers can  
surf the Internet, play games and write papers, all while walking 
down the hall or sitting in class. 
</P>
<P>
	It's called Ralph, and during a recent computer convention in  
New York City the high school-student designed device wowed 
Microsoft executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, created by a group of Dearborn High School students,  
is a wearable computer headset. It was born out of last term's 
project for Dearborn High's Advanced Video Production course. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, three of teacher and former rock DJ Russ  
Gibb's students took Ralph to the computer convention and created 
such a stir, organizers asked them to demonstrate the device away 
from the main exhibit floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were the hit of the Streaming Video convention,'' Gibb  
told the Detroit Free Press for a Monday story. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph -- named after a character on the TV show ``The Simpsons''  
-- combines a connection to cyberspace with up-close access to the 
human race. For example, it can record walking down a school 
hallway, and transmit the recording to a Web site. It puts a 
darkened visor over the wearer's eyes with a Web video camera 
protruding from the side. 
</P>
<P>
	The visor has a transparent screen that can display Web sites  
called up by a Twiddler -- a miniature keybord/mouse that fits in 
one hand. A miniature computer, encased in an aluminum box, dangles 
from a strap on the wearer's waist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ralph does everything a normal computer can do, but it's more  
convenient,'' said Alex Fisher, 18, who graduated from Dearborn 
High in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The students aren't the first to design a wearable computer. But  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology guru Nicholas Negroponte told 
the students in an e-mail that they were probably the only high 
school designing such cutting-edge devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Since unveiling Ralph, the students have received e-mail from  
Anthony J. Bay, general manager of Microsoft's Streaming Media 
Division. Bay told them to keep Microsoft in mind when they're 
ready to hit the job market. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mark Cuban, president and chairman of Broadcast.com, also  
wants the Dearborn students to keep him apprised of future 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started off going to the convention, being like the little  
ants watching the big honchos,'' said Brandon Gheen, 15, ``and all 
of a sudden they're interested in us.''

<HEADLINE> Graf To Retire at End of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Steffi Graf probably will retire from the  
women's tennis tour at the end of the year, ending a magnificent 
career highlighted by seven Wimbledon championships and 22 Grand 
Slam titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, 30, will play in a couple of events next year and go to  
places where she has never competed, but her days of playing the 
Grand Slam circuit are probably over, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf didn't say specifically why she was leaving the tour, but  
she noted that over the past three years injuries have had her on 
the verge of retiring several times. Traveling, the demands on her 
time and not having as much fun playing in tournaments also were 
factors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say I haven't been very busy thinking about it,''  
Graf said when specially asked about retirement in a conference 
call prior to the A&AMP;P Tennis Classic at Mahwah, N.J. ``I let things 
happen more or less, but most naturally, I will (retire).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf has five more events on her schedule this year, including  
the U.S. Open. She refused to pin down which would be her last 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to stop playing tennis for myself,'' she added.  
``Tennis will always be a big part of my life. I enjoy it and 
hopefully I'll get a chance to play here and there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once she retires, Graf said it's unlikely she change her mind.  
</P>
<P>
	The retirement isn't a big surprise. After winning the French  
Open, she said she would not be returning to Paris. Earlier this 
month, she said she was finished with Wimbledon after losing the 
championship match to Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she played the final week at Wimbledon suffering from  
bronchitis and a fever, which was the major reason she withdrew 
from a mixed doubles semifinal with John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, who was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame last  
week, has criticized Graf for failing to inform him until just 
before they were to play. He was sent a note by Graf while he was 
working in the broadcast booth. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, who seemed to be unaware McEnroe was annoyed with her,  
added that dropping out late was a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to talk about how I was feeling,'' Graf said.  
``It's not my style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement actually seemed an easier choice for her.  
</P>
<P>
	``... You want to leave a sport when you are at the top,'' Graf  
said. ``That's an ideal situation which is never really easy 
because obviously if you are doing well it's very hard to part from 
what you love so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been having to think the past few years with all the  
injuries I've been having,'' she said. ``There are a lot of times I 
have come very close to making this decision and I feel fortunate I 
have been able to do it on my own terms and not being pushed by 
anything. It's my own decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf has run a sports management company for a couple of years  
and she intends to devote more time to that. She currently has 
three German junior players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what she was going to do with her free time, Graf  
quipped: 
</P>
<P>
	``What am I going to do with my life? I have a life, finally,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf played her first Wimbledon in 1984, reaching the fourth  
round. She won the championship in 1988, '89, '91, '92, '93, '95 
and '96. She was runner-up in '86. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Martina Navratilova has won Wimbledon more times, with nine  
titles. Graf's 22 Grand Slams are two short of Margaret Court 
Smith's record.

<HEADLINE> Arson-Murder Link Stuns Community </HEADLINE>

<P>
	HAPPY VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- In this tiny, largely conservative  
farming community, Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder were accepted. 
It didn't matter that they were gay. 
</P>
<P>
	They gained respect through their community work. They helped  
create a local children's museum, and Matson helped establish the 
20-year-old Redding Farmer's Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Now two brothers who have been linked to a series of arson fires  
at Sacramento synagogues are suspected of killing the couple, 
police said. Authorities said one of the alleged gunmen, Benjamin 
Matthew Williams, sometimes sold vegetables and herbs at Matson's 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond words that the farmers market may be the  
connection between the victims and the killers,'' said Margaret 
Jensen, who tends a market stall stocked with squash and onions. 
``If they burned the synagogues, too, that takes it to a level that 
is just staggering from someplace we think of as a small 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Williams, 31, nor his brother, 29-year-old James Tyler  
Williams, has been charged in connection with the murders or the 
fires. Authorities said they hope to bring murder charges later 
this week, said Shasta County Sheriff's Capt. Ron Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Matson, 50, and Mowder, 40, were discovered July 1  
at their home in Happy Valley, a small community just outside of 
Redding in northern California. They had been shot in their bed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, after one of the victims' credit cards was used,  
police staked out a Yuba City business where the credit card 
purchase was to be delivered, and arrested the Williams brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were both armed and one was wearing a bulletproof  
vest, police said. Yuba City is about 120 miles southeast of 
Redding. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, federal and local authorities said the brothers  
also were being investigated in connection with the Sacramento 
synagogue fires on June 18 that caused $1 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were being held in lieu of $150,000 bail on charges  
of receiving stolen property after authorities said they found a 
wallet, credit card, driver's license and Social Security card 
belonging to Matson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams brothers lived in a modest, wood-frame house in  
Redding, where investigators said they found material espousing 
white supremacist beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the material found was literature from the Illinois-based  
World Church of the Creator, according to news reports. A former 
member of the church, Benjamin Smith, killed himself last week 
after a two-state shooting spree targeting minorities in Indiana 
and Illinois that killed two men and wounded nine others. 
</P>
<P>
	Also found in the house was a list of 32 prominent Jewish and  
civic leaders in Sacramento, and FBI special agent James Maddock 
said protection was ordered for those individuals. Officials also 
urged Redding's only Jewish congregation, Temple Beth Israel, to 
increase security. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento authorities over the weekend also began visiting  
people believed to be members or followers of white supremacy 
groups, ``just to see if we can develop a sense of what we can 
expect from them in the future,'' sheriff's Lt. John McGinness told 
the Sacramento Bee in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Matson, a lifelong resident of the area, helped establish an  
arboretum as well as the museum and farmers market. Mowder, his 
companion of 16 years, worked in the plant department in the local 
hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the Williams brothers had been involved in a  
landscaping business. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Williams knew Matson through a shared interest in  
horticulture, according to Ed Smith, owner of a Redding nursery 
where Williams worked briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were acquaintances. They both sold at the farmers market.  
I don't know if they were friends, but I know that they knew each 
other,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Freitas, a retired teacher who taught 30 years at the  
elementary school, said: ``It's such a tragedy. Gary was a very 
nice fellow. Very much a community-minded person.''

<HEADLINE>  Extra Events Spice Up All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- One more day and then the real show begins.  
</P>
<P>
	First, though, the final prelude to the All-Star game takes  
place tonight when baseball's sluggers aim at the Green Monster, 
the 37-foot high left-field wall at Fenway Park, in the Home Run 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Nomar Garciaparra, who missed the Red Sox's last nine games  
with a groin injury, excite the Boston fans by winning the 
long-ball contest? How about Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa, the 
record-breakers of 1998? 
</P>
<P>
	And what will happen Tuesday night when the final All-Star game  
of the 1900s is played at 87-year-old Fenway Park? The high 
left-field wall may not be able to contain McGwire's towering 
blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he'll have to face Pedro Martinez, who has allowed  
just five homers in 132 2-3 innings. Martinez earned the start for 
the American League in his home park with a 15-3 record and 2.10 
ERA in 18 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling (13-4), who began his career in Boston's farm  
system, was expected to start for the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Three former Red Sox stars won't be there. New York's Roger  
Clemens and Anaheim's Mo Vaughn weren't selected, and Tampa Bay's 
Jose Canseco withdrew Sunday when he underwent back surgery for a 
herniated disc. He was replaced on the AL roster by Baltimore 
designated hitter Harold Baines. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's primary free agent pickup in the offseason, second  
baseman Jose Offerman, will be there as a reserve despite a 
2-for-38 slump that has dropped his batting average to .273. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, two other locals stars took their cuts in the  
Celebrity Hitting Challenge -- actor Matt Damon of Cambridge, Mass., 
and quarterback Doug Flutie of Boston College and the Buffalo 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star sidelights began Friday with FanFest, a display of  
baseball exhibits and activities, and continued Sunday with the 
celebrity competition and an All-Star Futures game featuring 
minor-league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	All that was a substantial change from 1946 and 1961, the other  
times the All-Star game was held at Fenway. That's all there was 
then -- a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of what has been added has been to the fans' benefit,''  
former Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson, now an executive in 
the commissioner's office, said Sunday. ``The Futures game is 
really a way of illustrating the international aspect of the game 
that already exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World team beat the United States team 7-0 as Yankees  
infield prospect Alfonso Soriano had two homers and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He did a lot better than Damon did in the celebrity competition  
in which four teams of three players each -- a celebrity, a former 
All-Star and a former Red Sox star -- earned points depending on how 
far they hit the ball on their seven swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon missed the ball once, hit four fouls and put just two  
balls in play. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and fellow actor Kevin Costner still pleased the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came out to see Kevin Costner because I think he's cute and  
I wanted to see if he could play baseball,'' said Casey Levesque, 
6, of Fall River. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's events also gave pitcher Kip Wells a chance to be part  
of the extravaganza. Wells, the Chicago White Sox' first-round 
draft pick last year, was on the United States Futures team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives prospects a chance to compare their talents against  
others at that point in their game,'' Wells said. ``For me, it was 
a thrill just being in the dressing room with those guys whose 
movies I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, a star in college, the Canadian Football League, and the  
NFL, still got a kick out of trying to hit the Green Monster. He 
succeeded twice -- once on a bounce and once on a liner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get a chance to come to Fenway for an All-Star game to rub  
shoulders with the current players and go out and be kids again for 
a day,'' he said. ``And it's just a blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current players for the NL include manager Bruce Bochy's  
likely batting order of Cincinnati's Barry Larkin, Colorado's Larry 
Walker, Chicago's Sosa, St. Louis' McGwire, Arizona's Matt 
Williams, Houston's Jeff Bagwell as designated hitter, Mike Piazza 
of the New York Mets, Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona's Jay 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL lineup wasn't announced Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	That day was reserved for activities attended by fans who might  
not be able to go to the actual game since Fenway is the smallest 
major-league park with 33,871 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that takes the spotlight off the game,'' Damon  
said before taking his cuts. ``This is just some kind of warmup 
stuff, revenue for the city, an excuse to come out to the ballpark 
on a sunny day for a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, the first time the All-Star game was in Fenway Park,  
Ted Williams went 4-for-4 in the AL's 12-0 win. Today, at age 80, 
even he likes the expanded format. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't try and squeeze too much in too few days, I  
think it's all a celebration,'' Williams said. ``It's all fun for 
baseball fans.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Japan Economy on Upswing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy is improving somewhat with private  
consumption recovering and government support measures sinking in, 
the Economic Planning Agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its closely watched monthly report, the EPA upgraded its  
overall assessment of the economy, saying that although recovery 
remains fragile, the situation is improving somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The recovery in consumption is weak, and some severe  
conditions remain, but the effects of various government policies 
are sinking in and at present the situation is improving 
somewhat,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's monthly report is considered a key indicator of  
government thinking on the state of the economy. This month's 
report is the first since the EPA announced in June that Japan's 
gross domestic product grew by an annualized 7.9 percent for the 
January-March quarter, and by 1.9 percent from the October-December 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall upgrade was the second in as many months. In its  
June report, the EPA also revised its assessment to say that the 
economy ``has stopped deteriorating and is fluctuating sideways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briefing reporters about the July report, Takashi Omori,  
director of the national economic division at the EPA's research 
bureau, was still guarded in his assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are good points and bad points, but on balance, it adds  
up to an improvement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Private consumption is slowly recovering despite stagnant  
incomes that weigh on its strength, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report echoes comments made by Japan's finance minister in a  
speech to Parliament on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the picture remained grim,  
but government efforts to spur growth are leading to signs of a 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Japanese economy, as seen in the weak levels of personal  
consumption and capital expenditures and in the high unemployment 
rate, is still in a severe situation,'' he said, adding that ``some 
bright signs are beginning to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the EPA reported that overall household spending in  
May rose 2.4 percent on year. This was despite the fact that 
incomes fell 1.1 percent on year in real terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's EPA monthly report said that private spending  
continued to be pressured by wage concerns as corporations 
restructure, but was showing signs of slight recovery from spring 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic prices are showing signs of bottoming out, the agency  
said in the July report, contrasting with a previous assessment 
that they were fluctuating at low levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate profits have begun to show signs of turning around,  
the July report said, after being assessed as generally in a 
downward trend last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The July report noted that housing construction also continues  
to rally. Construction starts for single family homes in Japan 
soared 17.9 percent on year in May after rising 12.5 percent in 
April, 19.1 percent in March and 9 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said that these rises reflect tax incentives and  
the popularity of low-interest government housing loans more than 
any improvement in consumer sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Schools Use Computers Effectively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Julie Burger, a second-grade teacher in  
Oswego, N.Y., spent nearly 200 hours learning how to use computers 
in the classroom. Now, her students create reports using digital 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a dramatic change in how much better and faster  
my students learn with our technology,'' she told Education 
Department researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	After some rocky starts, many schools are finding better and  
quicker ways to help teachers use the new technology, Education 
Secretary Richard Riley said Monday, opening a national conference 
on education technology. The meeting ends today. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've seen firsthand how teaching and learning that uses  
technology effectively really can make a difference in the lives of 
students,'' Riley said in prepared remarks. ``We are committed to 
making sure that teachers are well-trained ... and nearly every 
state has developed long-term plans to meet these goals. 
</P>
<P>
	While Riley cited federal programs such as a new $75 million  
fund for teacher training, he also called for careful study of 
existing projects: ``We must not assume everything that employs 
technology is going to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some school districts have created problems for themselves by  
putting computers into classrooms without showing teachers how to 
use them, failing to factor in future costs and rushing to install 
equipment and programs that might be obsolete or too advanced for 
their schools' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the conference also heard reports of promising projects that  
are improving teacher training and student achievement. Studies 
from West Virginia and Idaho released Monday indicated that 
students using computers in their lessons are improving test scores 
and other performance measures in math and reading. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual schools and districts are also putting more computers  
in classrooms and training more teachers to use the computers. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, until 1995, the Aneth Community School, a rural  
southeastern Utah school on the Navajo Nation Reservation, relied 
on a few computers scattered around in classrooms and offices. 
Today, the kindergarten through sixth-grade school has a new 
computer lab, a computer and color printer in each of its 41 
classrooms and a distance learning project that uses a microwave 
tower providing the students with full-motion video, voice and data 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of Boston's 130 public schools has a ``starter network''  
(computer lab, and terminals in the library, principal's office and 
four to eight classrooms) connected to a network based at the 
district office -- making it the first large urban school district 
in the country to have networks and high-speed Internet access in 
every school. The Boston district, which has one computer for every 
six students, also offers free on-site courses to teachers, 
principals and other staff to help them achieve new district 
standards for teaching with technology.

<HEADLINE> Venator's Moves To Boost Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Venator Group, the former Woolworth, has spent much of the 1990s  
restructuring in an attempt to boost profits. Some highlights: 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 8, 1992 -- Woolworth says it will close, sell or overhaul  
900 stores, including 25 percent of its Kinney shoe stores. Store 
divisions to be shut down include Susie's, Sportelle, Richman 
Brothers and Anderson- Little. 

</P>
<P>
	Oct. 13, 1993 -- Woolworth says it will close or reformat nearly  
1,000 stores and cut 13,000 jobs.

Canada to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 

</P>
<P>
	March 30, 1994 -- Woolworth reveals accounting irregularities  
will force it to restate earnings for the 1992 and 1993 fiscal 
years. Chairman William Lavin and chief financial officer Charles 
Young step aside temporarily. Lavin is reinstated as CEO and Young 
resigns in May, but Lavin quits later in the year in a dispute with 
the Woolworth board. 

</P>

at Federated Department Stores Inc., is named Woolworth's chairman. 

</P>
<P>
	April 3, 1995 -- Payless Shoe Source head Dale Hilpert is named  
president and chief operating officer. 

</P>
<P>
	May 31, 1995 -- Woolworth sells its Kids Mart subsidiary to  
management-led investors. The chain later closes nearly 100 stores 
and files for bankruptcy court protection. 

</P>
<P>
	April 1, 1996 -- Woolworth, which earlier sold off 24 Rx Place  
Drug Mart stores, says it will close the chain's remaining 14 
outlets.

and Footquarters stores. 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 22, 1998 -- Venator announces the sale of its 357 general  
merchandise stores in Germany for approximately $550 million. 

</P>
<P>
	July 1, 1999 -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission files  
an age discrimination lawsuit against Venator, alleging that 
Woolworth stores fired dozens of employees between September 1995 
and October 1997 because they were over 40.

<HEADLINE> Williams' Presence Felt at Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ted Williams was giving a batting lesson in his  
hotel suite, oblivious to time, a nervous aide, and actor Kevin 
Costner, who sat in the corner and waited his turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was making the point that players like Mark McGwire,  
who let go of the bat with one hand as they follow through on their 
swing, always maintain two-fisted control until bat meets ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been studying it,'' Williams said. McGwire, for example,  
doesn't let his hand go until he's hit the ball ``and the damage 
has been done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in his wheelchair, his voice booming, Williams ignored  
the aide trying to keep him on schedule through a morning of 
meetings Monday, the day before he throws out the ceremonial first 
pitch at the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing grabs Williams, even at 80, more than talking about  
batting. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams actually was looking forward to meeting Costner, whose  
film ``Field of Dreams'' rekindled Williams' longtime fascination 
with Shoeless Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was driven from baseball by the unproven claim that he  
was part of the Black Sox conspiracy to throw the 1919 World 
Series. Williams finds a kindred spirit in Jackson -- a natural with 
an unfair share of bad luck, a great hitter taken to task by the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
	But the connection had a more tangible start: Eddie Collins, a  
teammate of Jackson, signed Williams to his first major league 
contract and regaled him with stories of Jackson's batting prowess. 
</P>
<P>
	``He liked to talk about Babe Ruth, the big monkey, and Lou  
Gehrig, the Iron Horse, and other great players, but not with the 
same dreamlike vision that he spoke of Jackson,'' Williams said. 
``Finally one day, I was sitting in my mother's living room and he 
was sitting right in front of me, and I said tell me about Joe 
Jackson. He was looking at me and his head dropped. This wasn't an 
act. Then he looked at the ceiling, and said, 'Boy, what a player.' 
He said it with reverence, and he said it with sadness.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams kept asking questions. He always wanted to know more  
about Jackson -- just as he always sought out anything that might 
make him a better batter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have to say one word that would exemplify me as a person,  
as a conversationalist, as an individual, and my mental 
capabilities, it's my inquisitiveness,'' Williams said, leaning 
forward in his wheelchair. ``I want to know why. Why do you think 
that? I've always been that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after reading all the books on the Black Sox and seeing all  
the movies about them, Williams is convinced more than ever that 
baseball should reinstate Jackson and give him his due in the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in equality, fairness, and compassion, and I saw  
none of that in this thing,'' Williams said. ``And it always ground 
on me. Why? I'm not an evangelist. But he was a ballplayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Someday, no doubt, there will be a big movie about Williams --  
baseball great, fighter pilot, tireless voice for cancer patients. 
The role would demand someone large and loud, a John Wayne type. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of strokes and a broken hip in recent years haven't  
diminished the force of Williams' personality. He still spices his 
stories with salty language, still rails against the writers who 
took shots at him in print decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought of this for 50 years, how wrong those writers  
were about me,'' he says, a gleam in his eyes. ``And they've eaten 
more crow with their writing and their beliefs about Ted Williams 
than any other ballplayer they'll ever know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did it feel good to make them eat crow?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, boy,'' he says, licking his lips as he smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	They rebuked The Kid when he came out of the West to Boston  
boldly proclaiming, ``All I want out of life is that when I walk 
down the street folks will say, 'There goes the greatest hitter who 
ever lived.''' 
</P>
<P>
	With the angle and distance of time, he probably was what he set  
out to become. Nobody in 58 years has equaled his .406 batting 
average in 1941. Nobody, before or since, quite matched his 
combination of power (521 home runs) and average (.344 lifetime) in 
a 19-year career broken up by service in two wars and hampered by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, there is no one more fitting to throw out the first  
pitch at an All-Star Game than Williams, who played in 18 of those 
midsummer classics, hitting .304 with four homers and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Williams' fate to shine at the All-Star Games while his  
rival on the New York Yankees, Joe DiMaggio, excelled at the World 
Series. Fairly or not, critics used that difference to cheapen 
Williams' achievements, saying he wasn't the team player DiMaggio 
was. Yet there's no evidence that Williams was any less a team man, 
and he had, in fact, a reputation for imparting his hitting wisdom 
to anyone who was within distance of his bellowing voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and DiMaggio were the two most luminous stars of their  
era, players who could reasonably be placed in the baseball 
pantheon on the same level as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Ty Cobb. 
With the passing of DiMaggio earlier this year, Williams is now 
unquestionably the greatest living player. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Williams never lived in the past, and he still doesn't. He  
even has an Internet site: Hitter.net. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains an astute observer of baseball, watching ballgames as  
much as possible on television. His legendary vision has a narrower 
range these days, but he still sees more than most people. Unlike 
some fellow Hall of Famers, he isn't stuck in a belief that the 
game and the players were better in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a helluva lot of talent,'' Williams said.  
``Guys are bigger and stronger. I'm not saying they're better 
hitters. They have better bodies, stronger bodies. And they're 
encouraged and enthused about the monetary advantages. Geezus, with 
all that money, I'd want to knuckle down, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballplayers today, he said, also can feed off of what they see  
on television -- the replays of home runs, the plays of the day -- 
and compare themselves to the best in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The delicate, eternal balance in the game between hitting and  
pitching has shifted to the batters in recent years, he said, but 
he's not one to blame it simply on poor pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever that balance of hitting and pitching gets lopsided  
too much, like it's starting to get now, then you have to worry 
about the game deteriorating,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think there's more imagination about what pitchers can  
do. I see things that are practiced by pitchers now, more so than 
the hitters, things different than when I played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asking to borrow paper and pen, Williams sketched out the mound  
and home plate and illustrated how pitchers are getting better 
angles on batters by starting out from the left or right sides of 
the mound. It was a technique he first saw used in the late 1950s 
by Early Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all doing it now,'' Williams said. ``Nobody's ever  
written that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Williams doesn't let nostalgia cloud his views of the  
game, he doesn't allow sentiment to get in the way of his view of 
the future for baseball in Boston. It's time, he said, for Fenway 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be perfectly honest, I hope they don't build it in the same  
place,'' Williams said. ``I just can't see it with all the 
buildings, all the history, all the problems parking. Go down the 
road 25 miles. Buy 500 acres, and build a ballpark with seating, 
parking, new dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought the dimensions at Fenway were unfair.  
Sometimes unfair to the hitter, and sometimes unfair to the 
pitcher. No, I'm not sentimental about it. I've heard a lot of fans 
say, 'Oh, geez, I wouldn't even think about going any place else. 
It wasn't that great. The park is just an old park. It has a lot of 
history behind it, but it's right downtown in the apartment area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams spent his career with his back to the wall -- the Green  
Monster -- just 290 feet from home plate in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still seeing it,'' he said with a laugh.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soccer Squad Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Banging drums and singing the national anthem,  
Chinese fans gave a hero's welcome Monday to a women's soccer team 
that returned defiant from a World Cup defeat by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't lose because of spirit or strength. We lost because  
of luck,'' defender Zhao Lihong said as the team walked through 
Beijing airport to applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters jostled with fans and airport personnel to get  
pictures of China's new national heroines. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Chinese sports officials met the United Airlines flight  
bringing the team from San Francisco. In the receiving line was the 
top U.S. diplomat in China, William McCahill, who gave team captain 
Sun Wen a bouquet of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire Chinese people are extremely happy!'' enthused Wu  
Shaozu, director of the state sports commission, at a brief news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival was featured prominently on the national evening  
television news. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's 5-4 loss on penalty kicks after a scoreless game at  
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., was a bitter defeat for Chinese 
fans, many of whom regarded it as a grudge match with political 
overtones. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, the team captain, hinted at such sentiments, but was upbeat  
about the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only when you are very powerful can you win respect,'' she  
said. ``Through our good performance, we won the respect and love 
of American soccer fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 fans gathered outside the airport, some banging  
cymbals and drums, while others waved flags and sang the national 
anthem. One banner declared, ``The Chinese women's soccer team are 
national heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Chinese fans had complained of a conspiracy by U.S.  
organizers, saying their team was sabotaged by too much travel, 
lack of decent Chinese food and hot weather. But others were proud 
that the team had gone so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel that they lost,'' said Xin Yan, 32, who stood  
with 20 fellow employees of the Beijing Haidian Agricultural 
Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Gao Hong, who missed the winning shot by American  
Brandi Chastain, already was looking ahead to her next encounter 
with the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the Olympics next year, if we have this kind of  
competition, I won't let one ball in. I have confidence in this,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congressional Leaders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and congressional leaders  
discussed tax cuts, Social Security and other budget issues Monday 
at a White House meeting that both sides described as amicable but 
that produced no evidence they had bridged any of their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are some areas we can work together on to try to  
find some compromises,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said 
after the hour-long session in the Cabinet Room. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said Clinton stressed his willingness to work on  
Medicare overhaul this year. And they each cast the tone of the 
meeting positively, which considering the distrust many Republicans 
feel for Clinton might be a major achievement in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came to specifics over spending the $2.9 trillion in  
budget surpluses projected over the next decade, Republicans were 
still insisting on their plans for using budget surpluses to cut 
taxes by about $800 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton and Democrats were saying a smaller reduction might  
be in order, but only after the two sides agree to revamp Social 
Security and Medicare for the looming retirement of the baby boom 
generation. That was the point Clinton made to Republicans to open 
the meeting, said one Democrat who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the priority has to be Social Security and Medicare,''  
said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Hastert said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., used an analogy of a dog carrying too many bones to argue 
that the president and Congress consider tax cuts, spending, 
Medicare and other issues separately. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton responded that budget items must be linked because  
they all affect the surplus' bottom line, Hastert said. White House 
officials have argued that GOP tax-cutting plans would devour money 
needed for Medicare and Social Security revamping and for needed 
defense and domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
	No one expected the two sides to make substantive progress over  
their differences, because Monday's meeting came months before the 
Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, which is when the pressure 
will be on to enact legislation. Congress has not put any of this 
year's tax and spending bills into their final form, let alone send 
any to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the White House sent out the president's top economic  
advisers to criticize an $864 billion House GOP proposal that would 
cut income taxes by 10 percent over the next decade, and a $792 
billion Senate Republican alternative aimed at the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said America's prosperity  
would be ``put at risk by the dangerous reversal of course that 
would be represented by huge tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposals would swell the national debt, erode expected  
budget surpluses and fail to provide money to meet existing 
obligations, he said. ``The tax cuts are potentially explosive, out 
beyond the 10-year window, and involve very great risks if the 
(surplus) projections that we have made do not materialize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sperling, head of the president's National Economic  
Council, said the tax cuts would absorb money needed to ensure the 
long-term solvency of Medicare, the health insurance program for 
the elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling said prominent Republicans had agreed to make fixing  
Medicare a priority. ``That's why it's puzzling, disturbing and 
disappointing that the Republicans now put forward a tax cut plan 
that leaves zero -- zero -- for Medicare over a 10-year period,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Republicans both say they would use $1.9  
trillion of the expected $2.9 trillion in surpluses to reduce the 
national debt and strengthen Social Security. Republicans want to 
devote most of the remaining $1 trillion to tax cuts, while Clinton 
wants to spend it on Medicare, a prescription drug benefit, 
reducing the debt, creating federally subsidized retirement 
accounts and increasing spending for military and domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Lott said his message to Clinton was: ``Let's  
cooperate here and not let this year be wasted as a partisan 
fight.'' He invited Clinton to work with Republicans on their tax 
cut plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to engage,'' Lott said. ``He can't just stand there  
and throw rocks at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also took note of a Washington Post story saying  
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., has focused his 
attention on trying to put Democrats back in control of the House 
and has shown little inclination to compromise with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, the Democrat leadership has adopted a do-nothing  
partisan agenda that is designed to produce gridlock rather than 
legislative solutions to the problems facing the country,'' House 
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said.

<HEADLINE>  Extra Events Spice Up All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- One more day and then the real show begins.  
</P>
<P>
	First, though, the final prelude to the All-Star game takes  
place tonight when baseball's sluggers aim at the Green Monster, 
the 37-foot high left-field wall at Fenway Park, in the Home Run 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Nomar Garciaparra, who missed the Red Sox's last nine games  
with a groin injury, excite the Boston fans by winning the 
long-ball contest? How about Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa, the 
record-breakers of 1998? 
</P>
<P>
	And what will happen Tuesday night when the final All-Star game  
of the 1900s is played at 87-year-old Fenway Park? The high 
left-field wall may not be able to contain McGwire's towering 
blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he'll have to face Pedro Martinez, who has allowed  
just five homers in 132 2-3 innings. Martinez earned the start for 
the American League in his home park with a 15-3 record and 2.10 
ERA in 18 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling (13-4), who began his career in Boston's farm  
system, was expected to start for the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Three former Red Sox stars won't be there. New York's Roger  
Clemens and Anaheim's Mo Vaughn weren't selected, and Tampa Bay's 
Jose Canseco withdrew Sunday when he underwent back surgery for a 
herniated disc. He was replaced on the AL roster by Baltimore 
designated hitter Harold Baines. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's primary free agent pickup in the offseason, second  
baseman Jose Offerman, will be there as a reserve despite a 
2-for-38 slump that has dropped his batting average to .273. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, two other locals stars took their cuts in the  
Celebrity Hitting Challenge -- actor Matt Damon of Cambridge, Mass., 
and quarterback Doug Flutie of Boston College and the Buffalo 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star sidelights began Friday with FanFest, a display of  
baseball exhibits and activities, and continued Sunday with the 
celebrity competition and an All-Star Futures game featuring 
minor-league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	All that was a substantial change from 1946 and 1961, the other  
times the All-Star game was held at Fenway. That's all there was 
then -- a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of what has been added has been to the fans' benefit,''  
former Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson, now an executive in 
the commissioner's office, said Sunday. ``The Futures game is 
really a way of illustrating the international aspect of the game 
that already exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World team beat the United States team 7-0 as Yankees  
infield prospect Alfonso Soriano had two homers and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He did a lot better than Damon did in the celebrity competition  
in which four teams of three players each -- a celebrity, a former 
All-Star and a former Red Sox star -- earned points depending on how 
far they hit the ball on their seven swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon missed the ball once, hit four fouls and put just two  
balls in play. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and fellow actor Kevin Costner still pleased the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came out to see Kevin Costner because I think he's cute and  
I wanted to see if he could play baseball,'' said Casey Levesque, 
6, of Fall River. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's events also gave pitcher Kip Wells a chance to be part  
of the extravaganza. Wells, the Chicago White Sox' first-round 
draft pick last year, was on the United States Futures team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives prospects a chance to compare their talents against  
others at that point in their game,'' Wells said. ``For me, it was 
a thrill just being in the dressing room with those guys whose 
movies I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, a star in college, the Canadian Football League, and the  
NFL, still got a kick out of trying to hit the Green Monster. He 
succeeded twice -- once on a bounce and once on a liner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get a chance to come to Fenway for an All-Star game to rub  
shoulders with the current players and go out and be kids again for 
a day,'' he said. ``And it's just a blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current players for the NL include manager Bruce Bochy's  
likely batting order of Cincinnati's Barry Larkin, Colorado's Larry 
Walker, Chicago's Sosa, St. Louis' McGwire, Arizona's Matt 
Williams, Houston's Jeff Bagwell as designated hitter, Mike Piazza 
of the New York Mets, Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona's Jay 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL lineup wasn't announced Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	That day was reserved for activities attended by fans who might  
not be able to go to the actual game since Fenway is the smallest 
major-league park with 33,871 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that takes the spotlight off the game,'' Damon  
said before taking his cuts. ``This is just some kind of warmup 
stuff, revenue for the city, an excuse to come out to the ballpark 
on a sunny day for a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, the first time the All-Star game was in Fenway Park,  
Ted Williams went 4-for-4 in the AL's 12-0 win. Today, at age 80, 
even he likes the expanded format. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't try and squeeze too much in too few days, I  
think it's all a celebration,'' Williams said. ``It's all fun for 
baseball fans.''

<HEADLINE> Prairie View A&AMP;M Suspends Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAIRIE VIEW, Texas (AP) -- Prairie View A&AMP;M suspended football  
coach Greg Johnson while the school investigates alleged 
irregularities of an unspecified nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was placed on administrative leave with pay last week  
after the university received an anonymous letter alleging 
irregularities in the football program, said Larry Raab, Prairie 
View's vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifton Gilliard, the school's assistant athletic director, was  
appointed interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Raab said the allegations have been reported to the Texas A&AMP;M  
University System and will be reported to the NCAA ``once 
appropriate information is gathered upon which we can base a 
report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raab declined to detail the nature of the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Prairie View snapped its NCAA-record 80-game losing streak with  
a 14-12 victory over Langston at Oklahoma City on Sept. 26. It 
ended a string of losses dating back to Oct. 28, 1989 when the team 
beat Mississippi Valley State 21-12.

<HEADLINE>  Blast Rattles Iranian Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Protesters clashed with  
police in the Iranian capital today, and several people were 
arrested, as demonstrations persisted over a violent attack on a 
university dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in anti-riot gear were out in force at Vali Asr Avenue in  
central Tehran, where they arrested several protesters and threw 
them in a waiting van, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shops in the tree-lined commercial avenue pulled down their  
shutters during the clash, according to witnesses reached by 
telephone from Dubai. They said two men on a motorcycle were beaten 
by protesters who assumed they were plainclothes intelligence 
agents. The men escaped after throwing a tear gas canister at the 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The raid on the dormitory Friday prompted thousands of students  
to stage protests, the strongest expression of discontent in Iran 
since the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed 
shah. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used tear gas and fired shots into the air to disperse  
the crowds in central Tehran today. Nearby at Tehran University, 
about 5,000 people, including 2,000 university staff members, 
staged a sit-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have been losing patience with the protests, which  
were sparked Thursday by the closing of a leftist newspaper and the 
passing of an anti-press bill and swelled Friday after police 
stormed the Tehran University dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, police intervened to control the university  
protest after a small explosion plunged the sit-in into chaos, 
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the explosion was caused by a percussion hand  
grenade. A few minutes earlier, a person on motorcycle fired a 
single shot into the air as he raced past the university gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the managing director of the closed Salam newspaper  
asked Iranian journalists not to follow through with plans for a 
one-day strike Tuesday, IRNA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammad Musavi Khoiniha said it is important for the community  
to receive ``frank and transparent'' news reports about the current 
situation. Journalists at more than 20 newspapers had pledged to 
strike in solidarity with the banned newspaper, the Neshat daily 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died and at least 20 were injured in the raid on the  
dormitory, which apparently was carried out with the backing of 
government hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who heads the  
hard-liners, called the attack ``a bitter and unacceptable 
incident'' that ``pained his heart,'' the official news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	All offenders will be dealt with ``no matter in the garb of law  
enforcement forces or else,'' IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrations have exposed a widening gulf between the  
Khamenei's hard-line faction and the allies of the reformist 
President Mohammad Khatami. Khatami is the hero of the student 
protesters, who have been chanting slogans for Khamenei, who is not 
elected, to step down and hand over control of the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran on Sunday fired two security chiefs responsible for the  
raid in response to student demands, but there has been no action 
against Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian, head of the national police, 
whom the students blame for the raid. A third security chief, the 
commander of the Tehran region, has been reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said about 10,000 students demonstrated in Tehran on  
Sunday. Iranian communities in the United States also staged 
protests in Los Angeles, Houston and Dallas in support of the 
students.

central bank failed to intervene to prop up the U.S. currency. 
Stocks surged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.14 yen in late afternoon trading, down

	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 336.45  
points, or 1.88 percent, to 18,274.18 points, its highest level 
since September 1997. On Friday, the average fell 29.92 points, or 
0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell in Tokyo from its level in  
New York late Friday after expectations of Bank of Japan 
intervention went unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, investors bet the Bank of Japan would begin the  
week with a strong signal to markets that premature yen strength 
would not be tolerated ahead of an economic recovery, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have said an excessively strong yen would  
slow the country's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	As the yen rises against other currencies, exports become more  
expensive abroad and the yen value of foreign revenue declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank has intervened on three of the last four  
Mondays to sap the yen's strength. However, the BOJ did not step in 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, stocks closed higher on robust gains in  
international blue-chip shares. Sentiment remained solid amid 
continued buying from foreign investors and Japanese individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an awful lot of foreign buying in the market today.  
It is absorbing selling (by institutional investors),'' said 
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo 
Securities.

<P>
	Interest in international blue chips including Sony, Fujitsu and  
Hitachi was especially strong, traders said.

	NAACP Criticizes Gun Industry, TV  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP, calling the upcoming fall television  
lineup ``a virtual whitewash in programming,'' is pushing the four 
major television networks and advertisers to put more minorities on 
their shows. NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said the group is 
considering a lawsuit against the networks charging they violate 
the Communication Act of 1934, which mandates the airwaves belong 
to the public. The 26 new shows slated for the upcoming fall season 
have no minorities in starring or leading roles, Mfume said. The 
NAACP also said it will sue the gun industry, seeking an injunction 
to restrict the marketing of firearms.

	BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for the  
Democratic presidential nomination, promised today he would be a 
president who's tough on crime. Gore unveiled an anti-crime agenda 
that includes photo licenses for all new handgun owners, a ban on 
cheap handguns and a constitutional amendment for victims' rights. 
His plan also includes more federal money for the nation's court 
system and a requirement that criminal defendants pledge to get off 
drugs if they want to stay out of jail.

	Navy Says Puerto Rican Base Needed  
</P>
<P>
	ABOARD THE USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (AP) -- Puerto Rico's government  
is demanding the Navy abandon the outlying island of Vieques, used 
for training for every military operation since Vietnam, including 
Operation Desert Fox in Iraq and this year's Kosovo campaign. But 
the Navy argues that Vieques is the only Atlantic range where it 
can conduct full-blown land, sea and air games, with real 
munitions, under conditions that are closest to the real thing. 
Without the island, Navy officials worry that battle groups won't 
be fully combat-ready.

made their first court appearance. Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Hadi 
Eidarous, 42, and Adel Mohanned Abdul Almagid Bary, 39, were

Finance Ministry officials said Russia needs at least $187 million 
to prepare its computers for the year 2000, the ITAR-Tass news

by the United States. More than 500 fans gathered outside the 
airport, some banging cymbals and drums, while others waved flags 
and sang the national anthem. The team's 5-4 loss on penalty kicks 
after a scoreless game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., was a 
bitter defeat for Chinese fans, many of whom regarded it as a 
grudge match with political overtones.

<HEADLINE> Mexico OKs Extradition for American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A man charged with murder for allegedly  
shooting a mother in the face, slitting her throat and leaving her 
2-year-old quadruplets crawling in her blood will be extradited 
from Mexico, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had to agree not to seek the death penalty to win  
extradition of Jose Luis Del Toro, a U.S. citizen who had put up a 
vigorous fight against his return to Florida. Mexico does not have 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ruled eligible for extradition by the Mexican Supreme  
Court, according to officials who were told about the decision by 
Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Toro was expected to be in court in Florida as early as  
Tuesday. He is charged with murder in the 1997 death of Sheila 
Bellush, 35, who had moved from Texas to Florida to start a new 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bellush, the victim's husband, asked a House subcommittee  
in June for help in pressuring the Mexican government to hand Del 
Toro over. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been convicted for their roles in the crime, and  
authorities say they have compelling evidence against Del Toro, who 
was arrested in Mexico weeks after the killing. He was in the 
country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Rocha, who was convicted of murdering Mrs. Bellush, has  
said he is willing to testify that Mrs. Bellush's ex-husband, San 
Antonio businessman Allen Blackthorne, planned her death. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury in Texas is investigating Blackthorne's role.  
Bellush also has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit accusing 
Blackthorne of arranging to have Mrs. Bellush killed after a bitter 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackthorne has denied any involvement in the killing.  
</P>
<P>
	In a transcript of an interview published in the Sarasota  
Herald-Tribune, Del Toro told Mexican authorities he hit Mrs. 
Bellush twice, leaving her unconscious, but a man he knew only as 
Jorge actually killed the woman.

<HEADLINE> Bell Homer Makes Woman Millionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gylene Hoyle had never been to an Arizona  
Diamondbacks' game. She never considered herself a baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Sunday. Now she loves the Diamondbacks, especially Jay  
Bell. And why not? With one swing of the bat, Bell made her a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle was sitting with her husband and two children a few rows  
behind the Arizona dugout when Bell swung on a 3-2 pitch against 
Oakland in the sixth inning Sunday and sent the ball rocketing 
toward the left field seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my eyes closed at that point,'' she said. ``I didn't  
actually know he'd hit the home run until everyone around me 
started yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle, a 31-year-old child care provider from nearby Chandler,  
won the $1 million prize in the Diamondbacks' grand slam contest. 
At every Sunday home game since the Diamondbacks began play last 
year, there has been a contest where a fan wins tickets, then picks 
a player to hit a grand slam and the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the game tickets and the right to be the grand slam  
contest entrant through KNIX, a Phoenix country music station. She 
figured the odds that she'd win the $1 million were astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to get into the game because we'd never been  
here before,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle chose Bell ``because the rest of my family are big  
Diamondbacks fans and they said he was the best hitter with the 
most home runs.'' Her husband Clayton, a drill rig operator, 
suggested the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bingo.  
</P>
<P>
	After Tony Womack drew a two-out walk, the bases were loaded as  
Bell walked to the plate. He already knew she had chosen him and 
the sixth inning. He was 0-for-12 in the three-game series against 
the A's. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question I wanted to hit a home run there,'' Bell  
said. ``I saw her on our dugout before the game and knew the whole 
situation. Most of the fans did, too. It was a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the A's Jimmy Haynes on the mound, Bell worked the count to  
3-1, then fouled a couple pitches into the seats. The last foul 
barely escaped the reach of catcher Ramon Hernandez. A few rows 
behind the Arizona dugout, sitting with her husband and her two 
children, Colleen 8, and Clayton II, 7, Hoyle was going crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were counting players. I was saying, `Jay Bell isn't going  
to make it in the sixth' and my husband said, `You know, anything 
could happen,' '' she said. ``Then when he got up there and the 
bases were loaded, I just cringed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the foul balls went into the stands, ``my stomach was in  
knots,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he hit it,'' she said, ``I was ecstatic.''  
</P>
<P>
	Haynes delivered a fastball up and over the plate, and Bell hit  
into the left-field seats for his 24th homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's my share?'' Haynes said. ``Maybe I had greater powers  
working against me today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's slam was the fifth of his career and his first in two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 1-for-14 in the series,'' he said, ``and that hit was  
very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Hoyle seemed almost in shock. She hugged Bell outside  
the Diamondbacks' clubhouse and talked about what she'd do with the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' she said, ``other than take a well-deserved  
vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter already had an idea. ``I want to go to  
Disneyland,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle wasn't sure if she'd quit taking care of other people's  
children, despite her newfound wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like the kids I have,'' she said, ``but I won't take  
any more.''

<HEADLINE> 23 Making First All-Star Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Texas Rangers reliever Jeff Zimmerman found  
out he had made his first All-Star team, he was hoping he would get 
a chance to meet Cal Ripken Jr. When the two rode in the same 
elevator on Monday afternoon, though, Zimmerman was too intimidated 
to interrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Scott Williamson, on the other hand, just wants to  
meet Zimmerman, who was playing in front of double-digit crowds in 
France five years ago and then all but gave up the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to meet him and say, 'Look at us. We're longshots,'''  
said Williamson, who couldn't get past hotel security until Reds 
teammate Barry Larkin vouched for him. Now that he's finally gotten 
in the door, Williamson has one goal for the game: ``Don't fall 
down. You've got your whole family watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Ripken making his 17th All-Star appearance and the Mark  
McGwire and Sammy Sosa home run derby taking Fenway's center stage, 
it's easy to forget there are players in the All-Star game who are 
here less to put on a show than to see one. 
</P>
<P>
	And this year, with a whopping 24 players making their first  
All-Star appearance, Ripken and McGwire will be signing even more 
autographs for their teammates than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I feel like the puppy following the big dogs  
around,'' said Shawn Green, the Toronto Blue Jays outfielder who is 
a backup on his first All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	The fan voting for baseball's midsummer classic has long favored  
older stars with bigger names, whether they were having a good year 
or not. And this season is no exception: all 17 of the fans' 
favorites -- there was no designated hitter voting in the NL -- have 
All-Star experience. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the managers and league presidents went to fill out the  
reserve rosters, it was time for the deserving lesser-knowns to get 
their recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the first year is the toughest to get in, because  
fans look at guys who have been doing it for a while,'' said San 
Diego manager Bruce Bochy, the perfect manger for an NL team with 
17 first-time All-Stars because he is a first-timer himself. ``It's 
going to feel good seeing them all on the field, because they're 
all deserving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of them are charismatic -- can't-miss prospects coming into  
prominence for the first time. Some of them are more like 
Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby winner -- former claimers now 
playing on their sport's biggest stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, they're here, and they're going to enjoy themselves  
while they can. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the only All-Star game I can play in, that's  
fine,'' said Brad Ausmus, a Detroit Tigers catcher and New England 
native thrilled to be playing in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored for the first time are National Leaguers Kent  
Bottenfield, Paul Byrd, Mike Hampton, Jose Lima, Kevin Millwood, 
Billy Wagner, Mike Lieberthal, Dave Nilsson, Sean Casey, Alex 
Gonzalez, Jeff Kent, Ed Sprague, Jeromy Burnitz, Luis Gonzalez, 
Vladimir Guerrero and Brian Jordan. AL first-timers are Zimmerman, 
Ausmus, Ron Coomer, John Jaha, Green, Magglio Ordonez and B.J. 
Surhoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's time for some new guys to step in,'' said Padres  
outfielder Tony Gwynn, who has been to 15 All-Star games but was 
replaced by Burnitz in the starting lineup because of an injury. 
``I'm looking forward to seeing them in the clubhouse, to see the 
excitement in their faces. I remember my first game, in '84. You 
think, 'Wow, this is great.' It sticks with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, who leads an AL squad with  
seven first-timers, said he'll make a special effort to get them 
all in the game. ``I love looking at their faces when they walk 
into the clubhouse and see their names up on the lockers,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the players aren't all wide-eyed and star-struck. Some of  
them, like Surhoff and Sprague, have been around quite a while but 
never put everything together all at the right time in order to 
impress the fans or All-Star managers. Others are trying to act 
cool about sharing a clubhouse with future Hall of Famers like 
McGwire and Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in awe of their abilities. But am I intimidated by it?  
No,'' said Bottenfield, the St. Louis Cardinals pitcher. ``We're 
all baseball players here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha went to spring training this year trying to earn a spot on  
the team. He earned one all right -- on the All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	``To even think about an All-Star game was way out of reach for  
me at the time. ... I don't know if I belong here with these 
players who have been here through the years,'' said Jaha, who 
didn't make the Oakland roster until the last day of camp. ``I've 
been battling some things in my career. To be here at 33 makes it 
even more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmerman had dropped out of baseball and received his M.B.A. in  
1996. But when the corporate world didn't bite, he retooled his 
resume and sent a copy to all 30 major league teams. Only Texas was 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``After three or four months, I realized I love baseball too  
much to give it up. I'm just glad it wasn't too late,'' he said. 
``... I've played at the lowest levels. Now I'm playing at the 
highest level. So I guess I have a different perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent acknowledged that some of his teammates aren't household  
names. But he predicted that they will be soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The names that are here at the All-Star game are the names  
that people should remember,'' the San Francisco Giants second 
baseman said. ``They're going to be here year after year.''

<HEADLINE> Win Gives Golfer Eichelberger Boost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Even someone who has doggedly  
pursued his trade for more than 30 years can use a career boost now 
and then. Dave Eichelberger got his by winning the U.S. Senior 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger, a touring pro since 1967, earned his first victory  
in a major when he won the biggest event on the senior tour by 
three strokes on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It came after nearly two months of unspectacular play and was  
his first victory of any kind in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see how it would do anything but help at this point,''  
Eichelberger said. ``But I don't think it's going to change my life 
or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What changes your life is being the father of 20-month-old twins  
at the age of 55. If Eichelberger expends a lot of energy walking 
golf courses, it pales in comparison to what he faces when he 
returns to his home in New Canaan, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably one of the toughest things, keeping up with  
them,'' he said. ``My wife's 10 years younger than me and she's 
pretty tired at the end of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hectic home life hasn't kept Eichelberger off the golf  
course. He has played in 20 tournaments so far and will continue 
his busy schedule. He'll just do it a little more confidently now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to play a lot of tournaments,'' he said. ``That is what  
I love to do more than anything is play in a golf tournament. I 
would imagine I will probably keep doing that for some years to 
come, as long as I am healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of all those tournaments Eichelberger played before the Open, he  
had finished in the top 10 only once, taking second at the Las 
Vegas Classic in mid-May. In the six tournaments that followed, 
Eichelberger's best finish was 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on arriving at the Des Moines Golf and Country Club for  
the Open's practice rounds, it all fell together for Eichelberger, 
a modest, unassuming sort who plays with an icy calmness. On the 
driving range, he found he could hit the ball with a fade off the 
tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never tried to hook the ball one time with the driver all  
week,'' Eichelberger said. ``Everything was aimed down the left 
side and I tried to cut it into the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am kind of excited about that,'' he said. ``I want to go out  
and see if I can get that to work again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger started with rounds of 71, 69, and 73 on the par-72  
course. He trailed leader Ed Dougherty by one stroke going into 
Sunday's round, and as he got ready to play, Eichelberger said he 
could feel it was going to be a good day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swing really felt good,'' he said. ``On the practice tee  
warming up, I was hitting the shots kind of the way I wanted to hit 
them. Then starting off, I hit good shots early on. So I really 
felt very confident with my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger closed with a 68 to finish at 7-under-par 281.  
Dougherty, a winner just once in a 24-year PGA career, wound up 
alone in second at 284, and he, too, will get a boost from the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	His $185,000 paycheck was nearly triple his previous best on the  
tour, and the fans and media loved him. He was witty, expressed 
wide-eyed amazement after each of the three rounds he led the 
tournament and with his massive forearms and barrel chest, looked 
like everyone's favorite uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty's last chance at what would have been an astonishing  
victory vanished when he double-bogeyed the par-3 14th hole. The 
fans didn't care. Two hours after his round, Dougherty was still 
signing autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I shot par, I probably could have, well tied, I guess,'' he  
said. ``That comes into the if story. If a bullfrog had wings, he 
wouldn't bump his rear every time he jumped.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Licensing Handgun Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Monday that mandatory  
licensing of handgun owners would be more effective than ``today's 
patchwork of background checks.'' He left open the possibility that 
he would support additional gun control restrictions if needed to 
protect children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiling a broad anti-crime initiative, Gore acknowledged that  
``the gun lobby is sure to have a fit'' because of his proposals. 
``But to me, it's worth it,'' he said during a speech at the Boston 
Police Station. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential candidate said taking a stand  
against firearms would protect American families. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's create a family lobby that is greater and more powerful  
than the gun lobby,'' he said. ``Our children cannot reach for 
their dreams if they are ducking for cover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth policy address of his campaign, Gore called for  
photo licenses for handgun owners and tougher penalties for hate 
crimes and against those who commit crimes in front of children. He 
said cheap, easily concealed handguns, known as ``junk guns'' or 
``Saturday night specials,'' should be banned. He also proposed a 
constitutional amendment to protect the rights of victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crime must have serious consequences and the rights of victims  
should be at the center of all justice,'' he said. ``How can we 
expect children to choose the good if our very system of justice 
too often fails to side with the good guys?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, during an appearance on ABC's ``Good Morning  
America,'' Gore said that requiring a photo license for handgun 
owners and imposing new ways to trace weapons would be just as 
effective as mandatory registration of all handguns. ``But if other 
provisions are needed, fine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	School shootings this year in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers,  
Ga., have turned gun control into a major issue in the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bradley, Gore's only announced opponent for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, put forth his own gun-control plan last 
month, including proposals for the registration of all handguns and 
a ban on the manufacture and sale of Saturday night specials. He 
also called for a one-per-month limit on handgun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential  
front-runner, has said he favors background checks at gun shows but 
did not support a measure that passed the Senate with Gore's 
tie-breaking vote. The proposal later died in the House. Bush's 
office said the governor thought an NRA-backed version of the 
measure was a better alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the vice president's plan, GOP presidential  
candidate Elizabeth Dole said, ``Where has Al Gore been for the 
last seven years in fighting crime? The Clinton-Gore administration 
has failed to prosecute gun crimes and no amount of posturing can 
make up for Gore being AWOL on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not provide cost estimates for his crime-reduction  
package. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said he supports raising the age for handgun possession  
from 18 to 21, barring juveniles from possessing assault weapons or 
large-capacity ammunition clips, imposing new penalties on adults 
who sell guns to minors and requiring safety locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticizing a criminal justice system that he said ``is too  
often a revolving door, where even violent criminals get a slap on 
the wrist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he would work to improve an overcrowded court system ,  
and he vowed to help states that want to ban plea bargains for 
drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also asked for more prosecutors and public defenders, and  
urged Congress to stop delaying the appointment of 72 federal 
judges whose seats remain empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said his intensified war on drugs would expand drug  
treatment for at-risk youth, double the number of drug hotspots 
that police aggressively monitor, attack the increased trafficking 
of methamphetamines, and target alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for ``zero tolerance'' of guns and drugs in schools.  
</P>
<P>
	``Parents have a right to know if a child has brought a gun to  
school, and schools should be legally required to tell them,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's plan also includes a ``Stay Clean to Stay Out'' policy  
that requires prisoners convicted of drug-related crimes to pass 
drug tests before being released. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the technology buff, Gore also called for more use of  
computers in law enforcement, including software that police could 
use to map and target high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Other features of Gore's anti-crime package include  
establishment of ``gang-free zones'' with curfews for known gang 
members; more aid for professional development and training of 
police officers; and a quadrupling of the country's commitment to 
after-school programs for young people.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Basketball Takes Sixth Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- After a close call in  
the semifinals, the U.S. men's basketball team wrapped up its sixth 
straight World University Games gold medal and 40th straight win -- 
both records -- by routing Yugoslavia 79-65 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's team, playing without two starters, was upset  
by host Spain 57-48 in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin led the U.S. men with 21 points,  
several coming off dunks against the outsized and outclassed 
Yugoslavs. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Mladen Sekularac, the only member of the Yugoslavian  
team who plays in the country's first division, had a game-high 31 
points in the men's final. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept running plays for him, isolating him. That hurt  
their team. When we locked them down defensively, the game was 
pretty much over,'' said U.S. head coach Oliver Purnell, an 
assistant on the 1995 University Games squad that featured recent 
NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan and league scoring-leader Allen Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	The current crop of college stars -- five of the 12 team members  
have NCAA Final Four experience -- struggled. The opener against 
South Korea was tight early in the second half, Canada led at 
halftime in their quarterfinal matchup, and Saturday's semifinal 
against Spain was a two-point game with 20 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invented the game, so our guys certainly expected to get  
the gold. But it wasn't easy,'' said Purnell, who coaches at 
Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody tried to play their `A' game against us, and the  
international game is more physical than what we're used to,'' said 
Kevin Freeman, a member of Connecticut's NCAA championship team. 
``But we stayed focused, because we didn't want to be the U.S. team 
that didn't bring home the gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women shot just 27 percent from the field, including  
1-of-12 from 3-point range in front of a hostile crowd at muggy Son 
Moix arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosaura Sanchez led Spain with 14 points, and Nieves Llamas  
added 13. Spain had not participated in the University Games since 
taking its only previous medal -- a silver -- in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball wasn't falling for us, and we kind of put out heads  
down,'' said guard Katie Douglas, who led the U.S. with 14 points. 
``If you're not doing well on offense, you have to dig in on 
defense. We didn't. We let them dictate things all game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas is one of two U.S. players from NCAA champion Purdue  
University. The other, Camille Cooper, missed the gold medal game 
with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia won the women's bronze with a 77-71 victory over Ukraine.  
</P>
<P>
	In other action on the penultimate day of this Olympics-style  
event, Romania's Lonela Tirlea ran the year's fastest time for the 
women's 400 meters, and set a new University Games record in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Tirlea, European champion in the 400 hurdles, clocked 49.98  
seconds to win easily. Mikele Barber of the United States edged 
Nigeria's Doris Jacob to take the silver with a time of 51.03. The 
Romanian was supposed to compete in the hurdles here, but said she 
didn't arrive in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners in track and field events included Yulia Taranova  
of Russia in the women's 800 meters, Jerome Davis of the United 
States in the men's 400, and Cuba's Raul Duany in the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	In judo, South Korea won the men's team event and France claimed  
the women's title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the soccer final, Fernando Soriano scored the go-ahead goal  
in the 110th minute of play to give Spain a 2-1 victory over Italy. 
Brazil beat South Korea 5-4 on penalty kicks after supplemental 
time ended with the countries tied 2-2 to take the soccer bronze

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lamb Tariffs Prompt Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Australian Prime Minister John Howard  
complained to President Clinton today about punitive U.S. tariffs 
on foreign lamb but said the dispute should not be allowed to mar 
relations between the United States and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disappointed and upset and cranky about the U.S.  
lamb decision,'' the prime minister said after a White House 
luncheon with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard paused to talk with reporters outside the White House.  
Standing under an umbrella in the rain, he said he told Clinton the 
lamb decision triggered perhaps the biggest trade row ever in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're upset at the decision, but it's not going to be  
changed,'' Howard said. ``I understand that. Doesn't make it any 
easier for us. We don't agree with the decision. Equally we can't 
allow it to contaminate a broader relationship -- certainly not the 
security aspects of that relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tariffs are intended to protect American lamb producers  
threatened by imports from New Zealand and Australia, which between 
them account for 95 percent of the lamb imported into the United 
States. American ranchers had complained that current tariffs of 
less than 1 percent were too low to protect them from foreign 
competitors flooding the U.S. market with exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new tariffs, a border tax of 9 percent will be imposed on  
the first 31,851 metric tons, the amount of lamb imported last 
year. Shipments above that will carry a 40 percent tariff. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said the tariffs ``caused the most adverse reaction of  
any trade decision the United States has taken in recent times. I 
can't think of one that's caused a more adverse reaction in 
Australia. I told the president that. I told those who were at the 
lunch that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, that doesn't mean that you allow it to contaminate other  
aspects of a very broad and a very deep relationship,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House played down the dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton spoke with  
Howard and New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley before 
announcing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I think they understand our view,'' Lockhart said. He said  
the International Trade Commission on lamb supported Clinton's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that despite the dispute, ``We have a very strong  
and broad-based relationship with Australia. And I don't expect 
this particular trade dispute to sour that relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time we have trade issues with allies around the  
world and try to resolve them in the best way we can,'' Lockhart 
said. ``But this is a very strong relationship that certainly can 
be sustained despite disputes that arise from time to time.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Indiana Player Injured in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- Former Indiana basketball standout Luke  
Recker was recovering from a broken arm, facial cuts and a 
partially severed ear after a head-on collision in rural 
southwestern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, 21, was listed in fair condition today at Mercy Hospital  
in Durango. He spent much of Sunday before undergoing plastic 
surgery to his face and left ear. Hospital spokesman Joe Wade Plunk 
said Recker would probably not be released until Tuesday at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the vehicle in which Recker was a passenger was  
killed in Saturday night's three-car crash on County Road 240 near 
Durango. He was identified as John Hollbert, 23, of Senoia, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four passengers riding with Recker were also injured,  
one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were Kelly Craig, 19, of Jasper, Ind., an Indiana  
student identified by Indianapolis TV station WRTV as Recker's 
girlfriend. The state patrol said she suffered a spinal fracture 
and partial paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 17-year-old brother Jason Craig, a senior football player at  
Jasper High School, suffered a head injury and a fractured spleen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Craigs were transported Sunday to the San Juan Regional  
Medical Center in Farmington, N.M., where Jason was listed in 
critical condition in intensive care and Kelly in serious, 
spokeswoman Rhonda Warden said . 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the Recker car identified by the State Patrol were  
Joanne McGuine, 18, of Durango, listed in serious condition, and 
Brian O'Hare, 23, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who was in good 
condition today at Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker reportedly was part of a group of 17 people driving to a  
carnival in Durango when a truck driven by Bob Hardwick, 21, of 
Durango, drifted across the center line at about 70 mph, State 
Trooper Mike McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck then sideswiped a pickup carrying 11 people in  
Recker's group and collided head-on with the Ford Taurus that 
Recker was riding in. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the people in the pickup truck that was sideswiped was  
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado State Patrol said Hardwick was being held under  
$500,000 bond for investigation of vehicular homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	McGuire said drunken driving also is suspected, but he was  
awaiting blood toxicology reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, a Mr. Basketball in Indiana, transferred from Indiana to  
Arizona this year. He averaged 16.2 points and four rebounds last 
season as a sophomore forward for the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker will sit out this year and will have two years of  
eligibility remaining.

<HEADLINE>  Greenpeace, Whalers Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norwegian whale hunters tussled with  
Greenpeace activists in the North Sea on Monday, with Greenpeace 
claiming the whalers shot at them and the whalers insisting they 
fired at a whale. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured. The Norwegian Coast Guard seized the  
Greenpeace vessel Sirius and arrested 15 activists, but had no 
information about a rifle shot, said Grethe Skundberg Lovvik of the 
Norwegian Southern Defense Command. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty amazing that the coast guard didn't react to a  
rifle shot that could have been life threatening, and then arrested 
us,'' Greenpeace spokesman Frode Pleym said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sirius had been pursuing the whaling boat Kato through the  
North Sea, 100 miles off Norway's southwestern coast. Lovvik said 
the activists repeatedly had been told to withdraw from a 500 yard 
security zone around the Kato. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were hampering a legal hunt,'' Lovvik said from the west  
coast town of Stavanger. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling  
in 1986 to protect some types of whales from extinction. However, 
the Norwegian hunt is legal because commission rules allow members 
to reject its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway enraged environmentalists in 1993 by resuming its hunts,  
and since has faced boycott threats, protests, sabotage and 
confrontations at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Kato skipper Ole Myklebust told the Norwegian news agency NTB  
the shot was fired at the harpooned whale to make sure it was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenpeace was trying to cut the rope between the whale and  
the boat just as we were about to kill it,'' Myklebust was quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace's Pleym, who was in Oslo, denied that activists were  
trying to cut the rope, but acknowledged the rubber boat was 
between the Kato and the harpooned whale. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's annual whale hunt all but stopped earlier this month,  
with just 500 of a quota of 753 whales killed, partly because the 
market for whale meat in Norway was saturated. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway says minke whales, the smallest of the baleen whales at  
about 30 feet, are plentiful and can sustain a hunt.

	Under the deal, CompUSA will close its distribution center in  
Grapevine, Texas, and will no longer stock, configure or custom 
assemble computers for its commercial customers. Ingram Micro will 
take over these operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram Micro was named as  
one of four distributors for Compaq Computers, which is the world's 
leader in retail computer sales, according to the research firm PC 
Data. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq had been using 39 distributors, but made the cut to  
better manage inventory levels and streamline distribution, the 
company said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of this move, CompUSA needed to partner with Ingram -- or  
one of the other distributors -- in order to have direct access to 
Compaq machines.

<HEADLINE> Supremacist Group Being Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- The white supremacist group linked to  
the Fourth of July weekend shooting spree is under investigation 
for possible violations of state tax and charities regulations. The 
group's leader says it doesn't have to pay taxes because it is a 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Department of Revenue and the Illinois Attorney  
General's Charitable Trusts Bureau launched probes into the East 
Peoria-based World Church of the Creator. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigations come in the wake of the shooting spree that  
left two people dead and nine others injured in Illinois and 
Indiana before suspected gunman Benjamin Nathaniel Smith committed 
suicide. Smith, 21, had been a member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Revenue wants to know whether the group  
violated any tax laws, spokesman Mike Klemens said. In August 1995, 
the department denied an application for sales tax-exempt status 
filed by Matt Hale of East Peoria, who had just become the group's 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``They applied to us as a religious organization,'' Klemens  
said. ``They are not a religious organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was adamant Sunday. ``We will not pay taxes. We are a  
church,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police recovered a receipt for $6,190 from East Central  
Communications in Rantoul made out to Ben Smith. The printing 
company delivered 100,000 copies of literature it printed for the 
group in June to a storage locker rented by Smith and Hale, general 
manager Dennis Kaster said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group did not pay sales tax on the purchase, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The state is also investigating whether the group should be  
collecting taxes on sales of the book ``The White Man's Bible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who sells merchandise has to pay taxes,'' said Floyd  
Perkins, chief of the Illinois General's Charitable Trusts Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said his group does not need to collect sales tax because  
selling the book on white supremacy is part of their religious 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials are also trying to determine what kind of  
organization the World Church of the Creator is, and whether it 
violated charitable trust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization is not registered as a church, a charity or a  
business with the revenue department, the Illinois Attorney 
General's Office or the Internal Revenue Service. But Perkins said 
because the organization has asked for donations for publications, 
the law requires it to register as a charity in Illinois.

<HEADLINE> A's Activate Catcher Macfarlane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics activated catcher  
Mike Macfarlane from the 15-day disabled list Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on their roster, the A's optioned catcher A.J.  
Hinch to Triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Macfarlane sprained his thumbs after a collision at home plate  
with Steve Decker of Anaheim on June 26. He is batting .267 with 
one home run and 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Macfarlane re-signed with Oakland this year to help develop  
Hinch, who is batting .203 and has thrown out seven baserunners in 
39 attempts in his second year with the A's.

<HEADLINE>  Greenpeace, Whalers Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norwegian whale hunters tussled with  
Greenpeace activists in the North Sea on Monday, with Greenpeace 
claiming the whalers shot at them and the whalers insisting they 
fired at a whale. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured. The Norwegian Coast Guard seized the  
Greenpeace vessel Sirius and arrested 15 activists, but had no 
information about a rifle shot, said Grethe Skundberg Lovvik of the 
Norwegian Southern Defense Command. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty amazing that the coast guard didn't react to a  
rifle shot that could have been life threatening, and then arrested 
us,'' Greenpeace spokesman Frode Pleym said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sirius had been pursuing the whaling boat Kato through the  
North Sea, 100 miles off Norway's southwestern coast. Lovvik said 
the activists repeatedly had been told to withdraw from a 500 yard 
security zone around the Kato. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were hampering a legal hunt,'' Lovvik said from the west  
coast town of Stavanger. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling  
in 1986 to protect some types of whales from extinction. However, 
the Norwegian hunt is legal because commission rules allow members 
to reject its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway enraged environmentalists in 1993 by resuming its hunts,  
and since has faced boycott threats, protests, sabotage and 
confrontations at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Kato skipper Ole Myklebust told the Norwegian news agency NTB  
the shot was fired at the harpooned whale to make sure it was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenpeace was trying to cut the rope between the whale and  
the boat just as we were about to kill it,'' Myklebust was quoted 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace's Pleym, who was in Oslo, denied that activists were  
trying to cut the rope, but acknowledged the rubber boat was 
between the Kato and the harpooned whale. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's annual whale hunt all but stopped earlier this month,  
with just 500 of a quota of 753 whales killed, partly because the 
market for whale meat in Norway was saturated. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway says minke whales, the smallest of the baleen whales at  
about 30 feet, are plentiful and can sustain a hunt.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 11.71 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip shares edged higher today, but the  
broad market was mixed as investors cautiously awaited the coming 
flood of second-quarter earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 11.71 at 11,205.41, having erased an earlier 38-point deficit. 
The Dow was once again in record territory, having achieved a new 
closing high of 11,193.70 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several broader stock indicators remained in negative territory,  
although the Nasdaq composite index was up 12.45 at 2,805.52 as 
technology shares showed some strength. The Nasdaq also closed at a 
record high on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.94 at 1,400.34.  
</P>
<P>
	With quarterly profit reports beginning in earnest on Tuesday,  
traders were hesitant to make any big bets. Most stocks traded in a 
narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
	International Paper was up 2 3/8 to 54 1/8 to lead the rebound in the  
Dow, which also drew a boost from American Express, up 2 1/8 at 135 3/8, 
and Eastman Kodak, up 2 1/8 to 73 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Among leading technology names, Microsoft was up 1 3/8 to 94 5/8 and  
Sun Micrososytems was up 2 5/8 to 75 9/16 to lead the Nasdaq recovery. 
Intel, scheduled to release its earnings on Tuesday, was off 7/16 
at 65 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer, which got a vote of confidence from Goldman Sachs  
last week, was up 15/16 at 43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Infoseek was down 3 5/8 at 47 7/8 after Disney, which holds a 42  
percent stake in the Internet search engine provider, said it would 
buy the rest of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, but advancers took a small lead in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume came to 452.11 million shares, ahead of Friday's  
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was off 1.30 at 656.38, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.49 at 813.22.

<HEADLINE>  Green Monster Focus at Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. wants a piece of the Green  
Monster. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the All-Star focus clearly on Fenway Park's famous  
left-field fixture, Junior has a plan for Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chip some paint off the wall, put it in a bag and take it  
home,'' Griffey said Monday. ``There's something I will take from 
this ballpark before I leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll let Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire try to clear the  
37-foot-high wall -- after all, he's hit only eight of his 379 
career shots at Fenway. Griffey still won Monday night's home run 
derby for the second year, overcoming a monstrous performance by 
Big Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey will let Ted Williams and Carlton Fisk look out toward  
the wall and reminisce -- they spent many years playing in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior just wants a keepsake.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a classic,'' the Seattle center fielder said. ``There are  
certain ballparks that have a lot of tradition behind them, and 
this is one of them. And before they tear it down, they've having 
an All-Star game here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a recent run in which many of the majors' newer stadiums  
got to play host, baseball returns to its roots for the final 
All-Star game of the 20th century. Fenway opened in 1912, the same 
week the Titanic sunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one old park I haven't played in,'' San Diego  
outfielder Tony Gwynn said. ``I saw what Wade Boggs used to do 
here. I'm looking forward to doing it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, tied with Boggs at 2,982 career hits, won't be able to  
help the National League try to extend its 40-28-1 edge. Hobbled by 
injuries, he'll sit out as Boston ace Pedro Martinez starts for the 
AL against Philadelphia's Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gwynn wanted to take batting practice Monday and maybe  
field a few balls off the wall. How excited was he about seeing 
Fenway? He had a book detailing the history of the ballpark in his 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	NL manager Bruce Bochy of the Padres was equally enthused.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in Fenway. You step on the field, it's  
hallowed ground,'' he said. ``I hate to age Carlton, but I was a 
Reds fan and now I get to walk in there and see where it really 
went out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk's down-the-line, 12th-inning shot that won Game 6 of the  
1975 World Series remains one of baseball's most enduring images. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Green Monster, when you talk about it, everybody knows  
where the Green Monster is,'' said Fisk, the AL's honorary captain. 
``There are plans that they're going to build a brand new, 
old-fashioned ballpark. That doesn't cut off your memories and the 
stories that have taken place in the old ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who will throw out the ceremonial first ball, put on a  
one-man show in the 1946 All-Star game at Fenway. He hit two 
homers, including a drive off Rip Sewell's ``eephus'' pitch, in 
going 4-for-4 with five RBIs in a 12-0 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the 80-year-old Williams claimed he won't miss  
Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm not sentimental about it. I want to see a new ballpark  
where the seats are bigger,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot of fans say, `Oh, geez, I wouldn't even think  
about going anyplace else.' It wasn't that great. The park is just 
an old park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a lot of history wrapped up in that wall.  
</P>
<P>
	At times, it was made of wood, brick, concrete and sheet metal.  
Now, the side facing the hitters is all tin and stretches about 240 
feet toward center field. 
</P>
<P>
	It became known as the Green Monster in 1947 when ads for  
Lifebuoy, Gem Blades and other products were covered up with green 
paint. There's also a thin ladder running to the top -- grounds crew 
members use it to retrieve balls that wind up in the 23-foot screen 
on top. 
</P>
<P>
	One other fact about the wall: The initials of former owner  
Thomas Austin Yawkey and his wife, Jean Remington Yawkey, appear on 
it in morse code. Easy to overlook, a series of dots and dashes for 
``T-A-Y'' and ``J-R-Y'' show up in the vertical white lines to the 
left of pitchers' numbers on the out-of-town scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Bradley of the Red Sox hit the first shot over the wall on  
April 26, 1912 -- ``Few of the fans who have been out to Fenway Park 
believed it was possible,'' the Boston Herald reported the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his first major league homer over the Monster off Roger  
Clemens in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me real proud of myself,'' the Chicago Cubs slugger  
said. ``After I did that, I knew I could play in the major 
leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit 18 home runs at Fenway, most of them to left. In the  
first round of Monday's derby, he hit 13 in 23 swings, including a 
drive off a light tower above the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocky Colavito connected for the AL in the 1961 All-Star game at  
Fenway, stopped by rain after nine innings for a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Marked at 310 feet down the line in left, many believe the wall  
isn't even that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's right on top of you,'' Anaheim reliever Troy Percival  
said. ``It's much too close for comfort when you're on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust ol' Ted Williams on this one.  
</P>
<P>
	``The wall's 290 feet,'' he said. ``When I first got there in  
left field, they had a rise out there to let you know you're 
getting near the fence. But that was taken out. 
</P>
<P>
	``But still I knew the wall was only 290 feet. And I had a good  
conception of how close I was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Outlines Top Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTERSET, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole said Monday that tax cuts  
must be a top priority for presidential hopefuls, but she also 
called for more government spending in several areas, including 
defense and crime fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	During campaign stops across central Iowa, Mrs. Dole repeatedly  
said she thinks it's wrong that 40 percent of the average American 
family's income goes to pay taxes. Mrs. Dole did not offer many 
specifics, but pledged to cut Americans' taxes if elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she wants to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty  
tax structure that causes some married couples to pay more in taxes 
than people who are single. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very important that we give tax relief so our  
families can keep more of their hard-earned dollars,'' Mrs. Dole 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also outlined several ideas that would require more  
government spending, including a call for a missile defense system 
to guard against possible attacks from countries developing missile 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned that the Clinton-Gore administration has  
reduced the Pentagon to a triangle, and we've got to build it 
back,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also took aim at Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has  
raised more money than any other GOP hopeful and leads most polls. 
</P>
<P>
	At each stop Monday, Mrs. Dole asked those in the crowd to  
support her at a GOP straw poll Aug. 14 in Ames. While the poll 
will not determine any electoral votes, Iowa Republicans will cast 
unofficial ballots and many view the event as an early test of 
candidates' strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole asked people to support her at the straw poll if they  
``feel this election should be about the person who has the most 
experience rather than the one who has raised the most money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think when we're talking about the president of the  
United States, experience is important,'' she said, citing her work 
in two Cabinet positions and as president of the American Red 
Cross.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Takes Tour de France Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METZ, France (AP) -- Soon, the plane would be taking off for  
Geneva on the way to the French Alps, where the Tour de France gets 
a whole lot more grueling. First, it was time for champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Armstrong won Sunday's crucial time trial a few hours  
earlier, recapturing the yellow jersey and staking his claim as a 
clear favorite to win cycling's biggest race. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service team had a champagne toast to celebrate  
their star rider's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to expect it. It's another thing to see it  
happen,'' Mark Gorski, the team's general manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old rider from Texas is earning a lot of new  
admirers these days, far from home. Many see his comeback from 
testicular cancer to the very top of cycling as inspiring, not to 
mention amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``His comeback is great!'' said 19-year-old Christian Kohl of  
Germany, waiting for an autograph before the race. ``He was so 
sick, and now he's one of the favorites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, wearing the red-white-and-blue jersey of the U.S.  
Postal Service team, powered through the 34-mile course in 1 hour, 
8 minutes and 36 seconds. He rode at an average speed of nearly 30 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	He left such specialists as Spain's Abraham Olano, the world  
time-trial champion, and Britain's Chris Boardman in the dust. 
Armstrong called it ``one of the greatest victories of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Armstrong, once so severely ill that almost everyone assumed  
his career was over -- at the very least -- is a decisive favorite as 
the Tour hits the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's stage wasn't kind to all American riders. Bobby Julich,  
who came in third overall last year, fell on a steep descent during 
the time trial and is out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Julich, who rides for the French team Cofidis, was taken to a  
hospital, where he was found to have bruised ribs. Nothing was 
broken, except his hopes for this year's Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old from Glenwood Springs, Colo., fell at the  
18.6-mile mark, on a descent where riders were traveling at about 
46 mph. He was was in 20th place overall going into Sunday's stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Things worked out better for another American, Tyler Hamilton of  
U.S. Postal, who came in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Zulle of Switzerland was in second place, 58 seconds  
behind, followed by Frenchman Christophe Moreau, 2:05 behind. Olano 
came in fourth, at 2:22 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Moreau is second, followed by Olano and then Australian  
Stuart O'Grady. Spaniard Alvaro Gonzalez Galdeano is fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the team trailer before the race, Armstrong exuded  
confidence, joking with a teammate as he warmed up on a stationary 
bike. He even strummed a few bars of air guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance knew this was the day the Tour really began for him,''  
said Dan Osipow, operations manager for U.S. Postal. ``He's been 
waiting for this day for quite a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Armstrong took great care to learn Sunday's course,  
coming to Metz on a rainy day in April to try it out. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer  
that spread to his lungs and brain. He underwent surgery to remove 
his right testicle and lesions from his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After long months of rehabilitation and recovery, Armstrong  
returned to racing early last year, and has been steadily 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
	He was considered a favorite for the time trial ever since he  
won the race prologue, also a time trial. He wore the yellow jersey 
for two days before losing it to Estonian Jaan Kirsipuu. 
</P>
<P>
	In public, he's appeared calm and focused all week. But after  
finishing Sunday, he admitted to a case of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I won the yellow jersey a week ago,'' he said,  
``because I was really nervous while I had it. Maybe now I'll be 
less nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The riders were traveling to the Alps on today, a rest day.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 23.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell today, ending a brief  
foray into record territory, as investors cautiously awaited the 
coming flood of quarterly profit reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 23.43 at 11,170.27, having surrendered a 36-point gain in 
earlier trading. On Friday, the Dow rose 66 points to a record 
11,193.70, extending 1999's gain to more than 2,000 points, or 
nearly 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly posting modest losses,  
although the Nasdaq composite index was still flirting with a 
record high, down just 0.73 at 2,792.34. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
index was down 6.39 at 1,396.89. 
</P>
<P>
	With the flow of reports on the just ended second quarter  
beginning in earnest on Tuesday, traders were hesitant to make any 
big bets. Most stocks traded in a narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric, which posted its results last week, was down 2  
3/16 at 114 15/16 to lead the Dow's retreat, offsetting gains by 
International Paper, up 1 7/8 at 53 5/8, and Eastman Kodak, up 1 15/16 at 
73 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Among leading Nasdaq technology names, Sun Micrososytems was up  
2 13/16 at 75 3/4. Intel, scheduled to release its earnings on 
Tuesday, was off 3/4 at 65 1/2. Dell Computer, which got a vote of 
confidence from Goldman Sachs last week, was up 15/16 at 43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, but advancers held a small lead in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume came to 531.50 million shares, down from Friday's  
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was off 2.49 at 655.19, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.09 at 812.64.

<HEADLINE> Rapper DMX Arrested in Trinidad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- Rapper DMX was arrested in  
mid-concert by police who accused him of using obscene language. 
</P>
<P>
	DMX, whose real name is Earl Simmons, was led from the stage  
Saturday night as concertgoers hurled bottles at police, who fired 
their guns into the air to control the angry crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	DMX remained in jail Sunday pending a court appearance scheduled  
today. It was unclear Sunday what words Simmons was charged with 
using. 
</P>
<P>
	Public use of obscene language is illegal in this conservative  
former British colony. Police stopped a concert by hip-hop singer 
Foxy Brown on July 3 and escorted her off the stage because of 
similar allegations. No criminal charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	DMX has had been in trouble with police in his own country. The  
28-year-old rapper was charged last month in New Jersey with 
possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. He also is free on 
bail in connection with an assault charge in Yonkers, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Indiana Player Injured in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- Luke Recker, a former Indiana basketball  
standout, was recuperating Monday after undergoing surgery to 
repair an ear severely lacerated in a fatal weekend car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, 21, also suffered facial cuts, but did not have a broken  
arm, as was initially reported, said Mercy Hospital spokesman Joe 
Wade Plunk. Recker was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's resting peacefully in his bed. His parents are at his  
bedside,'' said Plunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be absolutely perfect,'' Clair Recker, the  
athlete's father, told the Tucson (Ariz.) Citizen. ``There were no 
broken bones. ... There were some severe lacerations to the left 
ear area. An artery was hit, but he'll be fine. He also sprained 
his left wrist. He's very fortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker and four friends were injured in the three-car accident  
Saturday night on County Road 240 near Durango in southwestern 
Colorado. He was a passenger in a vehicle driven by John Hollbert, 
23, of Senoia, Ga., who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Kelly Craig, 19, of Jasper, Ind., an Indiana student  
identified by Indianapolis TV station WRTV as Recker's girlfriend, 
suffered a spinal fracture and partial paralysis, according to a 
Colorado State Patrol report. 
</P>
<P>
	Her brother Jason Craig, 17, a senior football player at Jasper  
High School, injured his head and spleen, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Craig was in serious condition and Craig was in critical  
condition in intensive care at the San Juan Regional Medical Center 
in Farmington, N.M., said spokeswoman Rhonda Warden. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona coach Lute Olson, who will coach Recker next year, said  
he was hoping for a full recovery for Recker and the Craigs. 
</P>
<P>
	``For something like this to happen to young people who have so  
much in front of them is just horrible and really puts life into 
perspective,'' Olson said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the Recker car identified by the Colorado State Patrol  
were Joanne McGurk, 18, of Durango, listed in serious condition, 
and Brian O'Hara, 23, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who was in good 
condition Monday at Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	They reportedly were among 17 people traveling to a carnival in  
Durango when a truck driven by Bob Hardwick, 21, of Durango drifted 
across the center line at about 70 mph, State Trooper Mike McGuire 
said. Hardwick and a passenger suffered facial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck sideswiped a pickup carrying 11 people in Recker's  
group and collided head-on with the Ford Taurus in which Recker was 
a passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the people in the pickup truck was hospitalized.  
</P>
<P>
	The patrol report stated that Hardwick was being held under  
$500,000 bond on charges of vehicular homicide, vehicular assault 
and drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker transferred from Indiana to Arizona this year. He  
averaged 16.2 points and four rebounds last season as a sophomore 
forward for the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker will sit out this year and will have two years of  
eligibility remaining.

<HEADLINE> Disney Acquires Rest of Infoseek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. is consolidating its online  
strategy by acquiring the rest of Infoseek Corp. that it doesn't 
already own, the two companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney will pool its existing Internet assets with those of  
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Infoseek into the go.com site they 
currently operate, which will then serve as the online arm of the 
entertainment conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies did not disclose the value of the Disney assets  
being contributed to the deal. Disney shares, which have slumped 
badly this year on lower earnings, edged up 25 cents to $27.87 1/2 in 
early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange. Infoseek's 
shares fell $4.50 to $47 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney had already taken a 42 percent stake in Infoseek last  
year and worked with it to create the Go Network, which is powered 
by Infoseek's search capabilities. The site, which competes with 
Yahoo!, Excite and other major ``portal'' sites, offers Web 
searches, entertainment and personalized news. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney will contribute its other Internet properties to the new  
venture, including the Web site for its TV network, ABC.com, the 
online store that sells Disney products, its kids site Disney.com 
and the sports site ESPN.com. Disney will also add its share of 
several Internet projects it co-owns with Infoseek. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the transaction, which is expected to close  
by the end of this year, Infoseek shareholders will receive 1.15 
shares of the new company for each Infoseek share they own. Disney 
will own about 72 percent of go.com, which is expected to have 
revenues of about $350 million this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and CEO, said in a statement  
that ``go.com will unlock the value and potential of our combined 
Internet assets and position them to ignite the marketplace with 
new products and services reaching millions of current and new 
users around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney's Internet business, like the Internet itself, is only  
beginning to realize its potential,'' said Thomas O. Staggs, chief 
financial officer of Disney, who has been a key figure in 
developing Disney's online strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney had revealed a month ago that it was in talks to acquire  
the rest of Infoseek. At the time, Disney also said it was taking a 
``significant'' stake in a venture called eCompanies that will 
serve as an incubator for Internet startups. ECompanies was formed 
by Jake Winebaum, who had a key role in building Disney's own 
Internet efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Motro will leave as president and CEO of Infoseek after  
the merger is completed. Motro said he wants to spend more time 
with his family.

<HEADLINE> Gore Outlines Anti-Crime Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Unveiling a broad anti-crime initiative, Vice  
President Al Gore today proposed requiring photo licenses for all 
new handgun owners and tougher penalties for those who commit 
crimes in front of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our children cannot reach for their dreams if they are ducking  
for cover,'' he said in a speech at the Boston Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized a criminal justice system that he said puts half a  
million unrepentant, unrehabilitated and drug- or alcohol-addicted 
prisoners back on the streets each year. These ``walking time-bombs 
of violence'' pose a danger to families and children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In what was billed as his fourth major policy address as a  
Democratic presidential candidate, Gore touched on dozens of 
hot-button issues, including exploiters of the elderly, school 
violence, Internet stalkers and domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed a constitutional amendment to protect the  
rights of victims. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no estimate on the cost of the package.  
</P>
<P>
	School shootings this year in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers,  
Ga., have turned gun control into a major issue in the 2000 
presidential campaign. Bill Bradley, Gore's only announced opponent 
for the Democratic presidential nomination, has outlined his own 
anti-crime initiatives, including handgun registration and a ban on 
the manufacture and sale of cheap handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Gore said crime had dropped across the nation  
since President Clinton's anti-crime bill was passed, but he said 
those measures were only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed tougher penalties for those who commit crimes in  
front of children, for repeat drug abusers and for those who commit 
hate crimes, calling on Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would work to improve an overcrowded court  
system that is less like the television show ``Law and Order'' and 
more like the game show ``Let's Make a Deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said his intensified war on drugs would focus on known drug  
hot spots, the increased trafficking of methamphetamines, and also 
would focus on alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring a photo license for handgun purchases and imposing new  
ways to trace weapons will be just as effective as mandatory 
registration of all handguns, Gore said earlier today on ABC's 
``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if other provisions are needed, fine,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The most far-reaching of Gore's proposals deal with gun control.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will insist on a policy of zero tolerance toward guns and  
drugs in our schools,'' he said in Boston. ``Parents have a right 
to know if a child has brought a gun to school, and schools should 
be legally required to tell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called for the creation of ``second-chance schools'' where  
kids heading for trouble can receive discipline and guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is too easy for a child to get a gun and there are too many  
political leaders who take their marching orders from the gun 
lobby,'' Gore said. ``Let's create a family lobby that is greater 
and more powerful than the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheap, easily concealed handguns, known as ``junk guns'' or  
``Saturday night specials,'' would be banned under his proposal. 
Under current federal law, semiautomatic rifles equipped with 
detachable magazines and certain other features are banned. Similar 
guidelines are imposed on handguns and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also wants tougher penalties for gun trafficking.  
</P>
<P>
	The vice president has already said he supports raising the age  
for handgun possession from 18 to 21; barring juveniles from 
possessing assault weapons or large-capacity ammunition clips; 
imposing new penalties for adults who sell guns to minors; and 
requiring safety locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Gore's new gun-control proposals would be approved by  
Congress is questionable. The vice president cast a tie-breaking 
vote in May when the Senate passed legislation expanding a system 
of background checks on firearms purchases so they would cover all 
such buys at gun shows and pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign hoped that the moment of drama would add momentum  
to his campaign. But political squabbling between Democrats and 
Republicans helped kill a House gun-control bill in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's anti-crime package includes a ``Stay Clean to Stay Out''  
policy that says defendants in drug-related crimes who are awaiting 
trial must get off drugs to stay out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminals on parole also would have to stay off drugs to stay  
out of jail, under the proposed policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before you get out of jail, you have to stay clean and if you  
want to stay out then you better stay clean,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the technology buff, Gore would make increasing use of  
computers in law enforcement, investing in software that community 
police could use to map and target high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Other features of the anti-crime package include establishment  
of ``gang-free zones,'' more aid for professional development and 
retraining of police officers and increased spending on 
after-school programs for youths and anti-drug efforts.

<HEADLINE> Roche, Trimeris Agree on HV Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche has  
reached a deal with Durham, N.C.-based Trimeris Inc. to complete 
human testing and development of its two experimental anti-HIV 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche and Trimeris will share equally the development expenses  
and profits for the fusion inhibitors, T-20 and T-1249, in the 
United States and Canada, Roche said Monday. The Swiss company will 
pay for all development costs elsewhere, market the drugs worldwide 
and ``pay Trimeris undisclosed royalties on net sales of these 
products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary results of a study reported last November in the  
journal Nature Medicine showed T-20 cut the level of the AIDS virus 
in patients' blood by as much as 99 percent in two weeks. T-20 is 
in the second of three phases of human testing. It is as potent as 
currently approved drugs, which can drive the virus down to 
undetectable levels when taken longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug sabotages HIV's machinery for penetrating into the  
body's cells, a different strategy from that used in approved HIV 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche will make an initial cash payment to Trimeris of $10  
million. Additional payments of up to $78 million will be made as 
the drug reaches the market, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second drug, T-1249, which also inhibits HIV fusion, also  
has received fast track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration and is in the first phases of human testing, Roche 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies plan to begin a full-scale development program  
and clinical trials for both drugs in the coming months.

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Get $124M in Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- U.S. consumers with a penchant for Belgian  
chocolates and French mineral water will find it more expensive to 
satisfy their cravings because of the latest trade spat with 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade officials in both the United States and Canada pledged to  
act swiftly after independent arbitrators on Monday gave them to 
go-ahead to impose 100 percent penalty tariffs on $124 million in 
European goods in retaliation for the EU's ban on imports of 
hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Trade Organization panel awarded Washington $116.8  
million per year, while Canada was awarded $7.7 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we believe the arbitrator significantly underestimated  
the actual trade damage to U.S. beef and beef variety meat exports, 
we accept the arbitrator's findings,'' U.S. Agriculture Secretary 
Dan Glickman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A report from the independent World Trade Organization panel  
approved the sanctions at a level of about half of what the United 
States had asked for but twice what the EU had claimed was 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman said the EU ban was not based on sound science and ``is  
wholly unjustified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe that providing EU consumers with a choice  
through labeling of U.S. beef offers an appropriate solution to 
this impasse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But pending any settlement, officials said they will publish in  
the next few weeks a final list of the $116.8 million in additional 
European luxury goods that will be targeted for 100 percent 
tariffs. That list will be drawn from an initial target list in the 
beef dispute of $900 million in European imports ranging from foie 
gras and truffles to Belgian chocolates and mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian list includes beef, cucumbers, gingerbread, gin,  
vodka and soup. The Canadians were awarded one-seventh of what they 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs are likely to force the affected products out of the  
market entirely in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The three arbitrators rejected an EU claim that the United  
States and Canada should provide a definite list of the items which 
would face sanctions before approval was given. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO approved the principle of sanctions against the EU in  
May after Brussels failed to meet a deadline to comply with a 
ruling against its ban on imports hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU maintains that some of the hormones may cause cancer and  
is conducting further scientific studies on their safety. It has 
refused to lift the ban, even though it has been ruled illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries will now have to call another meeting of the  
WTO for the sanctions to be rubber-stamped. 
</P>
<P>
	An EU official in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the EU Commission would meet with the United States in the 
next 10 days to try to stave off the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hoped to agree on a satisfactory compensation package now  
that the amount involved was clear, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said it was more important for the EU to come into line  
with the WTO ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge the EU to reconsider its actions and demonstrate a  
real commitment to a WTO-consistent, multilateral trade system and 
to the basic ideals of market access and consumer choice,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time this year that the United States has  
imposed penalty tariffs on European imports. Earlier, it boosted 
tariffs by 100 percent on $191.2 million of EU products in a 
dispute involving bananas. That target list included fancy French 
handbags, German coffee makers and English bed linens.

<HEADLINE> Report: Money For Ill Squandered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The former head of a non-profit home for the  
mentally disabled squandered public funds on huge raises and 
nepotism while allowing residents to live in vile conditions, 
according to a state report released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Chantal Joseph, the former executive director of Project  
Independence of Queens, Inc., ``abused the public trust placed in 
her and neglected and financially exploited the eight (resident) 
adults ... by depriving them of adequate food, services and 
shelter,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-page report by the state Commission on Quality of Care  
for the Mentally Disabled is the result of an investigation 
prompted by anonymous tips in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, Joseph increased her salary from  
$47,398 to $114,615 between 1995 and 1997. Some of that money was 
used to make a down payment on her new Long Island home. 
</P>
<P>
	She also hired 15 relatives, a group that collected more than 50  
percent of the PIQ payroll, and issued several of them American 
Express cards on a PIQ account. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph did not return a phonecall for comment on the report.  
While no longer the executive director of PIQ, she remains employed 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	PIQ interim executive director McKinley Jones declined to  
comment on Joseph's alleged improprieties, but said the living 
conditions for the residents had improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individuals who lived there are not in any danger,'' he  
said. ``We've made great improvements in that area ... We are 
developing policies and procedures to prevent any recurrence of 
those problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unsanitary conditions chronicled in the report include roach  
traps, filled with live roaches, hanging above the food preparation 
area; a strong urine stench in the bathrooms and bedrooms; and a 
trash-filled entrance and backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission forwarded copies of its report to the U.S.  
attorney in Brooklyn and the state attorney general for possible 
criminal charges, said spokesman Gary W. Masline.

<HEADLINE> Racer Schumacher Could Miss 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, England (AP) -- Michael Schumacher could be  
sidelined at least three months after breaking his leg in two 
places during a crash in the British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ferrari driver was recovering today in Northampton General  
Hospital following surgery on his right leg. He is almost certain 
to be out of contention for the Formula One drivers' championship. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he is expected to return before the end of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was lucky to escape more serious injury after his  
Ferrari crashed head-on at more than 100 mph into a tire wall. His 
brakes appeared to jam about 30 seconds into Sunday's race at 
Silverstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder what would have happened years ago with such an  
accident,'' Ferrari team manager Jean Todt said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar accident killed Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna in 1994  
at the Imola track in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Northampton General Hospital chief executive David Wilson today  
said Schumacher spent a comfortable night, his wounds were healing 
and he was moving his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently he is having his dressings changed and will be  
starting physiotherapy,'' Wilson said. ``He will be staying at the 
hospital until at least tomorrow (Tuesday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon Dr. Bill Ribbans said some pins were placed in the leg  
during the 90-minute operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials and surgeons declined to comment on how long  
Schumacher will be out of racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, however, said: ``I think surgeons would normally say 12  
to 16 weeks for a normal everyday person like you or me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Syd Watkins, a Formula One medical delegate,  
estimated Schumacher would be out six weeks, a period that includes 
races in Austria, Germany and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian GP is Aug. 15. The two following races, in Belgium  
on Aug. 29 and Italy on Sept. 9, also would be in jeopardy. The 
remaining three races of the season are the European GP in Germany, 
the Malaysian GP on Oct. 12 and the Japanese GP on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Todt said he was ``confident'' Schumacher would be back before  
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the case, Schumacher's bid for his third World Drivers'  
Championship looks in doubt. So does his bid to bring Ferrari its 
first drivers' title in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's race, the eighth of the season, Schumacher shares  
second place in the standings with Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine at 
32 points. McLaren's Mika Hakkinen leads with 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Todt said Schumacher is ``in good spirits'' and his wife,  
Corinna, arrived at the hospital on Sunday night. Racing fans sent 
dozens of floral arrangements to the hospital to help cheer the 
German driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is all right,'' Todt said. ``Racing sometimes gives  
joy, sometimes gives sadness. Yesterday it was sadness. We can 
always see that things could be worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todt said team officials still can't explain what caused the  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know precisely yet what happened,'' he said. ``Brake  
problems probably. (Schumacher) felt he lost the brakes in the rear 
of his car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luca Badoer, who drove for the Minardi team at Silverstone, has  
a contract with Ferrari and was expected to test drive today and 
Tuesday. Todt declined to sat of Badoer will be the permanent 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is former Formula One driver Mika Salo.

<HEADLINE> Cos. To Create Largest Drilling Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Schlumberger Ltd. will spin off its offshore  
drilling operations and combine them with Transocean Offshore Inc. 
to create the world's largest offshore drilling company. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, to be based in Houston, will be called  
Transocean Sedco Forex and have about 7,500 employees, officials 
said Monday. Schlumberger stockholders will receive new shares 
valued at $3.2 billion as part of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by shareholders of both companies, Schlumberger  
stockholders will own 52 percent of the new company, receiving 
roughly one share of the new company for every five Schlumberger 
shares they own. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Michael Talbert, chairman and chief executive of  
Houston-based Transocean Offshore, told analysts Monday that the 
new company would have a large number of drilling rigs in all the 
major offshore fields, including the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, 
Brazil and West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert said the company, as the biggest of its kind, would  
offer the broadest range of service to its customers, the world's 
largest oil companies and major independents. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the merger was partly driven by the cost of new rig  
construction and the technical difficulty of deep-water drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Euan Baird, Schlumberger's president and chief executive, said  
the deal will let the remaining part of his company focus on 
extending its lead in technology that helps drillers tap 
hard-to-reach reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts generally gave high marks to the deal, saying  
Transocean's deep-water expertise and its drilling operations in 
the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and off Brazil would complement 
Schlumberger's activities. They also said it could be the first of 
several consolidations in the relatively fragmented industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the old Olympic theme, 'Let the games begin. This is  
going to foster more amalgamations in the offshore drilling 
industry,'' said George Gaspar, an oil industries analyst with 
Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. ``Even some of the big companies are going to 
find it hard to compete with this group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a positive, and it may trigger some other  
consolidations,'' said Allen Brooks of CIBC Oppenheimer. ``It's a 
highly fragmented business. There are just too many drilling 
contractors and the average fleet size is still fairly small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the deal would insulate Schlumberger from a  
volatile part of its business while giving Transocean, as part of 
the new company, a bigger fleet of drilling rigs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird dismissed an analyst's suggestions that the company is  
spinning off its offshore operations because it is pessimistic 
about that segment of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This deal is not premised on earnings of the year 2000 because  
I don't think anyone has much idea about what that will be,'' Baird 
said. ``But in the next three to four years, there will be a strong 
recovery in all of the oil industry, and the offshore industry will 
be one of the beneficiaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sedco Forex Offshore had revenue of $1.1 billion and net income  
of $390 million last year, Schlumberger officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Transocean was formed when Sonat Offshore Drilling acquired  
Norwegian-based Transocean ASA. Its customers include big oil 
companies Exxon, BP-Amoco, Royal Dutch Shell and state-run 
companies. It earned $343 million on revenue of $1.1 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert will be president and chief executive of the new  
company. The chairman will be Victor E. Grijalva, Schlumberger vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlumberger has 60,000 employees overall, while Transocean  
Offshore has 3,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlumberger's stock price rose 50 cents to $64.81 1/4.  
Transocean's stock was up 87 1/2 cents to $29.87 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Dry Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced Monday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as beneficial Midwestern rains eluded most 
spring-planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, soybeans and spring wheat bounced higher as meteorologists  
predicted normal summer temperatures this week will not be 
accompanied by rain. While soil moisture remains fair, investors 
were concerned a prolonged dry spell could reduce yields. That 
likely would impact fall production, helping slash what is expected 
to be bumper supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also were boosted by the U.S. Agriculture Department's  
report that showed a large amount crops were inspected for export 
shipment -- a sign that prices tumbling to their lowest in nearly 
three decades had spurred additional export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ignored a USDA report that predicted lower cash market  
prices this fall for corn and soybeans, noting that had already 
been taken into account with a sharp decline in futures prices last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in all the markets were limited, however, as the rally  
prompted a spate of farmer selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.60 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/4 cent to $1.96 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 1/4 
cent to $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans rose 7 1/4 cents to $4.18 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .98 cent to 63.80 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .35 cent to 77.47 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .15 cent to 45.97 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
.93 cent to 32.87 cents a pound, while other contract months fell 
sharply.

<HEADLINE> Stars Martinez, Schilling To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez of the hometown Boston Red Sox will  
start for the American League against Philadelphia's Curt Schilling 
in Tuesday night's All-Star game at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez leads the major leagues with 15 wins and a 2.10 ERA,  
and has 184 strikeouts in 132 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling is tied for second in the National Leagues in wins,  
going 13-4 with a 3.13 ERA and 133 strikeouts in 149 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	NL manager Bruce Bochy of the San Diego Padres said today his  
starting lineup will have Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin leading 
off, followed by Colorado's Larry Walker in right field, Chicago's 
Sammy Sosa in center field, St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire, 
Arizona third baseman Matt Williams, Houston's Jeff Bagwell at 
designated hitter, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza, Milwaukee 
outfielder Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona second baseman Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz is starting in place on San Diego's Tony Gwynn, still on  
the disabled list with a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy chose Schilling over Arizona's Randy Johnson, primarily  
because the Phillies ace last pitched on Friday, while Johnson 
worked Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Randy's numbers are not indicative of how he's  
thrown,'' Bochy said, referring to Johnson's 9-7 record. ``Curt has 
had a tremendous year. Their ERAs are close. I feel that with Curt, 
with the extra day's rest he was gettting, I could count on two 
innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL manager Joe Torre of the New York Yankees said his lineup  
will have Cleveland's Kenny Lofton leading off and playing left 
field, followed by Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, Seattle 
center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., Cleveland right fielder Manny 
Ramirez, Cleveland first baseman Jim Thome, Baltimore third baseman 
Cal Ripken Jr., Texas' Rafael Palmeiro at designated hitter, Texas 
catcher Ivan Rodriguez, and Cleveland second baseman Roberto 
Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro is starting in place of Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco, who  
had back surgery Sunday. Canseco, who leads the AL with 31 homers, 
one behind Sosa's major league-leading total, will be sidelined for 
at least six weeks.

<HEADLINE>  Orange Order Stages Belfast Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- More than 20,000 Protestant  
Orangemen and their supporters marched across Belfast today, but 
police and soldiers blocked a key bridge to keep them away from a 
hostile Catholic area on what is Northern Ireland's most 
hot-blooded day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parading beneath banners with such slogans as ``What we have we  
hold,'' the Orange Order rerouted its biggest annual Belfast parade 
to rally across the narrow Lagan River from Lower Ormeau, the 
Catholic area at the center of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the group's mass mobilization each July 12  
commemorates Protestant King William of Orange's battlefield 
triumph over the Catholic-led forces of James II three centuries 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In practice, it's designed to demonstrate which side of the  
community remains stronger in this Protestant-majority state. 
</P>
<P>
	At dawn, British army engineers erected tall steel walls crowned  
with barbed wire across Ormeau Bridge to prevent a few hundred 
south Belfast Orangemen from marching past Lower Ormeau en route to 
central Belfast and the start of the main parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Unwilling to accept this restriction without protest, all of  
Belfast's Orangemen marched in solidarity to the area, and rallied 
in nearby Ormeau Park as their leaders implored them not to fight 
the British security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behave today and show the world that we are not the problem,''  
the Rev. William Hoey told the Orangemen at the bridge barricade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem lies on the other side of this bridge!'' Hoey  
proclaimed through a bullhorn, referring to a Catholic protest 
group in Lower Ormeau. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic demonstrators, led by a paroled IRA member, have  
tried to block Protestant parades since 1995, but today calmly 
watched the Orangemen protest across the river. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, an estimated 80,000 Orangemen marched at 18 locations  
across Northern Ireland today to mark Northern Ireland's annual 
holiday known as the Twelfth. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-sided festivities began overnight in hard-line  
Protestant parts of Northern Ireland with huge bonfires, impromptu 
concerts by so-called ``kick the pope'' bands of fife and drum, and 
fireworks displays. For the first time in several years, police 
reported no serious incidents of violence.

	The Catholic demonstrators, led by a paroled IRA member, have  
tried to block Protestant parades since 1995, but today calmly 
watched the Orangemen protest across the river. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, an estimated 80,000 Orangemen marched at 18 locations  
across Northern Ireland today to mark Northern Ireland's annual 
holiday known as the Twelfth. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-sided festivities began overnight in hard-line  
Protestant parts of Northern Ireland with huge bonfires, impromptu 
concerts by so-called ``kick the pope'' bands of fife and drum, and 
fireworks displays. For the first time in several years, police 
reported no serious incidents of violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Post's Dr. Gridlock column  
posed this riddle: What automobile is referred to in a license 
plate that reads 1 DIV 0? 
</P>
<P>
	The reader who figured it out was Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Dr. Gridlock: ... I believe it refers to an Infiniti,  
since when you divide 0 into 1 the result is infinity,'' the 
nation's top-ranking judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ron Shaffer, who writes the column, called Rehnquist's  
office at the Supreme Court to verify his entry and congratulate 
the winner, a delighted Janet Barnes, the chief justice's 
secretary, asked, ``Did he win?''

<HEADLINE>  Extra Events Spice Up All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- One more day and then the real show begins.  
</P>
<P>
	First, though, the final prelude to the All-Star game takes  
place tonight when baseball's sluggers aim at the Green Monster, 
the 37-foot high left-field wall at Fenway Park, in the Home Run 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Nomar Garciaparra, who missed the Red Sox's last nine games  
with a groin injury, excite the Boston fans by winning the 
long-ball contest? How about Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa, the 
record-breakers of 1998? 
</P>
<P>
	And what will happen Tuesday night when the final All-Star game  
of the 1900s is played at 87-year-old Fenway Park? The high 
left-field wall may not be able to contain McGwire's towering 
blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he'll have to face Pedro Martinez, who has allowed  
just five homers in 132 2-3 innings. Martinez earned the start for 
the American League in his home park with a 15-3 record and 2.10 
ERA in 18 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Schilling (13-4), who began his career in Boston's farm  
system, was picked today to start for the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Three former Red Sox stars won't be there. New York's Roger  
Clemens and Anaheim's Mo Vaughn weren't selected, and Tampa Bay's 
Jose Canseco withdrew Sunday when he underwent back surgery for a 
herniated disc. He was replaced on the AL roster by Baltimore 
designated hitter Harold Baines. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's primary free agent pickup in the offseason, second  
baseman Jose Offerman, will be there as a reserve despite a 
2-for-38 slump that has dropped his batting average to .273. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, two other locals stars took their cuts in the  
Celebrity Hitting Challenge -- actor Matt Damon of Cambridge, Mass., 
and quarterback Doug Flutie of Boston College and the Buffalo 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star sidelights began Friday with FanFest, a display of  
baseball exhibits and activities, and continued Sunday with the 
celebrity competition and an All-Star Futures game featuring 
minor-league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	All that was a substantial change from 1946 and 1961, the other  
times the All-Star game was held at Fenway. That's all there was 
then -- a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of what has been added has been to the fans' benefit,''  
former Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson, now an executive in 
the commissioner's office, said Sunday. ``The Futures game is 
really a way of illustrating the international aspect of the game 
that already exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World team beat the United States team 7-0 as Yankees  
infield prospect Alfonso Soriano had two homers and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	He did a lot better than Damon did in the celebrity competition  
in which four teams of three players each -- a celebrity, a former 
All-Star and a former Red Sox star -- earned points depending on how 
far they hit the ball on their seven swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon missed the ball once, hit four fouls and put just two  
balls in play. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and fellow actor Kevin Costner still pleased the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I came out to see Kevin Costner because I think he's cute and  
I wanted to see if he could play baseball,'' said Casey Levesque, 
6, of Fall River. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's events also gave pitcher Kip Wells a chance to be part  
of the extravaganza. Wells, the Chicago White Sox' first-round 
draft pick last year, was on the United States Futures team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives prospects a chance to compare their talents against  
others at that point in their game,'' Wells said. ``For me, it was 
a thrill just being in the dressing room with those guys whose 
movies I have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, a star in college, the Canadian Football League, and the  
NFL, still got a kick out of trying to hit the Green Monster. He 
succeeded twice -- once on a bounce and once on a liner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get a chance to come to Fenway for an All-Star game to rub  
shoulders with the current players and go out and be kids again for 
a day,'' he said. ``And it's just a blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current players for the NL include manager Bruce Bochy's  
likely batting order of Cincinnati's Barry Larkin, Colorado's Larry 
Walker, Chicago's Sosa, St. Louis' McGwire, Arizona's Matt 
Williams, Houston's Jeff Bagwell as designated hitter, Mike Piazza 
of the New York Mets, Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona's Jay 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL lineup wasn't announced Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	That day was reserved for activities attended by fans who might  
not be able to go to the actual game since Fenway is the smallest 
major-league park with 33,871 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that takes the spotlight off the game,'' Damon  
said before taking his cuts. ``This is just some kind of warmup 
stuff, revenue for the city, an excuse to come out to the ballpark 
on a sunny day for a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, the first time the All-Star game was in Fenway Park,  
Ted Williams went 4-for-4 in the AL's 12-0 win. Today, at age 80, 
even he likes the expanded format. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't try and squeeze too much in too few days, I  
think it's all a celebration,'' Williams said. ``It's all fun for 
baseball fans.''

<HEADLINE> Architect Cited for Congress Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The architect of the Capitol endangered lives  
at the Library of Congress when untrained employees working on 
poorly maintained equipment accidentally started a fire, 
congressional investigators report. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' workplace safety agency, the Office of Compliance,  
cited the architect's office for five safety violations in the 
April episode. The citations were classified as ``serious,'' a term 
reserved for violations ``likely to cause serious injury or 
death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The architect's office did not respond to a message seeking  
comment on the citations, which were issued Friday and announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire occurred at the library's Madison Building, which  
opened in 1980 and houses rare manuscripts, maps, books, musical 
instruments and a rough draft of the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents escaped damage, but an architect's electrician was  
burned as the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
	The architect's office had an inkling of problems two days  
before the fire, when officials in the Madison Building had to 
cancel a planned fire drill because the alarm system failed to 
activate. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the citations said an important circuit breaker  
implicated in the fire had not been serviced since 1993, ``creating 
a danger of fire for employees ... and a danger of shock or 
electrocution for employees who work on the equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators, charged with making Congress follow the same  
workplace safety rules that lawmakers have imposed on private 
businesses, previously have issued numerous citations against the 
architect for improper storage of chemicals and allowing an unsafe 
working environment, The Associated Press has reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the House inspector general said late last year  
that the Capitol and House offices were seriously deficient in fire 
safety and had installed a defective brand of sprinkler. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Green, general counsel for the Office of Compliance, said  
the architect's office ``does not share the same attitude that 
Fortune 500 companies share about safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has only been obligated to follow federal safety  
rules since 1995, and trying to force compliance ``is a little bit 
like turning an ocean liner around,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to failing to maintain circuit breaker equipment,  
the citations said the architect: 
</P>
<P>
	--Left the alarm system in ``a mode for servicing,'' preventing  
activation of the full building alarm from the building's control 
console. It may have been left in that condition for several months 
and resulted in the canceled fire drill. 
</P>
<P>
	The system was reset the morning of the fire, but a faulty  
circuit prevented the alarm from sounding in the vicinity of the 
control room when the fire broke out. Because of that problem, 
officers -- who were needed for the evacuation -- were instead sent 
to activate manual alarms throughout the building to ensure no 
other areas were missed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Failed to cut power to electrical parts before employees tried  
to perform maintenance work that resulted in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began when an electrician's tool came in contact with  
an energized conductor. Electrical distribution equipment failed, a 
nonfunctioning circuit breaker overheated and a flash fire began, 
burning and temporarily blinding the worker, who was saved by a 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	--Failed to train employees proper procedures for working on such  
equipment. The two electricians working in the Madison building on 
April 30 ``had received no training and were not familiar with the 
safety-related work practices required ... when performing work 
that poses a danger of electric shock,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Did not install equipment that would have allowed a blocked  
duct to open automatically in case of fire. On April 30, the 
blocked duct prevented smoke from leaving the building, and it 
spread throughout the structure. 
</P>
<P>
	During the fire evacuation, when the faulty circuit breaker  
finally tripped, power was cut to one-fourth of the building. Some 
people were in darkness in rooms without windows.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Nurse Getting Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PERU, Ind. (AP) -- Hundreds of Miami County residents filled out  
questionnaires today to determine if they would be suitable jurors 
for the trial of a former nurse accused of murdering seven patients 
by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	About 700 people filed into a high school auditorium to answer  
more than 140 questions crafted by Clay Circuit Court Judge Ernest 
Yelton. Another 700 residents have been told to appear July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those summoned live at least 150 miles from the former  
Vermillion County Hospital, where Orville Lynn Majors is accused of 
murdering seven elderly patients by giving them lethal injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurses have told investigators that Majors, 38, either gave  
injections to or stood near the victims holding a syringe when no 
injection was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and prosecutors have said he may have killed dozens at  
the hospital between 1993 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Yelton took the unusual step of summoning 1,400 people as  
possible jurors because of extensive publicity about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	He will whittle down the number of potential jurors to roughly  
100 for an Aug. 30 hearing, when prosecutors and defense attorneys 
will begin questioning them. A final panel of 18 will be selected.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Smith Leaves Republican Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire announced  
Monday night he was leaving Republican Party to become an 
independent, indicating he might seek the nomination of some other 
party in his bid for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith characterized his much-anticipated decision as one of  
principles over party, chastising GOP lawmakers for forsaking the 
Republican platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into the Republican Party on principle, and I'm leaving  
on principle,'' Smith said on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' He decried 
leaders in his party ``who believe that electing people with an 'R' 
next to their name is more important than principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he still intends to run for president and confirmed  
that he has been speaking with other political groups, such as 
members of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, about a nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly interested,'' Smith said of the Taxpayers Party.  
But, he added, ``it would be very presumptuous to say that the 
nomination is mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading up to Smith's announcement, a string of GOP  
leaders have blasted his decision. Jim Nicholson, chairman of the 
Republican National Committee, called the defection a ``serious 
mistake for you personally, with only a marginal political impact -- 
and a counterproductive one at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, New Hampshire Republican Chairman Steven Duprey  
continued the criticism, saying Smith had bailed out of the party 
because his message could not distinguish him among the field of 
GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``America has never liked a sore loser,'' Duprey said on CNN's  
``Crossfire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith brushed off the attacks by the party leaders.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the establishment. They're interested in poll numbers.  
They're interested in how much money you have. They're interested 
in your name recognition,'' he said. ``They've walked away from the 
principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential contender Steve Forbes, touring Iowa on Monday,  
called Smith's decision a ``wake-up call'' for the party 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that Bob Smith is abandoning the Republican Party,  
it's that the Republican establishment is in the process of 
abandoning grass-roots conservatives,'' Forbes said. ``It's a bad 
omen for the GOP when a solid Reagan conservative like Bob Smith 
would even consider leaving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP contender Dan Quayle, called Smith's decision a loss  
for the GOP but added: ``We cannot cut and run and still claim to 
provide the leadership conservatives across America expect from 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senator since 1990 and a House member for six years before  
that, Smith said he did not know how this would affect his standing 
on Senate committees. But he said he would accept the judgment of 
his colleagues.

<HEADLINE> Montreal Gets Time To Keep Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Montreal Expos, averaging just 9,085 fans for  
home games, will be given more time to put together a new stadium 
financing plan and ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving all parties ample time to do the things that they  
need to do to make that an economically viable franchise,'' 
baseball commissioner Bud Selig said before Monday's All-Star 
workouts at Fenway Park. ``You want to be fair and you want to bend 
over backwards to be fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos and Selig have said repeatedly for more than a year  
the team can't survive in Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Expos president Claude Brochu nor team chairman Jacques  
Menard has been able to raise sufficient financing for new 
ballpark, but baseball officials have said in recent weeks that 
they are more hopeful the team will be able to obtain some 
government financing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Montreal situation is one I'm monitoring now on an almost  
daily basis,'' Selig said. ``They appear to be somewhat optimistic 
that they're making progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal's crowd of 15,201 for Sunday's first-half finale  
against Toronto was the fourth-highest of the season at Olympic 
Stadium. Before the weekend series against the Blue Jays, the Expos 
reached 10,000 at home just nine times in 44 home games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a lot of negativism on a lot of sides there, and  
it's clearly affected their attendance,'' Selig said. ``I don't 
think this year's attendance is really a crucial factor one way or 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a decision is made to allow Montreal to move, Washington and  
Charlotte, N.C., appear to be the top candidates. But Baltimore 
owner Peter Angelos would possibly block a Washington move and 
Charlotte hasn't shown a willingness to build a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said it's too early to assess the Minnesota Twins'  
situation. St. Paul has expressed interest in constructing a 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want major league baseball to stay there,'' Selig said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also said he expects the proposed merger of the New York  
Yankees and the NBA's New Jersey Nets to come to a vote before the 
end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Shooting Suspect Called Suicidal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Lawyers for a 15-year-old boy accused of wounding  
six classmates during a shooting spree at his suburban school say 
he is suicidal and should be in a hospital rather than jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Solomon ``suffers from long-term, untreated and major  
depression with psychotic features and has some degree of suicidal 
tendencies,'' Jan Harris, one of Solomon's lawyers, said Monday in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said the request is backed up by psychiatric evaluations  
done for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution opposes taking Solomon out of the juvenile  
detention center where he has been held since the May shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no need for it whatsoever based on our  
evaluations of the facts and circumstances,'' District Attorney 
Richard Read said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Read said he wanted his prosecution psychiatrists to examine  
Solomon's mental state before a decision is made on where the teen 
is held. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Juvenile Judge William Schneider on Monday delayed  
until August a hearing on whether Solomon should be tried as an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, a sophomore at Heritage High School in Conyers, is  
accused of opening fire on schoolmates May 20 -- exactly a month 
after the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., 
that left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with 21 counts, including aggravated assault,  
cruelty to children and weapons violations.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm X's Grandson Transferred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- Malcolm Shabazz, the 14-year-old grandson  
of Malcolm X who set a fire that killed his grandmother, has been 
transferred to a more secure facility after escaping twice from a 
group home. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was moved to an undisclosed location after a Family  
Court hearing last week in Westchester County, court spokesman 
David Bookstaver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm was 12 when he was convicted in 1997 of the juvenile  
equivalents of manslaughter and arson for setting the blaze in the 
Yonkers apartment of Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shabazz died of burns three weeks after the fire. She had  
been caring for the boy because the boy's mother, Qubilah Shabazz, 
had battled alcohol abuse and legal problems. Prosecutors said he 
set the fire in hopes that it would get him reunited with his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm was originally sent to the Hillcrest Educational Center  
in Pittsfield, Mass. When the original 18-month sentence was up in 
February, he was transferred to Leake &AMP; Watts, a residential 
treatment center in Yonkers. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped from the group home twice, most recently July 4.  
</P>
<P>
	The boy's sentence can be extended a year at a time until he is  
18 if probation officials deem it necessary.

<HEADLINE> Pets Get Topical Heartworm Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dog and cat lovers are getting an alternative  
to forcing heartworm pills down their pet's throat: a once-a-month 
topical drug that protects against not just heartworms, but fleas 
and five other parasites, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer Inc.'s selamectin, which it will sell under the brand  
name Revolution, was approved by the government Monday as the first 
topical heartworm prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Selamectin comes in premeasured monthly doses according to an  
animal's size and age. Simply push aside the pet's fur and squeeze 
the liquid onto the back of the neck, between the shoulder blades, 
said Dr. Elizabeth Luddy of the Food and Drug Administration. The 
drug is absorbed through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Selamectin is only for dogs and cats at least 6 weeks old -- and  
while side effects in healthy animals were minimal, it should be 
used with caution in pets who are sick or underweight, Luddy 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
	While giving pets a pill isn't always easy, ``what's important  
here is really the convenience factor'' of a once-a-month 
medication that fights seven different parasites, said Pfizer 
veterinarian Dr. Ed Kanara. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosquitoes transmit heartworms, a parasite that can destroy  
pets' hearts. It's a well-known problem for dogs, who routinely are 
tested for heartworm. But many cat owners don't know that heartworm 
threatens their pets, too. Symptoms include coughing, breathing 
difficulty, lethargy and weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Selamectin is as effective as oral drugs that prevent heartworm,  
Luddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, selamectin kills adult fleas and prevents flea eggs  
from hatching for a month and treats ear mites, an itchy dog 
condition called sarcoptic mange, or scabies, and intestinal 
roundworm and hookworm in cats. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies of more than 1,700 animals, side effects appeared  
minimal, fewer than 1 percent of cats had hair loss where 
selamectin was applied, and fewer than 1 percent of pets vomited or 
had diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the FDA urged caution in animals who are sick or  
underweight, because a malnourished stray kitten died eight hours 
after one selamectin dose. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said the drug will be available, by veterinarians'  
prescription, by September. It hasn't finalized a price, but said 
the drug should cost $10 to $20 a month, depending on the animal's 
size.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japanese Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen today after Japan's  
central bank failed to intervene to prop up the U.S. currency. 
Stocks surged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.14 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
0.52 yen from late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 336.45  
points, or 1.88 percent, to 18,274.18 points, its highest level 
since September 1997. On Friday, the average fell 29.92 points, or 
0.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell in Tokyo from its level in  
New York late Friday after expectations of Bank of Japan 
intervention went unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, investors bet the Bank of Japan would begin the  
week with a strong signal to markets that premature yen strength 
would not be tolerated ahead of an economic recovery, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have said an excessively strong yen would  
slow the country's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	As the yen rises against other currencies, exports become more  
expensive abroad and the yen value of foreign revenue declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank has intervened on three of the last four  
Mondays to sap the yen's strength. However, the BOJ did not step in 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, stocks closed higher on robust gains in  
international blue-chip shares. Sentiment remained solid amid 
continued buying from foreign investors and Japanese individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an awful lot of foreign buying in the market today.  
It is absorbing selling (by institutional investors),'' said 
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in international blue chips including Sony, Fujitsu and  
Hitachi was especially strong, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 19.71 points, or 1.35 percent, to 1,484.11 
points. The TOPIX closed down 4.69 points, or 0.32 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 124.10 yen, down  
from 124.97 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.6350 percent from Friday's finish of 
1.6650 percent, driving its price up to 101.43 yen from 101.17 yen.

<HEADLINE> Next Golf Oddity: The British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- The Masters had rough, the U.S. Open  
didn't. The next oddity in major championships this year is 
Carnoustie Golf Links, a course hardly anyone has played in a 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Open was last played at Carnoustie in 1975, the year Tom  
Watson buried his reputation as a choker in the majors by making a 
birdie on the 72nd hole and winning the last 18-hole playoff in 
Open history. So much has changed since then, except for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a struggle,'' Watson said. ``If we get the  
blow they are predicting on Thursday, you might see some real tears 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was crying Monday during the first full day of practice,  
not with sunny skies, only a fresh breeze off the Firth of Tay and 
scores that didn't count. Then again, laughter didn't exactly fill 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would have broken 80,'' David Duval said with a  
straight face after playing a practice round with Greg Norman and 
Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Janzen, a two-time U.S. Open champion who plays his best  
under the most severe conditions, chose his words carefully when 
asked for his first impression of Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's in great shape, and that's the best thing I can  
say about it,'' he said. ``I think it's the toughest course I've 
ever played. Par would be a great score, but I think higher than 
that will win -- and that's under good conditions. I can't imagine 
what it would be like if we have tough conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie owns the course record, a 64 during the 1995  
Scottish Open. That should be safe this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody is going to win. But at the same time, it will be no  
fun,'' said Montgomerie, who predicted scores in the 90s if the 
wind blows hard. ``We all hope and pray that it doesn't become a 
wind. If it becomes a wind, you'll see scores higher than we've 
ever, ever seen before in any British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that John H. Taylor won the Open in 1894 with a  
72-hole score of 326, that might be a bit of a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the one consensus at Carnoustie is it that it figures to  
be the toughest test of the year. The course is playing at 7,361 
yards at a par of 71. The greens are large and firm. The fairways 
are narrow enough to make the USGA jealous. The rough is so high 
that Duval missed the green on the par-3 13th and measured a full 
12 inches from the top of the grass to the bottom of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only 6 or 7 inches was really thick stuff,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In short, Carnoustie is everything the U.S. Open wants to be.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time I think players will say the U.S. Open  
was more fair than the British Open,'' Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval, Tiger Woods, Payne Stewart and defending champion  
Mark O'Meara were among those who prepared for the Open by playing 
links golf in Ireland, PGA champion Vijay Singh arrived at 
Carnoustie last week -- smart move, by the sound of it. 
</P>
<P>
	He played his first round on Saturday and said it was nearly  
impossible. By Monday, Singh had changed his tune, even though it 
still sounded like a dirge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each time I play, I seem to know a little bit more about the  
golf course,'' he said. ``It will be OK, I think, if you drive the 
ball in play. I think the key is to have a game plan in your mind 
and just stick to it. That way, you don't go out there guessing 
what you're trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh stopped short of saying it was ``unfair,'' but clearly  
that was on the minds of several players on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Els hit two balls off the first tee to one of the more  
generous fairways on Carnoustie, then walked over to the side and 
engaged in playful banter with Jack Newton, who lost in the 1975 
playoff and now works for an Australian television station. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Watson finished at 9-under 279, but that was when  
Carnoustie played to a par-72 and was 296 yards shorter. The wind 
only blew in the final round, when one player broke 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was the rough this high?'' Els said.  
</P>
<P>
	Newton shook his head.  
</P>
<P>
	``You guys had it easy,'' Els said.  
</P>
<P>
	Els was among those who predicted outrageously high scores --  
perhaps a 300 -- if the wind blows in hard from the North Sea. The 
wind is usually the best defense in a British Open, although 
Carnoustie doesn't need it to be brutal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it fair? It's the same for everybody,'' Stewart said. ``We  
played today in conditions that just don't exist. If we get weather 
like this, it's possible under par could win. If we get blowing 
conditions, there's no telling what wins this golf tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about a 300?  
</P>
<P>
	``I said there's no telling,'' Stewart said.

<HEADLINE> City Hall in Kosovo Capital Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- For the first time since the end of  
NATO airstrikes last month, a mixed ethnic Albanian-Serb staff of 
140 civil administration employees returned to work today, 
reopening Pristina's City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty ethnic Albanians and 60 Serbs listened to J.F. Carter,  
the U.N. chief civil administrator, call for moderation and 
cooperation among the people of different ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the pullout of Yugoslav army and Serbian police forces  
early last month and the flight of tens of thousands of Serbs 
fearing retribution from returning ethnic Albanian refugees, the 
war-battered province has been without local governments, courts 
and police. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Pristina today, Jiri Dienstbier, the  
U.N. special investigator on human rights in the current and former 
Yugoslavia, urged that the international community make the maximum 
effort to re-establish structures of civil justice, especially 
police forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Dienstbier also said work must be done to ``guarantee property  
rights to make sure houses are in the hands of the people who own 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials are recruiting people to fill vacancies in the  
civilian sector in an attempt to help Kosovo recover from years of 
ethnic conflict and bloody fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things will be never the same as they were in 1990, nor as  
they were in March of 1999,'' Carter told the City Hall workers, 
referring to the revocation of Kosovo's autonomy nearly a decade 
ago and the launching of NATO's punishing airstrikes on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have to work with their own community to create a new  
order,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pristina's City Hall will have nine departments and two  
co-mayors, called municipal presidents. The co-mayors will be 
Zvonimir Stevic, a former deputy mayor, and Mexhid Syla, an ethnic 
Albanian who has not worked since 1989 when he lost his job in an 
electricity company. He had served in the local government until 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, the International Committee  
of the Red Cross said it has received lists of more than 2,000 
people detained in Serbia in connection with the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross said the Serbian Ministry of Justice has provided  
the names and location of 2,095 people held in Serbian prisons. The 
lists included 166 people who were released to the Red Cross on 
June 25 and returned to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia earlier acknowledged holding the prisoners, and the Red  
Cross said the provision of their names was ``a major contribution 
toward alleviating the anguish of families seeking to establish the 
whereabouts of a missing relative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross said it has visited 331 detainees and soon will  
visit more. Most are believed to be ethnic Albanians held on 
charges of terrorism or anti-state activities. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albania, government officials gave the chief prosecutor of  
the international war crimes tribunal, Louise Arbour, testimony 
collected from ethnic Albanian refugees of alleged war crimes 
committed by Serbs in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Arbour is scheduled to go to Kosovo. Yugoslav  
officials would not let her enter Kosovo in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Dienstbier told reporters he has not been able to confirm  
reports that the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army may be holding people 
in detention centers in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said KLA leaders have told him they are concerned that  
``they cannot openly challenge the feelings of vengeance'' in 
Kosovo. ``I think strong leadership is needed to prevent problems 
like this,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Dienstbier expressed concern about reports he said he heard in  
Prizren that local people have blocked fire brigades from 
extinguishing fires at Serb houses. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 78-day NATO campaign, hundreds of thousands of Kosovo  
Albanians fled a Serb troop crackdown in the province that included 
mass killings and the destruction of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	An aerial survey conducted by the United States Imagery and  
Mapping Agency shows that more than 65,000 houses in Kosovo have 
been destroyed or left uninhabitable in the province, Ron Redmond 
of the U.N. refugee agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the weekend, U.S. Army troops began moving into Kosovo to  
take up peacekeeping duties from departing Marines who came under 
fire in separate incidents toward the end of their tour. No 
Americans were injured.

<HEADLINE> Gannett Earnings Up 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Gannett Co.'s earnings rose 12 percent in  
the second quarter due to increased advertising sales at USA Today, 
its flagship newspaper, and other papers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett, the nation's second-largest newspaper chain, earned  
$244.2 million, or 87 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 
27, up from $222.8 million, or 78 cents per share, during the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of  
86 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenue increased 3 percent to $1.34 billion,  
from $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett publishes 74 daily newspapers. It also operates 21  
television stations and cable TV systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Monday that the earnings in its newspaper  
segment reflected strong demand for classified and national 
advertising and the 9 percent decline in newsprint expense for the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today's paid advertising pages increased to 1,657, compared  
to 1,494 in the second quarter of 1998, and advertising revenues 
grew 20 percent. Revenues from circulation, however, dropped 1.6 
percent to $248,812, from $252,762. 
</P>
<P>
	Television cash flow decreased 4 percent to $115.1 million and  
was affected by the absence of political advertising and last 
year's ``Seinfeld'' show finale, which boosted results in the 
second quarter of 1998, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Gannett rose 56 1/4 cents to $72 in afternoon trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Scripps Earnings Up 21 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The E.W. Scripps Co. reported a 21 percent  
increase in second-quarter earnings Monday thanks to better results 
from cable television and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps earned $44.2 million, or 56 cents per share, in the  
quarter ended June 30 compared with $36.4 million and 45 cents a 
year ago. Revenues rose 6 percent to $388.3 million from $366.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers in many of the company's markets reported revenue  
increases from classified and national advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were up at Scripps' two cable channels, Home &AMP; Garden  
Television and the Food Network, but the company plans to begin 
1,000 hours of new programming that will increase costs during the 
second half of the year, said William R. Burleigh, chairman, 
president and chief executive officer of Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 30, the company plans to start a third cable channel  
called Do-It-Yourself, or DIY, designed to be used with interactive 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The company operates 19 daily newspapers, nine  
network-affiliated television stations; the two cable channels; 
Scripps Productions; United Media, which syndicates and licenses 
news features and comics, and the Scripps Howard News Service. 
Scripps also publishes independent Yellow Pages directories. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the fiscal year, Scripps earned  
$76.2 million, or 96 cents per share, compared with $61.5 million 
and 75 cents a year earlier. Revenues rose to $761.7 million from 
$713.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Falls Sharply on Forecast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures fell sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York amid perceptions the world's largest producing country 
will sail through the winter without a damaging frost. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cotton also tumbled, while grains and soybeans  
moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures went into sharp retreat as another threatened  
cold front in some of Brazil's major producing regions failed to 
materialize over the weekend. Brazil has been enjoying a mild 
winter that is expected to help boost production for a third year. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest producer of coffee is benefiting from having  
planted young trees earlier this decade; they can produce more -- 
and have. Brazil last year harvested its largest crop in 11 years 
and is on tap to surpass that this year, agronomists say. 
</P>
<P>
	That could further contribute to a world supply glut. While  
Brazil produces mainly robusta coffees not certified for New York 
contract specifications, its beans often are blended with the 
arabicas used for gourmet coffees. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabica coffee for September delivery tumbled 4.6 cents to 92.70  
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures also finished sharply lower on the New York  
Cotton Exchange after the government predicted both world and U.S. 
inventories will swell in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department's latest supply and demand  
report showed this year's world production at 89.24 million bales, 
up more than 2 million bales from its June estimate. The amount of 
the crop expected to be left over before the next harvest also 
rose, by 1.8 million bales to 43.45 million bales. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable growing weather in the United States also was expected  
to help boost production by 700,000 bales to 18.7 million bales, 
the USDA predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	October cotton fell 1.56 cents to 48.45 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade  
as beneficial Midwestern rains eluded most spring-planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, soybeans and spring wheat bounced higher as meteorologists  
predicted normal summer temperatures this week will not be 
accompanied by rain. While soil moisture remains fair, investors 
were concerned a prolonged dry spell could reduce yields. That 
likely would impact fall production, helping slash what is expected 
to be bumper supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Weather Service's latest 10-day forecast,  
released after trading ended, called for above-normal rainfall and

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump says he would ``probably run and  
probably win'' the 2000 presidential race if the Reform Party 
drafted him. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem: The Reform Party isn't asking.  
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a joke?'' Reform Party Chairman Russell Verney asked.  
``I have never once heard his name mentioned in the Reform Party. 
There is going to be no absentee candidate-drafting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running on the Democratic or Republican tickets is out, Trump  
said, because ``the two major parties are lost when it comes to 
finding solutions to America's problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While I have not decided to become a candidate at this time,  
if the Reform Party nominated me, I would probably run and probably 
win,'' Trump said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I won, I would ask for an immediate recount,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Verney said Trump has never contacted the party or discussed his  
views of its platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Verney and Reform Party Vice Chair Pat Benjamin and Verney  
said Trump is welcome to compete for the nomination along with any 
other interested candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to endorse our principles, our platform, then he  
can present himself to the members for nomination,'' Verney said. 
``Our process requires people to do work. There's no absentee 
draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said ``early Reform Party polls'' and urgings from ``many,  
many Americans'' had inspired him to publicize his interest in the 
nomination. 
</P>

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush got a tasty  
payoff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben's Best delicatessen of Rego Park, N.Y., delivered sandwiches  
for 30 courtesy of New York Gov. George Pataki, who had bet Bush 
that the Knicks would beat the Spurs in the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The delivery featured matzoh balls, celery soda and a variety of  
kosher sandwiches, including pastrami and corned beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Photographers, but no reporters, were allowed into the  
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deli owner delivered the sandwiches personally, so we  
thought it would be all in good spirit to have a photo opportunity 
and share in the pride that all Texans feel toward our San Antonio 
Spurs,'' said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs won their first NBA title in the franchise's 26-year  
history last month, beating the Knicks four games to one in the 
finals. If the San Antonio team had lost, Bush had pledged to send 
Pataki a pair of Texas-style western boots -- complete with spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first victory for the GOP presidential  
front-runner in his sports team rivalry with Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Republican governors also had wagered on whether the  
Dallas Stars or Buffalo Sabres would win the NHL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars triumphed and Pataki sent Bush buffalo wings last week  
and will dispatch an order of sandwiches Wednesday, according to 
the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Sabres won, Bush would have owed Pataki barbecue ribs  
and brisket if the Sabres had won. 
</P>

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A Democratic county leader said Monday that  
Vice President Al Gore is a ``stuffed shirt'' and that Bill Bradley 
is ``more electable'' in the presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	While stopping short of an outright endorsement of the former  
New Jersey senator's bid for the Democratic nomination, David 
Alpert of Westchester County said that while he could ``live with 
either ... I think Bradley is the more exciting candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're putting together a whole package, I think he's  
more electable,'' Alpert said. ``I think Gore is a great guy, but I 
think he's -- I'm probably using the wrong word -- a stuffed shirt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alpert said he hoped to make an endorsement in the presidential  
race before the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester is the state's eighth largest of 62 counties in  
terms of Democratic enrollment, with 210,000 party members. It is 
located just north of New York City and is considered one of the 
linchpins to success in the politically crucial suburbs surrounding 
the city in statewide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Gore, Chris Lehane, said ``we're very pleased  
with the depth and breadth of our support throughout New York and 
we'll continue working to make that support even broader and 
deeper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the state's top Democratic Party leadership, including  
more than a half dozen of the state's most powerful county chairmen 
have already lined up behind Gore in New York.

	Ingram, CompUSA Sign $10B Deal  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Ingram Micro Inc., the world's largest  
distributor of computers, today announced an initial agreement to 
assemble and provide maintenance for machines that CompUSA Inc. 
sells directly to business, government and education customers. 
CompUSA estimates the five-year deal, which the companies hope to 
have finalized by late August, is worth about $10 billion. Under 
the deal, CompUSA will close its distribution center in Grapevine, 
Texas, and will no longer stock, configure or custom assemble 
computers for its commercial customers. Ingram Micro will take over 
these operations. Ingram Micro shares were at 17 3/4, up 1 1/4. CompUSA 
shares were at 7 5/16, down 1/16.

	Showdown Expected at Venator Meeting  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Observers are expecting lively discussion at  
Friday's meeting in Florida of of shareholders in Venator, the 
former Woolworth. The business seems still to be limping along. 
Sales and profits are down, and its stock price -- while improved 
this year -- stands at just 10 1/4, up 3/8 today, compared to more than 
28 two years ago. Now, its biggest shareholder, Greenway Partners, 
is charging that the company's management isn't doing enough to get 
the troubled retailer back on track. A showdown is expected at 
Friday's gathering, an event that many think will be nothing less 
than downright nasty. Greenway, a New York-based investment firm, 
will try to snatch away four director seats, and also to convince 
shareholders to change the corporate name back to Woolworth and 
loosen the company's defenses against a takeover.

	DETROIT (AP) -- More buyers are cruising the information highway

percent of consumers who recently bought a car or truck used the 
Internet to help them shop, up from 25 percent a year ago, 
according to initial results of a J.D. Power and Associates survey. 
The survey showed that the number of purchasers who used an online 
buying service doubled in this year's first quarter, from 12,500 a 
month nationwide to more than 25,000, said Chris Denove, consulting 
operations director for the research firm in Agoura Hills, Calif. 
The proportion of new-vehicle purchasers using the Internet

	South Africa Braces for Job Losses

<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa is bracing for  
tens of thousands of job losses in the gold, transport and 
telecommunications industries, part of a continuing drive to make 
private and public companies more competitive. In the past week, 
numerous reports have circulated of 27,000 possible job cuts by 
national train operator Spoornet, 10,000 by telecommunications 
provider Telkom and another 11,700 in the gold mining industry. 
Last week, 5,000 miners were laid off at the East Rand Proprietary 
Mines in Johannesburg, one of the country's oldest firms forced to 
close by high production costs and low gold prices.

	Russia's Computers Not Y2K-Ready

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Only one-third of Russia's vital computer systems  
are ready for the millennium, and the government probably won't 
have the money to fix the rest in time, officials said today. 
Finance Ministry officials told a Cabinet meeting that Russia needs 
at least $187 million to prepare its computers for the year 2000, 
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The new estimates were 
dramatically lower than previous figures, which said Russia would 
need $1 billion to $3 billion to fight the millennium bug. The 
Finance Ministry did not explain the discrepancy.

$1.62 billion, the government announced today. The sale of 42.1 
million shares, which began three weeks ago, reduced the 
government's stake in the company to 10 percent. The phased 
privatization of PT, which is expanding into Brazil and North 
Africa, began in 1994. The state's share of revenue from the sale

18-week-old takeover fight began in March when BNP jumped into an 
agreed merger between Societe Generale and Paribas, offering $37 
billion for the two banks. Societe Generale and Paribas rejected 
BNP's offer and have spurned its advances since then.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Sharply / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose sharply Monday as investors  
sought the safety of U.S.-backed notes amid a slide in Latin 
American stock markets. The rally sent bond yields to their lowest 
level in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/4 point, or $12.50  
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction, fell to 5.90 percent from 6 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market also gained ground as some portfolio managers  
were said to have moved part of their assets out of U.S. stocks and 
into bonds, encouraged by expectations that economic indicators due 
out later this week will show a lack of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds rose as talk of problems in Latin America surfaced,  
including a possible debt moratorium in Argentina and talk of 
cabinet reshuffle in Brazil. The uncertainty sent Argentine and 
Brazilian stocks sharply lower and left investors hungry for the 
safety of U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term securities  
rose 5/32 point to 7/32 point higher and intermediate maturities 
rose 13/32 point to 27/32 point higher, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to  
4.72 percent while the rose 0.05 percentage point to 4.60 percent. 
Six-month yields rose to 4.71 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 
percentage point to 4.54 percent. One-year yields fell to 4.96 
percent as the discount fell 0.02 percent to 4.72 percent from late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5 percent from 4.94 percent from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 5/16 point to 119 1/4. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.51 percent from 5.53 percent late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Eubanks Discusses 'Newlywed Game' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For game show host Bob Eubanks, there's one  
moment on ``The Newlywed Game'' that will be hard to match. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in Monday's Los Angeles Times, Eubanks recalled  
asking a contestant to remember something her husband told her not 
to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
	``She answered that her husband and her cousin were going to  
kill her uncle for the insurance money,'' Eubanks said. ``I was 
shocked, but even more taken aback when the husband returned and 
matched the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't elaborate on whether the conversation was a joke or if  
there was any criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks has been a TV game show host since the mid-1960s.

<HEADLINE>  World Cup Champs on Whirlwind Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America's newest golden girls -- the United  
States' winning World Cup women's soccer team -- used whirlwind TV 
appearances today to spread the message that professional women 
athletes are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The extraordinary attention did not surprise midfielder Julie  
Foudy. ``We've always said this team is America's best kept 
secret,'' Foudy said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``So finally the 
secret is out!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team, minus Michelle Akers who was injured in Saturday's  
game, also appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' with their 
World Cup trophy in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	Several young girls were in the crowd sporting replicas of Mia  
Hamm's No. 9 jersey. The team signed soccer balls and encouraged 
young fans not to give up in fulfilling their ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were those girls at one time and they can be there, too,''  
Hamm said. ``Whatever they want to be, whatever they dream to be, 
they can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Briana Scurry said she relished her position as a role  
model for young black girls and said she planned to hold some inner 
city soccer clinics to get more black boys and girls involved in 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Showered with confetti and praise on Sunday in Los Angeles, the  
team took its victory laps at Disneyland and at a sweltering 
downtown rally where -- this time at least -- nobody took their shirt 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup winners rubbed elbows with Mickey and Minnie Mouse  
and were pelted with confetti as they rode a float down 
Disneyland's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was on to the Los Angeles Convention Center, where  
several hundred fans in red, white and blue seemed unfazed by the 
95-degree heat. One fan held a sign that read: ``Thank You Title 
IX.'' That refers to the 1972 federal law that forced schools to 
provide females with the same sports opportunities as males. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outdoor Los Angeles rally, Foudy ran to the microphone  
and raised her arms in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's up L.A.?'' she said. ``You guys are awesome!''  
</P>
<P>
	She introduced her teammates one by one, and the cheering  
swelled when she got to Scurry and Brandi Chastain -- described by 
Foudy as ``a woman who has the uncanny knack for taking her clothes 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain shed her jersey after kicking the winning goal in  
Saturday's victory over China. She previously posed in the buff -- 
carrying a strategically placed soccer ball -- for Gear magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you'll see any more of that,'' Chastain said.  
``But I'm glad I did it. It was fun and if it brought attention to 
soccer, that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had blamed the euphoria of victory for the impromptu baring  
of her sports bra. But Foudy didn't let her off that easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``She says `temporary insanity,' but who believes that?'' Foudy  
yelled to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Players strode onto the stage wearing white World Cup champion  
T-shirts, gold medals around their necks and smiles on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	They had more than one reason to be happy -- the Women's World  
Cup Organizing Committee announced Sunday that it would make a 
$750,000 contribution to the tournament's prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	The players already have been paid between $25,000 and $45,000  
each, but their $12,500 bonuses for winning the final were 
increased between $40,000 and $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain said that, when she was preparing for the final kick of  
the game, she tried ``not to look the goalkeeper in the eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a way of making you feel uncomfortable when you do  
that,'' Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the ball hit the net?  
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be described,'' she said. ``Everything was  
slow-motion up until then, and you feel like you're in total 
control of everything. Then it's gone and you have no control of 
anything at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry greeted fans by thanking young soccer players who  
traveled from around the country to attend the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys have been watching us for years, making the drive or  
trek to come out here. We appreciate all of your support. We love 
all of you,'' said Scurry, introduced by Foudy simply as ``the 
woman on goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd peppered Scurry with good-natured boos when she ended  
her speech by quipping, ``I have to scurry off and do some more 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on!'' she replied. ``That was a good one.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hamm did not speak, but clutched the World Cup trophy in her  
hands and occasionally snapped photos of the cheering crowd and the 
swarm of cameras and reporters behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers, removed from the game after suffering heat exhaustion,  
was still recovering Sunday and did not attend the victory events. 
Coach Tony DiCicco also missed the events, returning home to spend 
time with his family.

<HEADLINE> Americans Boost Seafood Intake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans ate more fish last year, boosting  
average consumption to 14.9 pounds, the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Seafood consumption was up 3.7 percent in the United States, to  
4.01 billion pounds, the agency said. The 14.9 pound average is up 
0.3 pounds from 1997, NOAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the seafood consumed per person, 10.2 pounds were fresh or  
frozen fish or shellfish, 4.4 pounds were canned seafood, and 0.3 
pounds of seafood was cured. The increase was in the fresh and 
frozen products. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Indiana Player Injured in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- Former Indiana basketball standout Luke  
Recker was recovering from a broken arm, facial cuts and a 
partially severed ear after a head-on collision on a rural road. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, 21, was listed in fair condition today at Mercy Hospital  
in Durango. He spent much of Sunday before undergoing plastic 
surgery to his face and left ear. Hospital spokesman Joe Wade Plunk 
said Recker would probably not be released until Tuesday at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the vehicle in which Recker was a passenger was  
killed in Saturday night's three-car crash on County Road 240 near 
Durango in southwestern Colorado. He was identified as John 
Hollbert, 23, of Senoia, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four passengers riding with Recker were also injured,  
one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were Kelly Craig, 19, of Jasper, Ind., an Indiana  
student identified by Indianapolis TV station WRTV as Recker's 
girlfriend. The state patrol said she suffered a spinal fracture 
and partial paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 17-year-old brother Jason Craig, a senior football player at  
Jasper High School, injured his head and spleen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Craigs were transported Sunday to the San Juan Regional  
Medical Center in Farmington, N.M., where Jason was listed in 
critical condition in intensive care and Kelly in serious, 
spokeswoman Rhonda Warden said . 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the Recker car identified by the State Patrol were  
Joanne McGurk, 18, of Durango listed in serious condition, and 
Brian O'Hara, 23, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who was in good 
condition today at Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker reportedly was part of a group of 17 people driving to a  
carnival in Durango when a truck driven by Bob Hardwick, 21, of 
Durango, drifted across the center line at about 70 mph, State 
Trooper Mike McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck then sideswiped a pickup carrying 11 people in  
Recker's group and collided head-on with the Ford Taurus that 
Recker was riding in. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the people in the pickup truck that was sideswiped was  
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado State Patrol said Hardwick was being held under  
$500,000 bond on charges of vehicular homicide, vehicular assault 
and drunken driving. He was scheduled to be arraigned this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, a Mr. Basketball in Indiana, transferred from Indiana to  
Arizona this year. He averaged 16.2 points and four rebounds last 
season as a sophomore forward for the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker will sit out this year and will have two years of  
eligibility remaining.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 5 Hurt After Calif. Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST FALLS, Calif. (AP) -- A search through mud and debris  
after flash flood waters 25-feet high swept boulders through homes 
and cars in this Southern California mountain hamlet ended late 
Monday with one person dead and five injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked just like a movie out of Hollywood,'' said Tristan  
McDow, who helped rescue an elderly woman buried to her neck in mud 
and debris for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulldozers were snaking a path Monday through the vacation  
community of 3,500, but some residents still couldn't drive out of 
the area, which was awash in debris that included giant pine trees, 
wreckage of automobiles and propane tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of one woman was pulled from the ooze and four others  
were accounted for by Monday afternoon after authorities feared 
they were lost to the Sunday torrent that damaged or destroyed 15 
homes, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Jack Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on the five injured people were not immediately  
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all so quick,'' said Randy Thompson, 52, of Calimesa,  
who was barbecuing ribs with friends when sunshine suddenly turned 
to rain, then hail. ``All of a sudden the house started trembling 
and the boulders starting coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Merryman watched in horror as floodwaters picked up houses  
and cars in a 60 mph rush past her Spring Drive vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
	When the waters receded, Mrs. Merryman and Thompson said there  
was an eerie whistling sound coming from across the street where a 
home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Buried in debris under a couch was an elderly neighbor man they  
know only as Bill. Clutching two Chihuahuas, he was whistling in 
hopes someone would find him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter! My daughter!'' he pleaded as his neighbors  
carried him away from the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of his dead daughter, believed to be in her 30s, was  
beneath him. His wife was airlifted to a hospital in serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The downpour, which dropped more than 1 1/2 inches in just 30  
minutes, was the latest devastation from a powerful flow of 
tropical moisture that has sent thunderheads towering over the 
Southwest for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted flash flood watches  
throughout Southern California on Monday. Urban and small stream 
flood advisories were also posted in southern Nevada.

<HEADLINE> Ga. School Shooting Hearing Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- A hearing to determine if the 15-year-old  
charged in the Heritage High School shootings should be tried as an 
adult was delayed today after his attorney asked that his client be 
hospitalized for psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing for Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon had been scheduled for  
Tuesday in Rockdale County Juvenile Court. It was put off until 
early August, but no definite date was set, said Lillian Sellers, a 
spokeswoman for Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon, a sophomore at the school in the Atlanta suburb, is  
charged with 21 counts including aggravated assault, cruelty to 
children and weapons violations in the gunfire that wounded six of 
his classmates May 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Harris, a lawyer for the Atlanta firm that is representing  
Solomon, said today that the teen-ager ``suffers from long-term, 
untreated and major depression with psychotic features and has some 
degree of suicidal tendencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The request to have Solomon hospitalized was made late last  
week, and the defense lawyers plan to meet with Schneider on 
Tuesday to discuss it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon has been in juvenile detention since the shooting and  
``is not doing very well emotionally,'' Ms. Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of Solomon's lawyers, Ed Garland, has previously said  
that at the time of the shooting the teen-ager was taking Ritalin, 
a drug often prescribed for children with attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting happened one month after the shootings at Columbine  
High School in Littleton, Colo., in which 15 people died, including 
the two shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Solomon do not include crimes that  
automatically would transfer the case to adult court. It will be up 
to the judge to decide whether to transfer it, as District Attorney 
Richard Read has said he wants, or keep it in the juvenile system. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted as an adult, Solomon faces a sentence of up to 351  
years. The maximum sentence he could receive in juvenile court is 
60 months in the youth prison system.

<HEADLINE>  Blast Rattles Iranian Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Protesters clashed with  
police in the Iranian capital today, and several people were 
arrested, as demonstrations persisted over a violent attack on a 
university dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in anti-riot gear were out in force at Vali Asr Avenue in  
central Tehran, where they arrested several protesters and threw 
them in a waiting van, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shops in the tree-lined commercial avenue pulled down their  
shutters during the clash, according to witnesses reached by 
telephone from Dubai. They said two men on a motorcycle were beaten 
by protesters who assumed they were plainclothes intelligence 
agents. The men escaped after throwing a tear gas canister at the 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The raid on the dormitory Friday prompted thousands of students  
to stage protests, the strongest expression of discontent in Iran 
since the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed 
shah. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used tear gas and fired shots into the air to disperse  
the crowds in central Tehran today. Nearby at Tehran University, 
about 5,000 people, including 2,000 university staff members, 
staged a sit-in. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have been losing patience with the protests, which  
were sparked Thursday by the closing of a leftist newspaper and the 
passing of an anti-press bill and swelled Friday after police 
stormed the Tehran University dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, police intervened to control the university  
protest after a small explosion plunged the sit-in into chaos, 
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the explosion was caused by a percussion hand  
grenade. A few minutes earlier, a person on motorcycle fired a 
single shot into the air as he raced past the university gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the managing director of the closed Salam newspaper  
asked Iranian journalists not to follow through with plans for a 
one-day strike Tuesday, IRNA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammad Musavi Khoiniha said it is important for the community  
to receive ``frank and transparent'' news reports about the current 
situation. Journalists at more than 20 newspapers had pledged to 
strike in solidarity with the banned newspaper, the Neshat daily 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died and at least 20 were injured in the raid on the  
dormitory, which apparently was carried out with the backing of 
government hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who heads the  
hard-liners, called the attack ``a bitter and unacceptable 
incident'' that ``pained his heart,'' the official news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	All offenders will be dealt with ``no matter in the garb of law  
enforcement forces or else,'' IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrations have exposed a widening gulf between the  
Khamenei's hard-line faction and the allies of the reformist 
President Mohammad Khatami. Khatami is the hero of the student 
protesters, who have been chanting slogans for Khamenei, who is not 
elected, to step down and hand over control of the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran on Sunday fired two security chiefs responsible for the  
raid in response to student demands, but there has been no action 
against Brig. Gen. Hedayat Lotfian, head of the national police, 
whom the students blame for the raid. A third security chief, the 
commander of the Tehran region, has been reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said about 10,000 students demonstrated in Tehran on  
Sunday. Iranian communities in the United States also staged 
protests in Los Angeles, Houston and Dallas in support of the 
students.

<HEADLINE> Goodrich, Coltec Complete Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- BFGoodrich Co. completed its $2 billion  
merger with Coltec Industries Monday, creating the world's largest 
manufacturer of aircraft landing gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies' announcement came after Connecticut-based Crane  
Co. dropped its lawsuit claiming the merger violated federal 
anti-trust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, BFGoodrich promised Crane it would consider  
using Crane's brake control and proximity sensors when making 
integrated landing system bids over the next 10 years, the 
companies said in a joint statement. Specifics of the deal were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	BFGoodrich and Coltec struck a deal with AlliedSignal last week  
to use its wheels and brakes in bidding integrated landing systems 
in exchange for the New Jersey-based company dropping its part of 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the settlement with Crane was reached, a judge in U.S.  
District Court in South Bend, Ind., lifted a preliminary injunction 
that had blocked the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced in November has already passed regulatory  
muster. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich, which was founded in nearby Akron as a rubber company  
in 1870, will move to Coltec's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., as 
a result of the merger, eliminating 170 positions here. About 50 of 
those jobs may be transferred to Charlotte or other Goodrich 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sold its tire business in 1987 to Michelin to focus  
on products and services for the aeronautics industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as a cautious  
market awaited the flood of second-quarter earnings reports 
expected over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 8.24 at 11,185.46 after rising in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also down. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index fell 6.77 to 1,396.51 and the Nasdaq composite index fell 
12.78 to 2,780.29. 
</P>
<P>
	With quarterly profit reports beginning in earnest this week,  
traders were hesitant to make any big bets. Most stocks traded in a 
narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech stocks gave up early gains. Intel, scheduled to  
release its earnings on Tuesday, was off 11/16 at 65 9/16. IBM 
dropped 1 1/2 to 135 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dell Computer, which got a vote of confidence from Goldman  
Sachs last week, was up 3/4 at 43 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Sevearl big Internet stocks were sharply lower. Yahoo! was off 6  
15/16 at 153 1/16, and Infoseek was down 4 1/2 at 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 7  
to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 214.36 
million shares, slower than Friday's pace.

<HEADLINE> European stocks fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Depressed German industrial production figures  
pushed European stocks lower today. 
</P>
<P>
	Investor confidence was hit by data for May showing industrial  
production had shrunk by 0.2 percent, instead of rising by 0.1 
percent, as markets had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a blow to recent hopes that Germany will rescue Europe  
from low growth expectations. Despite that, Frankfurt's DAX stock 
index closed up 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a blip. It goes to show the sluggish performance  
of the first half. We still believe growth will expand in the 
second half of 1999,'' said Jeremy Batstone, equity economist at 
NatWest Stockbrokers in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, oil stocks made gains, with the Dow Jones Stoxx  
Energy index closing up 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 594 European companies closed up  
1.20 points, or 0.4 percent, at 321.42, while the Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 295 companies in countries that joined 
the euro single currency, finished up 0.59 points at 337.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris hotel chain Accor helped the CAC-40 index close up 0.3  
percent -- one of the best-performing markets Monday -- after it made 
a $1.1 billion offer for U.S. motel chain Red Roof Inns. Accor 
finished up 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan's MIBtel index fell 0.1 percent, and Madrid's IBEX-35  
index closed down 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Braces for Job Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa is bracing for  
tens of thousands of job losses in the gold, transport and 
telecommunications industries, part of a continuing drive to make 
private and public companies more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, numerous reports have circulated of 27,000  
possible job cuts by national train operator Spoornet, 10,000 by 
telecommunications provider Telkom and another 11,700 in the gold 
mining industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact ... on local economies is difficult to calculate,  
but the threat facing individuals and their families could spread 
to whole communities,'' wrote The Star in Johannesburg in an 
editorial on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, 5,000 miners were laid off at the East Rand  
Proprietary Mines in Johannesburg, one of the country's oldest 
firms forced to close by high production costs and low gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
	South African industry and government shed 500,000 jobs in the  
past five years, officials have said. These included 315,000 in the 
private sector and another 100,000 in the civil service, according 
to media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	With 42 percent unemployment among the country's majority black  
population, the issue was a major theme of recent elections, when 
President Thabo Mbeki pledged to attract foreign investment to 
boost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, he promised to crackdown on waste in  
government, which would result in some layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Enterprises Minster Jeff Radebe on Monday said the  
elimination of up to 27,000 jobs at Spoornet was only one of 
several options being considered for public-owned companies that 
were being privatized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any reports that imminent retrenchments are on hand are  
premature to say the least, '' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Transnet, which runs Spoornet's train service and other  
transport companies, lost $68 million last year. Since 1994, 
Spoornet alone has cut 16,000 jobs; it currently employs 48,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a government that has promised to put job creation at the  
top of its agenda, the past few weeks look like a disaster of epic 
proportions,'' said an editorial last week in Business Day, the 
country's leading business newspaper in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics charge that the ruling African National Congress waited  
until after the elections to release the bad news, in order to keep 
together the alliance of trade unions and the Communist Party 
forged during the anti-apartheid struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these cutdowns are done after the elections because  
government had to keep the tripartite alliance together,'' said 
Dirk Hermann of the Mineworker's Union. 
</P>
<P>
	To add pressure on the government, three public service unions --  
representing about 500,000 teachers, health workers and police -- 
launched low-key job actions on Monday to push for 10 percent 
salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Government has offered only 5.7 percent, less than the 7 percent  
inflation rate. With 1 million public service employees, the 
government spends about 50 percent of its budget on salaries.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Md. of Legionnaires Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVRE de GRACE, Md. (AP) -- A hot-water tank at Harford Memorial  
Hospital is the likely cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' 
disease that has killed three elderly patients and sickened two 
others, state and hospital officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest fatality was a patient in the hospital June 18-28,  
before health officials discovered the bacteria there, hospital 
spokesman Robert Netherland said yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, whose name was not released, was readmitted to the  
hospital Friday and died that evening. Test results came back 
Saturday confirming he had the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``This person was very ill with other medical conditions,''  
Netherland said, adding that the hospital suspects the disease 
contributed to the death, ``but was not the sole cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another unidentified patient died June 26, and Elizabeth M. Cox,  
79, died on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believe a hot water tank at the hospital was the  
probable source of the bacteria. Water samples taken from the tank 
and pipes tested positive for the bacteria. The hospital's water 
system has since been flushed with 150-degree water and 
decontaminated with a chlorine solution. Results of new tests are 
expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said Friday that additional cases were possible  
because the incubation period for the disease is two to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has been calling more than 400 recent patients to  
ask them about symptoms and offer free testing if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Legionnaires' is a form of pneumonia caused by a common bacteria  
often found in air conditioning cooling towers, water tanks, 
whirlpool spas and humidifiers. The disease takes its name from a 
deadly outbreak at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention held 
in Philadelphia in July 1976.

<HEADLINE> 5 Hospitalized After Drinking Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Five teen-agers went into convulsions  
and lapsed into comas after sharing a drink that had been laced 
with the powerful party drug GHB, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three boys and two girls, ages 13 to 17, were hospitalized  
after falling ill at a home Sunday night. They had regained 
consciousness by Monday night but were expected to remain 
hospitalized until at least Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said a suspect believed to be involved in  
distributing the drug has been taken into custody on unrelated 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	GHB acts as a powerful depressant that lasts several hours. Its  
popularity has increased in dance clubs and parties because in 
small doses, it can induce relaxation and euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration has linked GHB to 32 deaths  
and 3,500 overdoses since 1990. It also has been associated with 
cases of sexual assault, in part because it is odorless and 
practically colorless.

<HEADLINE> Female Kicker's Lawsuit Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court Monday reinstated  
the sex discrimination lawsuit of a female place-kicker who was cut 
from Duke's football team in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled that Heather Sue Mercer is entitled to a trial on her claim 
that Duke violated Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 
1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in 
educational programs receiving federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous decision reversed a ruling by U.S. District Judge  
N. Carlton Tilley Jr. of Durham, who said Duke and coach Fred 
Goldsmith had the right to prevent a female from participating in a 
contact sport under a Title IX subsection. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke University spokesman Al Rossiter said it would be  
inappropriate for the university to comment on the decision until 
the school's attorneys have read the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer kicked the winning 28-yard field goal in Duke's 1995  
Blue-White intrasquad game, and Goldsmith told reporters she had 
made the team. She was listed on the team's official roster and 
pictured in the Duke football yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she never kicked in a game. She claims in her lawsuit  
that Goldsmith made offensive comments to her, including asking why 
she didn't prefer to participate in beauty pageants rather than 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer claims Goldsmith's decision to cut her from the team at  
the beginning of the 1996 season was based on gender because other, 
less qualified walk-on kickers were allowed to remain on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court agreed that Duke had a right to bar Mercer  
from a contact sport. However, the court said that once she was 
allowed to participate, the university could not discriminate 
against her.

<HEADLINE> IBM Buys Sequent for $810 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM is buying Sequent Computer Systems Inc., a  
struggling maker of powerful business computers, in a $810 million 
deal that helps fill a hole in IBM's product line for handling 
heavy duty corporate computing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sequent, though far smaller than Big Blue, is a leading seller  
of brawny machines that run on Intel computer chips, expected to be 
the next corporate computing trend. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM uses its own chips as the brains of powerful mainframe  
computers, which process everything from millions of bank 
transactions to inventories. It plans to use Sequent's technology 
to sell networked ``server'' machines that are an inexpensive and 
flexible substitute to mainframes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Intel chips are not widely used to power these server  
machines, that will start to change next year, when the No. 1 chip 
maker releases a long-awaited next-generation chip known as Merced. 
</P>
<P>
	Merced is intended to work with high-end business machines that  
run either Unix -- the traditional operating system for such 
computers -- or Microsoft's Windows NT, which is rapidly gaining 
market share. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM and other large computer makers, including Hewlett-Packard  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., are racing to adapt their machines 
to Merced. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which is hedging its bets, plans to simultaneously promote  
existing machines based on its own proprietary chip technology. 
Some of these machines will appeal to corporate customers seeking 
extremely powerful computers, while Intel-based computers will 
feature more flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., hopes to greatly increase sales of  
Sequent machines by pitching them through its giant sales force. 
IBM plans to sell Sequent's computers as well as integrate 
Sequent's technology into its own machines. Beaverton, Ore.-based 
Sequent has about 2,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Sequent's leading technology, the company has succeeded  
only in attracting a handful of major corporate customers. Its 
financial results have been viewed by Wall Street as mediocre, 
losing $53 million last year on sales of $784 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sequent's share of the server market has been declining, said  
Amir Ahari, an analyst at researcher International Data Corp. 
``They've been struggling for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's interest in buying Sequent was sparked by an ongoing  
alliance it has with Sequent and software maker Santa Cruz 
Operation Inc. to produce a new version of the Unix operating 
system for the Merced chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Sequent chief executive Casey Powell, who will continue to head  
up Sequent's operations under IBM, founded the company in 1983 
after heading Intel's microprocessor operations. Sequent will be 
folded into IBM's more than $12 billion server division, headed by 
IBM senior vice president Robert Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger allows us the clout of a very large company,''  
Powell said. ``Combined with the size and clout of IBM, we'll be a 
force to reckon with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM will pay $18 cash for each of Sequent's outstanding shares,  
plus additional cash. It hopes to complete the transaction this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sequent's stock, which had been selling for about $14 in June,  
has been rising sharply since rumors of IBM's interest recently hit 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM shares rose 43 3/4 cents a share at $137.81 1/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Sequent's shares fell 15 5/8 cents a share at $17.28 1/8 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sues Toyota, Seeks $58.5B Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government accused Toyota on Monday of  
putting faulty smog-control computers on 2.2 million 1996-1998 
vehicles and sought to have the computers repaired and the company 
fined up to $58.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Justice  
Department filed a civil lawsuit against the automaker's U.S. 
subsidiary under the Clean Air Act in U.S. District Court here 
after Toyota rejected a government settlement offer last week that 
might have cost it $100 million in civil fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese-owned Toyota company is the first automaker that  
has refused to settle a Clean Air Act case with the government. 
Since 1995, Cadillac, Honda, Ford and seven heavy-duty diesel 
engine makers have reached multimillion-dollar Clean Air Act 
settlements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The government always seeks up to the maximum civil penalty the  
act allows but doesn't expect or get that much. ``We're asking for 
an appropriate penalty and notifying the court that the parameters 
are somewhere between zero and $58 billion,'' said Joel Gross, 
chief of Justice's environmental enforcement section. The law 
allows the judge to take into account a company's economic gain 
from the violation, its history of compliance and remedies and 
whether a fine would allow a company to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, the penalty is $25,000 per car sold before Jan.  
31, 1997, and $27,500 for each car sold after that date. The 
government did not know the exact dates on which the 1997 model 
vehicles were sold -- 857,620 of the 2.2 million total -- so the top 
penalty was between $56.4 billion and $58.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also did not specify what actions would be  
necessary to remedy the problem on existing cars. Justice 
officials, requesting anonymity, said they could involve extension 
of warranties so the devices could be replaced or repaired for free 
over a longer period, other repairs or even a recall of the cars 
for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June 1998 settlement with Honda, which involved  
computerized emission monitors on 1.7 million cars, the automaker 
extended the emissions systems warranty to 14 years or 150,000 
miles, offered a free tune-up after 75,000 miles and paid a $17.1 
million civil penalty. Officials said the warranty and repairs 
could cost Honda up to $267 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates for the cost of repairing or replacing all the Toyota  
smog-control computers range up to $550 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At Toyota Motor Sales USA, the company's U.S. subsidiary in  
Torrance, Calif., Senior Vice President Jim Olson said Monday, 
``Toyota continues to be disappointed that despite our vehicles 
having the best in-use emission performance in the industry, this 
matter has not yet been resolved in a mutually agreeable manner.'' 
He argued that regulators had reinterpreted their rules after 
Toyota's equipment was approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials wanted to file the lawsuit early this week so  
the federal case would be available to the California. The state's 
Office of Administrative Hearings on Monday began what is expected 
to be a weeks-long hearing on California's demand that Toyota 
repair 330,000 vehicles sold there with the same computer problems, 
said California Air Resources Board spokesman Jerry Martin. 
California's air standards are tougher than the national standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit covered the three model years of Toyota Camrys,  
Avalons, Corollas, Tercels and Paseos; Lexus cars; Sienna minivans; 
4Runner and RAV4 sport utility vehicles, and Tacoma and T100 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleged that Toyota's on-board computerized  
emission monitors would allow escape of increased hydrocarbon vapor 
without setting off a dashboard warning light for the driver. These 
emissions contribute to ground-level ozone, also known as smog, 
which can cause lung and respiratory problems, especially in the 
elderly and children. Ozone near the ground also is harmful to 
crops and plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies that take short cuts with their vehicle pollution  
control systems shortchange the consumer and our environment,'' 
said Assistant Attorney General Lois J. Schiffer. ``We will hold 
them accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the on-board monitors don't work, ``the government's and  
the state's ability to protect the public health and the 
environment is seriously jeopardized,'' said Assistant EPA 
Administrator Steven A. Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is designed to detect leaks and light a dashboard  
warning light, such as ``check engine'' or ``service engine soon.'' 
The government said the computers were not properly programmed and 
the government was not advised of the programming in certifications 
filed for the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Air Resources Board approved the computers based  
on computer simulations, but they failed to meet California or 
federal standards in field tests in the fall of 1997. Federal 
regulators joined the dispute in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota claims its computers met all guidelines in place when  
they were certified but the state changed the rules afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, the seven diesel engine makers agreed to spend  
nearly $1 billion, including an $83.4 million civil penalty, to 
settle charges they installed illegal software to disable emission 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Honda's settlement, Ford in June 1998 agreed to  
pay $7.8 million for selling vehicles with a device that defeated 
emission controls. In 1995, General Motors settled for $45 million 
over defeat devices on 500,000 Cadillacs.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record High 11,200.98 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials edged to another record high  
but most stocks fell Monday in cautious trading before the 
impending flood of quarterly profit reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.28 to 11,200.98, turning  
positive with only minutes left in the session. It was the third 
closing record in four sessions for the Dow, which has now gained 
more than 2,000 points, or 22 percent, in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Most broad-market indicators posted small losses on the day.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.63 to 2,790.44 after flirting  
with a second straight record high. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
index, which also closed at a new high on Friday, fell 4.18 to 
1,399.10. 
</P>
<P>
	With the flow of reports on the just-ended second quarter  
beginning in earnest on Tuesday, traders were hesitant to make any 
big bets. Most stocks traded in a narrow range as investors waited 
to see whether profit reports will justify the market's 
record-setting climb. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, a market without conviction and one that is inclined  
just to wait and see as we get through these second-quarter 
earnings reports,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist 
for Legg Mason of Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> McGwire, Sosa Linked As All-Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa spent most of last  
season making home run history together. Now they will be 
side-by-side in the same lineup for the first time Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	NL manager Bruce Bochy put baseball's two biggest sluggers  
back-to-back in his lineup for Tuesday's All-Star game, with Sosa 
batting third, followed by McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor for me to be together with Mark again and  
play,'' Sosa said after the lineup was released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the two energized the entire sport with their chase  
of Roger Maris' home run record. McGwire hit his 61st and 62nd 
homers -- tying and passing Maris -- with Sosa in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``With everything that we did last year, it will be great for  
everyone who loves baseball,'' said Sosa, who missed last year's 
All-Star game with an injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire might have won last year's home run race -- outdistancing  
Sosa 70-66 -- but Sosa won the love of the fans, who made him the 
NL's leading vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was the year that everybody recognized me the way I  
was supposed to be recognized,'' Sosa said. ``This year I am the 
leader in votes. That shows the appreciation there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has the midway lead in homers this year, with a major  
league-best 32 at the All-Star break. McGwire is four back, tied 
for second in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	The exploits of the two sluggers has even gotten their fellow  
teammates this week star struck. Many of the 23 first-time 
All-Stars said one of their goals this week was to get autographed 
baseballs from McGwire and Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Ken Griffey Jr., with 56 homers each of the last two  
seasons, appreciated their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you turned on the TV, somebody was getting  
excited,'' Griffey said. ``I think it was a lot of fun not only for 
myself to watch but for all of baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Acquires Rest of Infoseek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. is taking over Infoseek, an  
early arrival on the Internet scene, in an effort to consolidate 
its online operations into one enterprise that can leverage the 
power of Disney's entertainment brands in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney is merging all of its Internet operations together with  
Infoseek to form a new company called go.com. That's also the name 
of a portal site the two companies launched together late last 
year, which has been facing stiff competition from leading portals 
like Yahoo! and AOL.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney has had success with its various Internet holdings, which  
include Web sites for its ESPN cable channel, the ABC television 
network and sites related to its theme parks. But the company had 
not yet brought all these assets together under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are positioning ourselves to lead in this space,'' Disney  
chairman Michael Eisner said Monday at a New York news conference 
announcing the deal. ``We're taking the Disney brand and letting it 
evolve into the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts viewed the deal as positive for Disney, but cautioned  
that a lot of hard work lay ahead for the company in terms of 
making the most out of its media holdings and shaping a clearer 
Internet strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a way to go before becoming a mainstream portal  
site,'' said Charlene Li, senior analyst Forrester Research in 
Cambridge, Mass. ``Disney has a great name, but they haven't been 
able to capitalize on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney investors gave tepid approval to the deal, edging the  
company's shares up 18 3/4 cents $27.81 1/4 as one of the most active 
issues on the New York Stock Exchange. Disney's shares have 
suffered this year due to an earnings slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	But Infoseek shareholders were clearly disappointed in the  
deal's outcome, and may have been hoping for better terms. Infoseek 
shares were off $5.56 1/4, or by nearly 11 percent, at $45.93 3/4 in 
heavy Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney bought 42 percent of Infoseek last year, and announced a  
month ago that it was interested in getting control of the rest. 
Under terms of the deal, Infoseek shareholders will receive 1.15 
shares of the new company, which will be a special class of Disney 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Go.com will also include Disney's catalog operation, which could  
provide key support for any online retail operations down the road. 
Some Internet companies have struggled with the mechanics of online 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	One key point of concern among industry analysts and investors  
was the lack of a new management team for the new company. Harry 
Motro is leaving as president Infoseek after the merger is 
completed, and it's not clear who will replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly need to have a management in place quicky,'' said  
James Preissler, an Internet analyst at PaineWebber. ``It's a very 
complex business and they're starting out from a behind position. 
They're going to have to run very hard, very quickly in order to 
catch up to big players like Yahoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will have revenues of approximately $350  
million. Eisner said Disney has not set a goal for when the company 
would turn a profit, but he tried to allay any concerns that go.com 
might follow the well-trod path of many Internet companies that 
seem to place a higher priority on building market share than 
making money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not out-of-control Internet people,'' Eisner said. ``We  
believe that it's a good idea to have profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney is also pursuing other opportunities in cyberspace. Last  
month, Disney announced that it was taking a ``significant'' stake 
in a venture called eCompanies that will serve as an incubator for 
Internet startups. ECompanies was formed by Jake Winebaum, who had 
a key role in building Disney's own Internet efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney' Internet push provides a much-needed piece of good news  
for the company, which just last week settled a bitter and 
protracted legal battle with Jeffrey Katzenberg over how much 
Katzenberg was due when he left Disney to form another studio.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Champs on Whirlwind Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They hoisted their trophy like an Oscar at the  
Academy Awards, stopped pedestrian traffic in midtown Manhattan and 
even burst into song on the sidewalks of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The champion U.S. women's soccer team took to the streets  
Monday, soaking up more acclaim for their World Cup victory over 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	A lunchtime crowd gawked at the women in matching lavender  
shirts. Then the realization hit the onlookers: These were those 
soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
	If there were any doubt, the players locked arms and began  
singing ``We are the Champions!'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were in New York for a rapid-fire tour of network shows  
from ``Good Morning America'' and ``Today'' to CNN and Fox News 
Channel. A midtown rally was on Tuesday's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players will participate in the LPGA JAL Big Apple Classic  
Pro-Am in suburban New Rochelle on Wednesday and others will attend 
the WNBA All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sharing it with New York City because big things happen  
here,'' said Brandi Chastain, standing amid midtown skyscrapers and 
sharing the sidewalk with the bustling suit-and-tie crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her penalty kick Saturday at the Rose Bowl that set off a  
whirlwind of activity. The players were welcomed at Disneyland on 
Sunday, then flew overnight, landing at Newark Airport at 4:30 a.m. 
and piling on a bus to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all worth it,'' said Chastain, who had not slept since  
early Sunday. ``We're promoting women's soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most touching episode came at the end of their  
overnight trip from California. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were 10 little girls waiting in the airport,'' Chastain  
said. ``They were wearing World Cup and USA soccer stuff. They were 
all so excited. They had slept there. They were jumping around and 
asking for autographs. We all obliged. They deserved them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain was on the 1991 U.S. World Cup championship team and  
remembered one solitary media representative greeting the team when 
it returned to the United States that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were 2,000 media credentialed this year,'' she said.  
``More people are paying attention to women's soccer and we feel 
very proud of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The media push was on full blast. Full-page ads from major  
companies like Nike, Chevrolet and Budweiser saluted the victory in 
newspapers. HarperCollins trumpeted a new book by star player Mia 
Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain thinks she and her teammates proved a crucial point.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety thousand in the Rose Bowl and record television ratings  
gives validity to what we've been saying all along,'' she said. 
``There is a place for this team in pro sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After goalkeeper Briana Scurry stopped the third penalty kick by  
the Chinese, the edge belonged to the Americans. It was up to 
Chastain to make the final kick and seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Over and over, she has been asked to describe those final  
moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I stepped up, four others nailed them,'' he said.  
``It's a mental thing -- you against the goalie. As I grabbed the 
ball and put it down, it was very quiet in the stadium. It was 
surreal. There was no movement. It was like there was nobody there 
except me and this little ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain said she had prepared for the moment hundreds, maybe  
thousands of times, practicing penalty kicks with her teammates. 
This would be just one more kick -- with a championship riding on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it as hard as I could,'' she said. ``I aimed for the  
left side of the net. If you hit the side, that's pretty 
unstoppable. It was the best one I hit of all the ones I practiced. 
When it hit the net, then I heard noise and movement. Then I heard 
the reaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion poured out of Chastain, who ripped off her shirt as  
the celebration began. That was not planned, she said. Rather it 
was a release of emotion over a journey that began with training 
camp in January and ended against China in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In training, the players loaded up on pasta and other  
carbohydrates. Now, with the Cup in their hands, and in a city 
where dining choices are unlimited, the choice of cuisine for some 
was clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese food.  
</P>
<P>
	Backup goalkeeper Saskia Webber insisted the choice was not  
intended as a jab at their finals opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, it has nothing to do with it,'' she said with a grin as  
she and some teammates entered the China Grill restaurant to a 
standing ovation from patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	After dinner, eight of the players headed to the celebrity night  
spot, The China Club.

	The deal announced Monday would give Orion shareholders $50 a  
share, a 23 percent premium over its Friday closing share price and 
a 65 percent premium from the share price a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Orion shares soared 16, or by $6.56 1/4, to close at $47.31 1/4 a  
share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boards have approved the transaction, Royal &AMP; SunAlliance

<HEADLINE> Sampras Defines Davis Cup Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pete Sampras may be ranked No. 3 in the world and  
he may have just played some the best tennis of his life in 
dispatching Andre Agassi in the Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
	But unless he has a dramatic change of heart, Sampras won't be  
playing singles for the United States in this weekend's Davis Cup 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras and his Davis Cup teammates were together for the first  
time Monday in preparation for the quarterfinal tie with Australia 
at Longwood Cricket Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a hot streak and entreaties from teammate Todd Martin,  
Sampras insisted that as a late arrival on a team that has earned a 
quarterfinal berth without him, his place is the doubles court with 
partner Alex O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I want to do is jump on the bandwagon,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only injuries to Jim Courier or Martin, the current singles duo,  
could make him reconsider, Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless that happens, I don't think it's right,'' he said. ``I  
think those guys deserve to play singles. It's their show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Sampras refused to play the Davis Cup, a move  
derided by players such as Courier. But after watching a tape of 
the U.S. beating Great Britain in dramatic fashion during the first 
round in April, Sampras had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an inspiration to me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Knowing his about-face was a sensitive topic with his teammates,  
Sampras said he'd only play doubles when he announced his 
willingness to join the team in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Martin has said he'd step aside if coach Tom  
Gullikson decided to insert Sampras in his singles spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Peter should be playing,'' Martin said. ``I've told  
Tom I think we should have the best team on the court. If he thinks 
that I'm not part of that, that's fine with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, however, is not persuaded.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Todd's a nice enough guy to step aside,'' Sampras  
said. ``It's just not something I'm comfortable doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson said the team would meet this week to hash out  
Sampras' place on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to force him to play,'' Gullikson said. ``Unless  
the other four guys throw him onto the court, I don't think he'll 
play singles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier thinks that the U.S. team will be in good shape, no  
matter what's decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to put a competitive team on the court,'' he said.  
``I think either way, we'll have a competitive team.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen in Tuesday  
morning trading, after Japan's finance minister said the government 
will not take ``extreme'' action in foreign exchange markets. 
Japanese stocks were little changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.12 yen in late morning trading, down 0.02  
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 122.23 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 17.18 points,  
or 0.09 percent, to 18,257.00 points at the end of morning trading. 
On Monday, the average closed up 336.45 points, or 1.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.04 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,487.15 
points. The TOPIX closed up 19.71 points, or 1.35 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar inched lower after Finance  
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tokyo doesn't intend to take 
``extreme'' action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has repeatedly intervened in recent weeks to  
weaken the yen against the dollar in an attempt to help the 
nation's economic recover from a deep recession. But traders say 
the government likely is comfortable with the current dollar-yen 
exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, should the dollar fall to 121.80 yen, the Bank of Japan  
may try to push the U.S. currency back up past 123.00 yen, said one 
Tokyo trader. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, reducing dollar-denominated earnings of 
export-oriented Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.86 yen, down  
from 124.10 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei average fell slightly on  
profit-taking following the previous day's surge. The biggest 
declines were in high technology sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average edged up  
7.28 points to 11,200.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.6200 percent from Monday's finish of 
1.6400 percent, driving its price up to 101.57 yen from 101.39 yen.

<HEADLINE> 'Dawson's Creek' Cited by Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Parents Television Council apparently has a  
love-hate relationship with the WB network. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative watchdog group cited two shows on the WB --  
``7th Heaven'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' -- as the best and worst 
television programs for families. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-aged soap ``Dawson's Creek,'' which stars heartthrob  
James Van Der Beek, was cited by the council as the most offensive 
show on network television for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``The show features an almost obsessive focus on premarital  
sexual activity,'' the council said. The group also criticizes 
``Dawson's Creek'' for its storyline about a teen-aged character 
revealing his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the WB's ``7th Heaven'' demonstrates the  
drawing power of family-friendly programming, the organization said 
Monday. Its lead character, a minister father, offers advice that 
most viewers can relate to, the council said.

<HEADLINE> Kent. Democrats Lose Senate Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky's Democrats lost their majority  
in the state Senate on Monday -- apparently for the first time since 
the early 1800s -- when a single legislator switched to the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dan Seum's defection left each party holding 19 seats in  
the 38-seat chamber, producing an uneasy balance that could affect 
committee chairmanships and the flow of legislation for the 2000 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Party affiliation records are sketchy, especially before 1908.  
However, U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said it was the 
first time since Kentucky's Democratic Party was founded in the 
early 1800s that it did not control both chambers of the 
legislature. Kentucky became a state in 1792. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Democratic Chairwoman Nicki Patton, daughter of Gov.  
Paul Patton, said Seum's switch raises the stakes for Democrats in 
2000, when 19 of the Senate's 38 seats will be up. Democrats now 
hold 11 of those 19 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had a 30-8 majority in the Senate just nine years ago.  
Twice before in this century -- the sessions of 1920 and 1922 -- the 
Democratic majority fell to 20-18. 
</P>
<P>
	They still have firm control of the House, with 65 of 100 seats.  
</P>
<P>
	Seum, a 16-year legislator from Louisville, said he had  
philosophical conflicts with the Democratic Party and had been 
considering a switch to the GOP for years. 

</P>
<P>
	Seum is considered conservative but is not easily categorized.  
He opposes abortion, for example, but is staunchly pro-labor. He 
disdains government regulation of business, opposes abortion and 
higher taxes, and supports school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not easy. This decision was not made overnight, it's  
been a long time in coming,'' he said. ``I do live and represent an 
area that is heavily Democratic. Quite frankly, the easy thing to 
do would have been to just coast, just to ride on out.''

<HEADLINE> State of Care Eyed at Nursing-homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sheryl Lee Lynch considered her father  
a gentleman, a hero and her best friend -- someone far different 
from the nursing-home patient who screamed in pain and didn't 
recognize her. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Lee's health declined so sharply during a six-week stay  
at a ManorCare Health Services nursing home that Lynch and her 
sister moved him to another facility, where he died a short time 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Their wrongful-death lawsuit against ManorCare provides a  
glimpse into an industry that needs far tougher state oversight, 
advocates for the elderly say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The laws aren't being enforced,'' said Carole Herman,  
president of the Foundation Aiding The Elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch and her sister, Linda Braas, contended inadequate care at  
the Citrus Heights nursing home in 1996 caused weight loss, bed 
sores and blood poisoning that led to the death of their 
80-year-old father, Russell Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	During trial last month, ManorCare agreed to settle the case for  
$1 million. It did not admit any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really want to comment on it,'' said Julie Beckert of  
ManorCare's parent company, HCR Manor Care Inc. in Toledo, Ohio, 
said. ``Our feeling is that it's better to use our company's 
resources for quality care than prove our innocence in this case 
because it's so costly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the problems Lee's daughters cited are similar to those  
reported last summer by federal officials who reviewed 1993 
California nursing home deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 62 nursing home deaths that year, 34 involved ``care that  
was unacceptable and that sometimes endangered their health and 
safety,'' the General Accounting Office study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO found problems such as ``inadequate intervention by the  
nursing home to prevent dramatic, unplanned weight loss and failure 
to properly treat pressure sores that became infected and toxic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1995 and 1998, about one-third of California's nursing  
homes were cited for ``serious or potentially life-threatening care 
problems,'' but state regulators were lenient toward many, the GAO 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most, except the worst offenders, were given a month to correct  
deficiencies, without penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials defended their regulatory record.  
</P>
<P>
	Health Services Department spokeswoman Lea Brooks said about 290  
inspectors scrutinize more than 6,000 health facilities an average 
of once a year, one-fourth of them nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Klutz, Health Services' deputy director of licensing and  
certification, said her unit stepped up its efforts last year, 
focusing on the most troubled of California's 1,498 nursing homes. 
About 5,500 complaints were filed against the homes, which house 
more than 150,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The state issued 792 citations to 460 nursing homes last year,  
resulting in more than $2.6 million in fines. Fines range from $100 
for infractions such as cold food to $25,000 for conditions that 
lead directly to a death. 
</P>
<P>
	But due to appeals and other delays, not all fines have been  
paid, Brooks said. She did not know how many fines were owed. 
</P>
<P>
	Assemblyman Kevin Shelley believes the state's oversight needs  
an overhaul. He said he looked into nursing homes after his mother 
suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I visited about 20 to 30 nursing homes,'' Shelley said. ``I  
was appalled at what I found -- patients strapped into wheelchairs 
in dark hallways festering in their own urine, or immobilized in 
bed, pushing call buttons for hours and nobody responding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelley instead pays someone to take care of his mother at home.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Democrat has proposed a bill before the state  
Senate that would boost penalties for the most serious violations 
to $100,000, reduce the patient load for nurses' aides and require 
more training. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursing home industry opposes the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to see enforcement target the consistently  
problematic facilities rather than painting the entire industry 
with that brush,'' said Gary Macomber, president of the California 
Association of Health Facilities.

	BESSEMER, Ala. (AP) -- A $5,000 reward was offered Monday for  
information about a missing 2-year-old girl whose mother told 
police she traded the child for crack. 
</P>
<P>
	Keteria Alexis Blackburn has been missing since February. Her  
mother, Lasondra Diane Smith, 20, was arrested Friday and charged 
with child abuse and child abandonment. She was jailed without

<HEADLINE> Big Mac Conquers Green Monster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Green Monster met its match Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire didn't just conquer The Wall. He embarrassed it,  
making it look like little more than a picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't even dent the 87-year-old icon. He sent one soaring  
off the light tower, about 100 feet above the field and 60 feet 
over the wall's top. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearing Lansdowne Street was easy. A few seemed to soar over  
the Mass Pike toward the Citgo sign in Kenmore Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on an official off-day, McGwire set another home run  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Ken Griffey Jr. repeated as Home Run Derby champion  
Monday night, it was all anticlimactic. Fenway Park was buzzing 
about McGwire's 13 home runs in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was having fun,'' Big Mac said. ``I love doing these things.  
Earlier in my career, when I didn't accept myself as a home-run 
hitter, I didn't like doing these things. But now I enjoy them. I 
think sometimes it's better than the game because I haven't really 
had a great All-Star game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's 13 homers off Tim Flannery broke the one-round record  
set by Cal Ripken in 1991 at Toronto's SkyDome. His longest shot 
was his last of the first round, a 488-foot drive deep over the 
screen and into the summer night. Of the eight longest shots, eight 
were his, all 450 feet or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to question a lot of those measurements on some of  
those balls,'' Boston's Nomar Garciaparra said. ``I don't think 
it's 480 feet to the Mass Pike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the other All-Stars were on their feet, applauding him. Just  
like all of baseball last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro and a few other players followed every swing  
with camcorders. Even Griffey sounded awed. 
</P>
<P>
	``(You're) watching Mark hit them 500 feet when you're getting  
them over like 420, 430, and his balls are doing the postal 
service, just flying by you and dropping mail off at your house,'' 
Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Mac's attack totaled 5,692 feet -- more than a mile -- and a  
lot more than he hit one mile up at Denver's Coors Field last July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I didn't do so good in the home run contest,'' said  
McGwire, who hit four at Coors and apologized to the fans. ``In 
these home run contests, it's up to the pitcher. Tim got me in a 
good grove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit 18 home runs at Fenway while he played for the  
Oakland Athletics, powered the NL to a 27-10 victory. But when it 
came to the individual title, he got just three in the second round 
and didn't make it to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting and waiting tired me out,'' he said. ``I probably  
tried a little too hard. I was more relaxed in the first round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, like Ted Williams showing left-handed hitters can flash  
power at Fenway, hit 10 homers in the second round, including a 
460-foot shot to the back of the center-field triangle and an 
opposite-field drive over The Wall and into the screen. Milwaukee's 
Jeromy Burnitz hit six and also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just sad Mac didn't make it because I know that's why  
everybody's here to watch.'' Burnitz said, sounding apologetic. 
``Best show on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, despite a sore knee, won the final 3-2, winning the  
Derby for the third time since it began in 1990. He didn't seem to 
take it that seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is 'defending the title,' '' he said.  
``It's just going out there and having a lot fun.''

<HEADLINE> Hidden Camera Shows Nurse's Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRESHAM, Ore. (AP) -- The husband of a woman recovering from a  
brain aneurysm used a hidden camera to catch a nurse allegedly 
sneaking into the patient's room and sexually abusing her in the 
middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Elisa Deaine Peterson, 27, was arrested Friday and charged with  
sexual abuse and unlawful sexual penetration. Bail was set at 
$70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged victim was a patient at the Rest Harbor  
Rehabilitation and Extended Care Center, recovering from an 
aneurysm she suffered a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband suspected something was wrong three weeks ago when  
he noticed that his 46-year-old wife was getting worse and that she 
was afraid to be alone or go to sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
	The husband installed a small video camera in her room, and  
shortly before midnight on June 6, he recorded an incident.

<HEADLINE> Bell Homer Makes Woman Millionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Gylene Hoyle had never been to an Arizona  
Diamondbacks' game. She never considered herself a baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Sunday. Now she loves the Diamondbacks, especially Jay  
Bell. And why not? With one swing of the bat, Bell made her a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle was sitting with her husband and two children a few rows  
behind the Arizona dugout when Bell swung on a 3-2 pitch against 
Oakland in the sixth inning Sunday and sent the ball rocketing 
toward the left field seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my eyes closed at that point,'' she said. ``I didn't  
actually know he'd hit the home run until everyone around me 
started yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle, a 31-year-old child care provider from nearby Chandler,  
won the $1 million prize in the Diamondbacks' grand slam contest. 
At every Sunday home game since the Diamondbacks began play last 
year, there has been a contest where a fan wins tickets, then picks 
a player to hit a grand slam and the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the game tickets and the right to be the grand slam  
contest entrant through KNIX, a Phoenix country music station. She 
figured the odds that she'd win the $1 million were astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to get into the game because we'd never been  
here before,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle chose Bell ``because the rest of my family are big  
Diamondbacks fans and they said he was the best hitter with the 
most home runs.'' Her husband Clayton, a drill rig operator, 
suggested the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bingo.  
</P>
<P>
	After Tony Womack drew a two-out walk, the bases were loaded as  
Bell walked to the plate. He already knew she had chosen him and 
the sixth inning. He was 0-for-12 in the three-game series against 
the A's. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question I wanted to hit a home run there,'' Bell  
said. ``I saw her on our dugout before the game and knew the whole 
situation. Most of the fans did, too. It was a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the A's Jimmy Haynes on the mound, Bell worked the count to  
3-1, then fouled a couple pitches into the seats. The last foul 
barely escaped the reach of catcher Ramon Hernandez. A few rows 
behind the Arizona dugout, sitting with her husband and her two 
children, Colleen 8, and Clayton II, 7, Hoyle was going crazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were counting players. I was saying, `Jay Bell isn't going  
to make it in the sixth' and my husband said, `You know, anything 
could happen,' '' she said. ``Then when he got up there and the 
bases were loaded, I just cringed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the foul balls went into the stands, ``my stomach was in  
knots,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he hit it,'' she said, ``I was ecstatic.''  
</P>
<P>
	Haynes delivered a fastball up and over the plate, and Bell hit  
into the left-field seats for his 24th homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where's my share?'' Haynes said. ``Maybe I had greater powers  
working against me today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's slam was the fifth of his career and his first in two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 1-for-14 in the series,'' he said, ``and that hit was  
very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Hoyle seemed almost in shock. She hugged Bell outside  
the Diamondbacks' clubhouse and talked about what she'd do with the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' she said, ``other than take a well-deserved  
vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter already had an idea. ``I want to go to  
Disneyland,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyle wasn't sure if she'd quit taking care of other people's  
children, despite her newfound wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really like the kids I have,'' she said, ``but I won't take  
any more.''

<HEADLINE>  Graf To Retire at End of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Steffi Graf probably will retire from the  
women's tennis tour at the end of the year, ending a magnificent 
career highlighted by seven Wimbledon championships and 22 Grand 
Slam titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, 30, will play in a couple of events next year and go to  
places where she has never competed, but her days of playing the 
Grand Slam circuit are probably over, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf didn't say specifically why she was leaving the tour, but  
she noted that over the past three years injuries have had her on 
the verge of retiring several times. Traveling, the demands on her 
time and not having as much fun playing in tournaments also were 
factors, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say I haven't been very busy thinking about it,''  
Graf said when specially asked about retirement in a conference 
call prior to the A&AMP;P Tennis Classic at Mahwah, N.J. ``I let things 
happen more or less, but most naturally, I will (retire).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf has five more events on her schedule this year, including  
the U.S. Open. She refused to pin down which would be her last 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to stop playing tennis for myself,'' she added.  
``Tennis will always be a big part of my life. I enjoy it and 
hopefully I'll get a chance to play here and there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once she retires, Graf said it's unlikely she change her mind.  
</P>
<P>
	The retirement isn't a big surprise. After winning the French  
Open, she said she would not be returning to Paris. Earlier this 
month, she said she was finished with Wimbledon after losing the 
championship match to Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she played the final week at Wimbledon suffering from  
bronchitis and a fever, which was the major reason she withdrew 
from a mixed doubles semifinal with John McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, who was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame last  
week, has criticized Graf for failing to inform him until just 
before they were to play. He was sent a note by Graf while he was 
working in the broadcast booth. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, who seemed to be unaware McEnroe was annoyed with her,  
added that dropping out late was a difficult decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to talk about how I was feeling,'' Graf said.  
``It's not my style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retirement actually seemed an easier choice for her.  
</P>
<P>
	``... You want to leave a sport when you are at the top,'' Graf  
said. ``That's an ideal situation which is never really easy 
because obviously if you are doing well it's very hard to part from 
what you love so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been having to think the past few years with all the  
injuries I've been having,'' she said. ``There are a lot of times I 
have come very close to making this decision and I feel fortunate I 
have been able to do it on my own terms and not being pushed by 
anything. It's my own decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf has run a sports management company for a couple of years  
and she intends to devote more time to that. She currently has 
three German junior players under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what she was going to do with her free time, Graf  
quipped: 
</P>
<P>
	``What am I going to do with my life? I have a life, finally,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf played her first Wimbledon in 1984, reaching the fourth  
round. She won the championship in 1988, '89, '91, '92, '93, '95 
and '96. She was runner-up in '86. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Martina Navratilova has won Wimbledon more times, with nine  
titles. Graf's 22 Grand Slams are two short of Margaret Court 
Smith's record.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The University of Georgia wrongly awards ``racial  
bonus points'' to minority applicants, but didn't discriminate 
against a white student whose application was rejected in 1997, a 
judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge B. Avant Edenfield said Craig Green  
would not have been admitted regardless of race, due to his 
academic record. But Edenfield also said the university ``cannot 
constitutionally justify the affirmative use of race in its 
admission decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The record shows, quite simply, that ... UGA prefers one  
applicant over another based solely on race,'' Edenfield wrote in 
his July 6 ruling. ``UGA officials evidently employed racial 
preferences first and asked questions later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green's lawsuit contended the University System of Georgia uses  
racial quotas to illegally segregate public colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Edenfield threw out the discrimination claim, the judge's  
remarks were encouraging, said Lee Parks, Green's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball is now in the university's court,'' Parks said. ``Are  
they going to continue this program in the face of this ruling or 
not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university's admission policy uses the same academic  
standards for all students. Borderline applicants, who comprise 
about 25 percent of admitted freshmen, are awarded extra points for 
being minorities. Extra points are also given to applicants whose 
parents are alumni or who live in rural or poor areas of the state, 
regardless of race. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials justified the system as a way to diversify  
the campus, where blacks make up 6.2 percent of the student body. 
The state population is 28.4 percent black. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edenfield wrote that the policy ``stigmatizes non-white  
students, the vast majority of whom earned admission without the 
benefit of the ... racial preference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University President Michael Adams said school officials will  
review current admissions practices to ensure they are 
nondiscriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The system's chancellor, Stephen Portch, said the judge's  
comments pose challenges to creating diverse college campuses. He 
said officials will continue to ``explore all of the options that 
will enable UGA to have an inclusive student body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the University of Georgia accepted black applicants  
with lower grade-point averages and SAT scores than whites. 
University officials switched to the current policy in 1996, citing 
constitutionality concerns.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Drink Puts Teens in Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Five teens shared a drink at a  
get-together and then suffered convulsions and went into comas, 
authorities said as they worked today to figure out what the liquid 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were hospitalized after they fell ill about 10 p.m.  
Sunday at a home in this Missaukee County community. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all passed around a drink, and they all got sick,'' state  
police Sgt. Mike Salasky said. ``We know it wasn't alcoholic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sample of the liquid was being tested at a lab, Salasky said  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The five teens ranged in age from 13 to 17. A sixth teen who was  
at the home but apparently didn't drink any of the substance and 
hasn't been able to give much information on what it was, Salasky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down the road he'll be talked to a little bit more, once we  
figure out what the drug is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were not immediately identified. A police statement  
said all of them were comatose this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims initially were taken to Mercy Hospital in Cadillac.  
One was transferred to Spectrum Health hospital in Grand Rapids; 
two others were taken to Munson Hospital in Traverse City. 
Spokesmen at all three hospitals either would not release 
information this morning or did not return a call.

<HEADLINE> All Star Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez was a prominent topic of  
conversation Monday after he decided he'd rather stay home than 
come off the bench for the AL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is totally out of line refusing to be recognized as  
one of the greatest players,'' said Carlton Fisk, an 11-time 
All-Star and the AL honorary captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether that is a kind of attitude or selfishness  
on his part, but it is. I think down the line he may regret the 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, the reigning AL MVP, was angered by the high number of  
votes for the Cleveland Indians. Despite being third in the league 
in homers and RBIs, he finished fifth in the voting, behind Ken 
Griffey Jr. and three Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, his colleagues were confounded by the Texas  
slugger's choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the decision he made wasn't a very good decision,''  
said Sammy Sosa, Gonzalez's friend and former teammate. ``But 
that's his business and there is nothing I can do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn, who has been selected to 17 All-Star teams, made the  
trip even though he is sidelined with a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juan decided he didn't want to be here,'' Gwynn said. ``That's  
his choice. They are not going to call off the game because Juan 
Gonzalez isn't here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JUNIOR AND JUNIOR:* Ken Griffey Jr. was a late arrival for his  
All-Star news conference. At least he had an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry I'm late,'' he said right before receiving the award for  
being the leading vote-getter in the AL. ``My 3-year old, who just 
got in, wanted me to stay in the room and watch cartoons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Griffey arrived, much of the talk was about his chances to  
pass Hank Aaron to become baseball's career home run king. Griffey, 
who doesn't turn 30 until after the season, has 379 career homers -- 
more than halfway to Aaron's record 755. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really thought about it,'' Griffey said. ``The  
person that I wanted to beat was my dad -- over 2,000 hits, world 
championships, played every day. That's the only person I wanted to 
beat because he was the guy I could physically touch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they're talking about me breaking Hank Aaron's record, and  
I just say OK. It's an honor that he says it and you people say it, 
but I still take it one day at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL-STAR MEMORIES:* With 23 first-timers at this All-Star game,  
AL manager Joe Torre reminisced about his first All-Star 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	As a 22-year-old in 1963, Torre was thrilled to be selected as  
the third catcher, even if he spent the entire game in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally got to play the next year, catching Don Drysdale at  
Shea Stadium in front of his hometown. The two went over the signs 
before the game for the fastball, slider, change-up, and even the 
spitter. 
</P>
<P>
	They agreed that the fastball and spitter would have the same  
sign, and since Torre didn't know which was coming, he had trouble 
catching some of Drysdale's pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said `I'll throw it off the fastball.' And I said OK,''  
Torre recalled. ``That was the dumbest thing I've ever done. In the 
first inning, I went back to say hello to Mayor Wagner (behind the 
plate) about four times. We had a sign for it after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRIBAL REUNION:* There is a decidedly Cleveland flavor to this  
year's game. And you can't put all the blame on the Jacobs Field 
ballot stuffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Indian Tony Fernandez joins six current Cleveland players  
-- Roberto Alomar, Kenny Lofton, Manny Ramirez, Jim Thome, Charles 
Nagy and Omar Vizquel on the AL squad. The NL has six former 
Indians: Matt Williams, Jay Bell, Paul Byrd, Sean Casey, Jeromy 
Burnitz and Jeff Kent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a quality organization,'' Burnitz said. ``They develop  
guys and they can make trades with their prospects. I loved it 
there even though I didn't play. I learned a lot there and so did a 
lot of other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the former players were forced out of Cleveland because  
there was no room to push out the All-Stars who were already there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really tough with Jim Thome ahead of me,'' Casey said.  
``You look at the long-term situation there and you realize there 
isn't much chance. If I hadn't gotten the opportunity to be traded, 
who knows how long I would have waited.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EQUAL REPRESENTATION:* At least two All-Stars agree that  
baseball shouldn't do away with the requirement that every team be 
represented at the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there wasn't that rule, I wouldn't be asked that  
question,'' Detroit's Brad Ausmus said. ``I know it doesn't make 
everybody happy, but I don't know if there is a perfect system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's Ron Coomer, another player who wouldn't be at Fenway  
Park without that rule, sees both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, I remember waiting up all night to see the  
one Cub, Steve Swisher, get his one at-bat,'' Coomer said. ``I'm 
glad we have the rule, but it can keep some deserving guys out.''

<HEADLINE> Dennis Franz Talks to TV Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Emmy-winning actor Dennis Franz says he probably  
would have left ``NYPD Blue'' after the first season because he and 
co-star David Caruso didn't get along. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz, who has won three Emmys during his six-year tenure on the  
ABC cop drama, said he has gotten along much better with Caruso's 
two replacements, Jimmy Smits and Rick Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't know how much longer I would have stayed with  
the show,'' Franz told TV Guide in the July 17 issue. ``Life is too 
short to be that unhappy with something you should be loving. ... 
The work process for me became not enjoyable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso left the drama in 1994 to pursue a movie career that  
never took off. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz said Smits' exit after four years last spring was very  
hard for him because they had grown so close. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the last scene I did with Jimmy, I had tears rolling  
down my cheeks,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Equestrian Board Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Most of Japan's equestrian board resigned Monday in  
the aftermath of an investigation in which it was found that 
federation executives accepted a $29,000 payment from an Olympic 
rider. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen of the Japanese Equestrian Federation's 20 executive  
board members, including president Shozo Hara, submitted their 
resignations at a meeting, according to Takashi Fujita, a 
federation official. 
</P>
<P>
	The board members decided to step down to take ``moral  
responsibility for causing a stir in society,'' said Fujita. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20th member was traveling overseas and unable to attend the  
meeting but was also expected to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation again denied that the payment from Yoshinaga  
Sakurai was a bribe to secure his place on the 1992 Olympic squad, 
Fujita said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation carried out an investigation after the national  
Mainichi newspaper reported Sakurai's payment last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to that report, federation president Hara said the  
money comprised a gift, payments for a training camp and a loan. He 
denied that the money influenced team selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakurai also denied that the cash was intended to get him a  
berth on the Barcelona Olympics squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations will be accepted at a general meeting to be  
held at a later date, Fujita said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those resigning included two of the three federation members --  
vice chairman Hiroshi Gotoh and head of judges Eizo Osaka -- who 
received money from Sakurai. The third member who received money, 
Shoji Murakami, an editor for the federation magazine, was not a 
member of the board but also resigned, Fujita said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation issued a ``serious warning'' to Sakurai.

<HEADLINE> Not Your Mother's Role Models </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They definitely were not your mother's role  
models. 
</P>
<P>
	But they will be your daughter's.  
</P>
<P>
	And maybe your son's too.  
</P>
<P>
	The lasting image of the women's World Cup is game-winning goal  
scorer Brandi Chastain sliding on her knees near the penalty spot, 
celebrating victory with a full-throated roar and waving her jersey 
instead of wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was the same one she made last month by posing for  
a magazine wearing nothing but a soccer ball and cleats -- daring 
anyone to suggest beauty, brains and athletic ability couldn't be 
bundled in one package. 
</P>
<P>
	For the moment at least, there were no takers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We caught lightning in a bottle,'' Hank Steinbrecher, general  
secretary of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said Sunday. ``The Queen 
Mother doesn't have enough money to pay these women what they 
deserve right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrecher spoke just minutes before Chastain and her  
teammates swept past during a parade through Disneyland's Main 
Street, showered with confetti as they rode a float and rubbed 
elbows with Mickey and Minnie Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities marked the start of a two-day, two-coast  
whirlwind tour that will put the team in front of the cameras that 
missed them the first time around -- when they crisscrossed America 
en route to winning the 16-nation, 32-game tournament that 
concluded Saturday with a 5-4 victory over China on penalty kicks 
following a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' thrilling triumph produced the most-watched  
soccer game ever on U.S. network television, with ABC estimating 
that 40 million viewers tuned in. A few million more woke up in 
time to catch Chastain on the Sunday morning news programs 
bantering with fellow guests First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	For all that, the lingering question is how much a nation that  
fell under the spell of a sport and the female athletes who played 
it will value them both by next week. After all, the United States 
played host to the men's World Cup in 1994, but the men's national 
team and the professional league created soon afterward are still 
struggling for attention in a crowded sports landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the U.S. women team members are adamant about getting  
a professional league of their own, it is far from becoming a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is about making things happen,'' Chastain said. ``If  
it takes each one of us knocking on doors to get that, we'll do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Soccer Federation, which developed the business plan  
for Major League Soccer before turning the enterprise over to 
private investors, has launched a feasibility study for a women's 
league. And while Steinbrecher was cautious about whether the World 
Cup generated enough momentum to launch and sustain a pro league, 
he had no doubts about its success in another, more important 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to take what we've learned about women's equity,  
what we've learned about women as equal partners and not 
subordinates, and export it around the world,'' he said. ``I think 
we're on the cutting edge of a revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confirmation of that was practically at Steinbrecher's elbow,  
where Jeff Marquis and his family, from nearby Corona, sat along 
Disneyland's Main Street, waiting for the U.S. team to go by. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquis came into possession of two tickets for the final only  
last week, no small feat after the U.S. team packed stadiums in New 
Jersey, Chicago, Boston, Washington and Palo Alto, Calif. He 
decided to take his 15-year-old daughter, Brittany, because she 
plays on her high school team. And besides, he already had tickets 
to take his 13-year-old son, Bryce, to the Dodgers game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were growing up, I don't think I ever imagined that  
they'd have equal opportunities to play sports,'' Marquis said. 
``But even before this thing exploded, she had many of the same 
things he got out of sports -- a network of friends, the confidence, 
the power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he could envision his daughter playing  
professionally as easy as his son, Marquis paused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody always ties it to that,'' he said, ``but I'm not  
sure that's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He may be right. Brittany said the most important thing to her  
was how good she and her friends felt to be on a soccer field, 
knowing that their boyfriends had come to see them play -- instead 
of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, her younger brother was one of those boys watching  
the girls play and he admitted loving every minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see any difference,'' Bryce said, ``except at the  
end, the ripping-off-the-shirt part. I haven't ever seen that 
before.'' 
</P>

	NEW YORK (AP) -- America's newest golden girls -- the United  
States' winning World Cup women's soccer team -- used whirlwind TV 
appearances today to spread the message that professional women 
athletes are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The extraordinary attention did not surprise midfielder Julie  
Foudy. ``We've always said this team is America's best kept 
secret,'' Foudy said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``So finally the 
secret is out!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team, minus Michelle Akers who was injured in Saturday's  
game, also appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' with their 
World Cup trophy in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	Several young girls were in the crowd sporting replicas of Mia  
Hamm's No. 9 jersey. The team signed soccer balls and encouraged 
young fans not to give up in fulfilling their ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were those girls at one time and they can be there, too,''  
Hamm said. ``Whatever they want to be, whatever they dream to be, 
they can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Briana Scurry said she relished her position as a role  
model for young black girls and said she planned to hold some inner 
city soccer clinics to get more black boys and girls involved in 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Showered with confetti and praise on Sunday in Los Angeles, the  
team took its victory laps at Disneyland and at a sweltering 
downtown rally where -- this time at least -- nobody took their shirt 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup winners rubbed elbows with Mickey and Minnie Mouse  
and were pelted with confetti as they rode a float down 
Disneyland's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was on to the Los Angeles Convention Center, where  
several hundred fans in red, white and blue seemed unfazed by the 
95-degree heat. One fan held a sign that read: ``Thank You Title 
IX.'' That refers to the 1972 federal law that forced schools to 
provide females with the same sports opportunities as males. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outdoor Los Angeles rally, Foudy ran to the microphone  
and raised her arms in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's up L.A.?'' she said. ``You guys are awesome!''  
</P>
<P>
	She introduced her teammates one by one, and the cheering  
swelled when she got to Scurry and Brandi Chastain -- described by 
Foudy as ``a woman who has the uncanny knack for taking her clothes 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain shed her jersey after kicking the winning goal in  
Saturday's victory over China. She previously posed in the buff -- 
carrying a strategically placed soccer ball -- for Gear magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you'll see any more of that,'' Chastain said.  
``But I'm glad I did it. It was fun and if it brought attention to 
soccer, that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had blamed the euphoria of victory for the impromptu baring  
of her sports bra. But Foudy didn't let her off that easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``She says `temporary insanity,' but who believes that?'' Foudy  
yelled to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Players strode onto the stage wearing white World Cup champion  
T-shirts, gold medals around their necks and smiles on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	They had more than one reason to be happy -- the Women's World  
Cup Organizing Committee announced Sunday that it would make a 
$750,000 contribution to the tournament's prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	The players already have been paid between $25,000 and $45,000  
each, but their $12,500 bonuses for winning the final were 
increased between $40,000 and $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain said that, when she was preparing for the final kick of  
the game, she tried ``not to look the goalkeeper in the eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a way of making you feel uncomfortable when you do  
that,'' Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the ball hit the net?  
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be described,'' she said. ``Everything was  
slow-motion up until then, and you feel like you're in total 
control of everything. Then it's gone and you have no control of 
anything at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry greeted fans by thanking young soccer players who  
traveled from around the country to attend the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys have been watching us for years, making the drive or  
trek to come out here. We appreciate all of your support. We love 
all of you,'' said Scurry, introduced by Foudy simply as ``the 
woman on goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd peppered Scurry with good-natured boos when she ended  
her speech by quipping, ``I have to scurry off and do some more 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on!'' she replied. ``That was a good one.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hamm did not speak, but clutched the World Cup trophy in her  
hands and occasionally snapped photos of the cheering crowd and the 
swarm of cameras and reporters behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers, removed from the game after suffering heat exhaustion,  
was still recovering Sunday and did not attend the victory events. 
Coach Tony DiCicco also missed the events, returning home to spend 
time with his family.

<HEADLINE> Spider Expert Disappears in Idaho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- One of the world's foremost  
authorities on spiders has been missing for six weeks and police 
say they fear the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have had two investigators working on the case since  
48-year-old Darwin K. Vest vanished June 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it's unlikely he's committed suicide or gone  
somewhere on his own,'' Lt. Steve Roos said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only days before his disappearance, Vest had notified his  
sister, Rebecca, that an Oregon business was interested in selling 
the hobo spider trap kits he had invented. 
</P>
<P>
	The hobo spider had special meaning for Vest and his sister:  
They named the spider, whose bite was thought for years to be that 
of a brown recluse. 
</P>
<P>
	Vest was an authority on spider, snake and plant poisons. The  
self-taught scientist and owner of Eagle Rock Research in Idaho 
Falls has testified about poisonous bites in court cases across the 
country, lectured and written on the subject and been featured on 
the Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Vest collected spiders and milked them for their venom. The  
process involved Scotch-taping an anesthetized arachnid to a board, 
delivering a shock and using a pipette to pick up a bead of venom. 
</P>
<P>
	He apparently vanished as he was walking back to his house near  
the Snake River. He had played his weekly trivia game with friends 
at a bar and then stopped off at another place, apparently for a 
nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's heard anything more about him,'' his cousin Farrel  
Vest said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark-haired, bearded man was known for taking walks at  
night, and was mugged after a similar evening out several years 
ago, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mark at 10-Yr Low Vs. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro fell closer to parity with the dollar  
Monday, sinking to yet another low as weak industrial production 
figures from Germany indicated that Europe's stagnant economy is 
not recovering as quickly as hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss franc and German mark both fell to 10-year lows  
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar fell against the Japanese yen. Traders were  
hesitant to take the dollar higher against the yen because Japan's 
central bank -- in an attempt to further the economy's recovery from 
a deep recession -- has repeatedly intervened in recent weeks to 
weaken the yen against the dollar and the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0148, down  
from $1.0176 late Friday. During trading, the euro fell to $1.0112, 
below the previous low of $1.0146, which was set during trading 
Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 122.23 Japanese yen, down 
from 122.38. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell as Germany reported industrial production  
unexpectedly fell 0.2 percent in May from April. Analysts had 
expected output to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro started to sink lower'' when the disappointing  
figures were released, said Jay Bryson, an international economist 
at First Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has the third-largest economy in the world and is the  
engine that moves the 11 European countries using the euro to 
represent its currency. Euro-region countries are stagnating and a 
fall in German economic data brings ``into question when the 
European economies are turning the corner,'' Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question on everybody's mind is when do we hit parity,''  
with one euro equaling $1, Bryson said; the euro has fallen since 
it began trading at $1.1668 on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5830 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5793, and 1.4796 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4733. The British 
pound rose to $1.5559 from $1.5480. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro rate in late New York trading, the dollar was 
worth 1.9290 German marks, up from 1.9220; and 6.4609 French 
francs, up from 6.4475.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today began to debate HMO reforms  
with both sides supporting their own versions of a patients' ``bill

<HEADLINE> Rapper DMX Fined $25 for Obscenities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- After spending two nights in  
jail, U.S. rapper DMX was released Monday when he paid a $25 fine 
for using obscene language at a local concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Magistrate Deborah Thomas Felix gave the musician, whose real  
name is Earl Simmons, the option of the fine or a month's 
imprisonment at hard labor. 
</P>
<P>
	He had pleaded guilty to the obscenity charge stemming from his  
Saturday night concert. 
</P>
<P>
	As police escorted Simmons off the stage, they fired shots in  
the air to disperse unruly fans who were protesting the singer's 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, the rapper thanked police who handled his  
arrest, saying the situation could have become violent. He also 
apologized to the Caribbean country, saying he was ignorant of its 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trinidad Guardian newspaper Monday quoted concert promoters  
as saying he might not get paid because he broke a contract in 
which he had agreed not to use any obscene language.

<HEADLINE> Baxter Creates Cardiovascular Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Baxter International Inc. is spinning off  
to shareholders its $1 billion cardiovascular business to focus on 
its blood, medical products and kidney systems business. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the tax-free spinoff, including the new company's  
name, have yet to be determined, Baxter said in a statement Monday. 
The transaction is expected to close by mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The news drove shares of Baxter up $3.31 1/4, or 5 percent, to  
close at $64.18 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Baxter's cardiovascular products, including heart-valve  
therapies, cardiac monitoring systems and mechanical cardiac-assist 
systems, have market leading positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very excited about creating one of the world's largest  
companies focused on advanced cardiovascular disease,'' said Harry 
M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr., Baxter's president and chief executive. 
``As separate entities, both companies will be more competitive and 
have greater financial flexibility to invest and grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael A. Mussallem, Baxter group vice president, will become  
chief executive of the new company, which will be based in Irvine, 
Calif. Mussallem has managed Baxter's cardiovascular business since 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	With manufacturing operations in North America, Japan, Europe  
and Latin America, Baxter's cardiovascular operation generates more 
than 40 percent of its sales outside of the United States. Of 
Baxter's 42,000 employees, 6,000 work in its cardiovascular 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, some former Baxter executives will be leading a  
related company called LifeStream International LLC, First Chicago 
Equity Capital and Garrett Capital Advisors announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will be formed from the acquisitions of the  
cardiopulmonary products division of C.R. Bard Inc., assets of the 
cardiosurgery business of Minntech Corp. and Surgimedics Inc. 
Details of the acquisitions were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert W. Kleinert Jr. will become LifeStream International's  
president and chief executive after the deal closes in August, the 
partnership said in a statement. Kleinert has been executive vice 
president of Dade Behring Inc. He held the same position at Dade 
International from 1994 to 1997 and before that held several 
executive positions with Baxter, including president of Clintec 
Nutrition, and Baxter Diagnostics in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Products in the LifeStream portfolio will include oxygenators,  
catheters and blood filters and reservoirs.

<HEADLINE> Chief Wants Four Chicago Cops Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago's police superintendent on Monday  
recommended the firing of four officers for their part in the fatal 
shooting of an unarmed black woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers will be suspended 30 days without pay while the  
police board takes up the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	LaTanya Haggerty, 26, was a passenger in a car involved in a  
police chase on June 4 when she was shot and killed. Investigators 
said an officer mistook her cellular phone for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Terry Hillard said the officers ignored a  
supervisor's order to call off the chase, fired without 
justification and failed to notify a supervisor promptly that shots 
had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced department rules and regulation were  
intentionally ignored and the four officers involved must be held 
accountable for those actions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to release the officers' names.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, protesters called for criminal charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights leaders and members of the clergy have staged  
several protests since the recent fatal shootings of Ms. Haggerty 
and an unarmed black man, a 22-year-old Northwestern University 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers who fired the fatal shots in both cases are black,  
but black leaders have said that the shootings may reflect racism 
on the police force. They have argued that black officers have 
incorporated the racist attitudes of their white colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Nolan, president of the Chicago chapter of the Fraternal  
Order of Police, called Hillard's decision a ``foregone 
conclusion'' in light of public pressure to blame someone for the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed in it, and we'll do whatever we can to help  
the officers ... keep their jobs,'' Nolan told CLTV in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> INS Changes Detention Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by a flurry of court rulings taking  
aim at a section of the sweeping immigration law enacted by 
Congress in 1996, the federal immigration service on Monday 
significantly changed its mandatory detention policies for 
noncitizens with criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service's new legal  
interpretation could free hundreds of immigrants deemed non-violent 
who are being held pending their removal hearings. The new 
interpretation affects certain criminal aliens who completed their 
criminal sentences prior to Oct. 9, 1998, when the controversial 
mandatory detention provisions took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The action essentially restores the discretion INS once enjoyed  
to free noncitizens with criminal records who are not believed to 
pose a danger to the community or a flight risk in advance of their 
final deportation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions of the 1996 law that took effect in October 1998  
mandated that INS detain virtually all noncitizens whose criminal 
convictions -- occurring before or after passage of the law -- made 
them deportable. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the 1996 law also broadened the definition of crimes  
that would trigger deportation and included retroactivity 
provisions covering convictions prior to 1996, some noncitizens who 
had steered clear of crime after an earlier brush with the law 
suddenly found themselves behind bars under mandatory detention. 
</P>
<P>
	With the changes announced Monday, INS will initiate a  
case-by-case review. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner stressed that no one deemed to  
pose a threat to public safety will be released under the new 
policy. Release decisions are subject to review by immigration 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1996 act gave INS important new tools that have helped us  
reach record levels in the removal of criminal aliens,'' Meissner 
said in a news release. ``In one provision of the new law, at least 
13 federal courts have ruled that INS has greater flexibility in 
implementing the law's mandatory detention requirements than we had 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials, who had worried the mandatory detention  
provisions would overburden their already strained detention 
system, estimate their new interpretation could reduce the 
detention population of 17,400 by about 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	An author of the 1996 law, House Judiciary immigration  
subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, had no immediate 
comment pending review of the new INS policy, said spokesman Allen 
Kay. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, who had written Attorney General Janet Reno  
seeking a change to the mandatory detention policies, welcomed the 
INS action. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they are criminals and they are terrorists, yes, deport  
them,'' the Texas Democrat said. ``But if they are people who have 
been here 20, 30 years and are not a threat to our nation and are 
working, have a family, then we need to be conscious of that. They 
have a right to (be released on) bond.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Hatch Begins White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch acknowledged Monday that  
he faced long odds in his just-started presidential campaign, but 
predicted he could beat the Republican front-runner, George W. 
Bush, by raising at least $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that I've been in tougher circumstances,  
no question that I've had to fight the establishment in Washington 
and there's no question I've been able to bring people together,'' 
he said on his first campaign swing through New Hampshire, which 
holds the nation's first primary. 
</P>
<P>
	In appearances at a church daycare center and a dental insurance  
company, Hatch promoted himself as the candidate of the people. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing himself as the more experienced candidate, Hatch said  
he could beat the Texas governor with only $12 million to $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah senator said he hopes to match Bush's $36 million war  
chest by having 1 million people contribute $36 apiece to his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With only four years as a governor, Bush would be led by party  
``elites'' if he made it to the White House, Hatch said. 
Republicans should require Bush to defend his positions instead of 
bowing to the Bush ``juggernaut,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch noted his own experience, including his past chairmanship  
of the Senate Labor Committee and his current chairmanship of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's lack of experience would make him vulnerable in a general  
election, and a Democrat victory would cause great harm to the 
country, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll take us 50 years to get this country back'' if a  
Democrat gets to nominate Supreme Court justices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said conservative battles on important issues -- like  
affirmative action, the death penalty and state's rights -- would be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll lead to a breakdown in the economy. I think  
it'll lead to a lot of changes in the federal government -- a 
federal government triumph in this country over all the states,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separating himself from the other contenders, Hatch said he grew  
up in poverty, unlike the privileged lives of Bush, Vice President 
Al Gore and Democrat Bill Bradley. He said his parents lost their 
home shortly after his birth, and he worked as a janitor to pay his 
way through college. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch is very respected, but is a gamble at this point because  
he is untested in this kind of race, said Republican media 
consultant Patrick Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The slippery snow and ice of Iowa and New Hampshire can be  
very unkind, even to the most genteel members of the U.S. Senate,'' 
Griffin said. ``There's a a big difference running for Senate in 
Utah and being the party's nominee for president.''

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Killer Gets Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- A former postal worker today became the  
first person to be sentenced to death under the ``serial killer'' 
provision of New York's death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Shulman, 45, was convicted in March of bludgeoning three  
women to death. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge sentenced him under a provision in the 1995 death  
penalty law that calls for the execution of someone who kills three 
or more people within a two-year period as part of a common plan or 
in a similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other people have been sentenced to death in New York  
since it reinstated the death penalty. Both are appealing their 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Shulman, a former postal worker in the Long Island village of  
Hicksville, was convicted of killing three women whose bodies were 
found in 1994 and 1995. He is awaiting trial in the killings of two 
other women. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer argued that Shulman's life should be spared because  
he suffers from depression and has a weak grasp of reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``God knows I didn't do this,'' Shulman said in court Monday.  
``That gives me peace of mind.''

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra To Play Despite Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra has missed the last nine games  
with a groin injury, but he won't be a spectator for Tuesday 
night's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox shortstop plans to start for the AL team in  
order to test his injury and play in front of his hometown fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually good for me,'' Boston's shortstop said Monday.  
``It will help me get ready so I can play Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Red Sox resume their season with the opener of a  
three-game series against Philadelphia. But first Garciaparra plans 
to start for the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday in Atlanta, he missed his ninth consecutive game with  
a strained left groin. He doesn't feel he's jeopardizing himself by 
playing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said my team's first,'' said Garciaparra, third in  
the AL with a .366 batting average. ``I probably could have played 
yesterday (Sunday) and if we had a game today I probably would have 
played today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how long Garciaparra, batting second, would play.  
AL manager Joe Torre of the New York Yankees said he would consult 
with Boston manager Jimy Williams, one of his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to hurt anyone, but certainly he should get the  
recognition by playing,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra will play before his home fans at Fenway Park after  
winning the fan balloting with 1,089,974 votes. New York's Derek 
Jeter was second with 1,069,528. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be in any All-Star game,'' said Garciaparra, a  
backup as a rookie in 1997 but not picked last year. ``The fans 
here have always been great.''

<HEADLINE> Extraterrestrial Life Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAT CREEK, Calif. (AP) -- On a high desert plain, with silvery  
green sagebrush roasting under a glowing ball of sun, astronomer 
Jack Welch looks at the sky and wonders. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, he's studied the stars, uncovered the secrets of  
their distant fire. Now, as the first professor to hold the new 
chair dedicated to the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence at 
the University of California at Berkeley, Welch is embarking on a 
new venture -- listening for the alien civilizations that may lie 
beyond the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The future is out there, he thinks. One day, he hopes to hear  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're listening for technologies like our own,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Welch, an expert in star formation, has been coming to the  
mountains of Northern California for years, studying stellar 
chemistry at Berkeley's Hat Creek Radio Observatory, some 230 miles 
northeast of the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, he was appointed to the Watson and Marilyn Alberts  
Chair for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, a field of 
study commonly called SETI. 
</P>
<P>
	``The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is like taking a  
big leap and saying, 'Well, look, if there's organic chemistry 
going on, why don't we just -- boom -- listen?,''' he says, striking 
his hands together for emphasis. ``Why don't we just go right to 
the top?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some think Welch and his colleagues are wasting their time.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are excellent reasons to expect that technological  
intelligence occurs only very rarely in the universe,'' Ben 
Zuckerman, a professor of astronomy at the University of California 
at Los Angeles, says in an e-mail interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuckerman opposes public funding of SETI research but says he  
wishes the researchers good luck provided they stick to private 
funds. He said the idea that aliens are out there ``is supported 
only by Copernican argument and wishful thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Copernican argument, Zuckerman refers to a world view --  
dating back to the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus' discovery that 
the Earth revolves around the sun -- that there's nothing 
particularly special about life on Earth and it could therefore 
exist elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress withdrew NASA funding for SETI in 1993 amid cutbacks  
and criticism. The work continued after a number of Silicon Valley 
entrepreneurs stepped in with private support. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end of the spectrum are those who seem a little too  
willing to believe: the UFO enthusiasts with their tales of bright 
lights on country roads who make the SETI scientists groan. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch says no unexplained radio signal has been received in  
decades of listening, let alone a visitation. ``My own feeling is 
they're less likely to be flying around in a spaceship than to be 
parked on a planet somewhere broadcasting,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a chair at prestigious Berkeley -- one endowed with  
$500,000 to boot -- is vindication for SETI researchers trying to 
demonstrate their work is science, not fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that SETI has been recognized as an important part of  
mainstream science,'' says Frank Drake, president of the Mountain 
View-based SETI Institute and a pioneer of the use of radio 
telescopes in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch has strong ties to the SETI Institute. He's on the board  
of directors and is married to Jill Tarter, project scientist for 
Project Phoenix, the institute's search program. Tarter was the 
model for the astronomer played by Jodie Foster in the 1997 movie 
``Contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's job makes the couple a two-chair pair; Tarter holds the  
institute's Bernard M. Oliver Chair for SETI. 
</P>
<P>
	A former director of UC Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Laboratory,  
Welch took a roundabout route to SETI, spending most of his career 
in orthodox astronomy. But with each major discovery, he became 
more convinced that the possibility of life elsewhere existed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are sort of overwhelming,'' he says, reeling off  
the arguments for life beyond Earth: billions of stars, millions of 
planets, the discovery of water and other organic chemicals 
floating around in space. ``Put that all together, it seems crazy 
to believe that there isn't life on some level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next big step will be building an array of radiotelescopes,  
probably at the Hat Creek observatory, over 2 1/2 acres, which is one 
hectare. Drake dreamed up the so-called One Hectare Telescope, or 
1hT -- an array of 500 to 1,000 conventional backyard satellite 
dishes tied together with dedicated software. 
</P>
<P>
	The finished array -- supporters are trying to raise $25 million  
to get it built -- would be much cheaper than building one large 
dish, could look at many directions of the sky at the same time and 
could be used for regular astronomy and SETI work simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Hat Creek observatory is home to 10 six-meter radio  
dishes, spread out on a stretch of land ringed by mountains. Modest 
ranch-style accommodations dot the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hat Creek antennas now in place are not being used for SETI  
research. But in six years or so, Welch hopes to be able to look 
out over a forest of satellite dishes, each with an ear on the 
heavens. 
</P>
<P>
	One day, someday, he thinks someone is going to hear something.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it won't be me, but I think it will happen,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Telecom Sell-Off a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- The sale of a 13.5 percent stake in  
Portugal Telecom and an associated share rights issue raised some 
$1.62 billion, the government announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of 42.1 million shares, which began three weeks ago,  
reduced the government's stake in the company to 10 percent. The 
phased privatization of PT, which is expanding into Brazil and 
North Africa, began in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's share of revenue from the sale was expected to be  
$960 million, according to Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, Secretary 
of State for the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Dos Santos called the sale -- the largest ever in Portugal, if  
the rights issue is included -- a success, especially considering 
the recent slump in the Portuguese stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The next privatizations planned will include a partial stake in  
tobacco company Tabaqueira and a further stake in Electricidade de 
Portugal SA, though the specific timing hasn't been defined.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Tie Up Missouri Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- About 900 civil rights demonstrators spilled  
onto Interstate 70 north of downtown during rush hour this morning, 
shutting down the key highway for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York  
activist, want the state to hire more minority contractors for 
highway construction projects. Protest organizers said talks with 
Gov. Mel Carnahan's staff over the past week had gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't take it any more. We want our fair share,'' said Cleo  
Willis, a welder who sat down in the middle of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters created a human chain across the roadway,  
shouting ``No justice, no peace'' as traffic backed up for miles in 
both directions. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6:40 a.m., about 20 minutes after protesters began walking  
onto the highway, police arrested Sharpton and then the others. 
Many had to be carried to police buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities estimated 900 people took part in the  
demonstration, after initially saying there were only 300. About 
200 of them were arrested on charges of impeding the flow of 
traffic and disobeying the law. Most of those arrested were 
released a short time later, including Sharpton. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those arrested was state Rep. Charles Q. Troupe of St.  
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was worth it,'' Troupe said after being released.  
``If black men are out of work, then black women and children will 
suffer. We've got to fight for the employment of black people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 70 is the region's busiest east-west corridor. Much  
road construction work is under way around St. Louis this summer, 
including replacement of bridges and overpasses on I-70. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters have demanded that minorities make up 35 percent  
of workers and 25 percent of contractors in construction projects. 
They had said they hoped to attract 10,000 protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	``How dare they build a highway down the middle of north St.  
Louis and have no minority contractors?'' said Marcus Hindmon, 
president of MO-KAN, a group representing minority contractors.

<HEADLINE> Three Jets Arraigned on Long Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Two New York Jets players and a former  
teammate arrested after a bar fight in Long Island face 
disciplinary action by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were arraigned today in Long Beach City Court and  
remained free on bail, the Nassau County district attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were scheduled to appear before Nassau County Judge Joseph  
Calabrese on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	John ``Jumbo'' Elliott, 34, and Jason Fabini, 24, of the Jets  
and Matt O'Dwyer, 26, of the Cincinnati Bengals were drinking at 
Bogart's Bar and Restaurant in Long Beach about 12:30 a.m. Saturday 
when they began acting up, police said. It took 31 officers to 
subdue the 300-pound football players, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a left tackle, was charged with misdemeanor assault,  
harassment and public lewdness. Police said he triggered the brawl 
by urinating in a sink in the women's bathroom in the bar and then 
punching two patrons, a woman and a male volunteer firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabini, one of the Jets' top rookies last year, was charged with  
disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, who signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with  
Cincinnati three weeks ago, faces the most serious charges: felony 
assault, harassment and criminal mischief. Police said he kicked 
out the window of a patrol car, sending shattered glass into the 
faces of two officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were treated for scratches to their corneas.  
</P>
<P>
	The players could be ordered to get counseling and could face  
fines or suspensions if found guilty, NFL officials said. NFL rules 
say that players charged with crimes involving violence or alcohol 
can be ordered to enroll in anger management programs and alcohol 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The players posted cash bail -- Fabini $100, Elliott $10,000 and

<HEADLINE> Quebecor Printing Acquiring US Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Quebecor Printing Inc., based in  
Montreal, will acquire World Color Press Inc. for $1.4 billion in 
cash and stock in a deal that will create the largest commercial 
printer in the world. World Color Press is headquartered in 
Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, to be known as Quebecor World Inc., will  
serve customers in magazines, catalogs, books, retail inserts and 
circulars and direct mail printing. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger agreement announced today, a subsidiary of  
Quebecor Printing will acquire World Color Press through a tender 
offer to purchase World Color shares for $36.09 a share in cash or 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	That represents a 30 percent premium over the average trading  
price of World Color shares since July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, World  
Color rose $4.68 3/4 a share, or 15.7 percent, to $34.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebecor Printing said about $840 million of the purchase price  
would be for cash and the rest for stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Quebecor is assuming $1.3 billion in World Color  
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Color board has approved the merger by a unanimous  
vote and recommended acceptance of the offer by shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer is subject to 50.1 percent of World Color shares being  
tendered to the offer and regulatory approvals. Both the tender 
offer and the merger are expected to be completed within four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebecor Printing is now the largest printer in Europe and the  
second-largest printer in North America and South America, with 
1998 annual revenues of $3.8 billion and 26,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	World Color is one of the leading commercial printers in the  
United States. The company has 16,000 employees and revenues of 
$2.5 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Punch Still Wants Allied Domecq Pubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Punch Taverns Ltd. plans to make a final,  
irrevocable offer this week for 3,600 pubs it hopes to buy from 
Allied Domecq PLC, a Punch spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch has twice sweetened its initial offer in a bidding war  
with rival Whitbread PLC, and it criticized Allied's decision last 
week to recommend that shareholders approve Whitbread's smaller 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch will issue its final offer by Wednesday, the spokesman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch has offered $4.53 billion in cash together with an option  
for shares in Bass PLC. Whitbread has offered $4.42 billion in cash 
and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied's management explained its preference for Whitbread by  
saying it believed the Whitbread offer would allow for a speedier 
sale of its pubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied wants to sell its pubs to focus on its other businesses,  
including some of the world's best-known liquor brands -- like 
Beefeater gin and Canadian Club whiskey -- along with the Dunkin' 
Donut and Baskin-Robbins ice cream chains.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.600 percent, up from 4.590 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.540 percent, down from 4.590 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since June 28, when the  
bills sold for 4.750 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since May 10, when the rate was 4.510. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.733 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,883.70 and 4.724 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,770.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 5.06 
percent last week from 5.11 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Takes Tour de France Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METZ, France (AP) -- Soon, the plane would be taking off for  
Geneva on the way to the French Alps, where the Tour de France gets 
a whole lot more grueling. First, it was time for champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Armstrong won Sunday's crucial time trial a few hours  
earlier, recapturing the yellow jersey and staking his claim as a 
clear favorite to win cycling's biggest race. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service team had a champagne toast to celebrate  
their star rider's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing to expect it. It's another thing to see it  
happen,'' Mark Gorski, the team's general manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old rider from Texas is earning a lot of new  
admirers these days, far from home. Many see his comeback from 
testicular cancer to the very top of cycling as inspiring, not to 
mention amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``His comeback is great!'' said 19-year-old Christian Kohl of  
Germany, waiting for an autograph before the race. ``He was so 
sick, and now he's one of the favorites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, wearing the red-white-and-blue jersey of the U.S.  
Postal Service team, powered through the 34-mile course in 1 hour, 
8 minutes and 36 seconds. He rode at an average speed of nearly 30 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	He left such specialists as Spain's Abraham Olano, the world  
time-trial champion, and Britain's Chris Boardman in the dust. 
Armstrong called it ``one of the greatest victories of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Armstrong, once so severely ill that almost everyone assumed  
his career was over -- at the very least -- is a decisive favorite as 
the Tour hits the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's stage wasn't kind to all American riders. Bobby Julich,  
who came in third overall last year, fell on a steep descent during 
the time trial and is out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Julich, who rides for the French team Cofidis, was taken to a  
hospital, where he was found to have bruised ribs. Nothing was 
broken, except his hopes for this year's Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old from Glenwood Springs, Colo., fell at the  
18.6-mile mark, on a descent where riders were traveling at about 
46 mph. He was was in 20th place overall going into Sunday's stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Things worked out better for another American, Tyler Hamilton of  
U.S. Postal, who came in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Zulle of Switzerland was in second place, 58 seconds  
behind, followed by Frenchman Christophe Moreau, 2:05 behind. Olano 
came in fourth, at 2:22 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Moreau is second, followed by Olano and then Australian  
Stuart O'Grady. Spaniard Alvaro Gonzalez Galdeano is fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the team trailer before the race, Armstrong exuded  
confidence, joking with a teammate as he warmed up on a stationary 
bike. He even strummed a few bars of air guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance knew this was the day the Tour really began for him,''  
said Dan Osipow, operations manager for U.S. Postal. ``He's been 
waiting for this day for quite a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Armstrong took great care to learn Sunday's course,  
coming to Metz on a rainy day in April to try it out. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer  
that spread to his lungs and brain. He underwent surgery to remove 
his right testicle and lesions from his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	After long months of rehabilitation and recovery, Armstrong  
returned to racing early last year, and has been steadily 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
	He was considered a favorite for the time trial ever since he  
won the race prologue, also a time trial. He wore the yellow jersey 
for two days before losing it to Estonian Jaan Kirsipuu. 
</P>
<P>
	In public, he's appeared calm and focused all week. But after  
finishing Sunday, he admitted to a case of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I won the yellow jersey a week ago,'' he said,  
``because I was really nervous while I had it. Maybe now I'll be 
less nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The riders were traveling to the Alps on today, a rest day.

	2 Arrested in U.S. Embassy Bombings  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Police have arrested two men in London in  
connection with the fatal bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa 
last summer, authorities said. Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Hadi Eidarous, 
42, and Adel Mohanned Abdul Almagid Bary, 39, were due in court 
today to face charges they conspired with Saudi fugitive Osama bin 
Laden and his alleged terrorist network to kill Americans, Scotland 
Yard said. The men, who must appear today in Bow Street Magistrates 
Court, were arrested yesterday on an extradition warrant following 
a request from the United States.

	Belfast Braces for Protestant March  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Protestant revelers blackened  
the sky with bonfires, played anti-Catholic tunes and set off 
booming fireworks that echoed through Belfast's otherwise empty 
streets today as Northern Ireland began its most tension-packed day 
of the year. An estimated 80,000 Protestant members of the Orange 
Order brotherhood planned to march today in several parades across 
Northern Ireland. Their official reason is to commemorate 
Protestant King William of Orange's battlefield triumph over the 
Catholic-led forces of James II three centuries ago, but in 
practice the mass mobilization is designed to demonstrate which 
side of the community is still stronger in this Protestant-majority 
state.

who came under fire in separate incidents toward the end of their 
tour. No Americans were injured, and a spokesman for the U.S. 
forces said experience from other peacekeeping missions would stand 
the troops in good stead. Task Force 1-26, part of the Army's 1st 
Infantry Division based in Germany, is taking over from the 26th 
Marine Expeditionary Unit, initially deployed in southeastern 
Kosovo. The last Marines are expected to depart later this week.

	Japanese Nuclear Reactor Shut Down

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Engineers shut down a nuclear reactor in western  
Japan this morning after monitoring equipment showed it was leaking 
radioactive water, an official said. The No. 2 reactor operated by 
Japan Atomic Power Co. in Tsuruga, 200 miles west of Tokyo, was 
manually shut down, company spokesman Yoshikazu Murabe said. There 
was no danger of radioactivity escaping into the outside 
environment, he said. An estimated 50 tons of water used for 
cooling the inside of the reactor had leaked out, and the device 
was still leaking as of noon, ``but at a lower volume than 
earlier,'' Murabe said.

yesterday. Matt Williams hit a two-run homer for Arizona, and David 
Dellucci was 2-for-3 with two doubles and an RBI. Bell's grand 
slam, on a full count with two outs in the sixth inning off Jimmy 
Haynes, broke a 3-3 tie.

<HEADLINE> Losing Virginity the `American' Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At 17, when testosterone charges through a young man's body like  
the bulls of Pamplona, everything is about sex and how to get it. 
And for the awkward adolescents in ``American Pie,'' the biggest 
challenge is how to lose their virginity. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sherman, the solution is to lie about his sexual experience.  
Finch pays a friend 200 bucks to make sure all the girls at school 
think he's a killer stud in bed. Oz, a simple-minded jock, joins 
the school chorus so he can hook up with a blonde cutie, while 
Kevin consults a secret manual of sexual do's and don'ts that has 
been passed down by generations at school. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, there's Jim. He gets up close and personal with dirty  
tube socks and mother's apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim provides a reason why this coming-of-age movie is called  
``American Pie,'' and the defining scene, in which he tries to 
simulate a sexual act with dessert, is a gross-out. You'll think 
twice the next time someone offers you a slice of apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
	You'll also think twice about ever sipping beer -- or any drink --  
from a friend's cup. The brothers Weitz -- Chris and Paul -- make 
their feature film debut as producer and director of this Universal 
Pictures release, and they could not have thought up a more 
nauseating scene than the beer episode. You'll probably gag, as did 
some audience members at a recent press screening. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the plot. It's so thin, it makes Calista  
Flockhart look like a poster child for Weight Watchers. Here's the 
skinny: Four middle-class suburban boys try to score. Ooooh, the 
sweet mystery of it all. Do they succeed? What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
	But plot isn't everything. In this case, fun is. And ``American  
Pie'' has some genuinely funny moments, like Jim's on-line 
sexcapade with a foreign exchange student and his bedroom tango 
with the band geek dominatrix. The movie's humor, though, is 
uneven, and the film falters with sometimes deadly pacing and 
overdone silliness as a substitute for wit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a coming-of-age piece, it lacks the edge -- and social  
redemption -- of ``Porky's'' and the sassy writing and knock-out 
performances of ``Animal House'' and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont 
High.'' Nor is it a smart film like ``Election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Take away the nudity, sexual content and sleaze, and ``American  
Pie'' has the look and feel of a television series expanded into a 
two-hour special. The actors have that homogenized, bland 
all-American TV look. Sadly, there are no break-out performances -- 
there's no Sean Penn or Reese Witherspoon to keep the film afloat. 
And, with the exception of the band geek Michelle, and Jim's dad, 
who takes an active interest in his son's sex ed, the characters 
aren't very memorable and seem to be ordered up from a Central 
Casting mail-order catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Farrelly Brothers and ``Austin Powers'' are any  
indication, people love gross; they love toilet humor and lewd, 
crude and rude. You'll laugh and you'll smile, but here's also fair 
warning that you might just lose your cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Biggs, from the TV soap ``As the World Turns,'' plays Jim;  
the apple pie is unbilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Klein, last seen as Paul Metzler in ``Election,'' is Oz,  
the group's self-appointed Casanova; Alyson Hannigan is the talky, 
geeky flute player; Shannon Elizabeth gets to bare her breasts as 
the exchange student Nadia; Eugene Levy does his usual droll take 
as Jim's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Natasha Lyonne is wasted in her role as Jessica, who helps  
Finch's reputation; Thomas Ian Nicholas is a forgettable Kevin, who 
is in love with Tara Reid's Vicky (we're asked to believe that this 
twitette has been accepted by Cornell University). 
</P>
<P>
	The ensemble cast is filled out with Chris Owen as Sherman, who  
starts the ball rolling when he lies about having lost his 
virginity, Seann W. Scott as the annoying Stifler, Mena Suvari as 
sweet Heather the chorus soloist and Eddie Kaye Thomas as the 
provocative Finch. 
</P>
<P>
	``American Pie'' was produced by Chris Weitz, Warren Zide, Craig  
Perry and Chris Moore. Paul Weitz directed from a screenplay by 
Adam Herz. The movie is rated R for brief nudity, sexual situations 
and the gross-out factor.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard in Standoff With Cubans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A floating standoff between a boatload of Cubans  
fleeing their country and Coast Guard vessels ended peacefully 
after four hours Monday when the Cubans willingly boarded a cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. policy, Cubans who reach land are allowed to stay  
while those picked up at sea are sent back. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's standoff did not involve any forceful attempt to detain  
the refugees, Coast Guard spokesman Glenn Rosenholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was in contrast to a much tenser interdiction of 12 Cubans  
late Friday off an inlet in north Broward County. A Coast Guard 
cutter collided with the Cubans' boat, throwing all 12 refugees 
into the ocean. One woman drowned. The 11 survivors were taken to 
the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo, Cuba, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Again Monday, the Cubans wanted to reach shore and freedom, but  
the Coast Guard said it couldn't let that happen, trying instead to 
persuade the group to board one of their ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guardsmen rode alongside the Cubans' 16-foot motorized  
wooden boat, urging them to stop. The standoff ended in 
international waters about 17 miles off Miami Beach when the 
vessel's motor stopped, possibly because of mechanical failure, and 
the boat began to drift. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans, including 13 men and three women, then willingly  
boarded the cutter, Vachon said.

<HEADLINE> Doctor To Destroy Unclaimed Embryos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The ad ran deep in the Sunday classifieds,  
between ``Can't Collect on a Judgment?'' and a notice seeking 
witnesses to a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you feel you have embryos or sperms stored with Arizona  
Institute of Reproductive Medicine,'' the ad began, ``please 
contact us immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 lines of eye-straining type announced one fertility  
clinic's answer to a question with dizzying implications: What do 
you do with frozen embryos whose donors cannot be found? 
</P>
<P>
	``All unclaimed specimens will be destroyed as of July 15th,  
'99,'' the ad warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the notice, appearing in The Arizona Republic on  
June 27, may mark the first time that a fertility clinic in the 
United States has announced such plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Tamis plans on retiring this year at age 69 and  
closing the clinic he founded. Clinic workers are contacting 
patients to offer this choice: Have the embryos implanted in the 
next six months, transferred to storage at another clinic or 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 patients each have up to 16 frozen embryos at the  
clinic. Some 75 sperm samples also must be claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Patient coordinator Kathy Fink cannot say how many of those  
patients cannot yet be located, but she hopes the ad will help 
locate all of them or lighten any potential legal liability for the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	When the clinic first began freezing embryos in the mid-1980s,  
patients never even considered this dilemma. Several years ago, 
Tamis' clinic and others across the country began asking patients 
to sign contracts spelling out the ultimate fate of any unclaimed 
embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't stick around,'' Fink said. The clinic is in an  
all-out search, even for those who authorized the clinic to destroy 
their embryos under just such circumstances as these. 
</P>
<P>
	Some guidance does exist. In 1997, an ethics panel of the  
American Society for Reproductive Medicine concluded that clinics 
could destroy embryos unclaimed after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no legal precedent for Tamis' clinic. ``People keep  
saying someone has to do something about this,'' said Washington 
University law professor Rebecca Dresser, who helped develop the 
ASRM guidelines. ``It has to be resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The embryos are created by fertilizing an egg with sperm in a  
laboratory and letting the fertilized egg grow for two days to 
about eight cells before being frozen and stored. When a woman 
wants to try to get pregnant, up to four embryos are thawed and 
inserted in her uterus. 
</P>
<P>
	Destroying embryos leaves some doctors, ethicists and patients  
aghast. 
</P>
<P>
	``If those were my embryos and they thawed them, I would flip  
out,'' said Denise Moreli, of New York City. She's had two 
unsuccessful embryo implantations. 
</P>
<P>
	Carmen Knaus, of Pittsburgh, has 22 embryos in cold storage.  
``Every fertility patient thinks of those embryos as their 
babies,'' she said. Like Moreli, she is a member of the online 
infertility support group called Child of My Dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Knaus also has an agreement with her husband to donate embryos  
to other infertile couples. But other fertility patients have a 
hard time deciding what to do with frozen embryos after pregnancy 
efforts fail or a baby is born. 
</P>
<P>
	Such hesitation shows that patients instinctively know embryos  
are babies that need to be protected, said John Grabowski, a 
theologian at Catholic University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thawing them out and discarding them as if they were nothing  
more than excess lab material is morally troubling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To which Fink replied: ``That's why we're giving (patients) the  
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patient privacy raises yet another concern. ``The patients may  
not have wished other people to be aware of those embryos,'' said 
Melvin Polkow, who heads the bioethics committee at Hackensack 
University Medical Center in Hackensack, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The choices may be more theoretical than real. Other clinics are  
unlikely to take unclaimed embryos. In many cases, some date back 
to the 1980s and are so old that fertility experts say they have no 
chance of surviving inside a womb. 
</P>
<P>
	Though other doctors might hesitate, Dr. Jaroslav Marik of Los  
Angeles once accepted stored embryos from another retiring doctor. 
``There's always a liability issue if the freezing doesn't come out 
well,'' he said. ``It's an unfortunate consequence of the sue-happy 
population.''

<HEADLINE>  Propaganda War Heats Up in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- With a weekend of heavy fighting between  
government troops and guerillas over, Colombia's propaganda war is 
heating up. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed services chief Gen. Fernando Tapias said today that the  
fighting -- some of the heaviest in memory -- had ended, and offered 
to show scores of dead rebels to the country's skeptical media. 
</P>
<P>
	``My information at this moment is that there are no  
(roadblocks) and no clashes in any part of the country,'' Tapias 
told Radionet Radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Television images showed police barracks, stores, banks and  
houses reduced to rubble by leftist rebels who attacked over the 
weekend with homemade explosives and armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	A dusk-to-dawn travel ban went into effect for the second  
straight night Sunday in nearly a third of the country's provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	And a funeral was held Sunday for dozens of soldiers killed in  
the action that touched off the weekend's bloodshed -- a guerrilla 
raid Thursday on an encampment in mountains south of Bogota. At 
least 59 soldiers and police died in the four days of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the military claimed a resounding victory.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement faxed to the media late Sunday, the army said it  
had stiff-armed ``the biggest and most demented guerrilla offensive 
in the past 40 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 202 rebels were killed in ``Operation Independence,''  
as the military labeled its response to ``terrorist'' attacks in 
two dozen locations across central and southeastern Colombia. Four 
battalions battled more than 1,000 guerrilla fighters of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, the army 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With few independent reports in the conflict zones, however, and  
rebel death counts notoriously difficult to verify, Colombians were 
left wondering what to make of the latest round of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics said tough talk from the government was no substitute  
for more convincing actions to reverse a three-year string of 
victories by the 15,000-member FARC, which now controls nearly 40 
percent of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't gain anything by covering our eyes and labeling them  
as terrorists,'' former national security adviser Alfredo Rangel 
wrote Sunday in El Tiempo newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Only by beefing up the military, and dealing unequivocal blows  
to the FARC on the battlefield can the rebel group be convinced to 
give up its 35-year struggle, Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace negotiations between the FARC and President Andres  
Pastrana began in January, and many observers saw the group's 
latest onslaught as a show of force meant to influence a round of 
talks scheduled to begin July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest of Sunday's fighting took place in Puerto Lleras, a  
town in Meta state 110 miles southeast of Bogota, where guerrillas 
attacked with armor-plated trucks. At the army's invitation, 
journalists headed in droves today to the town where the military 
claims nearly 100 FARC fighters died. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels also targeted police stations in several regions.  
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Caqueta state, police said two children were  
killed when a rebel bomb destroyed their house, which was next to 
the police station in the village of Valparaiso. 
</P>
<P>
	Two police died when rebels launched homemade bombs fashioned  
from gas canisters at a police barracks and a bank in Campamento, a 
town in the northwestern state of Antioquia. Television pictures 
showed houses and stores reduced to rubble by the crude but deadly 
bombs. A third officer was killed in a FARC drive-by shooting near 
Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of rebels had police pinned down Sunday night in two  
other southern towns, Puerto Rico and Doncello, with army 
reinforcements yet to arrive, said the national police commander, 
Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 travelers were reported held since early Sunday at a  
rebel roadblock on a highway near Pasto, capital of the state of 
Narino, 330 miles southwest of Bogota.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Champs on Whirlwind Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America's newest golden girls -- the United  
States' winning World Cup women's soccer team -- used whirlwind TV 
appearances today to spread the message that professional women 
athletes are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	The extraordinary attention did not surprise midfielder Julie  
Foudy. ``We've always said this team is America's best kept 
secret,'' Foudy said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``So finally the 
secret is out!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team, minus Michelle Akers who was injured in Saturday's  
game, also appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' with their 
World Cup trophy in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	Several young girls were in the crowd sporting replicas of Mia  
Hamm's No. 9 jersey. The team signed soccer balls and encouraged 
young fans not to give up in fulfilling their ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were those girls at one time and they can be there, too,''  
Hamm said. ``Whatever they want to be, whatever they dream to be, 
they can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Briana Scurry said she relished her position as a role  
model for young black girls and said she planned to hold some inner 
city soccer clinics to get more black boys and girls involved in 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Showered with confetti and praise on Sunday in Los Angeles, the  
team took its victory laps at Disneyland and at a sweltering 
downtown rally where -- this time at least -- nobody took their shirt 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup winners rubbed elbows with Mickey and Minnie Mouse  
and were pelted with confetti as they rode a float down 
Disneyland's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was on to the Los Angeles Convention Center, where  
several hundred fans in red, white and blue seemed unfazed by the 
95-degree heat. One fan held a sign that read: ``Thank You Title 
IX.'' That refers to the 1972 federal law that forced schools to 
provide females with the same sports opportunities as males. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outdoor Los Angeles rally, Foudy ran to the microphone  
and raised her arms in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's up L.A.?'' she said. ``You guys are awesome!''  
</P>
<P>
	She introduced her teammates one by one, and the cheering  
swelled when she got to Scurry and Brandi Chastain -- described by 
Foudy as ``a woman who has the uncanny knack for taking her clothes 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain shed her jersey after kicking the winning goal in  
Saturday's victory over China. She previously posed in the buff -- 
carrying a strategically placed soccer ball -- for Gear magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you'll see any more of that,'' Chastain said.  
``But I'm glad I did it. It was fun and if it brought attention to 
soccer, that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had blamed the euphoria of victory for the impromptu baring  
of her sports bra. But Foudy didn't let her off that easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``She says `temporary insanity,' but who believes that?'' Foudy  
yelled to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Players strode onto the stage wearing white World Cup champion  
T-shirts, gold medals around their necks and smiles on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
	They had more than one reason to be happy -- the Women's World  
Cup Organizing Committee announced Sunday that it would make a 
$750,000 contribution to the tournament's prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	The players already have been paid between $25,000 and $45,000  
each, but their $12,500 bonuses for winning the final were 
increased between $40,000 and $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain said that, when she was preparing for the final kick of  
the game, she tried ``not to look the goalkeeper in the eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a way of making you feel uncomfortable when you do  
that,'' Chastain said. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the ball hit the net?  
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be described,'' she said. ``Everything was  
slow-motion up until then, and you feel like you're in total 
control of everything. Then it's gone and you have no control of 
anything at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry greeted fans by thanking young soccer players who  
traveled from around the country to attend the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys have been watching us for years, making the drive or  
trek to come out here. We appreciate all of your support. We love 
all of you,'' said Scurry, introduced by Foudy simply as ``the 
woman on goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd peppered Scurry with good-natured boos when she ended  
her speech by quipping, ``I have to scurry off and do some more 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on!'' she replied. ``That was a good one.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hamm did not speak, but clutched the World Cup trophy in her  
hands and occasionally snapped photos of the cheering crowd and the 
swarm of cameras and reporters behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Akers, removed from the game after suffering heat exhaustion,  
was still recovering Sunday and did not attend the victory events. 
Coach Tony DiCicco also missed the events, returning home to spend 
time with his family.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ventura Returns to the Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura wasn't saying Monday  
whether he would don his pink feather boa and return to the ring to 
wrestle or referee at next month's World Wrestling Federation 
``SummerSlam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Be there on Wednesday for the press conference and find out.  
Charities are going to do well,'' Ventura said after touring 
storm-damaged areas of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. 
</P>
<P>
	He and WWF officials confirmed a news conference Wednesday to  
discuss Ventura's ``return to the ring'' Aug. 22 at Target Center 
in Minneapolis. The ``SummerSlam'' event already is sold out but 
will be on pay-per-view for $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who turns 48 Thursday, hasn't wrestled since 1986.  
Back in his WWF days, Ventura wore a boa and played a bad guy known 
as ``The Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two top wrestling analysts said they expected Ventura would  
referee, mainly because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Meltzer of San Jose, Calif., who publishes the Wrestling  
Observer, one of the top weekly fan newspapers in the world, said 
wrestling was possible but not probable. ``He could wrestle, it's 
not inconceivable,'' Meltzer said. ``I would think refereeing would 
be the best for all concerned. You'd get the same amount of 
(publicity) for refereeing as the wrestling; It's just less of a 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He expected Ventura would referee the main event, likely  
featuring WWF superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin is among 
those expected to be at the news conference with Ventura and WWF 
Chairman Vince McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Keller of Bloomington, Minn., publishes the Pro Wrestling  
Torch and agreed with Meltzer's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's not a referee, the most he will do is be in a tag team  
where like most of his career, his partner does most of the work in 
the ring,'' Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both expected the paycheck to be big.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he would do it for less than huge money because  
I don't think he particularly loves those people. He wouldn't want 
to feel that he was being ripped off by wrestling at this stage of 
his life,'' Meltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura once successfully sued McMahon for $1 million for  
royalties off a wrestling tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I'd beaten him in court, he wasn't ever going to hire me  
again,'' Ventura wrote in his recent autobiography. ``It doesn't 
behoove promoters to have wrestlers who know what their rights 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meltzer and Keller said the show could gross more than $20  
million, with the WWF keeping about half, and a paycheck of $1 
million for Ventura was not out of the question. Mike Tyson claimed 
to make $3.5 million for refereeing a WWF championship match last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meltzer noted the WWF could use some good publicity.  
</P>
<P>
	In May, WWF wrestler Owen Hart died while performing a stunt at  
a Kansas City event. In June, champion Sable sued the WWF for $110 
million, complaining it wanted her to participate in a lesbian 
storyline, expose her breasts on TV and appear in sexually 
degrading photos. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dallas 7-year-old recently used a professional wrestling move  
on his 3-year-old brother and accidentally killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has often tried to distance himself from his wrestling  
past, saying he now wants to be called ``The Mind'' instead of 
``The Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's staff wouldn't answer questions on the WWF plans,  
saying the governor would take vacation time for the activities.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Stock Index Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Argentina's leading stock index  
plunged 8.7 percent on Monday as international investors left in 
droves amid worries over the country's still-feeble economic 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	The select Merval Index plunged as investors returned from a  
long holiday weekend to newspapers filled with worries about 
everything from debt payments and the recession to the course set 
by Economy Minister Roque Fernandez. The Merval dropped 43.07 
points to close at 453.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the broad General Index lost 1,140.48 points or 5.8  
percent to finish at 18,484.39. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all getting a little out of hand,'' said Marcelo Simini,  
a fund manager at local bank Merchant Bankers y Asociados SA. 
``Nothing actually happened to cause such a strong decline, but an 
accumulation of crises, rumors and unhelpful comments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the damage was blamed on damaging remarks by  
presidential hopefuls ahead of the October election. 
</P>
<P>
	Peronist presidential candidate Eduardo Duhalde said Sunday he  
would ask Pope John Paul II to mediate a one year moratorium on the 
country's debt if he is successful in the Oct. 24 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Duhalde last week worried investors when he called for  
significant injection of foreign aid to help Argentina kickstart 
its economy and pay off debt. His main opposition rival, Fernando 
de la Rua of the Alliance, asked for ``political consideration'' of 
the country's foreign debt in other recent comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Also unnerving foreign investors is speculation about how  
Fernandez and his team will handle some $220 million in debt owed 
by the PAMI state-run health care plan for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Though government officials have regularly soothed investors  
with messages of market stability and imminent economic growth, 
analysts said the underlying issue is Argentina's ongoing struggle 
to meet its 1999 fiscal targets set in tandem with the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a $2.8 billion agreement with the IMF, the government  
agreed to cap its 1999 budget deficit at the equivalent of $5.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A reduction in tax revenue due to a decline in imports and the  
contraction of the economy meant Argentina already has a five-month 
accumulated budget deficit of $2.85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miguel Kiguel, one of Argentina's undersecretaries for  
financial planning, said the debt is ``completely manageable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Argentina's favor is a windfall from the recent sale of the  
government's stake in oil giant YPF to Spain's energy conglomerate 
Repsol, netting the treasury $842 million. It also reaped $1.2 
billion from the sale of wireless telephone licenses.

<HEADLINE> Fiat Marks Birthday With New Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURIN, Italy (AP) -- Looking ahead to a new century, Fiat SpA  
celebrated its centennial Monday by unveiling the new version of 
one of its most successful cars, while a top executive denied 
rumors that the Italian automaker was shopping for a merger 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive officer Paolo Cantarella said Fiat plans to produce 4  
million cars a year by the second half of the next decade, without 
a partnership with another automaker. Last year Fiat produced 2.66 
million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat has been the subject of extensive speculation that it wants  
to form an alliance or merger with another major automaker to 
better compete with larger players in the consolidating global auto 
industry. Fiat is the world's sixth-largest automaker in terms of 
production, just behind DaimlerChrysler AG and ahead of Nissan 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is Italy's largest industrial group, but Cantarella said  
Fiat plans to keep cars as its core business in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantarella said Fiat is finding new opportunities for growth in  
manufacturing parts and in targeting special product niches. He 
cited as an example the recently announced contract with Mitsubishi 
Motors Corp. to develop and build a four-wheel-drive sport utility 
vehicle in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe is Fiat's primary market, but officials say they want to  
boost production and sales in the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern 
Europe and South America. One part of that strategy is the New 
Punto subcompact unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat plans to produce 600,000 to 700,000 New Puntos a year at  
three Italian plants and plans to sell at least half outside Italy. 
It will be in most world markets by next year, except North 
America, where Fiat does not operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The car will go on sale in Europe in the fall in three- and  
five-door models. The lowest-priced version will cost about 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Testore, the chief executive of Fiat Auto, said Fiat  
expects total European sales to rise between 2 percent and 3 
percent this year, to more than 14 million units. He denied rumors 
that Fiat may sell one of its Polish plants to Ford Motor Co.

	Smith Leaves Republican Party  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire announced  
today he was leaving the Republican Party to become an independent, 
indicating he might seek the nomination of some other party in his 
bid for the White House. Smith characterized his decision as one of 
principles over party, chastising GOP lawmakers for forsaking the 
Republican platform. He decried leaders in his party ``who believe 
that electing people with an 'R' next to their name is more 
important than principle,'' Smith said on CNN's ``Larry King 
Live.''

	Flights Offered to Refugees in U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Refugees from Kosovo who found sanctuary in  
the United States will be offered free flights home from next week 
through next May, the State Department said today. Some 9,700 
ethnic Albanian refugees were flown to the United States last 
spring. About half went to live with relatives. And except for 78 
who remained in Fort Dix, N.J., the other half found other places 
to live in this country. Many of the refugees here are expected to 
take the United States up on the offer to go back to Kosovo through 
Macedonia, U.S. officials said, adding that younger refugees may be 
more inclined to remain here and start new lives.

	20,000 Protestants March in Belfast  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- More than 20,000 Protestants on  
Monday celebrated Northern Ireland's most hot-blooded holiday by 
parading near a hostile Catholic neighborhood. A huge police and 
army presence kept the event peaceful -- unlike the rioting that has 
plagued Northern Ireland over Protestant marches in the last three 
years. Each July 12, the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's major 
Protestant brotherhood, parades in commemoration of a 1690 victory 
over Irish Catholics.

	Iranian Cops Crack Down on Protests  
</P>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Riot police backed by  
helicopters broke up a demonstration of 1,000 people in Tehran on 
Monday, as hard-liners in the Iranian government lost patience on 
the fifth day of pro-democracy protests. The crackdown followed 
government warnings Sunday that unauthorized demonstrations would 
no longer be tolerated. The protests, which began Thursday, have 
shown the widening gulf between Iran's reformists, who support 
President Mohammad Khatami, and the hard-liners in government who 
oppose him.

	Survey: More Feel Distant From Gov't  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half of Americans say in a survey  
they feel distant and disconnected from government. Only those 65 
or older were inclined to feel a sense of connection. The survey 
was taken for the Council for Excellence in Government and released 
today. ``The disconnect is more prevalent among younger 
Americans,'' said Patricia McGinnis, council president. Voter 
turnout in the 1998 congressional elections was 36 percent, the 
lowest national turnout in more than 50 years.

	U.S. Sues Toyota Over Smog Control

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government accused Toyota today of putting  
faulty smog-control computers on 2.2 million 1996-1998 vehicles and 
sought to have the computers repaired and the company fined up to 
$58.5 billion. On behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against the 
automaker's U.S. subsidiary under the Clean Air Act in U.S. 
District Court. Toyota rejected a settlement offer last week that 
might have cost it $100 million in civil fines.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. repeated as Home Run Derby  
champion today, but Fenway Park was buzzing about Mark McGwire's 13 
home runs in the first round. McGwire's 13 homers off Tim Flannery 
broke the one-round record set by Cal Ripken in 1991 at Toronto's 
SkyDome. Big Mac's attack totaled 5,692 feet -- more than a mile -- 
and a lot more than he hit one mile up at Denver's Coors Field last 
July. Griffey hit 10 homers in the second round, including a 
460-foot shot to the back of the center-field triangle and an 
opposite-field drive over The Green Monster and into the screen.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Herbert M. Allison Jr., the heir-apparent for  
the top job at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. surprised Wall Street Monday by 
announcing his early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison, 55, president and chief operating officer, plans to  
leave the brokerage and investment bank by end of the month. 
Allison, who joined Merrill 28 years ago as an associate, was 
widely expected to succeed David Komansky, 60, chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company said it had no immediate plans to  
name a replacement for Allison. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in my life and career, I realize that this is an  
opportune time to make a change,'' Allison said in a statement. He 
could not be reached for additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill's recent push onto the Internet reportedly caused  
friction among top officials. Last month, Merrill Lynch unveiled an 
aggressive strategy to let its clients buy and sell stock over the 
Internet at prices competitive with Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison had sought a presence on the Internet over the protests  
of co-vice chairman John ``Launny'' Steffens, who oversees 
Merrill's 14,000 retail stockbrokers. Allison wanted to create an 
Internet group outside Steffens' control. But in the end, Steffens 
backed the Internet plans and insisted he spearhead the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big surprise,'' said James Hanbury, an analyst at Schroder &AMP;  
Co. He added, however, that he didn't think the loss of Allison 
would hurt Merrill going forward. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Merrill Lynch declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Allison's responsibilities will be divided between Steffens and  
co-vice chairman Stephen L. Hammerman. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Komansky said, ``Herb Allison has brought great  
intellectual energy, dedication and integrity to every stage of his 
career at Merrill Lynch. ... All of us understand and respect his 
decision and wish him every success and happiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allison was born in Pennsyvania in 1943 and earned an MBA from  
Stanford University in 1971. At Merrill Lynch, he spent much of his 
early years overseas, holding investment banking positions in 
Paris, Tehran, and London before moving into finance and human 
resources in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent three years as treasurer, then ran the human-resources  
department, before being promoted to chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison was put in charge of Merrill's investment-banking  
operations in 1993. Two years later, he was able to consolidate his 
authority over the firm's stock and bond underwriting and trading 
operations as well. 
</P>
<P>
	After several more promotions, he was named to his current post  
in April 1997. Last year, Allison was paid $7.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill is expected to release its second-quarter financial  
results Tuesday. Analysts expect the brokerage firm to earn $1.46 a 
share, up from a $1.31 in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after the market closed. Merrill's shares  
ended the day up 81 1/4 cents at $77.87 1/2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Network Apologizes to Astros Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Telemundo's chief executive apologized Monday to  
Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane for allegations by executives 
of its local affiliate that McLane made derogatory remarks about 
Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on my inquiry into the matter, and in reliance upon your  
representations to me ... I believe that you did not make any 
racially motivated comments to our station management,'' wrote 
Roland Hernandez, chief executive officer of Santa Monica, 
Calif.-based Telemundo Group Inc. ``Further, I believe you and the 
Houston Astros strongly support Hispanics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Camacho, general manager of KTMD-TV, and sales manager Rod  
Rodriguez alleged last month that McLane made belittling remarks 
about Hispanics. They said McLane made the comments to them before 
a dinner honoring him with the Houston Advertising Federation's 
Trailblazer Award for community service. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane was accused of saying that he does not market to the  
Hispanic community because it was a complicated game, that 
Hispanics do not read newspapers and that Hispanic fans do not like 
Astrodome food and buy cheap seats. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane cut short a vacation and returned to Houston when he  
heard the accusations and vehemently denied that he made any 
disrespectful remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	McLane said Monday he was relieved by the public apology.  
</P>
<P>
	``The untruthful accusations made by their Houston television  
station last month have caused great pain and anguish for me, my 
family and the Astros organization,'' McLane said. ``The story went 
worldwide in a number of minutes and severely damaged my 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having spent a lifetime honoring the values of integrity and  
honesty, this episode has been unsettling. Despite a rush to 
judgment by some, this action by Telemundo, hopefully, will help to 
speed the healing process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho and Rodriguez did not immediately reply to messages left  
by The Associated Press on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Camacho later backed off his allegations somewhat, issuing a  
June 11 statement: ``I find him to be an honorable man and a man of 
integrity. It is now clear that Mr. McLane is not biased or 
insensitive toward the Hispanic community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig defended McLane, dismissing the  
remarks by the TV executives as ``slander'' and said McLane has the 
``full support of everyone in baseball.''

<HEADLINE> MetLife Buys from St. Paul Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- In a move to strengthen its auto and home  
insurance businesses, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. will purchase 
the personal insurance operations from The St. Paul Cos. for about 
$600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will boost MetLife Auto &AMP; Home premiums to $2.7  
billion, vaulting the company from 20th to 12th in the personal 
property and casualty insurance industry, MetLife said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife Auto &AMP; Home, a subsidiary of the Warwick, R.I.-based  
MetLife, expects to more than double its independent agency 
distribution network through the acquisition, with the potential to 
add 3,000 independent agencies and brokers to its existing 2,700 
independent agents. 
</P>
<P>
	All 1,700 St. Paul employees directly involved in the personal  
insurance business will be transferred to MetLife Auto &AMP; Homes, 
said Douglas Leatherdale, chairman and chief executive of The St. 
Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the St. Paul company will cut 500 to 600 other  
employees to bring expenses in line with its smaller revenue base. 
Employees who lose their jobs will be given severance packages and 
help in finding other jobs, Leatherdale said. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Paul-based company employs about 13,500 workers,  
including 3,300 in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, subject to regulatory approval and other conditions,  
is expected to close in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street reacted favorably to the news, sending the St.  
Paul's shares up $1.12 1/2 to $30.25 Monday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Met Life is a mutual company, owned by its policyholders, and  
has no publicly traded stock.

<HEADLINE> Jockey Romero Ends Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARENCRO, La. (AP) -- Randy Romero's last night as a jockey was  
spent riding a 10-1 longshot to a rainy sixth-place finish at the 
southern Louisiana track where he won his first race in 1973, 
Evangeline Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to give something back to the people of Acadiana and  
Evangeline Downs,'' Romero said before Monday night's race. ``I 
think they deserve it. I just want it to be something a little 
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romero, almost as well-known for an injury-marred career as for  
his 4,294 wins and more than $74 million in purses, is beginning a 
new career as a jockey agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven friends who also started their riding careers at  
Evangeline came back to Louisiana to compete against him in the 
$30,000 Cradle of Jockeys Invitational. Awesome Explosion was his 
final mount at Evangeline Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other riders included Corey Lanerie, Shane Sellers. Marlon St.  
Julien, the rider Romero will represent as an agent, also was in 
the race, along with Mark Guidry, Ronald Ardoin, E.J. Perrodin and 
Ray Sibille. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Julien won the 5 1/2-furlong race in 1:39 aboard 7-2 choice  
Oscar Magic, followed by Gran's Halo with Sellers aboard. Majestic 
Colors showed under Lanerie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Romero won three Breeders' Cup races and set  
records at three separate tracks for most victories by a jockey in 
a single meet. Romero has also been the leading rider at 10 
different tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Romero has been one of racing's most frequently injured  
riders, suffering through countless spills, 23 operations, plus a 
series of skin grafts after a light bulb exploded in the jockey's 
``hot box'' at Oaklawn Park, setting the rubbing alcohol on his 
body on fire, nearly burning him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in 1990, Go for Wand broke down, throwing Romero during  
the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Belmont Park. He broke eight ribs and 
his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Other injuries followed before a brief retirement. After that,  
Romero passed the 4,000-win mark, one of only 27 riders to achieve 
that record. He stands 26th on the all-time win list.

<HEADLINE> Stars Martinez, Schilling To Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez of the hometown Boston Red Sox will  
start for the American League against Philadelphia's Curt Schilling 
in Tuesday night's All-Star game at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez leads the major leagues with 15 wins and a 2.10 ERA,  
and has 184 strikeouts in 132 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling is tied for second in the National Leagues in wins,  
going 13-4 with a 3.13 ERA and 133 strikeouts in 149 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	NL manager Bruce Bochy of the San Diego Padres said today his  
starting lineup will have Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin leading 
off, followed by Colorado's Larry Walker in right field, Chicago's 
Sammy Sosa in center field, St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire, 
Arizona third baseman Matt Williams, Houston's Jeff Bagwell at 
designated hitter, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza, Milwaukee 
outfielder Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona second baseman Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz is starting in place on San Diego's Tony Gwynn, still on  
the disabled list with a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy chose Schilling over Arizona's Randy Johnson, primarily  
because the Phillies ace last pitched on Friday, while Johnson 
worked Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Randy's numbers are not indicative of how he's  
thrown,'' Bochy said, referring to Johnson's 9-7 record. ``Curt has 
had a tremendous year. Their ERAs are close. I feel that with Curt, 
with the extra day's rest he was gettting, I could count on two 
innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL manager Joe Torre of the New York Yankees said his lineup  
will have Cleveland's Kenny Lofton leading off and playing left 
field, followed by Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, Seattle 
center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., Cleveland right fielder Manny 
Ramirez, Cleveland first baseman Jim Thome, Baltimore third baseman 
Cal Ripken Jr., Texas' Rafael Palmeiro at designated hitter, Texas 
catcher Ivan Rodriguez, and Cleveland second baseman Roberto 
Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro is starting in place of Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco, who  
had back surgery Sunday. Canseco, who leads the AL with 31 homers, 
one behind Sosa's major league-leading total, will be sidelined for 
at least six weeks.

<HEADLINE> New Car Buyers Go to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Consumers looking to buy a new vehicle are  
increasingly using the Internet to help in their search, a survey 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, the number or people using the Internet to  
help them shop has increased to 40 percent, up from 25 percent a 
year earlier, according to initial results of a J.D. Power and 
Associates survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that the number of purchasers who used an  
online buying service doubled in this year's first quarter, from 
12,500 a month nationwide to more than 25,000, said Chris Denove, 
consulting operations director for the research firm in Agoura 
Hills, Calif. The proportion of new-vehicle purchasers using the 
Internet increased from 1.1 percent a year ago to 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be amazed by the growth of automotive-related  
Internet usage,'' Denove said. ``The real key is that people are 
using the Internet to go deeper into the shopping process than ever 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denove said he expects to see continued growth in the use of  
online car-buying because it reduces haggling and makes purchasing 
easier. ``The car buyer who goes online for their purchase is an 
extremely aggressive shopper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another research firm, San Diego-based Strategic Vision,  
released similar figures Monday. It found that 35 percent of new 
vehicle buyers used the Internet to search for information, up from 
26 percent a year earlier. The figures were based on a survey of 
33,760 buyers last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate J.D. Power survey found Internet use by used-vehicle  
buyers also was significant. Among those who bought a used 1994 to 
1999 model in January, 26 percent used the Internet to help find a 
vehicle and make a decision. This was the first year J.D. Power 
surveyed Internet usage by used-vehicle buyers, but Denove 
estimated that it was up from about 14 percent the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, I believe the Internet will have more impact on  
the way people shop for used vehicles than it will on the way they 
shop for new vehicles,'' Denove said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the used-vehicle buyer is more focused on finding  
a specific model from a more diffuse inventory that includes 
new-car dealers, used-car lots, auctions and private sellers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers and other traditional classified advertising media  
face a threat as more used-car buyers turn to the Internet to 
purchase their vehicle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implication is clear for newspapers,'' Denove said.  
``You'd better find a way to partner with online companies, 
otherwise you'll face considerable shrinkage of your customer 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That already is happening with such sites as cars.com, which has  
built an online database of vehicle classified ads from many 
newspapers. It's sponsored by several large newspaper chains. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power's new-vehicle survey was based on telephone  
interviews last spring with about 2,500 consumers who bought a new 
vehicle in January or February. The survey of used-vehicle shoppers 
involved nearly 10,000 mail-in responses from consumers who bought 
a used car or truck in the same months. 
</P>
<P>
	Full results of J.D. Power's used-vehicle study will be released  
later this month and for the new-vehicle survey in August.

<HEADLINE>  Three Jets Arraigned on Long Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Two New York Jets players and a former  
teammate arrested after a bar fight in Long Island face 
disciplinary action by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were arraigned today in Long Beach City Court and  
remained free on bail, the Nassau County district attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were scheduled to appear before Nassau County Judge Joseph  
Calabrese on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	John ``Jumbo'' Elliott, 34, and Jason Fabini, 24, of the Jets  
and Matt O'Dwyer, 26, of the Cincinnati Bengals were drinking at 
Bogart's Bar and Restaurant in Long Beach about 12:30 a.m. Saturday 
when they began acting up, police said. It took 31 officers to 
subdue the 300-pound football players, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a left tackle, was charged with misdemeanor assault,  
harassment and public lewdness. Police said he triggered the brawl 
by urinating in a sink in the women's bathroom in the bar and then 
punching two patrons, a woman and a male volunteer firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabini, one of the Jets' top rookies last year, was charged with  
disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, who signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with  
Cincinnati three weeks ago, faces the most serious charges: felony 
assault, harassment and criminal mischief. Police said he kicked 
out the window of a patrol car, sending shattered glass into the 
faces of two officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were treated for scratches to their corneas.  
</P>
<P>
	The players could be ordered to get counseling and could face  
fines or suspensions if found guilty, NFL officials said. NFL rules 
say that players charged with crimes involving violence or alcohol 
can be ordered to enroll in anger management programs and alcohol 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The players posted cash bail -- Fabini $100, Elliott $10,000 and  
O'Dwyer $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott pleaded guilty last year to driving while impaired. He  
was fined $350, his driver's license was suspended for 90 days, and 
he had to undergo counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL officials refused to comment on the arrests. Officials for  
the Jets and Bengals said the players were expected at training 
camps later this month.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Receiver Has Thumb Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky wide receiver Jimmy Robinson,  
injured when gunfire broke out at an off-campus party over the 
weekend, underwent surgery on his left thumb Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was shot twice in the incident, which occurred after a  
group of people crashed a party at the swimming pool of the 
University Commons apartment complex and fighting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, the only person shot, was hit in his upper left arm  
and at the base of his thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the school's athletics department said Robinson  
was operated on by Dr. Phil Blazar of the UK Hospital. Pins were 
used to repair the fracture at the base of Robinson's thumb. 
According to Blazar, the surgery was successful and the pins should 
be removed in about five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's upper arm was placed in a cast and is not expected to  
require surgery. The fractured humerus is expected to require three 
to four months to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was in fair condition and was being kept overnight at  
UK Hospital for observation. His playing status will depend on how 
quickly he heals, the school said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, of Stone Mountain, Ga., played the last two seasons  
for Kentucky after transferring from Georgia Military College in 
1997. Last season, he caught 26 passes for 285 yards and two 
touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Scurry Admits Breaking Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry admits she may  
have bent the rules in making the lunging save on a penalty kick 
that helped her teammates beat China for the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody does it,'' Scurry told the Los Angeles Times. ``It's  
only cheating if you get caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After China and the United States made their first two penalty  
kicks, Scurry took a few steps forward before Liu Ying struck the 
ball. That gave Scurry the angle she needed to dive to her left and 
block the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the only penalty kick missed in Saturday's championship  
game at the Rose Bowl, and that was enough to give the United 
States the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, a goalkeeper can move only laterally along the goal  
line before a penalty kick is attempted, but that's the strictest 
interpretation of the rules. Virtually all goalies inch forward, 
and such a violation is rarely called. 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry did not return a phone message left at her hotel in New  
York, and no one was reachable at the U.S. Soccer Federation in 
Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Future Fenway on the Horizon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Baseball's edifice complex looms large over  
Tuesday's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrecking ball won't bash into Fenway Park minutes after the  
final out. The Red Sox just make it seem that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans were crying out for a new ballpark,'' Red Sox chief  
executive officer John Harrington said in his office Monday as 
players started coming onto the field for the All-Star workout. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Green on the Monster in left field won't pay for it. Tax  
money will be needed, the amount undetermined. Unlike Fenway, a 
one-deck anachronism with 33,817 seats that opened in 1912, the 
replacement will have three decks, a 45,000 capacity, 100 luxury 
suites and 5,500 club seats. 
</P>
<P>
	At a total cost of $545 million in 2001 dollars, the Red Sox  
envision the new ballpark opening in 2003, with home plate moving 
618 feet southwest of its present location, the field relocating 
onto land currently occupied by 24 businesses that will have to be 
bought out. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything on the field will remain virtually the same, from the  
Green Monster with its 37-foot wall in left, to Pesky's Pole in 
right, which will move back 5 feet to 307 for architectural 
reasons. The Triangle in the center-field bleachers will be 
reconfigured into a two-deck arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way for this team to generate the revenue that they  
have to do to be successful is with a new ballpark,'' commissioner 
Bud Selig said later in the afternoon during a news conference 
beneath the grandstand, repeating a pitch he's made in several 
cities across the country in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Toronto's SkyDome opened in 1989, teams have looked at new  
ballparks like Xanadu, the palatial estate in ``Citizen Kane.'' 
Already open for business are Chicago's Comiskey Park (1991), 
Baltimore's Camden Yards ('92), Cleveland's Jacobs Field ('94), 
Arlington's The Ballpark (also '94), Denver's Coors Field ('95), 
Atlanta's Turner Field ('97) and Phoenix's Bank One Ballpark ('98). 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle's Safeco Field, at $517 million the most expensive  
ballpark ever built, opens Thursday. Next year will see four more: 
Detroit's Comerica Park, Houston's Enron Field, Milwaukee's Miller 
Park and San Francisco's Pac Bell Park. 
</P>
<P>
	But change here is more traumatic. Fenway and the Cubs' Wrigley  
Field are the twin temples of ballparks, tied up with history, 
emotion and human resistance to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Camden inspired many other teams to move forward on new  
classic ballparks,'' Harrington said. ``Now we're embracing what 
they're doing in many ways, and we all realize we need an 
additional million fans in our ballpark to remain competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball has been abuzz in recent weeks with news that Safeco  
Field went $100 million over budget. The Mariners used an architect 
who had never built a baseball park, and the team may be 
responsible for the overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	While some owners criticized them a few years ago for not going  
after public money, the San Francisco Giants apparently are now the 
model. Pac Bell will cost $325 million and will open on time and on 
budget in April, Giants executive vice president Larry Baer said 
Monday. The team paid for all but $15 million, the amount of a tax 
break the Giants were given. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants raised $140 million by selling naming rights, seat  
licenses, advertising, concession rights and sponsorships. The rest 
came from a $170 million loan from Chase Manhattan, a deal the bank 
later resold to 10 insurance companies. At an interest rate of 
about 8 percent, the Giants will be paying off the loan for the 
next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, San Francisco has sold 25,000 season tickets for next  
year. The Giants anticipate selling out all 41,000 seats for every 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking at that model, Harrington said there's no question there  
will be a new ballpark. The only debates are what percentage will 
be paid by the team and when the new Fenway will open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably have one of the largest private investments  
in this ballpark than any other ballpark that has been built,'' 
Harrington said. ``It will be very close to San Francisco, if not 
exceeding it.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lamb Tariffs Prompt Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Australian Prime Minister John Howard  
complained to President Clinton on Monday about punitive U.S. 
tariffs on foreign lamb but said the dispute should not be allowed 
to mar relations between the United States and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very disappointed and upset and cranky about the U.S.  
lamb decision,'' the prime minister said after a White House 
luncheon with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	After one rounds of questions from reporters, Howard said at a  
brief evening news conference that he was ``lambed out'' on the 
issue and would have no more comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard paused to talk with reporters outside the White House.  
Standing under an umbrella in the rain, he said he told Clinton the 
lamb decision triggered perhaps the biggest trade row ever in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're upset at the decision, but it's not going to be  
changed,'' Howard said. ``I understand that. Doesn't make it any 
easier for us. We don't agree with the decision. Equally we can't 
allow it to contaminate a broader relationship -- certainly not the 
security aspects of that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tariffs are intended to protect American lamb producers  
threatened by imports from New Zealand and Australia, which between 
them account for 95 percent of the lamb imported into the United 
States. American ranchers had complained that current tariffs of 
less than 1 percent were too low to protect them from foreign 
competitors flooding the U.S. market with exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new tariffs, a border tax of 9 percent will be imposed on  
the first 31,851 metric tons, the amount of lamb imported last 
year. Shipments above that will carry a 40 percent tariff. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said the tariffs ``caused the most adverse reaction of  
any trade decision the United States has taken in recent times. I 
can't think of one that's caused a more adverse reaction in 
Australia. I told the president that. I told those who were at the 
lunch that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, that doesn't mean that you allow it to contaminate other  
aspects of a very broad and a very deep relationship,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said he and Clinton spent much of their time discussing  
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indonesia deserved from the world perhaps a little more credit  
and a little more praise and understanding for the transition that 
was occurring in that country towards a more democratic system of 
government,'' Howard said, relating what he told Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain very strongly committed to a clean and open ballot  
in East Timor to determine the fate of that territory, '' Howard 
said, but he added that ``it's important to keep things in 
proportion''. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing Clinton, Howard met with Barry McCaffrey, White  
House director for drug policy, to discuss a commitment to a 
drug-free Olympics in Sydney next year and ways to stop drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House played down the lamb tariff dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton spoke with  
Howard and New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley before 
announcing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I think they understand our view,'' Lockhart said. He said  
the International Trade Commission on lamb supported Clinton's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that despite the dispute, ``We have a very strong  
and broad-based relationship with Australia. And I don't expect 
this particular trade dispute to sour that relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``From time to time we have trade issues with allies around the  
world and try to resolve them in the best way we can,'' Lockhart 
said. ``But this is a very strong relationship that certainly can 
be sustained despite disputes that arise from time to time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing Clinton, Howard met with Barry McCaffrey, White  
House director for drug policy to discuss a commitment to a 
drug-free Olympics in Sydney next year and ways to stop drug 
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Internal VA Report Details Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two employees of the Veterans Affairs  
Department embezzled $1.2 million during the past several years, 
according to an internal VA memo that blames the fraud on lax 
security and letting the same workers who process claims also 
authorize payments. 
</P>
<P>
	VA Inspector General Richard Griffin wrote the 37-page report  
June 17 after he investigated how the employees pocketed government 
money by setting up fake veterans benefit claims. His report, 
obtained by The Associated Press Monday, says the VA is reviewing 
its program that sends payments to 2.7 million poor and disabled 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin's memo details how a supervisory claims examiner in the  
VA's regional office in St. Petersburg, Fla., was arrested in 
January for stealing $615,451 in benefits. The woman, identified in 
previous news stories as Joy Cheri Brown, made fake disability 
claims in the name of her fiance, a police officer who was unaware 
of the scam. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo also describes how a former employee at the VA's New  
York regional office, who was not identified, received more than 
$620,000 in benefits over a 12-year period. The fraud was uncovered 
last year when the man, who worked for the VA in 1986 and 1987, was 
arrested on drug charges in New Jersey and authorities found an 
identification card bearing the name of a fictitious veteran. At 
the time, the man was receiving $5,011 in benefits every month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can report that the perpetrators of the thefts have pleaded  
guilty, and sentencing is pending,'' Griffin wrote. ``We are 
exploring techniques to proactively look for ongoing -- but as yet 
undiscovered -- frauds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The VA inspector general's memo lists 18 weaknesses, including  
loose computer security and infrequent reviews of long-running 
claims, that could lead to fraud and theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken McKinnon, a spokesman for the VA, said officials were not  
available to comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the VA has proposed adding 440 claims processors at  
regional offices where government cutbacks have led to a 20 percent 
reduction in staffing during the past few years. He also said the 
VA has been working on ways to tighten computer security in the 
regional offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Budahn, a spokesman for the American Legion, said it's  
unclear whether VA fraud is widespread. ``There has been a failure 
of accountability,'' Budahn said. ``We don't know if this is the 
tip of the iceberg, or the iceberg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said most veterans who get VA benefits receive a monthly  
check for several hundred not several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The warning bells should have been ringing very loudly in  
these two cases,'' Budahn said. ``To get to $5,000 (a month) it 
takes the most extreme sorts of injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 2.7 million veterans receive disability compensation or  
pension payments from the VA. Some 628,180 widows, children and 
parents of deceased veterans are paid survivor compensation or 
death pension benefits. VA disability and death compensation and 
pension payments are expected to cost more than $21.8 billion this 
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Blasts Presidential Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) -- Steve Forbes blasted Republican  
presidential rivals who ``stand for nothing'' as he opened a noisy 
bus caravan today aimed at toning his organizational muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that you can go through a campaign and just not say  
anything is not going to work,'' Forbes said in setting the theme 
for his swing. ``You need a message to win. You have to have that 
principled message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly expanded that theme today, blaming a sagging farm  
economy on ``the high priests of high finances'' that he's uniquely 
qualified to confront. 
</P>
<P>
	Those high priests, he said, sit on the Federal Reserve. He said  
the Fed's tight money policy had contributed to farmers' financial 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only candidate who knows enough to challenge them,''  
said Forbes, a multimillionaire. ``There's no way they're going to 
intimidate or bully me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is touchy in Iowa because farm commodity prices are at  
historic lows, though most of the economy is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	In his latest swing through the state where precinct caucuses  
launch the nominating season, Forbes was crisscrossing Iowa in a 
pair of brightly festooned buses with music blaring from speakers 
on the roof, stopping in small towns to mingle with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	At his first stop today, about 150 people cheered Forbes at a  
breakfast meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus caravan was yet another sign that Forbes is approaching  
this campaign differently than the one he ran in 1996, when he 
relied almost exclusively on an expensive television ad effort. 
This time Forbes has hired talented organizers and spent time 
seeking to build a grass-roots organization one voter at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was the latest to take aim at Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
criticized by most of his rivals for the GOP presidential 
nomination as being vague on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get the message to the people and there's no  
substitute for doing it one on one,'' the magazine publisher said. 
``You have to ask people for their support and that's how you build 
it. There's just no shortcut and you have to work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls have shown Bush with a solid lead among Republicans,  
and running ahead of Vice President Al Gore, leading some 
Republicans to his camp because they believe he is the one 
candidate who can win back the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes rejected that argument.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tempting at a time like this to give in to the siren  
calls of 'we must win this election,''' said Forbes. ``In the eyes 
of some that means stand for nothing, or keep it as vague as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reporters later asked Forbes if that was directed at Bush,  
he noted that he has challenged Bush to debates and pointed to 
historical comparisons about the upcoming GOP convention in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last Republican convention in Philadelphia was 1948 when  
they nominated a governor from a big state who was ahead in the 
polls and looked like a sure winner,'' said Forbes. ``The man's 
name was Tom Dewey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coupled with the advertising, Forbes' bus swing was aimed at  
assembling support for a high-profile straw poll next month that 
has taken on significance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's designed to energize our people,'' said consultant John  
Maxwell. ``The advertising is a complement to the ground game and 
not a replacement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides were focusing on that organizational effort as  
the swing opened, passing out pledge cards, promising $25 tickets 
to the straw poll and buses to bring backers to the event.

<HEADLINE> Univ. of Ga. Scolded Over Admissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed a white man's claim  
that he was rejected from the University of Georgia because of his 
race, but the judge also lambasted the school for using race as a 
factor in its admissions policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge B. Avant Edenfield said the student's academic record was  
not good enough to justify his admission to the school, regardless 
of race. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the judge sharply criticized the university, saying the  
school ``cannot constitutionally justify the affirmative use of 
race in its admission decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The record shows, quite simply, that ... UGA prefers one  
applicant over another based solely on race,'' Edenfield, of the 
U.S. District Court in Savannah, wrote in his July 6 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The student's suit, filed in 1997, said the university illegally  
uses racial quotas. Although his client's claim of discrimination 
was thrown out, attorney Lee Parks said Monday that he was 
encouraged by Edenfield's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball is now in the university's court,'' he said. ``Are  
they going to continue this program in the face of this ruling or 
not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parks said he would consider another suit if the university does  
not change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, UGA's minimum grade-point average and SAT score  
required for blacks was lower than the criteria for whites. Worried 
about the constitutionality of the admissions policy, the 
university started using the current policy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy uses the same academic standards for all students.  
However, borderline applicants, who make up about 25 percent of 
freshman admissions, get extra points for being minorities, as do 
applicants whose parents are alumni or who live in rural or poor 
areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Edenfield described the policy as ``race counting -- where  
nonwhite applicants literally are awarded `racial bonus points.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``UGA officials evidently employed racial preferences  
first and asked questions later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University officials justified the system as a way to diversify  
the campus, where blacks make up 6.2 percent of the student body. 
The state population is 28.4 percent black. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our state's future economy depends on the University System of  
Georgia being accessible to all qualified Georgians, so we will 
continue to work ... to explore all of the options that will enable 
UGA to have an inclusive student body,'' Chancellor Stephen Portch 
said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Painting Looted by Nazis Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A painting by an obscure but respected German  
artist was returned to its Jewish owners on Monday, 60 years after 
it was stolen by the Nazis and wound up in a museum in Adolf 
Hitler's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Officals of the state Holocaust Claims Office turned over ``The  
Seamstress'' to Michael Loewenthal, whose grandfather, art 
collector Louis Loewenthal, lost everything when he fled Berlin at 
the outset of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	A pro-Nazi art dealer falsely claimed years later that ``The  
Seamstress'' had been destroyed in an Allied air raid. After the 
war, he sold it to the municipal museum in Linz, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council in Linz voted recently to give the painting to  
Loewenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough decision, but a very brave one,'' said  
Loewenthal, who lives in Franklin Lakes, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil painting is by Lesser Ury, who lived in a tiny Berlin  
garret in the 1930s. While Ury was regarded in his time as a master 
of pastels, ``The Seamstress'' depicts its subject in mostly dark 
colors, highlighted by sun through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewenthal, who was born in Israel and raised in New York City,  
asked the Holocaust claims office about the painting months ago, 
after learning it had been in the Linz museum since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holocaust office said the painting was part of a collection  
confiscated by the Nazis from Louis Loewenthal in 1939-40 and 
``acquired'' by Berlin art dealer Wolfgang Gurlitt. Gurlitt later 
played a key role in Nazi efforts to sell ``degenerate art'' -- 
works by Jews -- abroad and set up a ``Fuhrermuseum'' in Linz, 
Hitler's boyhood home. 
</P>
<P>
	When Louis Loewenthal's son Fritz asked Gurlitt in 1950 to  
either make a supplementary payment for his father's art or return 
it, Gurlitt insisted the paintings had been destroyed in a 1943 air 
raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gurlitt survived the war and moved to Linz, where he eventually  
sold more than 160 paintings, including ``The Seamstress,'' to the 
Linz museum. It hung there from 1956 until a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewenthal declined to estimate the painting's monetary worth,  
saying its value to his family was sentimental and he planned to 
give it to a museum of Judaica for display.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Already Planning Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHAMPTON, England (AP) -- Michael Schumacher is already  
planning his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	His leg broken in two places and his bid for this season's  
Formula One championship erased after a high-speed crash in the 
British Grand Prix, Schumacher said Monday he expects to return to 
racing this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old German was lucky to survive a head-on crash into  
a wall about 30 seconds into Sunday's GP. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons at nearby Northampton General Hospital had to insert a  
steel plate into his right leg to repair his broken tibia and 
fibula. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm lucky to be alive,'' Schumacher said from his hospital  
bed. ``I know I'm going to be out of action for two to three months 
and I realize that I have absolutely no chance of the championship 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm confident I'll be back driving a Ferrari in Formula  
One before the end of the season. I'm not depressed. I'm feeling 
positive and I'm looking forward even now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher admitted he feared for his life as his car, traveling  
at between 120 mph to 180 mph, veered into the tire-wall. He said 
safety precautions in F1 racing had saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thankful for the improvements made in the cars over the  
last few years because that is what has helped me escape with only 
a broken leg,'' he said. ``It was a very scary moment because it 
was the first time it has ever happened to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bouquets of flowers were sent to the hospital Monday  
by well wishers, while Schumacher received visits from other 
drivers, including Damon Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was to spend a second night at the hospital before  
returning to his home in Switzerland on Tuesday with his wife, 
Corinna. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari, meanwhile, continued investigations into what caused  
the crash. Particular attention focused on the rear brakes, which 
appeared to lock prior to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Mosley, president of auto racing's world governing body FIA,  
said Schumacher was only saved from serious injury or death by 
safety precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials and surgeons declined to estimate how long  
Schumacher would be out of action. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Northampton General Hospital chief executive David  
Wilson said: ``I think surgeons would normally say 12 to 16 weeks 
for a normal everyday person like you or me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early estimates from F1 medical delegate Syd Watkins said he'd  
be out of action for six weeks in a period which includes upcoming 
races in Austria, Germany and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the case, Schumacher's bid for his third World Drivers'  
Championship looks in doubt, as does his bid to bring Ferrari its 
first drivers' title in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's race, the eighth of the season, Schumacher shares  
second place in the standings with Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine on 
32 points. McLaren's Mika Hakkinen leads with 40 points.

<HEADLINE> Schilling To Start All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Curt Schilling's latest triumph was yet  
another tough loss for Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling was selected Sunday to start for the National League  
in the All-Star game, The Associated Press learned. A baseball 
source confirmed that Schilling, the Philadelphia Phillies' ace, 
was chosen by NL manager Bruce Bochy to start over Johnson of the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who was familiar with the selection process,  
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy, the San Diego Padres manager, would only say he was  
leaning toward starting Schilling. Bochy will make the official 
announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be his first (All-Star game) start, and he started  
his career with the Boston organization,'' Bochy said. ``It's a 
tough call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling has 13 victories, one fewer than Kent Bottenfield of  
St. Louis. He is tied with Johnson for the major league lead with 
seven complete games and is second in the NL to Johnson in 
strikeouts. Schilling also declined to confirm that he was Bochy's 
choice -- although he was seen accepting congratulations in the 
clubhouse after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know who's starting,'' said Schilling, named to his third  
straight All-Star team. ``I've got a pretty good idea who will have 
the ball when the game starts. The manager is going to announce it 
tomorrow, and we'll all have fun talking about it tomorrow. It's 
not my job to announce it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just more than a week ago, Bochy was leaning toward starting  
Johnson on Tuesday at Fenway Park. But the Arizona left-hander, who 
is 9-7, has been victimized by his own offense. Arizona hasn't 
scored a run in the last 34 innings Johnson has been on the mound. 
Johnson is 0-4 in his last four starts despite allowing a total of 
five earned runs and striking out 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Pedro Martinez will start for the American League.  
</P>
<P>
	Schilling was selected to the All-Star team in 1997 and '98 and  
pitched two scoreless innings two years ago at Jacobs Field in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his career in the Red Sox organization, but was  
traded to Baltimore with Brady Anderson for Mike Boddicker in 1988. 
He was dealt to Houston with Pete Harnisch and Steve Finley for 
Glenn Davis in 1991, and then traded to Philadelphia for Jason 
Grimsley in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In another All-Star game development, Bochy was told by the NL  
office that Mark McGwire has to start at first base since he voted 
in by the fans. Bochy wanted to use McGwire as his DH, but instead 
will use Houston's Jeff Bagwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy's likely batting order will be Cincinnati's Barry Larkin,  
Colorado's Larry Walker, Chicago's Sammy Sosa, McGwire, Arizona's 
Matt Williams, Bagwell, Mike Piazza of the New York Mets, 
Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and Arizona's Jay Bell.

<HEADLINE> Credit Suisse Faces Losing License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Financial Supervisory Agency has decided to  
recommend revoking the banking license of a unit of Credit Suisse 
Group AG because it allegedly tried to block an investigation of 
its handling of derivatives products, according to reports Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports in several Japanese media said the FSA will seek the  
revocation of the license of Credit Suisse Financial Products, 
invoking article 27 of Japan's banking law, and will formally 
notify Credit Suisse Group executives of the findings of its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit Suisse will have the opportunity at a hearing to respond  
to the findings. Credit Suisse Group has declined to comment on the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA has reportedly concluded Credit Suisse Financial  
Products attempted to obstruct an examination launched by the 
watchdog agency on Jan. 20 by destroying documents and shipping 
others off to London. 
</P>
<P>
	The FSA also believes Credit Suisse Group violated firewall  
regulations on banking and securities operations, among other 
illegal actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The almost six-month investigation also covered three other  
group companies: Credit Suisse First Boston Tokyo branch, Credit 
Suisse Trust and Banking Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston 
Securities Japan Ltd.

<HEADLINE>  Green Monster Focus at Fenway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. wants a piece of the Green  
Monster. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the All-Star focus clearly on Fenway Park's famous  
left-field fixture, Junior has a plan for Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chip some paint off the wall, put it in a bag and take it  
home,'' Griffey said Monday. ``There's something I will take from 
this ballpark before I leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll let Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire try to clear the  
37-foot-high wall -- after all, he's hit only eight of his 379 
career shots at Fenway. Griffey still won Monday night's home run 
derby for the second year, overcoming a monstrous performance by 
Big Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey will let Ted Williams and Carlton Fisk look out toward  
the wall and reminisce -- they spent many years playing in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior just wants a keepsake.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a classic,'' the Seattle center fielder said. ``There are  
certain ballparks that have a lot of tradition behind them, and 
this is one of them. And before they tear it down, they've having 
an All-Star game here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a recent run in which many of the majors' newer stadiums  
got to play host, baseball returns to its roots for the final 
All-Star game of the 20th century. Fenway opened in 1912, the same 
week the Titanic sunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one old park I haven't played in,'' San Diego  
outfielder Tony Gwynn said. ``I saw what Wade Boggs used to do 
here. I'm looking forward to doing it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, tied with Boggs at 2,982 career hits, won't be able to  
help the National League try to extend its 40-28-1 edge. Hobbled by 
injuries, he'll sit out as Boston ace Pedro Martinez starts for the 
AL against Philadelphia's Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gwynn wanted to take batting practice Monday and maybe  
field a few balls off the wall. How excited was he about seeing 
Fenway? He had a book detailing the history of the ballpark in his 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	NL manager Bruce Bochy of the Padres was equally enthused.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been in Fenway. You step on the field, it's  
hallowed ground,'' he said. ``I hate to age Carlton, but I was a 
Reds fan and now I get to walk in there and see where it really 
went out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk's down-the-line, 12th-inning shot that won Game 6 of the  
1975 World Series remains one of baseball's most enduring images. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Green Monster, when you talk about it, everybody knows  
where the Green Monster is,'' said Fisk, the AL's honorary captain. 
``There are plans that they're going to build a brand new, 
old-fashioned ballpark. That doesn't cut off your memories and the 
stories that have taken place in the old ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who will throw out the ceremonial first ball, put on a  
one-man show in the 1946 All-Star game at Fenway. He hit two 
homers, including a drive off Rip Sewell's ``eephus'' pitch, in 
going 4-for-4 with five RBIs in a 12-0 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the 80-year-old Williams claimed he won't miss  
Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm not sentimental about it. I want to see a new ballpark  
where the seats are bigger,'' he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot of fans say, `Oh, geez, I wouldn't even think  
about going anyplace else.' It wasn't that great. The park is just 
an old park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a lot of history wrapped up in that wall.  
</P>
<P>
	At times, it was made of wood, brick, concrete and sheet metal.  
Now, the side facing the hitters is all tin and stretches about 240 
feet toward center field. 
</P>
<P>
	It became known as the Green Monster in 1947 when ads for  
Lifebuoy, Gem Blades and other products were covered up with green 
paint. There's also a thin ladder running to the top -- grounds crew 
members use it to retrieve balls that wind up in the 23-foot screen 
on top. 
</P>
<P>
	One other fact about the wall: The initials of former owner  
Thomas Austin Yawkey and his wife, Jean Remington Yawkey, appear on 
it in morse code. Easy to overlook, a series of dots and dashes for 
``T-A-Y'' and ``J-R-Y'' show up in the vertical white lines to the 
left of pitchers' numbers on the out-of-town scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Bradley of the Red Sox hit the first shot over the wall on  
April 26, 1912 -- ``Few of the fans who have been out to Fenway Park 
believed it was possible,'' the Boston Herald reported the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his first major league homer over the Monster off Roger  
Clemens in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me real proud of myself,'' the Chicago Cubs slugger  
said. ``After I did that, I knew I could play in the major 
leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit 18 home runs at Fenway, most of them to left. In the  
first round of Monday's derby, he hit 13 in 23 swings, including a 
drive off a light tower above the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocky Colavito connected for the AL in the 1961 All-Star game at  
Fenway, stopped by rain after nine innings for a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Marked at 310 feet down the line in left, many believe the wall  
isn't even that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's right on top of you,'' Anaheim reliever Troy Percival  
said. ``It's much too close for comfort when you're on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust ol' Ted Williams on this one.  
</P>
<P>
	``The wall's 290 feet,'' he said. ``When I first got there in  
left field, they had a rise out there to let you know you're 
getting near the fence. But that was taken out. 
</P>
<P>
	``But still I knew the wall was only 290 feet. And I had a good  
conception of how close I was,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hate Groups Targeted After Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- In the wake of three recent synagogue  
fires in the Sacramento area, authorities over the weekend 
questioned dozens of people believed to be members or followers of 
white supremacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials focused on the World Church of the Creator, an  
Illinois-based group linked to two men suspected in the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a way to let them know that we are aware of their  
presence and discourage their engaging in violent behavior,'' 
sheriff's Lt. John McGinness said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people cooperated during the voluntary meetings while  
others objected, McGinness said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came to my door and said, `Are you a member of the  
church?''' said Chris Evans, 19. ``And I said, `Hell, yes, I'm a 
member.' They asked for fingerprints, too, but I saw no reason to 
cooperate with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials are also providing protection to 32 prominent  
Jewish and civic leaders named on a list found among the belongings 
of Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers are in jail, suspected of killing a gay couple in  
nearby Happy Valley and taking part in the burning of three 
Sacramento-area synagogues. Authorities say among their possessions 
were handouts from the World Church of the Creator. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Hale, the leader of the World Church of the Creator,  
rejected any involvement with the brothers and said comments by 
investigators linking his group to crimes in California are part of 
a federal ``smear campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group is active in Sacramento and the Williams brothers  
could have picked up fliers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Church of the Creator has drawn a probe by the  
Illinois Department of Revenue, which suspects the group has broken 
the law by not paying sales tax on white supremacist books it 
printed and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Church of the Creator is not registered as a charity,  
a business or a religious organization in the state of Illinois.

<HEADLINE>  Sampras Defines Davis Cup Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pete Sampras may be ranked No. 3 in the world and  
he may have just played some the best tennis of his life in 
dispatching Andre Agassi in the Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
	But unless he has a dramatic change of heart, Sampras won't be  
playing singles for the United States in this weekend's Davis Cup 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras and his Davis Cup teammates were together for the first  
time Monday in preparation for the quarterfinal tie with Australia 
at Longwood Cricket Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a hot streak and entreaties from teammate Todd Martin,  
Sampras insisted that as a late arrival on a team that has earned a 
quarterfinal berth without him, his place is the doubles court with 
partner Alex O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I want to do is jump on the bandwagon,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only injuries to Jim Courier or Martin, the current singles duo,  
could make him reconsider, Sampras said.

	``Unless that happens, I don't think it's right,'' he said. ``I  
think those guys deserve to play singles. It's their show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Sampras refused to play the Davis Cup, a move  
derided by players such as Courier. But after watching a tape of 
the U.S. beating Great Britain in dramatic fashion during the first 
round in April, Sampras had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an inspiration to me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Knowing his about-face was a sensitive topic with his teammates,  
Sampras said he'd only play doubles when he announced his

<P>
	Since then, Martin has said he'd step aside if coach Tom  
Gullikson decided to insert Sampras in his singles spot. 
</P>
<P>

Tom I think we should have the best team on the court. If he thinks 
that I'm not part of that, that's fine with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, however, is not persuaded.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Todd's a nice enough guy to step aside,'' Sampras  
said. ``It's just not something I'm comfortable doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson said the team would meet this week to hash out  
Sampras' place on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to force him to play,'' Gullikson said. ``Unless  
the other four guys throw him onto the court, I don't think he'll 
play singles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier thinks that the U.S. team will be in good shape, no  
matter what's decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job is to put a competitive team on the court,'' he said.  
``I think either way, we'll have a competitive team.''

<HEADLINE>  Sampras Defines Davis Cup Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pete Sampras may be ranked No. 3 in the world and  
he may have just played some the best tennis of his life in 
dispatching Andre Agassi in the Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
	But unless he has a dramatic change of heart, Sampras won't be  
playing singles for the United States in this weekend's Davis Cup 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras and his Davis Cup teammates were together for the first  
time Monday in preparation for the quarterfinal tie with Australia 
at Longwood Cricket Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a hot streak and entreaties from teammate Todd Martin,  
Sampras insisted that as a late arrival on a team that has earned a 
quarterfinal berth without him, his place is the doubles court with 
partner Alex O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I want to do is jump on the bandwagon,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only injuries to Jim Courier or Martin, the current singles duo,  
could make him reconsider, Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless that happens, I don't think it's right,'' he said. ``I  
think those guys deserve to play singles. It's their show.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead, 4 Missing After Calif. Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOREST FALLS, Calif. (AP) -- Search dogs prowled mud and debris  
for more bodies on Monday after flash-flood waters 25 feet high 
swept homes, boulders and cars through a Southern California 
mountain hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked just like a movie out of Hollywood,'' said Tristan  
McDow, who helped rescue an elderly woman buried to her neck in mud 
for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of one woman was pulled from the ooze and four others  
were feared lost to the Sunday afternoon torrent that damaged or 
destroyed 15 homes, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Jack Fox 
said. Five people were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulldozers were snaking a path through the vacation community of  
3,500, but some residents still could not drive out of the area, 
which was awash in debris that included giant pine trees, wreckage 
of automobiles and propane tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all so quick,'' said Randy Thompson, 52, who was  
barbecuing ribs with friends when sunshine suddenly turned to rain, 
then hail. ``All of a sudden the house started trembling and the 
boulders starting coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Merryman watched in horror as floodwaters picked up houses  
and cars in a 60 mph rush past her vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
	When the waters receded, Mrs. Merryman and Thompson said there  
was an eerie whistling sound coming from across the street where a 
home once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Buried in debris under a couch was an elderly neighbor man they  
know only as Bill. Clutching two Chihuahuas, he was whistling in 
hopes someone would find him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter! My daughter!'' he pleaded as his neighbors  
carried him away from the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of his dead daughter was beneath him. His wife was  
airlifted to a hospital in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's storms also struck in Los Angeles County, where  
firefighters had to rescue about 100 hikers and picnickers stranded 
in Azusa Canyon, said Mark Whaling, a spokesman for the county Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The downpour, which dropped more than 1 1/2 inches in just 30  
minutes, was the latest devastation from a powerful flow of 
tropical moisture that has sent thunderheads towering over the 
Southwest for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted flash flood watches  
throughout Southern California on Monday. Urban and small stream 
flood advisories were also posted in southern Nevada.

<HEADLINE> New Car Buyers Go to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- More buyers are cruising the information highway  
in search of a car, according to a study released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of consumers who recently bought a car or truck  
used the Internet to help them shop, up from 25 percent a year ago, 
according to initial results of a J.D. Power and Associates survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that the number of purchasers who used an  
online buying service doubled in this year's first quarter, from 
12,500 a month nationwide to more than 25,000, said Chris Denove, 
consulting operations director for the research firm in Agoura 
Hills, Calif. The proportion of new-vehicle purchasers using the 
Internet increased from 1.1 percent a year ago to 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be amazed by the growth of automotive-related  
Internet usage,'' Denove said. ``The real key is that people are 
using the Internet to go deeper into the shopping process than ever 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denove said he expects to see continued growth in the use of  
online car-buying because it reduces haggling and makes purchasing 
easier. ``The car buyer who goes online for their purchase is an 
extremely aggressive shopper,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another research firm, San Diego-based Strategic Vision,  
released similar figures Monday. It found that 35 percent of new 
vehicle buyers used the Internet to search for information, up from 
26 percent a year earlier. The figures were based on a survey of 
33,760 buyers last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate J.D. Power survey found Internet use by used-vehicle  
buyers also was significant. Among those who bought a used 1994 to 
1999 model in January, 26 percent used the Internet to help find a 
vehicle and make a decision. This was the first year J.D. Power 
surveyed Internet usage by used-vehicle buyers, but Denove 
estimated that it was up from about 14 percent the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, I believe the Internet will have more impact on  
the way people shop for used vehicles than it will on the way they 
shop for new vehicles,'' Denove said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the used-vehicle buyer is more focused on finding  
a specific model from a more diffuse inventory that includes 
new-car dealers, used-car lots, auctions and private sellers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers and other traditional classified advertising media  
face a threat as more used-car buyers turn to the Internet to 
purchase their vehicle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implication is clear for newspapers,'' Denove said.  
``You'd better find a way to partner with online companies, 
otherwise you'll face considerable shrinkage of your customer 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That already is happening with such sites as cars.com, which has  
built an online database of vehicle classified ads from many 
newspapers. It's sponsored by several large newspaper chains. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power's new-vehicle survey was based on telephone  
interviews last spring with about 2,500 consumers who bought a new 
vehicle in January or February. The survey of used-vehicle shoppers 
involved nearly 10,000 mail-in responses from consumers who bought 
a used car or truck in the same months. 
</P>
<P>
	Full results of J.D. Power's used-vehicle study will be released  
later this month and for the new-vehicle survey in August.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders $100M for Heat Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton directed the Department of  
Health and Human Services on Monday to release $100 million in 
emergency funds for 17 states that experienced the recent heat 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from the Low-income Home Energy Assistance  
Program and is directed at providing relief for eligible families 
and individuals. States -- from New England to the mid-Atlantic and 
in the Midwest -- can use the money to pay cooling bills and buy air 
conditioners for low-income households. 
</P>
<P>
	``These resources will help protect the most vulnerable among us  
as the current heat wave runs its course,'' Clinton said in a 
statement, noting that soaring temperatures in the past weeks have 
claimed the lives of more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds were allocated to the states most affected by the  
extreme heat and the number of low-income households in the state. 
Of the $100 million, $690,380 will go directly to 15 American 
Indian tribes in Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New 
York, North Carolina and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of funds for each state:

<HEADLINE> Rob Tallas Re-Signed by Bruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Bruins re-signed goaltender Rob Tallas  
to a one-year contract, the team announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Tallas, 26, was 7-7-2 with 2.61 goals-against-average in 17  
games last season as Byron Dafoe's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallas came to the Bruins in 1994 on a tryout basis at training  
camp. Signed by the team as a free agent in 1995, he split his next 
three seasons between Boston and its American Hockey League 
affiliate in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallas has a career record of 22-22-6 and a 2.71  
goals-against-average. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's proven to be a solid goaltender in this league and has  
performed well in his role for the Bruins over the past several 
seasons,'' Bruins vice president of operations Mike O'Connell said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Savors Cycling Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METZ, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong can't explain it.  
</P>
<P>
	How can someone recover so swiftly from an aggressive case of  
testicular cancer that spread first to his lungs, making him cough 
up ``buckets'' of blood, and then to his brain? 
</P>
<P>
	But the 27-year-old from Austin, Texas, is here, and he is  
riding better than ever. And at the moment, he's winning the Tour 
de France, the most prestigious cycling race in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no secrets,'' Armstrong said Monday, sitting on the  
edge of a bed in a team official's hotel room. The day before, he 
crushed the field in a grueling time trial to recapture the yellow 
jersey and become a decisive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sick as a kid could be. It was one of the worst cases my  
doctors had ever seen -- and they were the best,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Armstrong said, he feels better than ever. Asked if he  
really means it, he leans forward for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can prove it,'' he says, ``With my results. With my  
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Armstrong is smaller and lighter than before,  
perhaps one benefit of his ordeal. But there's something that's 
changed him mentally, too -- some call it a calmness, a more 
thoughtful attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong will only say this: ``The mind is an amazing thing.''  
</P>
<P>
	He won the 1993 World Championship, competed for the U.S.  
Olympic team in 1992 and 1996 and had signed a two-year contract 
with the French team Cofidis when he started feeling sick in 
October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt some soreness and started coughing up blood. ``This  
wasn't drops -- this was buckets,'' he said. And then came the 
headaches, the blurry vision, the flu-like symptoms, the dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	He thought he was going to die. ``I was scared when they first  
told me. Of course, they told me it was 95 percent curable, but 
that's when they catch it early. I knew I had a more advanced 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had surgery to remove his right testicle and brain  
lesions, then underwent three months of chemotherapy. He was out 
for the 1997 season and began his comeback last May. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy. People had forgotten him - fans and, more  
painfully, the European teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understood the thing with the fans,'' Armstrong said.  
``Frankly, I don't really like the spotlight, the constant 
autographs. I prefer a quieter life. So that was OK. But the thing 
with the teams - that was a surprise. A total shock. And I haven't 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a list of teams that didn't give me chance, and I have  
not forgotten,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially his own team, Cofidis. ``At the time of my  
announcement, while the world was listening, they pledged their 
support, the PR way. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then they came over to see how sick I was. They saw me as  
sick as a dog, not able to get up from my bed, vomiting. I thought, 
oh, that's nice, they've come to see me. And then an hour later my 
agent comes in and tells me, well ...'' They paid him 25 percent of 
his contract, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't even at his lowest point when Cofidis saw him.  
</P>
<P>
	``The third and fourth rounds were worse,'' he said, referring  
to the chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	When Armstrong began the Tour this year, wearing the  
red-white-and-blue of the U.S. Postal Service team, there were 
doubts about his fitness. But everything changed when he won the 
race prologue, also a time trial, and donned the yellow jersey for 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, Armstrong was a favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first week of flat stages, he stayed toward the front of  
the pack and out of trouble, letting the sprinters have their 
moment. He knew his would come during Sunday's time trial, when 
racing is at its purest: just the rider and the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Positive thinking aside, he had no doubt he would win that day.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was logical,'' he said. ``Nothing had changed since the  
prologue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race hits the Alps on Tuesday, where Armstrong will have to  
prove he can climb with the best of them. He'll need to depend more 
on strategy, and on the help of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Needless to say, he is confident.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before coming in, we all thought I would climb better than I  
would time trial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's true, Armstrong could be wearing yellow all the way to  
the Champs-Elysees. And an American team could claim the most 
European of races. Greg LeMond did it three times, but not with an 
American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be like a French team winning the Super Bowl,''  
said Mark Gorski, general manager of U.S. Postal. ``It's that 
big.''

<HEADLINE> GM Victims To Donate Half of Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Six people badly burned in a car crash say  
they want to turn their $4.9 billion judgment against General 
Motors Corp. into a windfall for other burn victims and the 
hospitals that treat them. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Anderson said Monday that she, her four children and  
family friend Jo Tigner want nearly half of the award to be used to 
build new hospital burn centers or expand those already operating. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Ms. Anderson the decision was based on her  
anguished struggle to get help for her children after they were 
burned, along with her and Ms. Tigner, in a fiery crash on 
Christmas Eve 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday awarded the family $107 million in compensatory  
damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages -- the largest amount 
ever awarded in a defective product case, legal experts have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the punitive damages would be donated to the state of  
California to help build new burn centers or expand those already 
in operation, Ms. Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this never happens to anyone else, but we want to help  
others get better medical care if it does,'' Ms. Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys in the case also have agreed to donate the portion of  
their fees that would come from punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts expect courts to reduce the award.  
</P>
<P>
	If it were to stand, the verdict could have a serious impact on  
General Motors. The amount exceeds GM's profits of $3.1 billion in 
all of 1998, a year in which earnings were hurt by strikes. In 
1997, the company earned $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you look at a $5 billion damage award you have to see  
if the award is reduced and how long will the appeal take,'' said 
Steve Garrity, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, Ms. Tigner and the children were on their way to a  
candy store after attending a Christmas Eve church service when 
their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu was rearended and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn centers were already crowded on the busy holiday night, so  
the six victims were taken to five different hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors at four of the hospitals would not treat the  
children without Ms. Anderson's signature, she said in a telephone 
interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With her head swollen and her hands wrapped mummy-like in  
bandages, she left the emergency room less than two hours after 
arriving and traveled to each of the four hospitals to sign forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said she has no complaint about the quality of care  
her friend and family received, but she doesn't want other families 
to face a similar ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awful. No one was able to sign a release for my kids to  
be treated. I had to check myself out. I went home to get the 
(insurance) cards and had to go to the hospitals to sign for the 
kids,'' she said. ``I didn't really think about it. I just did 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said she also wants some of the money to go to the  
Ronald McDonald Foundation. She stayed at the Ronald McDonald House 
near a Fresno hospital where two of her children were transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	The four children face additional surgery and other treatments.  
Alisha, 11, has trouble moving one arm because of scar tissue 
around the elbow, and Ty-Shon, 6, has limited movement of his ankle 
and foot because of scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	When times are rough, she tells her children they are beautiful  
despite their scars. 
</P>
<P>
	Faith helps them get by, she said. ``Just prayer, basically,  
just getting strength from the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 10-week trial, attorneys argued that GM knew its  
gasoline tanks were unsafe, but believed it was cheaper to settle 
claims than recall the cars for safety upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors contends the car was safe, and the accident was  
the fault of a drunken driver who hit the car while going 70 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not uncommon for recipients of large awards to give some  
of the money away, said Tom Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly 
USA. In a 1997 Texas case, the family of a man killed in an 
oil-well accident agreed to forego $30 million in punitive damages 
if the company, Esenjay Petroleum Corp., would install safer 
equipment. The company agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of saving face by saying you'll give up something  
you're probably not going to get anyway,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Get $124M in Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States and Canada were given the  
go-ahead by independent arbitrators Monday to impose 100 percent 
penalty tariffs on $124 million of imports from the European Union 
in their dispute over hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Trade Organization panel awarded Washington $116.8  
million per year, while Canada was awarded $7.7 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scale of the decision ... is an indication of the serious  
damage the European beef ban has inflicted on U.S. exporters and 
the opportunities it has denied European consumers,'' said U.S. 
trade Ambassador Rita Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	A report from the independent World Trade Organization panel  
approved the sanctions at a level of about half of what the United 
States had asked for but twice what the EU had claimed was 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
pledged that ``the United States will act firmly and swiftly under 
its WTO rights to sharply raise tariffs on imports from the EU in 
an amount equivalent to the trade damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States remains willing -- as it has always been -- to  
negotiate a resolution of the issue with the EU,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	But pending such a settlement, officials said they will publish  
in the next few weeks a final list of the $116.8 million in 
additional European luxury goods that will be targeted for 100 
percent tariffs. That list will be drawn from an initial target 
list in the beef dispute of $900 million in European imports 
ranging from foie gras and truffles to Belgian chocolates and 
mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian list includes beef, cucumbers, gingerbread, gin,  
vodka and soup. The Canadians were awarded one-seventh of what they 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs are likely to force the affected products out of the  
market entirely in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The three arbitrators rejected an EU claim that the United  
States and Canada should provide a definite list of the items which 
would face sanctions before approval was given. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO approved the principle of sanctions against the EU in  
May after Brussels failed to meet a deadline to comply with a 
ruling against its ban on imports hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU maintains that some of the hormones may cause cancer and  
is conducting further scientific studies on their safety. It has 
refused to lift the ban, even though it has been ruled illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries will now have to call another meeting of the  
WTO for the sanctions to be rubber-stamped. 
</P>
<P>
	An EU official in Brussels, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the EU Commission would meet with the United States in the 
next 10 days to try to stave off the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hoped to agree on a satisfactory compensation package now  
that the amount involved was clear, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said it was more important for the EU to come into line  
with the WTO ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge the EU to reconsider its actions and demonstrate a  
real commitment to a WTO-consistent, multilateral trade system and 
to the basic ideals of market access and consumer choice,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time this year that the United States has  
imposed penalty tariffs on European imports. Earlier, it boosted 
tariffs by 100 percent on $191.2 million of EU products in a 
dispute involving bananas. That target list included fancy French 
handbags, German coffee makers and English bed linens.

<HEADLINE>  Clashes in Colombia Subsiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Fierce clashes in Colombia's southern  
savannahs subsided Monday, winding down a four-day guerrilla blitz 
army leaders claimed was a debacle for the country's powerful 
leftist insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to convince a skeptical media, troops brought journalists  
to an army base where they displayed the bodies of 30 guerrillas 
allegedly killed in Puerto Lleras, a town 114 miles from the 
capital, Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	About a third of the dead on display at the army base in  
Granada, twenty minutes by helicopter from Puerto Lleras, were 
female fighters, common in the FARC. Many still had red, yellow and 
blue banners across the chests -- national colors the rebels often 
wear into battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Army explosives experts in the isolated southern town worked to  
defuse homemade missiles left by the guerrillas, who flattened a 
police station and homes with the crude, but deadly weapons 
fashioned from gas canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	After initially declaring the hostilities over, the army  
conceded Monday afternoon that clashes continued in at least two 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops and rebels were still ``fighting in the streets'' in  
Puerto Rico, another town in Meta, armed services chief Gen. 
Fernando Tapias told reporters. Thirty-seven police officers were 
missing and feared taken prisoner by rebels who raided the town 126 
miles from Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmen who were presumed to be rebels also fired sporadic shots  
Monday afternoon at anti-narcotics police roadblock near Florencia, 
the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Military leaders are saying they saved the country from one of  
the guerrillas' most ambitious offensives since taking up arms in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Many observers have their doubts. They feel the FARC is making  
steady progress -- even if it lost some fighters, didn't permanently 
seize territory or inflict heavy government casualties in its 
latest offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've managed to show force, to intimidate (Colombia's)  
establishment, and without a doubt made it possible to push harder 
at the negotiating table,'' said former national security adviser 
Alfredo Rangel. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels launched their offensive less than two weeks before a  
planned round of negotiations with the government of President 
Andres Pastrana to end Colombia's 35-year conflict. The FARC is 
demanding sweeping reforms to attack poverty, redistribute land and 
clean up political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting raged over the weekend in 10 of the country's 32  
provinces, killing at least 59 police and soldiers as well as two 
children whose house was destroyed by a rebel bomb. The army claims 
it killed a fifth of an estimated 1,000 rebel fighters 
participating in the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The combat began Thursday, when FARC rebels overran an army  
encampment, killing 38 soldiers in mountains an hour south of the 
capital. Military leaders claimed they had beaten back a strike at 
Bogota, a city of 7 million residents, and the government imposed a 
nighttime travel ban in the affected provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel said the army was probably exaggerating the scope of the  
FARC offensive as well as rebel losses -- part of a ``propaganda 
counteroffensive'' designed to divert attention from the military's 
own shortcomings on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15,000-member FARC has enjoyed a nearly unbroken string of  
victories during the past three years. In a much larger offensive 
last August, the rebels killed 143 soldiers and police, took more 
than hundred captive and overran a major anti-narcotics base.

<HEADLINE> WWF Says Ventura Returning to Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura will return to the  
ring with the World Wrestling Federation, although it's not clear 
if he will wrestle or referee. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who turns 48 Thursday, hasn't wrestled in more  
than a decade. In his WWF days, Ventura was a boa-wearing bad guy 
known as ``The Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be taking some vacation time,'' Ventura  
spokesman David Ruth said. ``It's business that is separate from 
his gubernatorial duties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth deferred further questions to the governor's lawyer, David  
Bradley Olsen, who did not immediately return a phone call. Ventura 
was in northern Minnesota and not immediately available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the WWF also declined comment, citing a news  
conference Wednesday at Target Center in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Ventura does, it will occur Aug. 22 at the WWF  
pay-per-view ``SummerSlam'' event at Target Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those scheduled to appear with Ventura at the news  
conference are WWF chairman Vince McMahon and champion ``Stone 
Cold'' Steve Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura once successfully sued McMahon. He said McMahon pocketed  
$1 million in royalties and interest from a wrestling tape McMahon 
was selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I'd beaten him in court, he wasn't ever going to hire me  
again,'' Ventura wrote in his recent autobiography. ``It doesn't 
behoove promoters to have wrestlers who know what their rights 
are.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. TV Station Rescinds Ad Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Fox television affiliate in Tennessee has  
hurriedly rescinded an offer to local businesses to produce three 
``positive'' news stories about them in exchange for $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising sales staff at WDSI in Chattanooga had told  
businesses that the stories would be broadcast on the station's 
news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive who oversees the station blamed a rogue salesperson  
for the offer, which was taken off the table before any sales were 
made. The station begin broadcasting news shows this year for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's out of ignorance that this happened, because they don't  
understand the ethics of journalism,'' said David Janecek, vice 
president for news at Pegasus Broadcast Television, a 
Pennsylvania-based company that owns Fox-61. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox spokesman said the network had no prior knowledge of the  
offer and had nothing to do with the conduct of its affiliate 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-page sales circular distributed by the station said that  
Fox-61 News was producing a series of news segments highlighting 
prominent businesses in the Chattanooga area. ``We want your 
company highlighted!'' said the sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fox-61 News is the most credible programming for the image of  
your company,'' the solicitation continues. ``When an organization 
is involved with positive news coverage, that organization is 
looked upon extremely favorable (sic) in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $15,000 fee entitled companies to news segments that would  
be repeated during the morning, midday and evening news programs, 
along with 18 promotional spots drawing attention to the stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Waterhouse, a public relations executive who represents  
businesses in the Chattanooga area, received the solicitation and 
was ``shocked it was so blatant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think there needs to be an extremely clear division  
between advertising and news,'' Waterhouse said. ``The public needs 
to understand that you can't buy favorable news stories about your 
clients or anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erlanger Health System, which owns a hospital and clinics in  
Chattanooga, also received the offer. ``Pretty much everyone agreed 
that it was not only a high price, it was somebody putting a price 
on news,'' spokeswoman Carolyn Peak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The station's general manager, Jim Wright, referred all calls to  
Janacek. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pegasus executive said the salesperson who devised and  
distributed the offer acted against policy and without permission. 
He wouldn't name the person involved or discuss what action the 
company might take. 
</P>
<P>
	Waterhouse suggested, however, that more than one person might  
have been involved: He said the offer was dropped off at his office 
by two people, including the Fox-61 sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how this would affect the station's credibility as a news  
organization, Janacek said, ``It's not going to help.''

<HEADLINE> El Diario Publisher Ramirez Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carlos D. Ramirez, the publisher of el diario/La  
Prensa who helped modernize and bring financial security to the 
city's largest and oldest daily Spanish-language newspaper, has 
died of pancreatic cancer. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez died Sunday morning at Sloan Kettering Memorial Center,  
his business partner Peter Davidson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great loss to his family and to the whole Latino  
community here in New York,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his illness, Ramirez continued to come into the office  
several days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was working right up until last week when he was  
hospitalized,'' Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez was hired by el diario's former owner Gannett Co. as a  
comptroller in 1981 and became publisher in 1984. The newspaper, 
founded in 1913, is believed to be the oldest Spanish-language 
daily in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, when Gannett first started shopping the newspaper  
around, Ramirez, Davidson and 15 others formed an investment group 
-- El Diario Associates -- and bought the newspaper for a reported 
$20 million to $25 million to keep it under Hispanic ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	He often told employees of how he borrowed money from his  
retired father who encouraged him, saying, ``It's your generation's 
turn now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under their ownership, Ramirez remained publisher and Davidson  
became president. The investment group, now called Latin 
Communications Group Inc., owns several Spanish-language newspapers 
and 18 radio stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last couple of years, el diario has had one of the  
fastest growing circulations in the city, along with the New York 
Post. Its Monday through Friday circulation is nearing 52,000 
daily, according to the 1999 Editor &AMP; Publisher.

<HEADLINE> Societe Generale Rebuffs BNP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The board of directors of French banking group  
Societe Generale on Monday rejected Banque Nationale de Paris' 
sweetened offer for its shares -- the latest installment of a 
three-way takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP did not immediately comment on the decision by Societe  
Generale. The third bank in the battle, Paribas, rejected the 
sweetened BNP offer on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-week-old takeover fight began in March when BNP jumped  
into an agreed merger between Societe Generale and Paribas, 
offering $37 billion for the two banks. Societe Generale and 
Paribas rejected BNP's offer and have spurned its advances since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, the BNP increased its initial bid by five percent.  
</P>
<P>
	A merger of the three banks would create the world's first $1  
trillion bank in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale also announced Monday that its first-half  
earnings this year will be double those reported in 1998, when the 
bank earned $707.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale in June sweetened its own offer to Paribas  
shareholders by adding a cash payout of as much as $1.54 billion to 
its initial all-stock offer. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP responded at the beginning of July by raising the value of  
its two bids to about $39 billion, adding a cash payout of as much 
as $900 million as well as stock to its all-stock offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for both sets of bids is July 30 unless extended.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Fortunately, I'm too old to be in fifth grade -- I might not ever  
get to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	At least, that's the upshot of a fun couple of hours with The  
ClueFinders 5th Grade Adventures, a new bit of educational software 
for both Windows and Macintosh platforms from The Learning Company, 
a division of Mattel, Inc., the toymaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The premise is that a multiracial, mixed-gender crew of fifth  
graders is shipwrecked on a volcanic island due to erupt any 
second. Two members of the crew have disappeared and the remaining 
members, including the child player, must solve a series of 
mysteries in language arts, math, science and social studies in 
time to rescue them and get off the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The learning experience begins with a test drive using what the  
company calls A.D.A.P.T. learning technology. The Learning Company 
may have just won an award for Most Strained Acronym In A Software 
Product, since the letters stand for Assesses Abilities, Develops 
Skills, Adjusts Levels, Provides Help and Tracks Progress. 
</P>
<P>
	That said, it's all just a fancy way of saying the program tests  
to see how much is between the kid's ears and adjusts itself 
accordingly. My own test results showed me strong in language arts, 
but needing a lot of help in math. (So OK, when was the last time, 
not counting fifth grade, you had to add a string of fractions?) 
Skills are assessed at one of four difficulty levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The ClueFinders 5th Grade Adventures includes amusing and  
challenging exercises involving addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, geometry, logic, spelling, synonyms and antonyms, 
map reading and electrical circuits -- the whole range of fifth 
grade activity. The four main characters are Joni Savage, Santiago 
Rivera, Leslie Clark and Owen Lam. 
</P>
<P>
	The artwork and animation are crisp and fluid and the characters  
are appealing in this two-CD-ROM set, not a surprise from the 
company with titles that helped define educational software like 
Reader Rabbit and Carmen Sandiego. The user interface is 
mouse-driven and intuitive, and the musical background appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Also appropriate is the $29.95 expected retail price.  
</P>
<P>
	The problems posed are challenging enough for an adult, but  
kid-centered enough to hold interest. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements for the PC world are Windows 95 or better,  
any Pentium chip, 16 megabytes of RAM, a quad-speed or better 
CD-ROM, 256-color SVGA monitor, sound card and speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	For Macs, PowerPC, System 7.1 or better, 16 megabytes of RAM,  
quad-speed CD-ROM, speakers and a 256-color monitor 13 inches or 
longer. The installation for both platforms takes 22 megabytes of 
hard disk space. The Learning Company's products are widely 
available at retail. Their Web site is www.learningco.com.

<HEADLINE> Amgen Beats Expectations Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Biotechnology giant Amgen's profits rose 24  
percent in the second quarter, powered by continuing strong demand 
for its anemia-fighting drug Epogen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based company made $268 million or 50  
cents per share in the quarter, compared to $216 million or 41 
cents a share in the same period a year ago. Results easily beat 
Wall Street expectations for 46 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the second quarter rose 21 percent, to $738 million  
from $611 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Epogen, which is used mainly by cancer patients to  
fight anemia, rose 27 percent, to $428 million from $337 million, 
and sales of Neupogen, which stimulates the growth of white blood 
cells in cancer patients, increased 12 percent, to $304 million 
from $271 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen said it now expects earnings per share for the full year  
to be at the high end of a range of $1.90 to $1.95. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1998, profits increased by 28  
percent, to $514.8 million from $403.6 million. Amgen's sales 
increased 20 percent to $1.42 billion from $1.18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen also said that is plans to file for federal approval for  
its experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug call IL-1ra. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen released its earnings after the markets closed. Amgen  
shares were trading at $72.25 in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market, after falling $3 during the regular trading session 
to close at 66.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE>  Three Jets Arraigned on Long Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Two New York Jets players and a former  
teammate arrested after a bar fight in Long Island face 
disciplinary action by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were arraigned today in Long Beach City Court and  
remained free on bail, the Nassau County district attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were scheduled to appear before Nassau County Judge Joseph  
Calabrese on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	John ``Jumbo'' Elliott, 34, and Jason Fabini, 24, of the Jets  
and Matt O'Dwyer, 26, of the Cincinnati Bengals were drinking at 
Bogart's Bar and Restaurant in Long Beach about 12:30 a.m. Saturday 
when they began acting up, police said. It took 31 officers to 
subdue the 300-pound football players, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a left tackle, was charged with misdemeanor assault,  
harassment and public lewdness. Police said he triggered the brawl 
by urinating in a sink in the women's bathroom in the bar and then 
punching two patrons, a woman and a male volunteer firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabini, one of the Jets' top rookies last year, was charged with  
disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, who signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with  
Cincinnati three weeks ago, faces the most serious charges: felony 
assault, harassment and criminal mischief. Police said he kicked 
out the window of a patrol car, sending shattered glass into the 
faces of two officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were treated for scratches to their corneas.  
</P>
<P>
	The players could be ordered to get counseling and could face  
fines or suspensions if found guilty, NFL officials said. NFL rules 
say that players charged with crimes involving violence or alcohol 
can be ordered to enroll in anger management programs and alcohol 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The players posted cash bail -- Fabini $100, Elliott $10,000 and  
O'Dwyer $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott pleaded guilty last year to driving while impaired. He  
was fined $350, his driver's license was suspended for 90 days, and 
he had to undergo counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL officials refused to comment on the arrests. Officials for  
the Jets and Bengals said the players were expected at training 
camps later this month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Basketball Takes Sixth Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- After a close call in  
the semifinals, the U.S. men's basketball team wrapped up its sixth 
straight World University Games gold medal and 40th straight win -- 
both records -- by routing Yugoslavia 79-65 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's team, playing without two starters, was upset  
by host Spain 57-48 in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin led the U.S. men with 21 points,  
several coming off dunks against the outsized and outclassed 
Yugoslavs. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Mladen Sekularac, the only member of the Yugoslavian  
team who plays in the country's first division, had a game-high 31 
points in the men's final. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept running plays for him, isolating him. That hurt  
their team. When we locked them down defensively, the game was 
pretty much over,'' said U.S. head coach Oliver Purnell, an 
assistant on the 1995 University Games squad that featured recent 
NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan and league scoring-leader Allen Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	The current crop of college stars -- five of the 12 team members  
have NCAA Final Four experience -- struggled. The opener against 
South Korea was tight early in the second half, Canada led at 
halftime in their quarterfinal matchup, and Saturday's semifinal 
against Spain was a two-point game with 20 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We invented the game, so our guys certainly expected to get  
the gold. But it wasn't easy,'' said Purnell, who coaches at 
Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody tried to play their `A' game against us, and the  
international game is more physical than what we're used to,'' said 
Kevin Freeman, a member of Connecticut's NCAA championship team. 
``But we stayed focused, because we didn't want to be the U.S. team 
that didn't bring home the gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women shot just 27 percent from the field, including  
1-of-12 from 3-point range in front of a hostile crowd at muggy Son 
Moix arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosaura Sanchez led Spain with 14 points, and Nieves Llamas  
added 13. Spain had not participated in the University Games since 
taking its only previous medal -- a silver -- in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball wasn't falling for us, and we kind of put out heads  
down,'' said guard Katie Douglas, who led the U.S. with 14 points. 
``If you're not doing well on offense, you have to dig in on 
defense. We didn't. We let them dictate things all game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas is one of two U.S. players from NCAA champion Purdue  
University. The other, Camille Cooper, missed the gold medal game 
with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia won the women's bronze with a 77-71 victory over Ukraine.  
</P>
<P>
	In other action on the penultimate day of this Olympics-style  
event, Romania's Lonela Tirlea ran the year's fastest time for the 
women's 400 meters, and set a new University Games record in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Tirlea, European champion in the 400 hurdles, clocked 49.98  
seconds to win easily. Mikele Barber of the United States edged 
Nigeria's Doris Jacob to take the silver with a time of 51.03. The 
Romanian was supposed to compete in the hurdles here, but said she 
didn't arrive in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners in track and field events included Yulia Taranova  
of Russia in the women's 800 meters, Jerome Davis of the United 
States in the men's 400, and Cuba's Raul Duany in the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	In judo, South Korea won the men's team event and France claimed  
the women's title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the soccer final, Fernando Soriano scored the go-ahead goal  
in the 110th minute of play to give Spain a 2-1 victory over Italy. 
Brazil beat South Korea 5-4 on penalty kicks after supplemental 
time ended with the countries tied 2-2 to take the soccer bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain beat Italy 6-5 in water polo, where the United States took  
the bronze by defeating Hungary 13-7.

<HEADLINE> NAACP To Sue Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NAACP announced offensives against TV  
networks and gun makers Monday, using public relations and the 
threat of lawsuits to push for more black faces on the tube and 
fewer guns on the street. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest civil rights group decided at its annual  
meeting to monitor and seek action on the ``virtual whitewash'' in 
fall TV programming, a lineup featuring few minority characters. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also said it will file a federal suit later this week  
in New York seeking tough limits on the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Both announcements came as the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People held its 90th annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said the group's new NAACP  
Television &AMP; Film Industry Diversity Initiative will monitor how 
well the entertainment industry reflects America's multicultural 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to calling for congressional and Federal  
Communication Commission hearings on licensing and ownership of 
networks, the campaign could lead to lawsuits and boycotts of 
advertisers, Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 27 new comedies and dramas premiering on the top  
four networks this fall has minorities in a leading role, and few 
have them in supporting roles either. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS President Leslie Moonves called the NAACP's concerns  
``relevant and extremely important.'' Moonves said in a statement 
that 11 of the network's 19 entertainment series broadcast this 
fall would have minority characters ``in a primary role.'' Network 
spokesman Chris Ender said one new show this fall, ``Now and 
Again,'' a drama, would feature a black actor, Dennis Haysbert. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said in a statement that including minorities on the air  
``has been a top priority for some time and it continues to remain 
an important priority,'' but that there was still work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	And Fox said it agreed with the NAACP that increasing racial and  
ethnic diversity on TV was an important goal. ``We welcome the 
opportunity to meet with Mr. Mfume to discuss this issue,'' the 
network said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses said the  
network was adding some black and Latino characters to its shows 
this fall in order to become more diverse. ``It is something we are 
always conscious of and (we're) disappointed we did not do a better 
job,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP will study whether the 1934 communications act  
mandating public ownership of the airwaves can be used as a basis 
for suing. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks make up 13 percent of the population, and ``we think our  
presence should be appropriately reflected both in front the 
cameras as well as behind the cameras,'' Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This glaring omission is an outrage and a shameful display by  
network executives who are either clueless, careless or both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On guns, the NAACP is launching a product liability suit against  
nearly 100 firearms makers, distributors and importers, seeking 
what it calls sweeping new steps to keep guns from criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has been reckless,'' said Denise Dunleavy, an  
attorney with the New York law firm of Weitz &AMP; Luxenberg, which 
will represent the NAACP without charge. ``We want safe marketing 
practices and new distribution patterns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP is seeking an injunction rather than monetary damages,  
Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the suit would seek to end the sale of firearms at gun  
shows, mandate that all new guns be equipped with safety locks, 
tighten regulations on who could qualify as federally licensed gun 
distributors and limit customers to one gun purchase per month. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association decried the suit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the NAACP is out of step with African American  
citizens around the country,'' said Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive 
vice president. Minorities value gun rights, he said, and the drive 
to limit those rights comes from ``rich white liberals who live 
behind security systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of holding a manufacturer of a legal product  
responsible for the third-party criminal misuse of their product is 
a horrible idea,'' he said. ``We won't have a manufactured product 
in America in the future if that theory of law is allowed to stand 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume suggested tougher gun standards might have headed off the  
recent murders of a black man and a Korean student by a white 
supremacist who went on a shooting rampage in Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Benjamin Smith got his firearms from an  
unlicensed dealer who had purchased 65 guns from a store over two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When 65 guns are sold to one person, something is wrong,''  
Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPierre noted Smith was turned down for guns by a legitimate  
dealer earlier, when a background check showed he was under court 
order to stay away from his girlfriend. Smith should have been 
arrested then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they'd enforced the law, Ben Smith wouldn't have killed  
anybody,'' LaPierre said.

<HEADLINE> NAACP, AT&AMP;t To Create Tech Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- To help bridge the ``digital divide'' -- the gap  
between white people and blacks and Hispanics in access to the 
Internet -- the NAACP and AT&AMP;T will partner to create technology 
centers in 20 cities that will provide computer training and 
Internet seminars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technological segregation known as the digital divide must  
be narrowed,'' NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, Mfume announced that through the program AT&AMP;T  
will provide hardware, software and on-site support for technology 
in the centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The centers will be open after the school doors close so  
parents and children can learn computer usage together,'' Mfume 
said. ``The old and the young learning together will help reduce 
that divide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NAACP spokesperson Sheila Douglas said that outside of  
Baltimore, where the NAACP is headquartered, locations of the other 
19 sites are yet to be determined. The project will cost 
approximately $300,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech Corp. and the National Urban League announced last  
week they will spend $350,000 to build five new Internet community 
centers in Aurora, Ill., Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis and 
Milwaukee. And 3Com Corp. said it will spend $1 million in donated 
equipment and training in 10 cities to help teach students to be 
computer network engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Commerce Department report, ``Falling Through the  
Net,'' said the disparity on the Internet between whites and black 
and Hispanic Americans is growing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found about 47 percent of all whites own computers,  
but fewer than half as many blacks do. About 25.5 percent of 
Hispanics own computers, but 55 percent of Asian-Americans do. 
Asian families also are most likely to have Internet access, with 
36 percent online. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found a child in a low-income white family is  
three times more likely to have Internet access as a child in a 
comparable black family, and four times more likely than a Hispanic 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Most troubling for government experts were indications these  
disparities can't be blamed solely on differences in income. Among 
families earning $15,000 to $35,000, for example, more than 33 
percent of whites owned computers, but only 19 percent of blacks 
did. That gap has widened nearly 62 percent since 1994 despite 
plunging computer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume also announced a new national campaign that could involve  
lawsuits against entertainment industry giants to end the scarcity 
of black characters on television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly formed NAACP Television &AMP; Film Industry Diversity  
Initiative will monitor how well the entertainment industry 
reflects America's multi-cultural base. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from calling for congressional and Federal Communications  
Commission hearings on licensing and ownership of networks, the 
campaign could initiate lawsuits and boycotts of advertisers, Mfume 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the dearth of minorities in upcoming fall shows as a  
touchstone, Mfume said the NAACP is studying whether or not to file 
suit against the four major networks for violating the 
Communications Act of 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	The act says the airwaves belong to the public, and Mfume argued  
there is a ``virtual whitewash'' in new programming since none of 
the 26 new shows slated for the upcoming fall season have 
minorities in featured roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This glaring omission is an outrage and a shameful display by  
network executives who are either clueless, careless or both,'' 
Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS President Leslie Moonves called the NAACP's concerns  
``relevant and extremely important.'' Moonves said in a statement 
that 11 of the network's 19 entertainment series broadcast this 
fall would have minority characters ``in a primary role.'' Network

	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese economy is still in the doldrums, but  
government efforts to spur growth are leading to signs of a 
recovery, the finance minister told Parliament on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is struggling to emerge from its deepest recession in 50  
years, with unemployment hovering around record highs. The 
government has embarked on a huge spending program to revive the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the picture remained grim.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Japanese economy, as seen in the weak levels of personal  
consumption and capital expenditures and in the high unemployment 
rate, is still in a severe situation,'' Miyazawa said in a speech 
to parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, the 1.9 percent growth in the nation's economy  
in the first three months of the year shows that ``some bright 
signs are beginning to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa also said the large budget for the fiscal year that  
began April 1 and steps to provide money for financial sector 
stability should also help strengthen the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance minister urged Parliament to pass a $4.25 billion  
supplementary budget aimed at bolstering the nation's ailing labor 
market. The Cabinet approved the plan last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplementary budget is meant to finance the government's  
plan to create about 720,000 jobs through measures such as 
subsidies to companies and nonprofit organizations for hiring 
displaced workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government perceives coping with the current severe  
employment situation as its most urgent and important task,'' 
Miyazawa was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A day after a strong quake shook the  
Caribbean coast of Guatemala, life in the region is returning to 
normal, Guatemala's president said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday morning quake injured 38 people and was blamed for  
the death of a man who had a heart attack. Fifty houses were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was located about 20 miles east of the Guatemalan  
coast city of Puerto Barrios. Estimates of its magnitude ranged 
from 6.1 to 6.6. It was felt in parts of Honduras, El Salvador and 
Mexico.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's president froze gasoline prices  
until the end of the year in an effort Monday to end a strike by 
taxi and bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	But strike leaders immediately rejected the measure, which froze  
gasoline prices at $1.16 a gallon, and said they would continue the 
week-old strike to force President Jamil Mahuad to rescind a 13 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Strikers want the government to freeze gasoline prices for two  
years at their June levels -- $1.02 a gallon. Monthly incomes in 
Ecuador hover at about $108. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers have partially paralyzed streets and highways in  
Ecuador's major cities by forming barricades with their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortages of foods and vegetables have started to occur in  
Quito, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is locked in its worst economic crisis in decades, with  
the economy expected to shrink by 5 percent this year and annual 
inflation topping 50 percent.

-- an agreement by Mexico and Venezuela to supply oil to 11 Central 
American and Caribbean countries at a discount -- to include Cuba 
and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cuban people will not forget this noble gesture of great  
generosity,'' Cuba Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said during 
a two-day visit to Venezuela. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> African Dust Found in Miami's Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Miami residents and visitors take a deep  
breath this summer, odds are they will inhale dust from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, researchers say that up to half the tiny particles in  
Miami's air originate across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph M. Prospero, of the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  
School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, reviewed 23 years of 
measurements of airborne particles at a coastal site in Miami. He 
believes this impact of African dust is comparable throughout the 
southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
	His findings will appear in the July 20 issue of Journal of  
Geophysical Research. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is nothing new about the transoceanic transport of  
African dust, Prospero notes that very little research has been 
done into the health effects of dust in the air, as contrasted with 
dust in coal mines and other contained industrial environments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospero noted that such African dust particles contain large  
amounts of iron, as a coating, providing its characteristic 
red-brown color. Once dust is deposited in the lung, the iron 
coating would probably be released to the lung tissue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On some days the African dust can push the total number of  
airborne particles above the limit set by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, he reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's standard is based on the total mass of particles  
measuring 2.5 microns or less that may be observed in a 24 hour 
period. Particles of this size can penetrate deep into the lung, 
where they are deposited and react with lung tissue. The standard 
does not distinguish among various types of particles, which 
include pollution and local dust along with African dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospero notes that manmade photochemical pollution in the  
eastern and southeastern United States is at its highest in summer, 
the same time that most of the African dust arrives.

<HEADLINE> Navy Says Puerto Rican Base Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABOARD THE USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (AP) -- The chest-pounding roar  
and face-burning blast of the twin furnaces that are the F-14 
Tomcat's engines sweep across the carrier deck. The Navy fighter 
lurches before soaring into a misty blue-grey sky. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 aircraft swarm the skies 80 miles south of Puerto Rico  
as the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier's group -- 12 ships and 
submarines in all -- works out the kinks of full-scale war games 
before deploying to the Mediterranean this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one thing is missing: someplace to bomb. Puerto Rico's  
government is demanding the Navy abandon the outlying island of 
Vieques, used for training for every military operation since 
Vietnam, including Operation Desert Fox in Iraq and this year's 
Kosovo campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy argues that Vieques is the only Atlantic range where it  
can conduct full-blown land, sea and air games, with real 
munitions, under conditions that are closest to the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the island, Rear Admiral J. Michael Johnson worries his  
carrier battle group won't be fully combat-ready when the real 
games begin. ``We're bombing the ocean,'' Johnson lamented 
recently. ``You can't miss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recent controversy started when an accidental bombing by a  
Marine fighter killed a Navy-employed Puerto Rican civilian 
security guard April 19 on the Vieques bombing range, which has 
since been occupied by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has appointed a panel to investigate what to  
do with Vieques, which the Navy has shared with civilians since 
1941 and insists is vital to national security. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's report isn't due until August. But the Navy, after  
months of criticism in the Puerto Rican media and protests by 
Puerto Rican officials, is taking the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials say commercial jet traffic restricts bombing  
other East Coast ranges. Vieques has no such restrictions, 
essential in an era when smart weapons can be fired from high 
altitudes or as far as 50 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation and the world have lessened their acceptance of  
collateral damage from any means, whether upon the enemy or upon 
civilians,'' Johnson said. ``The last time we were able to 
demonstrate that ... was in April,'' before bombing in Vieques was 
suspended following the worker's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next battle group to come to Puerto Rico will not have  
that luxury,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguments clearly pitched toward the four-man Washington  
panel that includes only one civilian, Navy officials also point to 
their pilots' record in Kosovo, where no U.S. forces suffered 
casualties during the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people executed these missions flawlessly because of the  
training they got right here,'' insisted Rear Admiral Richard J. 
Naughton, training commander for Atlantic battle carrier groups. 
``If they haven't practiced it in this environment here, there's no 
chance they can do it safely and get the bombs on target for 
real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mounting protests against the Vieques bombing come as the United  
States is making Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico its forward staging 
area for Latin America and withdraws its forces from the Panama 
Canal Zone this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico offers ``an ideal marriage'' for the U.S. armed  
forces in Latin America, Marine Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, chief of 
the U.S. Southern Command, told Congress in June. 
</P>
<P>
	That marriage is on the rocks, at least as far as Vieques is  
concerned, Puerto Rican officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gov. Pedro Rossello demanded that the Navy leave the  
island, home to 9,000 Puerto Ricans. ``The issue is the impact that 
these exercises have on a community of U.S. citizens,'' he told the 
Pentagon commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from the protests, the 5,200 crew of the Kennedy launch and  
bring home dozens of combat aircraft from the cloud-strewn 
Caribbean sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the situation and that a colleague died,'' said  
Lt. Nelson Craig, 23, of Ogden, Utah, a flight deck ``shooter'' who 
gives the final OK for each launch. ``But we've tried to put that 
behind us and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy's trying, too.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Pleas in Radio Payola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's largest independent Latin music  
label and two of its executives pleaded innocent Monday to federal 
payola charges, or paying radio stations to broadcast their 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against the Van Nuys-based Fonovisa are the first since  
the scandals of the 1950s, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the 
U.S. Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Gilberto Moreno, the company's promotion chief, pleaded  
innocent in Los Angeles Federal Court with making improper payments 
for radio play. Company president Guillermo Santiso pleaded 
innocent to a tax violation related to a payola charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Santiso and Moreno intend to plead guilty once their cases are  
consolidated, said Charles Kreindler, Santino's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Colyer, a lawyer for Fonovisa, spoke for the record  
label and pleaded innocent to a tax offense for allegedly falsely 
reporting promotional expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Their next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 7.  
</P>
<P>
	Similar payola cases occurred in the 1980s, but the defendants  
then did not work for record companies, Mrozek said. They were 
outside record promoters who promised the company a hit using 
methods presumed to be legal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, Moreno paid $2,000 to a program director to have  
Fonovisa records added to the station's play list, court records 
allege. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges follow a two-year investigation of Fonovisa, which  
is owned by Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists from the record label dominated Spanish-language  
airwaves in 1997 with songs from such singers as Enrique Iglesias 
and Marco Antonio Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrozek refused to identify the radio stations involved in the  
alleged scam, but said charges may still be filed against several 
programming directors. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he could not specify artists or songs the stations  
allegedly were paid to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonovisa monopolized the top three positions on Billboard  
magazine's Latin airplay chart for the first five months of 1997, 
regularly taking about 14 of the 40 slots available. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the company allegedly quit paying programmers cash to  
play its songs, its presence on the Hot Latin Tracks chart fell by 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, its record sales were about 16 percent of the nearly  
$500 million in Spanish music sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonovisa was credited with developing the U.S. market for banda,  
mariachi and other regional Mexican music. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Televisa said last year it reported the illegal activities  
to the U.S. government and cooperated with the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Family Awarded $295M in Ford Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CERES, Calif. (AP) -- A jury awarded $295 million Monday to the  
family of a couple and their son who were killed in the rollover of 
a Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came three days after a Los Angeles jury awarded a  
record $4.9 billion to six people who were severely burned when 
their Chevrolet exploded in a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated five days before awarding $5 million in  
compensation to three members of the victims' family and $290 
million in punitive damages, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Romo was driving the 1978 Bronco in June 1993 when he  
swerved to avoid a van he was passing. The vehicle rolled over, 
killing Romo's mother, father and brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Romo and his two surviving sisters claimed Ford knew the  
Bronco's mostly plastic roof would not hold up in a rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Ford executive, Tom Feeney, testified on behalf of the  
Romos, saying company officials knew the roof was virtually certain 
to fail, plaintiff lawyer Laurence Drivon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford argued that the vehicle was sound and that the accident was  
Romo's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conducted tests on the Bronco and it surpasses handily all  
of the federal motor vehicle safety standards, even though it's not 
required to do so,'' Ford spokesman Jim Cain said after the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company would ask for a new trial.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Said To Be On `Bubble' / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A subtle shading, a mere nuance, has begun to  
emerge in the commentary of securities analysts: They are losing 
their aversion to the use of the word ``bubble'' in describing the 
investment scene. 
</P>
<P>
	That aversion is understandable, given the tendency of bubbles  
to burst, but some analysts now use the word easily, as if to 
concede the word's relevance to the spectacular current market. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is rare to find an economic or financial forecaster  
willing to stake his or her reputation on a flat out bubble burst. 
Instead, they pose the possibility, just in case the worst case 
scenario unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could we get to 15,000 on the Dow before the end of the  
year?'' asks Deutsche Bank economist Edward Yardeni? He answers: 
``I said it before, I'll say it again: In a speculative bubble, 
anything is possible.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	David Wyss of Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI puts it similarly. ``DRI  
model equations suggest that this is indeed a market bubble, but we 
have never had one persist this long in the past,'' he wrote 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wyss, too, avoids any suggestion that the bubble is about to  
be pricked. ``The possibility that something fundamental has 
changed in the stock market should not be ruled out,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Stephen King, based in London for HSBC securities, is  
an exception. He is unusually explicit. Not only does a bubble 
exist, but ``the burst may come at the beginning of 2000.'' Even 
sooner, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 52-page analysis, King suggests that almost all the  
symptoms associated with earlier bubbles in other nations, as in 
Japan and the United Kingdom during 1986-1989, are factors in 
today's U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them: above trend growth, below trend inflation, global  
commodity price collapse, faster money supply growth, falling 
private sector savings, financial innovation and ``PARADIGM 
SHIFT.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. bubble'' he says, ``is likely to burst through a  
combination of rising interest rates and a falling dollar,'' 
suggesting a significant risk of a sharp and sustained fall in 
asset prices toward year end. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not as rare as they were a few months ago, bubble  
references such as these are still far from commonplace. Most 
economists and market forecasters continue an old tradition of not 
calling for major changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph McAlinden, chief investment officer for the Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter Family of Funds, suggests that investors 
``rotate'' into undervalued stocks, such as those often found in 
mature industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Salomon Smith Barney says ``we expect previously out-of-favor  
sectors to perform well, as the market continues to move toward 
equilibrium between large-cap and small-cap stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter advises clients to ``consider  
shifting into cyclical and smaller-cap stocks,'' that is, ``those 
sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy, such as autos, paper 
and chemicals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Somewhere between hope and deep concern lies another comment  
from Yardeni, as published in his global economic analysis of July 
6. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its ``bare minimum policy response'' to economic  
conditions, the outspoken Yardeni declares, the Federal Reserve's 
open market committee has sent a clear message to stock investors: 
``Have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How could he justify that conclusion? Because, he says, ``if the  
market is a bubble now, the bubble will get bigger.''

<HEADLINE> Seven Found Shot to Death in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Seven people were found shot to death Monday in  
an Atlanta home, with the only survivor an 11-year-old boy who hid 
in a closet for hours after he was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the fatal shootings of five adults and two  
children was unclear, but police were investigating whether one 
person killed the others and himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility does exist that one of the persons inside, who  
is also deceased, is responsible for all the shootings and that 
injury to himself was self-inflicted,'' Deputy Police Chief C.B. 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were called to the scene in the afternoon after the  
boy, who was shot in the elbow, sought help from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Betty Fuller said the boy's mother lived in the house  
with her sister and five children. She said the mother had a 
boyfriend, and that her boy is a smart, happy go-lucky child. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just as sweet as he could be, and God had to be with  
him for him to hide,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stayed outside the house for more than an hour after they  
arrived because a dog was barking inside, raising safety concerns. 
Once inside, officers found bodies throughout the house, which is 
in a predominantly black neighborhood of single-family homes and 
well-kept yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found at least one gun in the house.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm devastated,'' said Gikeivia Johnson, a cousin of the  
family. ``It don't make no sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy told police the shooting started around 6 a.m. Police  
did not release the name of the boy, who was in stable condition 
and alert, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's interacted fairly well with the physicians and nursing  
staff of the emergency department answering questions 
appropriately, given the things that he's gone through,'' Dr. Leon 
Haley said.

<HEADLINE> Tom Watson Returns to Carnoustie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Tiger Woods was in his mother's womb  
when Tom Watson won his first British Open title, beating Jack 
Newton in a playoff at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first of Watson's five Open triumphs. He's back at  
age 49, making his return to the course after an absence of 24 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, the last time the British Open was held at Carnoustie,  
Watson birdied the 18th to force an 18-hole playoff. He won the 
title when Newton bogeyed the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his subsequent wins in 1977, '80, '82 and '83, Watson has  
placed second, fourth, seventh and 10th in British Opens. The 
galleries can't get enough of him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bookmakers put his odds at 125-1, and Watson agrees he's  
a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not playing particularly well right now,'' he said. ``I  
am putting well but something brings out the best in me right here. 
I hope this time it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Watson is not kidding himself. He knows where he stands and  
is preparing himself for the Seniors Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten to the point where I am 49 years old and I said to  
myself I'm going to take a little break away from playing for the 
regular tour and work on my body, get my body into shape for the 
Senior Tour,'' Watson said. ``I am doing that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says his goal this week is simply to par the 16th hole.  
Watson bogeyed the 235-yard, par-3 hole in each round when he won 
in 1975. Even in practice he could do no better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit the green once in five rounds,'' Watson said. ``I hit it  
well beyond the hole one day when the pin was on the front and I 
hit my putt 15 feet by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson also recalled his first experience of links golf during  
practice before his triumph in 1975. Playing at a nearby course 
while Carnoustie was being used for qualifying, he hit a tee shot 
in the right direction, lost sight of it and found it in a small 
pot bunker he didn't know was there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a different type of golf. That was rude shock  
there,'' he recalled. ``I played American target golf -- hit the 
ball high -- and I was somewhat taken aback by that bounce. I truly 
didn't really like the game over here until I stopped fighting 
myself. I got on with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was going against my nature at that time. But I decided to  
change my nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And won five times.

<HEADLINE> Search for Bombing Suspect Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDREWS, N.C. (AP) -- It was a year ago that serial bombing  
suspect Eric Rudolph slipped through a police dragnet, loaded up on 
food and gear at an acquaintance's home and vanished into the 
rugged Southern Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, tracking dogs, 200 searchers and infrared-equipped  
helicopters have failed to find Rudolph in the dense mountain 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
	The trail has grown steadily cold, and now only a dozen police  
remain to follow up leads. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that's left up here are some investigators,'' said Macon  
County Deputy Kenny Cope, who knew Rudolph when they were growing 
up and later helped search for him. ``If they get a hot lead, they 
can call in the search teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings,  
including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in which a woman died. 
Investigators also suspect he was involved in a January 1998 
explosion that killed a police officer and maimed a nurse at the 
New Woman All Women Health Care clinic in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Task force leaders said Rudolph watched local resident George  
Nordmann's ridgetop home 10 miles east of town for several days 
before approaching it on July 7, 1998, to take some food. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, he reappeared, collecting oatmeal, batteries,  
dried fruit, cayenne pepper and other items. He left $500 and drove 
off in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordmann waited two days before notifying authorities. His truck  
was found at a campground a few miles away with a note left on the 
front seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordmann, who continues to work behind the counter at a health  
food store in downtown Andrews, said his brief encounter with 
Rudolph changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a year since all this baloney started,'' he said in  
a brief conversation with a visitor to his shop last week. He said 
federal agents leave him alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph put this small mountain community on the map early in  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the Birmingham, Ala., clinic bombing on Jan. 29,  
1998, a truck seen near the explosion site was traced to Rudolph. 
Authorities set about tracking him down for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph rented a video in nearby Murphy that night, bought a  
large cache of food and supplies and vanished. Searchers found his 
pickup truck outside Andrews several days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of law enforcement officers converged on the area.  
Rudolph quickly became the prime suspect when nails and other 
evidence were found in his home, pickup truck and a rented 
mini-warehouse. Charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he was charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including  
the 1996 Olympic Park bombing. Rudolph was placed on the FBI's 10 
most wanted list and a reward of $1 million was posted for 
information leading directly to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, search teams aided by tracking dogs disappeared into  
the thick forests, trying to pick up Rudolph's trail. They explored 
caves deep in the mountains. Helicopters cruised the ridgetops day 
and night. 
</P>
<P>
	By last July, the manhunt had ebbed as the thick summer foliage  
and heat rendered much of the task force's high-tech equipment 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Rudolph visited Nordmann, and everything changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 law enforcement officers soon returned to the woods. In  
August, James ``Bo'' Gritz, the former Green Beret colonel and 
leader of the right-wing Patriot Movement, led about 40 volunteers 
into the woods to try to find Rudolph. They left empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Woody Enderson, leader of the Southeast Bomb Task  
Force, said investigators were studying about a dozen break-ins 
over the winter in which food, toilet paper and other supplies were 
stolen. Sometimes, the intruder wanted only a shower and shave. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a task force source said the mission will not be  
dismantled until Rudolph's capture or proof he has left the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents have learned to take it all in stride -- the large task  
force command post behind the town hospital, the occasional 
helicopter flyovers, the federal agents in the restaurants and at 
weekend flea markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Bob Allison Campground, Pat Bonanno and Ronnie Davis were  
loading their two mules, Sadie and Daisy, and their horse, Sam, 
onto a trailer after camping about 200 feet from where Nordmann's 
truck was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonanno, who works for the Clay County Sheriff's Department,  
joked that they must have run into Rudolph while riding the horse 
trails leading to Nantahala Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swear I've seen him before all this,'' said Bonanno, who  
works part-time at a barber shop in nearby Warren. ``I might have 
cut his hair once or twice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cope wants Rudolph, 32, to get his day in court. ``All we have  
is one side of the story. We don't know his side yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he is guilty or not, Rudolph has impressed Cope with his  
resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Love him or hate him, I'd like to walk up to him and shake his  
hand,'' he said. ``I'd tell him he's done a hell of a job.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Helps South Ill. Peach Growers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- Stop complaining about those long, hot,  
dry days of summer. They're about to give you a big, sticky crop of 
sweet Southern Illinois peaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Orchard owners began picking early varieties of peaches last  
week, and by all indications, this year's yield will be bigger than 
last year's better-than-average crop -- with perfect conditions in 
southernmost Illinois making up for losses in other parts of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruit growers in Jackson and Union counties say the mild spring  
brought no frosts to kill off peach buds, and the warm, dry summer 
so far has been perfect for peach trees. 
</P>
<P>
	But brutal waves of winter cold washed over orchards from  
Madison County north in January, damaging the ability of peach 
trees from there to Michigan to set fruit in the spring, said Brad 
Taylor, an associate professor of plant and soil science at 
Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, growers expect to harvest very close to a full crop --  
well over last year's 7,500 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have so many peaches we're going to have to  
sell some to farmers' markets in St. Louis. We can't physically 
handle them all,'' said Larry Eckert, whose family owns a large 
pick-your-own orchard in St. Clair County. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Eckert said, this summer's crop could be the best his  
family has had in 20 years. Three years ago, the peach crop at 
Eckert's and other orchards was a complete loss. It has steadily 
improved since. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Flamm of Flamm Orchards in Cobden said the ideal weather  
conditions so far this summer should mean a more constant supply of 
fresh peaches throughout the summer. Different varieties mature at 
different times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the varieties last year were a little light, but this  
year, they're all full,'' he said. ``It looks like a good crop, a 
bumper crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mild winter and spring do mean more work for growers.  
Without harsh weather to kill off buds, some growers are taking to 
the orchards to sweep off young buds before they have a chance to 
blossom into fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Others will wait until the fruit begins growing to thin out the  
crop, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	That helps trees produce big, juicy peaches. But the weather has  
to cooperate, and so far it has. 
</P>
<P>
	Dry, hot, sunny weather helps peach trees produce fruit high in  
sugar and moderate in water -- meaning they will be sweet, juicy, 
and very peachy smelling. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Rifling through garbage cans and sneaking into  
unsuspecting people's homes, an exploding population of raccoons is 
making a nuisance of itself in suburbs and on farms all over 
Illinois this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	And believe it or not, officials say, the tumbling Russian ruble  
is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of the pesky critters' lives were spared  
last year as the devaluation of the Russian currency caused the 
demand for fur to plummet and many Illinois fur trappers to quit 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	That means more raccoons escaped to produce a bumper crop of  
kits this year, causing the population to grow from the typical 
nine to 45 per square mile to 101 raccoons per square mile in parts 
of McHenry, Kane and Cook counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about this from a global standpoint with wild fur as an  
agricultural product,'' said George Hubert, a wildlife biologist 
with the state Department of Natural Resources. ``Demand goes down, 
and harvests go down, which plays a substantial role in the 
population growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois -- one of the top five wild-fur exporting states --  
supplies up to 300,000 raccoon pelts to foreign countries. About 80 
percent of those pelts used to go to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Russia's banking system collapsed, Illinois' wild  
fur exports to the country dropped from $3 million in 1996 to $1 
million in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Is Selling to Amplifon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Looking to focus on eye care, Bausch &AMP;  
Lomb Inc. is selling its Miracle Ear hearing aid business to 
Amplifon SpA of Italy. The sales price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb will lose $17 million before taxes from the  
Miracle Ear sale, spokeswoman Holly Houston said Monday. Helping to 
offset the loss will be the $12 million profit from its recent sale 
of its sunglasses business to Luxottica Group SpA, Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miracle Ear, headquartered in Golden Valley, Minn., makes and  
sells hearing aids and related products through more than 1,000 
franchises and company locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amplifon, a privately held company, is the leading distributor  
and retailer of hearing aids in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb has been refocusing in recent years on eye care --  
contact lenses, ophthalmic drugs, eye surgery instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the divestiture of our hearing aid product line, we are  
close to completing our exit from those non-core businesses which 
do not leverage our heritage, brand name and technological 
competencies in the eye care field,'' said William M. Carpenter, 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bausch &AMP; Lomb hopes to sell by the end of the year its last  
non-core subsidiary, Charles River Laboratories, which breeds 
animals for medical research, Houston said.

<P>
	Winning the World Cup began paying dividends for the U.S.  
women's soccer team on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally scheduled to share $250,000 from the U.S. Soccer

winning the Cup. That breaks down to $50,000 per player instead of 
the $12,500 they originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Monday, the United States Olympic Committee said it was  
awarding $120,000 to the team -- $6,000 for each of the 20 players. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bristol Bay Salmon Feast Dimmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- It's been a bittersweet season for  
Bristol Bay's fishermen and for those whose living depends on their 
harvest in the world's richest sockeye salmon fishery. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this year, residents of Dillingham, King Salmon and a  
host of tiny nearby villages struggled through two seasons so 
dismal the region was declared a federal disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer the fish have returned, but seafood processors who  
have suffered right along with the fishermen now don't have enough 
capacity to handle the harvest fishermen could deliver. Fish that 
could cover past-due bills instead are headed upstream to spawn, 
die and rot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are a lot of people frustrated because they  
don't have a market for all the fish they can catch,'' said Terry 
Hefferle, chief of operations for the Bristol Bay Native 
Association in Dillingham. ``Those same folks have a feeling of 
relief that the fish came back this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big processing companies in Bristol Bay took in as many as  
44 million fish in the peak year of 1995, a catch that was worth 
$200 million. The average harvest during the past decade is 29 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	But farmed fish have radically cut into the market for the  
frozen and canned product that Bristol Bay processors produce. Then 
came the prolonged recession in Japan and the back-to-back seasons 
of poor Bristol Bay returns -- about 12 million salmon in 1997 and 
just 10 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Processors lost money, and they cut back.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bad news is the industry wasn't prepared for it based on  
the last two years of poor runs,'' said Chuck Bundrant, president 
of Trident Seafoods, one of the largest of the bay's dozen or so 
processors. ``In my case, we have half the capacity we normally 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Van Vactor, Bristol Bay manager for Peter Pan Seafoods,  
said his operation also has cut back in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The margins aren't there to speculate on the big years,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Processors in Bristol Bay can't simply bring in more workers and  
equipment when a big run materializes. Dillingham is about 350 
miles from Anchorage by air, and there are no roads. A trip around 
the tip of the Alaska Peninsula by ship covers perhaps a thousand 
miles. And the salmon run lasts only about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	So workers put in long shifts on the processing line, and some  
fish are shipped hundreds of miles to distant plants. 
</P>
<P>
	With an extremely perishable product, management biologists for  
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game last week decided to cut 
fishing periods instead of building up a glut of fish that would 
spoil before they could be canned or frozen. They would rather have 
extra fish going upriver to spawn -- even though too many spawners 
actually reduces survival rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the capacity of the processors that will determine how  
many fish we take,'' said Jeff Regnart, the regional management 
biologist in King Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	With the run about half over, fishermen have caught 15 million  
fish so far. That's a welcome change after the two bust years. 
</P>
<P>
	For local residents, the renewed health of the local industry  
run means renewed economic health. The region depends on its salmon 
harvests the way Iowa counties depend on the corn crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are going to make their boat payments, and pay  
down some of the credit that's been extended to them,'' said 
Hoefferle of the native association. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for some people, it's come too late.'' One fisherman lost  
his boat just a couple of weeks before the season began, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It a lot better than the last couple of years,'' said Homer  
grandmother Roseleen ``Snooks'' Moore, who has fished Bristol Bay 
for 15 years. ``At least people will go home with a paycheck.''

<HEADLINE> Miners Pay Price for Lackluster Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Gold's status as the ultimate store of value is  
fading, and miners in gold-producing nations are suffering from the 
effects of its plunging price. 
</P>
<P>
	A global gold selloff, hastened by the Bank of England's auction  
of 3.5 percent of its reserves last week, has sent prices down to 
their lowest level in a generation, triggering bankruptcies and 
street protests in South Africa and spreading gloom among miners 
from Uzbekistan to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	But gold is still coveted by many people around the world.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Benn, a 21-year-old London-based fitness instructor, said  
he still has faith in gold's inherent value. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gold is real. I can understand the solidness of gold -- its  
simplicity, its purity. It's just gold, rather than something 
symbolic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And gold's falling price has a bright side -- more lavish dowries  
in India and less expensive jewelry in shops in Asia. For many of 
the world's poor, faith in the metal that British economist John 
Maynard Keynes called a ``barbarous relic'' remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	To wealthier nations, the current era of low inflation and  
peaceful post-Cold War relations have eliminated gold's historic 
role as a solid investment with universal appeal and value. So, 
too, has the increasing popularity of investment alternatives, 
especially stock markets proliferating in rich and poor countries 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``The typical reasons for holding gold, at least in developed  
countries, don't exist anymore,'' said John Slater, a research 
economist at Britain's National Westminster Bank Group. ``Gold does 
not provide the function that it used to in terms of a hedge 
against inflation and as a haven against disruption in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain announced in May it planned to replace much of its gold  
holdings with higher-yielding assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds. 
Gold prices have plunged 11 percent since then. It closed at 
$257.70 a troy ounce in New York trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980 it reached a high of $875 during a period of global  
instability that provided a classic example of gold's value. Soviet 
troops had invaded Afghanistan, U.S. hostages were being held in 
Iran and oil prices were skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
	In coming months, prices are likely to drift lower as investors  
anticipate sales of gold by the International Monetary Fund and the 
central bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	To supporters of gold's traditional role, Britain's financial  
authorities ``have lost sight of the reason for having gold 
reserves in the first place -- they are the bastion of a nation's 
currency -- to be used in the last resort when paper money becomes 
unacceptable,'' said Haruko Fukuda of the World Gold Council, a 
London-based group financed by gold mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's decline is most troubling for poorer nations with  
comparatively big gold-mining industries, such as Uzbekistan, Mali 
and Papua New Guinea. Gold is Uzbekistan's second-biggest export 
after cotton, and it accounts for 8 percent of Mali's gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	At gold's current prices, sub-Saharan African countries,  
excluding South Africa, stand to earn $200 million less than 
expected this year. The IMF, which hopes to help poor countries 
with proceeds from its gold sales, will not be able to fill that 
gap, according to the World Gold Council. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa, the world's leading gold producer, has one of the  
highest average costs of production, at $246 per ounce. One of the 
country's oldest firms, East Rand Proprietary Mines, announced 
plans Wednesday to liquidate because it could no longer make a 
profit. The liquidation could cost 5,000 mining jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other mining companies want to lay off an additional 11,700  
workers, a step that prompted a large protest on Thursday in South 
Africa's capital, Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's economy is in an ``extremely precarious  
position,'' said David Munro, director of gold banking at The 
Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd. in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	But cheaper gold is welcome in developing countries that import  
the metal. Many Asians and Middle Easterners, wary of shaky banks 
and political uncertainty, are firm believers in hoarding gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold jewelry is now more affordable throughout East Asia, where  
the financial crisis that erupted two years ago in Thailand 
reinforced a widespread respect for gold as the safest of 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In India, a bride's family typically gives gifts of gold jewelry  
to the groom's parents. Anecdotal evidence suggests demand for gold 
in India has risen in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Asia, jewelry is now more affordable in  
pay-by-weight gold shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States currently holds half the world's gold  
reserves, but Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has played down the 
possibility that Washington might sell some of its 8,139 metric 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not think the United States should sell its gold, for a  
whole host of reasons,'' Rubin told the House Banking Committee in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Such words could help soothe tempers in U.S. gold mining states  
such as Nevada, where 8.86 million ounces were produced last year, 
an amount surpassed only by South Africa and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Settles For Fenway BP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tony Gwynn wasn't about to let a calf injury keep  
him from taking his hacks at Fenway Park's famous Green Monster. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being unable to play in this year's All-Star game, Gwynn  
took the trip to Boston just for the opportunity to take batting 
practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I did was look out at the wall,'' Gwynn said.  
``Man it is close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, a self-described baseball historian, bought a book on  
Fenway's history to read before heading out to the park for the 
first time. He read about the greats who played their careers at 
Fenway and the classic moments that took place here. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 18 years, this is the last park I really wanted to  
see,'' said Gwynn, who has spent his entire career in the NL with 
the San Diego Padres. ``I got to see Tiger Stadium and Yankee 
Stadium in the World Series. This might be my only chance to see 
Fenway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was most interested in the 37-foot wall that goes from the  
310-foot sign down the left-field line to the 379-foot marker in 
the power alley in left-center. Even though he is usually a right 
fielder, Gwynn was eager to field some balls off the monster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to see how the ball bounces off it,'' he said.  
``It's got the ladder, the scoreboard, a lot of different features. 
It will be fun to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what fans and Gwynn really want to see is how his classic,  
left-handed batting stroke handles Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	While most people think of right-handed sluggers hitting  
towering home runs over baseball's most famous boundary, there is a 
long history of lefties peppering the wall with opposite field line 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent was perhaps Wade Boggs, who is tied with  
Gwynn with 2,982 career hits -- 18 shy of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce Hurst used to tell me what a great park this would be  
for a left-hander like me,'' Gwynn said. ``I've seen what Boggs did 
here. Now I want to get a feel for myself what it's like to hit 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an unsuccessful first turn in the batting cage, Gwynn  
lined about five balls off the inviting target in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, that was fun,'' he said before heading out to field some  
balls in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, that's all the fans will see of Gwynn. San  
Diego's Bruce Bochy, who will manage the NL All-Stars, didn't want 
to take a chance with Gwynn's health in a game that didn't count. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to have Tony healthy for the rest of the year,''  
Bochy said. ``I wish he could play. The good news is we're going to 
get him back as soon as the break is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was hurt the first time on May 21 breaking out of the  
batter's box and missed 19 games. He came back on June 12 and 
played seven games, then sat out three. His calf bothered him as he 
pursued a fly ball in warmups and he went back on the disabled list 
June 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to get back playing,'' Gwynn said. ``People think  
it's because I want to get to 3,000. But I know I will get 18 hits. 
I just want to play.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Speaks at Ind. Memorial Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Haters are cowards who must be  
confronted until they back down, a solemn Attorney General Janet 
Reno said Monday at a memorial for a South Korean student killed in 
a two-state shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in this community came together to speak out against  
indifference. It was the right thing to do. This nation should 
follow your examples,'' Reno told the crowd of more than 1,400 who 
came to mourn Won-Joon Yoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon, an Indiana University doctoral student, died July 4  
outside his church as he entered services there. Authorities 
believe he was slain by white supremacist Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 
an undergraduate Indiana University student who committed suicide 
later that same day. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was one of several people who spoke at a public memorial  
service for Yoon in the university's Musical Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon's mother, Kang-Soon Lee, lit a candle onstage in memory of  
her son. Participants later planned to march to the Korean United 
Methodist Church where Yoon died. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall was filled to capacity. Those who couldn't find seats  
gathered around television sets in the lobby, while ushers handed 
out white ribbons at the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be with my community to stand against this kind of  
tragedy. You can't have this sense of detachment anymore. You have 
to stand up and say no,'' said Debarah Galyan of Bloomington, as 
she walked into the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, was a former member of the World Church of the  
Creator, a white-supremacist group based in East Peoria, Ill. He 
was believe responsible for shootings that left two people dead and 
nine others injured in Illinois and Indiana. All the victims were 
either black, Jewish or Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith later shot and killed himself in a struggle with police on  
an Illinois highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon, the only son among four children, came to Bloomington  
after earning a master's degree in economics from Southern Illinois 
University. His goal was to earn a doctorate and become a teacher.

<HEADLINE> Kasich May Drop White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio weighed the fate of  
his flagging presidential hopes Monday after signaling over the 
weekend he was considering quitting the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
no final decision had been made. But a fund-raising event 
originally scheduled for Monday in Seattle -- then canceled a week 
ago because of a poor response -- stood as a symbol of his faltering 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans said an announcement of Kasich's plans could  
come as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich pondered his future as another GOP presidential hopeful,  
Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, announced he was quitting the 
party. Smith thus became the first dropout of the campaign for the 
Republican nomination, although he said he was considering running 
on a third party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether Kasich intended to endorse  
front-running Texas Gov. George W. Bush or any other rival for the 
GOP nomination in the event of a withdrawal. But officials said 
there was no indication the 47-year-old Kasich was reconsidering 
his earlier tentative decision not to seek re-election to the House 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	While campaigning in New Hampshire over the weekend, Kasich was  
asked about reports he was considering abandoning his quest. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get to the point where we've made a decision and are  
going to talk about it, we'll let you know,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Todd Harris noted that, technically, Kasich has an  
exploratory committee and is not yet an officially declared 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been  
running hard for months, including several trips to Iowa and New 
Hampshire, site of next year's first caucus and primary, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his efforts, including widely noted speeches dealing  
with Social Security and government subsidies to business, Kasich 
was in low single digits in support in nationwide public opinion 
polls. His fund-raising efforts, like virtually everyone else's, 
were overwhelmed by Bush, who has said he collected a record $36.6 
million in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that if he stayed in the race, Kasich would be  
required to spend a significant portion of his remaining resources 
to compete in a non-binding straw poll in Iowa next month.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Goes After Federal Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGONA, Iowa (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes railed against the  
Federal Reserve's ``high priests of high finance'' Monday as his 
high-tech campaign bus caravan rumbled to the Chrome Country Inn 
blaring music and seeking recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is heaven on earth for a campaign,'' the Republican  
presidential candidate said as he hopped off the bus into a dusty 
parking lot. ``I wish it could happen every day.'' Over seven days, 
Forbes was headed to 26 of the state's 99 counties in a grinding 
effort to flex his campaign's organizational muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	That grass-roots network is considered crucial to success in a  
high-profile straw poll next month, and the state's leadoff 
precinct caucuses next winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes carefully selected a message for each day of the trip:  
the Federal Reserve on Monday, taxes on Tuesday, and abortion on 
Wednesday. His strategists created a high-tech rolling circus to 
take advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the Fed was being too tight with monetary policy,  
harming the farm economy. He called its members the ``high priests 
of high finance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monetary policy is a big issue in Iowa where commodity prices  
are low. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm one candidate who can take them on,'' said Forbes, a  
multimillionaire. ``I know the subject, I know the people. Bring 
them on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes drew solid crowds at stops like the Chrome Country Inn --  
a popular restaurant that served up meat loaf and mashed potatoes 
to about 150 local activists. 
</P>
<P>
	On their way into the luncheon, Forbes posed for photos with  
activists as aides clicked away with special digital cameras. 
Staffers retreated to the back of the bus, where a string of laptop 
computers and printers whirred away as Forbes spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	When the activists left, their photos with Forbes were on a  
table waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Forbes distributed pledge cards for those  
interested. Motoring between stops, aides began working the five 
telephone lines in the bus ``Victory Express II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so competitive,'' said Steve Grubbs, a consultant who  
designed the field operation. 
</P>
<P>
	While Forbes was hammered the last time he ran for running a  
television-only campaign, he vowed to employ the very latest 
techniques this time to build from the grassroots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a field operation and we're going to have  
a television operation,'' said Grubbs. 
</P>
<P>
	That can be important because the number of people active in  
caucus politics is relatively small, and a tightly organized 
campaign can have a disproportionate impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes proclaimed himself delighted.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every day you get people who are genuinely interested, taking  
a real look and making up their minds,''' said Forbes. ``It's not 
something you blaze at them on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Clark is the local county Republican Chairman and he's  
signed on to Forbes' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've noticed the difference,'' he said. ``People in Iowa want  
to see you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by wife, Sabina, and the youngest of his five  
daughters, Forbes says he's having the time of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy hearing the questions, hearing how people react,'' he  
said. ``You can feel the thing, it's not like going on TV where you 
have no idea how the audience is reacting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can feel the thing, you can feel it and draw energy from  
it,'' said Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bus inhabitants were not suffering. A fully stocked kitchen and  
refrigerator was complimented by bowls of candy, mints and nuts -- 
restocked, of course, after every stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Before start his day, Forbes recorded a radio blurb, and aide  
K.B. Forbes worked the phone in the back of the bus peddling it to 
local radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We usually get 20 to 50 takers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, other aides take photos of Forbes with local  
dignitaries, passing them along to local newspapers who might not 
have photographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will leave no stone unturned,'' said Grubbs.

<HEADLINE>  37 Hurt in Central American Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake injured at least 37  
people in eastern Guatemala and shattered windows and cracked walls 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's magnitude at  
6.6; Guatemala's Seismological Station estimated the magnitude at 
6.1. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake, which occurred at 8:14 a.m. Sunday, was felt across  
Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary reports indicated the quake was centered about 20  
miles east of the Guatemalan coast city of Puerto Barrios, 
according to Jim Taggart, a geophysicist with the survey's National 
Earthquake Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 37 people were reported injured, many with broken  
bones, in the eastern Guatemalan province of Izabal, Vice Gov. 
Adolfo Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads buckled and buildings cracked at a temporary U.S. military  
base in Puerto Barrios, said Lt. Col. Jeff Keane, a U.S. Army 
reservist who was across the border in Honduras when the quake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in a building. The building started shaking and  
telephone poles began tilting as the ground trembled. It lasted 
over a minute,'' Keane told The Associated Press by telephone from 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 U.S. Army reservists from Massachusetts and  
Connecticut are stationed in Puerto Barrios, about 150 miles 
northeast of Guatemala City, to help build schools and repair 
infrastructure damaged by Hurricane Mitch, Keane said. The schools 
they are building appeared not to be damaged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of injuries at either base in Guatemala or  
Honduras. But aftershocks continued Sunday in Puerto Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake damaged buildings in eastern Guatemala, including  
the Our Lady of the Trinity church in Chiquimula, 90 miles 
southwest of Puerto Barrios. Windows shattered at the international 
airport at Santa Elena and the Guatemalan air force base, both in 
the northern province of Peten. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also cut power to towns in Guatemala's northern and  
eastern regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala's disaster-relief agency was surveying the rest of the  
nation for any further damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Honduras, the quake caused minor damage, such as cracked  
walls at a hospital in the northern city of El Progresso and fallen 
electrical poles along the north coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quake alarmed Hondurans but did not cause deaths or  
injuries ... only fear,'' said Jose Zelaya, a Red Cross spokesman 
in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Seismologists in El Salvador said the quake lasted one minute 10  
seconds and was felt across their country. The Red Cross in El 
Salvador told local radio there were no reports of damage or 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was felt as far away as the Mexican city of  
Villahermosa, 330 miles northwest of Puerto Barrios.

<HEADLINE>  37 Hurt in Central American Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake injured at least 37  
people in eastern Guatemala and shattered windows and cracked walls 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's magnitude at  
6.6; Guatemala's Seismological Station estimated the magnitude at 
6.1. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake, which occurred at 8:14 a.m. Sunday, was felt across  
Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary reports indicated the quake was centered about 20  
miles east of the Guatemalan coast city of Puerto Barrios, 
according to Jim Taggart, a geophysicist with the survey's National 
Earthquake Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 37 people were reported injured, many with broken  
bones, in the eastern Guatemalan province of Izabal, Vice Gov. 
Adolfo Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads buckled and buildings cracked at a temporary U.S. military

<HEADLINE> Differences in the HMO Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Senate Democrats and Republicans each have a ``patients' bill of  
rights,'' but there are significant differences. A rundown: 
</P>
<P>
                          *WHO IS COVERED?   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Cover all Americans who have private health insurance  
-- an estimated 161 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Many provisions only apply to 48 million Americans  
who are in plans that are regulated only by federal law. This 
includes greater access to emergency rooms, specialists and 
medications and the right to choose a health plan that allows them 
to use doctors who are outside a defined network. 
</P>
<P>
                            *RIGHT TO SUE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Give patients who are harmed by the denial of care  
the right to sue their health insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Give no new rights to sue.  
</P>
<P>
                  *OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Allow women to see OB-GYN doctors without prior  
approval or to designate them as a primary care physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow women to see them without prior approval.  
Only applies to federally regulated plans. 
</P>
<P>
                        *EMERGENCY ROOM CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Require health plans to pay for reasonable care even  
if the hospital is outside the network. That includes care needed 
to stabilize the patient and to treat whatever is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Require payment only for stabilization. Only  
applies to federally regulated plans. 
</P>
<P>
                          *CLINICAL TRIALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Require health plans to pay the routine health care  
costs associated with clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Require a study of the issue.  
</P>
<P>
                         *MEDICAL NECESSITY   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Define medical necessity as care that is consistent  
with generally accepted principles of professional medical 
practice. Prohibits plans from interfering with a doctor's care if 
the services being performed are medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow plans to continue determining what care is  
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
                            *MASTECTOMY   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Require that health plans pay for overnight hospital  
stays if doctor and patient want it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: No provision.  
</P>
<P>
                            *TAX CHANGES   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: No provision.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow people who are self-employed to deduct the  
cost of health insurance. Allow more medical savings accounts, 
which let people to set aside money, tax-free, to pay for routine 
care if they buy a high-deductible insurance policy in case of an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
                             *APPEALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health plans to allow patients to appeal denials,  
first through an internal process and then to experts outside the 
plan. Details differ. 
</P>
<P>
                      *INFORMATION DISCLOSURE   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health insurance companies to disclose details  
about what they cover and how they operate.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Glavine Misses Homecoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Most major league players welcome the three-day  
All-Star break. Not Tom Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time Atlanta Braves All-Star makes no bones about it:  
he'd rather be pitching Tuesday at Boston's Fenway Park, a short 
25-minute drive from where he grew up in Billerica, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he'll be watching the game on TV while spending time  
with his family in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not making the All-Star team is a disappointment. The fact  
that it is in Fenway adds to it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, the winningest left-hander of the last 11 years with  
180 victories, struggled in the early part of this season and was 
3-7 before regaining the form that earned him NL Cy Young Awards in 
1991 and 1998. Now he is 7-8 with a 4.14 ERA after winning four of 
his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far it has been two seasons,'' Glavine said. ``The first  
six weeks weren't very good. The last six weeks have been really 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had no decision Saturday in Atlanta's 2-1, 11-inning win over  
Boston, when he went nine innings and gave up one run and six hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's easy for people to look up and say I'm having a  
bad year and struggling, but I'm not struggling right now,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes it even more difficult to accept his absence from the  
All-Star scene for the first time in four years. Plus, this is 
likely to be the last All-Star game at Fenway Park before it is 
torn down for a new park. 
</P>
<P>
	``To play an All-Star game at Fenway would have been a big, big  
thrill for me,'' Glavine said. ``But I'm not going to be there and 
I'm not going to dwell on it. I'll just hang around with my family, 
relax and watch the game on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1995, the Braves will send only two  
players to the game -- outfielder Brian Jordan and pitcher Kevin 
Millwood, both making it for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves have had at least six players on the NL squad --  
including Glavine -- in each of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, batting .295 with 17 home runs and a team-high 71 RBIs,  
has adequately filled in as the cleanup hitter for Andres 
Galarraga, who has been battling cancer since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, a 24-year-old in only his second full year with the  
Braves, is 11-4 with a five-game winning streak and a 3.20 ERA.
