<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Fully Implement Peace Accord in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government vowed
Tuesday to pursue the full implementation of a 1996 peace
agreement it forged with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
with or without Nur Misuari as the governor of the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre made this clear as
he said efforts to develop Mindanao must be based on institutions,
and not on personalities.
</P>
<P>
"We should pursue the peace agreement because it is beyond
personalities. We continue our obligations there, these are our
obligations to our people in the Muslim areas," Aguirre said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that pushing through with the government-MNLF
peace process despite the problem regarding Misuari would be one
of his recommendations to President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Misuari has remained abroad after attending the OIC meeting
where he and Aguirre presented clashing views on the government's
implementation of the 1996 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, also chair of the MNLF, accused the government of
reneging on its promise under the 1996 agreement to implement a
meaningful autonomy for Muslims in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who came from the 27th foreign ministers conference of
the OIC in Kuala Lumpur, said Misuari deserved to be censured not
only for his conduct during the OIC meeting, but also for his
failure to perform his functions as governor.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said it is also likely that Misuari would be forced to
step down as ARMM governor by September as President Estrada would
be given a free hand to appoint somebody else as interim governor
until the elections in May 2001.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Denies Knowledge About Party Leader's Talks With Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's deposed prime minister
Nawaz Sharif has said that he was not aware of meetings between
Pakistan's military ruler General Pervez Musharraf and the acting
leader of his Pakistan Muslim League (PML) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at the Attock Fort Accountability Court,
which is in the proximity of Islamabad, on Tuesday, Sharif refused
to confirm that Raja Zafar ul Haq sought his permission for the
meeting and simply stated that he was not aware of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, he said PML, the former ruling party, will remain
united and it will be impossible for any person to divide it.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister, who has been rewarded life
imprisonment in a hijacking case, is being tried in a corruption
case.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, chief executive of Pakistan, on Monday
started meetings with the country's leading political leaders in a
move to bridge the gulf between the regime and the parties.
</P>
<P>
His meeting with Haq, the No. 2 person in PML only second to
Sharif who is in jail, was his first meeting with any PML leader
since the military coup in October last year.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Haq said he will inform Sharif of the meeting.
"Of course, I cannot tell all," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Envoy Arrives For Talks With Indian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jayakody, Sri Lankan minister for Buddhist Sasana, Culture and
Religion Affairs, also came to thank the Indian government for the
moral support New Delhi had extended to Colombo during the counter-
offensive by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in northern
Jaffna, the PTI noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is on a three-day visit, will call on Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh on Wednesday, it added.
</P>
<P>
Carrying a letter from Kumaratunga to Vajpayee, the minister is
accompanied by K. Balapatabendi, secretary to the Sri Lankan
president, and Senake Bandaranayake, Sri Lanka's ambassador to
France.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president proposes to send special envoys
shortly to six other countries, including China, Pakistan, Israel,
the United States and Russia, to thank them for the support
extended to her government to tide over the crisis, the PTI
reported.
</P>
<P>
India decided to extend a 100 million dollar credit facility to
Sri Lanka during Jaswant Singh's recent visit to Colombo, but had
firmly ruled out any military intervention in the island nation.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Government Calls for Self-Censorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government Tuesday
called for media organizations to exercise self-censorship
following a reintroduced censorship on the local and foreign media.
</P>
<P>
However, "if you have any doubt on any articles before they
being published send those to the censor board for scrutiny," said
Director of Information Ariya Rubasinghe, the chief censor.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka on Monday reintroduced censorship on the local and
foreign media under an extraordinary gazette notification issued
by President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled last Friday that the blanket censorship
imposed on May 3 when Tamil Tiger rebels stepped up attacks in the
northern Jaffna peninsula was illegal as the censor was not
properly appointed.
</P>
<P>
Rubasinghe said that censorship is necessary since the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and government
troops were poised for a major confrontation in Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The notification said all war-related news and whatever else
the government considered to be against national interests or
detrimental to the preservation of public order would be covered
under the new censorship.
</P>
<P>
It said media could not report military operations, procurement
of arms, details of deployment of troops, or news that might
affect the morale of the troops.
</P>
<P>
Institutions violating the new sets of the regulations will be
punished according to the new gazette notification, said
Rubasinghe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka tightened security in Colombo on Tuesday
amid reports that some 25 LTTE's suicide bombers, known as Black
Tigers, had infiltrated the capital to assassinate political
leaders ahead of the 13th anniversary of the first suicide mission
carried out by a Black Tiger.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels staged their first suicide attack on July 5,
1987 when a rebel called Captain Miller drove a truck packed with
explosives and devastated the Nelliyadi army camp in the Jaffna
peninsula, killing some 40 people.

DHAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- An agreement was signed here Tuesday
on operating trains on Benapole-Petrapole route between Bangladesh

has already been established with introduction of bus service
between Calcutta and Dhaka in June last year.

MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Two people have been killed as
Tropical Depression Edeng and Typhoon Ditang continued to raze the
central and northern Philippines, the Philippine National Disaster
Coordinating Council (NDCC) said Tuesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report said a 27-year-old man and a 3-year-old boy were
drown in the flood caused by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC also said more than 400 hundred families in Metro
Manila have moved to different evacuation centers set up by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Most schools in Metro Manila were suspended Tuesday because
some roads were not passable.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Philippine President Estrada ordered
cabinet members to immediately extend the necessary assistance to
flood-hit residents in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical
Services Administration said the bad weather will continue in the
next few days and residents in low-lying areas are advised to

<HEADLINE> Three-way Summit Announcement Evokes Mixed Reactions in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli politicians Wednesday
evening reacted variedly toward U.S. President Bill Clinton's
announcement that a three-way summit among the Palestinian, Israeli
and U.S. leaders will be held early next week near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will attend the summit in Camp David, where
Israel and Egypt reached their landmark peace deal in 1979, the
first peace accord between the Jewish state and an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who met Britain Prime Minister Tony Blair and French
President Jacques Chirac early Wednesday in a lightning visit, said
in Paris that he will attend the summit to try to hammer out a
final peace deal with the Palestinians ahead of the September
deadline.
</P>
<P>
The deal will resolve interim issues between the two sides, as
well as so-called final-status issues, such as the fate of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy issued remarks with
a reserved tone following Clinton's announcement in White House.
</P>
<P>
He told Israel Radio that the differences between Israel and the
Palestinians are still substantial, and the Palestinians adopted
rigid negotiation stands in the talks, which will make the summit
have little chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai, leader of the
pivotal Shas party in Barak's ruling coalition, called on Barak to
convene his cabinet and coalition party leaders immediately to mark
off Israel's "red lines", or conditions Israel should never cross
in any peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Yishai added that he will not join the Israeli delegation to
Camp David as Barak had expected, because Shas's policy-making
Council of Torah Sages would meet to discuss the newly developments
in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky announced at a Jerusalem
gathering Wednesday evening that his party, Yisrael Ba'aliya, had
resigned from Barak's coalition because of "the confirmation of a
Clinton-Barak-Arafat summit."
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Levy, leader of the National Religious Party, also said
that his party will hold a meeting as soon as possible to decide if
it will also resign from the coalition as it had threatened last
month against the planned summit.
</P>
<P>
The leave of the two right-wing parties, who hold nine seats in
Israel's 120-member Knesset, will made Barak's coalition shrink
from a 68 parliamentary majority to a 59 minority.
</P>
<P>
However, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the most dovish
figures in Barak's cabinet, told CNN that the two parties' bow-out
will not affect the negotiations, as the peace camp in Israel will
unite behind Barak to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said: "They have been never so close (to reach a peace
deal)...... the gaps are wide there, the difference is there ahead
of us, but never in the past, the difference between the
Palestinians'
views and Israeli views is so small."
</P>
<P>
"That's what is making me hopeful about the summit. I believed
the summit has more than 50 percent prospects to succeed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid, who resigned as Education
Minister last month to appease the Shas party in a coalition
crisis, said that the summit would be "the last chance for peace
with the Palestinians ...... and that chance must be used."
</P>
<P>
He added that his party will back Barak if he works for peace,
regardless of past events. "Meretz trusts Barak to arrive at the
best agreement and will support any agreement signed," Sarid said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Acquits 77 of Rioting After Road Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian security court acquitted
on Wednesday all 77 people charged with rioting four months ago
after a speeding truck killed a teen-age girl, the country's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The March unrest in Mit Nema, a village about 15 kilometers
north of Cairo, erupted after a truck hit and killed Samah Mustafa,
16, on a highway. Villagers seized the driver of the truck, beat
him severely and set fire to his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The driver is awaiting trial on manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
Abdu Ahmed Atiya, a judge at the Qalyubiya Governorate State
Security Court in Benha, pronounced the villagers innocent for lack
of
evidence, after they were accused of using violence against the
police, stopping traffic and endangering the transport system.
</P>
<P>
The court's verdict, read by Atiya, said that more than 2,000
people took part in the riots and that it was unreasonable to
pinpoint those who damaged public property.
</P>
<P>
The verdict said that some of the defendants are dumb or deaf,
while others were arrested because they happened to be in the area
at the time of the unrest.
</P>
<P>
The rioters set fire on a police van, a fire engine and a paper
factory, disrupting traffic in the area for several hours. They
also placed huge rocks on the railway tracks, blocking trains for
about an hour.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Contribute to Success of Three-way Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the relevant
international resolutions would help render successful the upcoming
U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian summit slated for next Tuesday at Camp
David near Washington, said a senior Palestinian official
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Palestinian cabinet Minister
of International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said he could not predict
the results of the summit. However, he believed that U.S. President
Bill Clinton would do his best to make the anticipated summit
successful.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced Wednesday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would meet him next
Tuesday at Camp David in a bid to bring closer the positions of the
two sides on the final status issues.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is ready to attend the summit, said Shaath,
reiterating that the summit should be centered on peace only.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the Israeli side for blocking the peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians following a recent visit by U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side holds good intentions to move the peace
talks forward with a view to peace with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better to properly prepare for this summit in order
to head off fiasco as happened during the Geneva summit between
Clinton and late President Hafez al-Assad of Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians crossed their fingers that an agreement will be
reached ahead of the summit, said Shaath, calling on the Israeli
side to be earnest in making the summit a success, and to abide by
the international resolutions especially the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242, which may help the expected summit produce results.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are racing against time in working
out a framework agreement on permanent peace ahead of the self-
imposed deadline of September 13.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Albright Discuss Trilateral Summit on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday discussed over telephone with United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright a planned U.S.-Palestinian-Israeli summit
aimed at pushing forward the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation initiated by Albright, she
briefed Mubarak on U.S. President Bill Clinton's announcement that
a trilateral summit will be held near Washington to seek a
breakthrough in the peace negotiations, Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced at the White House earlier in the day that
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will meet with him next week at the presidential retreat of
Camp David to try to reach a final peace agreement by mid-
September.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Albright also exchanged views on a number of issues
under discussion between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have set September 13 as the target
date to finally resolve the thorniest issues including borders,
Jerusalem, refugees, Jewish settlements and water. The two sides
have made little progress.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
in 1979, plays an active role in mediating between the Palestinians
and the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Outlines Policy On Three-way Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has accepted U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to attend the
three-way summit slated for next Tuesday in Camp David, said the
Prime Minister's Office in a short statement on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation headed by Barak will discuss and resolve
the final-status issues with the Palestinian side at the summit in
a spirit of good-will and with a sense of responsibility so that
the two sides can reach a peace agreement on all issues in the
final-status talks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But, the Israeli delegation will only sign a peace agreement
that strengthens Israeli national interests and security, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced earlier on Wednesday the holding of the three-
way summit between himself, Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, which is aimed at reaching a framework agreement on the
final-status issues such as Jerusalem, refugees, settlements,
border, water ahead of the September 13 target for a final peace.
</P>
<P>
The announcement has sparked mixed reactions among Barak's
coalition partners and political parties in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky of Yisrael Ba'aliya, Barak's
coalition partner with four members of the Knesset (parliament),
announced his party has decided to withdraw from the coalition and
he will submit the withdrawal letter to Barak during next Sunday's
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky blamed Barak for keeping the coalition party leaders
in the dark about the ongoing Israeli-palestinian final-status
talks. He also accused Barak of making too much concessions to the
Palestinians regarding territorial transfer.
</P>
<P>
The largest coalition partner Shas called on Barak to finalize
with his coalition the "red lines" not to be crossed in the
negotiations with the Palestinians, but Shas Party leader Eli
Yishai will not be joining the delegation to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party said the party will leave the
coalition if Barak goes to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party Likud has prepared a non-confidence motion
in Barak in the Knesset to express its strong opposition to the
summit.
</P>
<P>
But Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid said the summit will be "the
last chance for peace with the Palestinians...and that chance must
be used."
</P>
<P>
Sarid added the party "trusts Barak to arrive at the best
agreement possible and will support any agreement signed."
</P>
<P>
Barak said on Wednesday he will attend a three-way summit to try
to work out a peace agreement with the Palestinians ahead of a
September target for a final peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Israeli Embassy in Paris, Barak told reporters
that "this is undoubtedly an important moment in the history of the
attempt to solve the conflict between us and the Palestinians,"
reported Israeli Radio.
</P>
<P>
"I will take my place at the head of our delegation to Camp
David next week with a heavy feeling of responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat will also attend the summit, a senior
palestinian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We committed to (U.S. Secretary of State) Madeleine Albright
when she came here that when President Clinton invites us to a
summit we would accept, and we accepted," Palestinian Minister of
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
Barak was in Paris to hold talks with French President Jacques
Chirac on the Middle East peace process after visiting British
Prime Minister Tony Blair in London earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Barak was due to return home later on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A 38-year-old man died after
collapsing during the Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta, a Fourth of
July tradition that drew 55,000 runners in sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in the 31 years of the race that a runner
has died.
</P>
<P>
Alvin Gains collapsed after running about four miles of the 6.2-
mile course, said Dr. John Wilson, one of the event's medical
coordinators.
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a tragedy," said Wilson, who described the
cause of death only as a "cardiac situation."
</P>
<P>
Ten others were taken to Piedmont Hospital for illnesses and
injuries. At least two became ill from the heat, one was hit by a
car while bicycling to the race and broke a wrist.
</P>

In 1993, Charles Tutterow, 40, died of a heart attack he
suffered during the race. The first death occurred a decade ago,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soccer Team Refused Entry by Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. soccer team was banned
from entering Tehran as a retaliation for the fingerprinting of
Iranians visiting the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bahram Afsharzadeh, deputy of Iran's Physical Education
Organization, said Wednesday that the Foreign Ministry intervened
to bar the Americans from playing in a July 9-11 tournament on
Kish, a resort island in the southern Gulf and one of three
Iranian free-trade zones.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Iran would hold the tournament at a later,
undisclosed date without the American team, which is two divisions
below Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
Afsharzadeh said Iran wanted improved sports contacts with the
United States but said "America's unfriendly behavior" was an
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to welcome American teams and treat them in a
friendly and civilized way and we expect the same from the
Americans," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fingerprinting Iranians is considered an insult against the
Iranian nation. We expect the United States to waive the
fingerprinting formality and show respect for Iranians to allow
improved sports contacts," he explained.
</P>
<P>
U.S. immigration officials waived the fingerprinting formality
in January to allow a soccer match between the two countries in
Pasadena, California, but only after Iran threatened to cancel the
match.
</P>
<P>
Last month, seven Iranian women refused to be fingerprinted
upon arriving in New York to attend a U.N. conference and returned
home after U.S. immigration officials insisted on the procedure.
</P>
<P>
Several Iranian groups have called on the Iranian government to
retaliate by fingerprinting Americans upon their arrival in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law requires non-immigrant visitors from four
countries with whom it has strained ties -- Iran, Iraq, Libya and
Sudan -- to be fingerprinted and photographed on arrival in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Poll: More Germans Turn Against Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Germans are losing patience with
the weak euro and only 31 percent of them are in favor of the
common European currency, a poll organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Institute for Public Opinion Research based in Allenbach
reported some 50 percent Germans had turned against euro in a
latest poll among 2,113 plain Germans.
</P>
<P>
In east Germany, 60 percent of the people asked gave a
negative comment on euro, while in western states the number was
47 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only 21 percent of the respondents said they trusted the euro
"much" or "very much." A year ago, the number was 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
That made a sharp contrast to the period between year 1997 and
year 1999, when the number of euro-favorites grew from 21 percent
to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The institute attributed the turning of public impression of
euro to its long-standing weakness that compelled Germans to pay
more for imported goods and overseas traveling.

<HEADLINE> New Economy, Still Rich Country Phenomenon: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the process of concentration of "knowledge power," will the
first-mover advantage gained by the more advanced players become
irreversible? asked the report prepared by the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The answer to the question is being given by delegates to a
three-day high-level meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council, themed "development and international cooperation in the
21st century: the role of information technology (IT) in the
context of a knowledge-based global economy."
</P>
<P>
Differential access to the Internet is much more pronounced
than national income inequalities across the world, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Figures and facts show that the fifth of the world's people
living in the highest income countries have 86 percent of the
world's GDP but 93 percent of Internet users, while the bottom
fifth have 1 percent of GDP and only 0.2 percent of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
The digital divide is also reflected in the production of
information technology, with 55 countries now accounting for 99
percent of world spending on IT production.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ongoing process of globalization helps to
consolidate the first-mover advantage of the developed nations,
thus making it difficult for developing countries to reap real
benefits from the production of IT.
</P>
<P>
The distribution of Internet bandwidth is another indicator of
the differential access, as more than 98 percent of global
bandwidth at the inter-regional level is currently connected to
North America.
</P>
<P>
North America, especially the United States, operates as the
hub of Internet traffic while developing countries have to make
payments for traffic exchange and connectivity to U.S.
telecommunications carriers.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement merely exacerbates the differential access to
IT in the context of developing nations' foreign exchange
constraints.
</P>
<P>
Unless radical and decisive action is taken, the differential
access to information and knowledge will become much more acute,
said the report, which called for collaborative effort involving
governments, multilateral and bilateral donors as market forces
cannot solve the problem alone.

<HEADLINE> Robust Growth Expected for Asia-Pacific Data Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The deployment of data
communications in Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, is expected to
remain strong throughout the next five years, a U.S. market
research firm predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Given the resiliency witnessed between 1998 and 1999, the
overall data communications market, including network adapters,
hubs, switches, routers, remote access servers and WAN switches,
in the region is expected to reach 9 billion U.S. dollars by 2004,
an annual growth rate of 23 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
The research firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
attributed the growth to continuing economic resurgence, renewed
investments by both government sector and enterprise,
telecommunications industry liberation and substantial increases
in Internet usage.
</P>
<P>
Aided by the strong growth in switches and routers, IDC said,
the LAN market for the region is likely to see robust growth of 18
percent over the forecast period to reach 5.8 billion dollars by
2004. In terms of products, switches will continue to remain the
fastest-growing segment and reach 3.3 billion dollars in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The region's remote access market is expected to more than
quadruple in the next five years, from 300 million dollars in 1999
to 1.4 billion dollars in 2004. Lack of an installed base in
emerging markets coupled with voice and data convergence trends
throughout the region will be the primary market drivers,
according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
China will remain one the key growth markets in the region, IDC
said. Australia and South Korea will continue to be the major
markets due to growing opportunity in the telecommunications and
Internet sectors. India will be the fatest-growing country and its
contribution to the region is expected to grow rapidly with the
opening up of the Internet industry and thus likely increased
awareness and demand for leading-edge technologies, IDC added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Signs Two Protocols on Child Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday singed at the Headquarters of the United Nations in
New York two U.N. protocols on child rights.
</P>
<P>
The two protocols, adopted by the United Nations General
Assembly in May, are the Optional Protocol to the Convention on
the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child
prostitution and child pornography and the Optional Protocol to
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of
children in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The optional protocol on the sale of children, child
prostitution and child pornography focuses on the criminalization
of these violations of children's rights and emphasizes the need
for increased public awareness and international cooperation in
efforts to combat them.
</P>
<P>
The optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed
conflict, among other provisions, makes 18 the minimum age for
compulsory induction into the armed forces. Fifteen is the current
minimum age.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the signing ceremony, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General,
Frechette Louise, expressed the hope that the United States would
also be able to ratify these protocols and, of course, ratify the
Convention on the Rights of Child.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Appeals Court Upholds Former Islamic Premier's Imprisonment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Appeals Court Wednesday
upheld a one-year imprisonment sentence imposed on Necmettin
Erbakan, former prime minister and leader of the outlawed Islamic
Welfare Party, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court unanimously approved the sentence, which was made by
the Diyarbakir State Security Court (DGM) for "inciting hatred and
animosity among people on the basis of racial, religious and social
class differences."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan took office as prime minister in June 1996. One year
later, he was forced to resign under heavy pressures from the
powerful military and other parties, which accused his pro-Islamic
cabinet of implementing anti-secular domestic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the Constitutional Court ordered the closure of
the Welfare Party for its violation of secularism stipulated in the
constitution, while Erbakan and other leaders of the party were
banned from politics for a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey sticks to secular, democratic and
nationalist principles, set up by the republic's founder Kemal
Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
The DGM charged Erbakan with instigating religious hatred in a
speech which he delivered in eastern Bingol province on February
25, 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Erbakan said that "laws in Turkey will be made by
infidels, who do not allow women to wear headscarf. We will not be
slaves to the Christians. We will be for the World Islamic Union."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was also criticized for opposing Turkey's efforts to
join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's lawyers said on Wednesday that they would request a "
correction of verdict" after the appeals court notifies the
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Naci Unver, head of the appeals court's criminal department,
said that Erbakan has the right to apply for a "correction of
verdict", but his application needs to be approved by the court's
prosecutor's office. If approved, the application will then be
reviewed by the court's criminal department.
</P>
<P>
If the prosecutor's office overturns his appeal, the legal
procedure will be completed and Erbakan will be put behind bars.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Bulent Arinc, acting chairman of the pro-
Islamic opposition Virtue Party's Deputies Group, said,"Turkey can
not and should not put a former prime minister in prison in 2000s."
</P>
<P>
"I felt profound sorrow and shame. Imprisonment of a person at
the age of 75 who served Turkey as a prime minister, due to a
sentence in his speech, will put Turkey in a difficult situation in
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of Virtue Party Mehmet Bekaroglu said at a press
briefing that the approval was made to detach people's attention
over the government's failed efforts to curb the chronic inflation,
which is putting a strain on the public.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was implementing a three-year economic stability program,
in which the government promised to reduce inflation to 20 percent
in 2000, 10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
But the annual inflation still stood at 58.6 percent in June of
this year, down from 68.9 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
He said that this move will put Turkey in a "bad" position in
front of the world, and negatively affect Turkey's accession
process to the EU.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Daily Oil Export Tops 2.45 Million Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- With an increase in oil production
starting July 1, Iran's oil export has topped 2.45 million barrels
per day (bpd) this month, an oil official announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in production and export is in line with the
agreement reached among members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) in June, said Deputy Managing Director
of the National Iranian Oil Company Hojatollah Qanimifard.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran will coordinate its policies with other
OPEC members to stabilize the international oil market, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers agreed to raise the organization's oil output
ceiling by 708,000 bpd to reach 25.4 million bpd in their June
meeting in Vienna. Iraq was excluded from the agreement as it is
under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with its quota within the OPEC agreement, Iran
announced on July 1 that it would increase the output by 104,000
bpd from the original level of some 3.7 million barrels. All the
increased will be exported.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the second largest producer after Saudi Arabia within
OPEC, is opposed to increasing output by a large scale, maintaining
that the oil supply to the world market is not so insufficient as
some people have calculated.
</P>
<P>
On the high oil price in the U.S. market, Qanimifard said it was
due to the need for new gasoline or the so-called "green gasoline"
as well as a lack of refinery facilities for the product.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iran's Oil Ministry also expressed its opposition to
unilateral output hike by OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members have decided a legal output hike through their
agreement, so there is no reason for any member state to
unilaterally make extra increase in production, an unnamed official
from the ministry was quoted by IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official also denied reports that Saudi Arabia would
increase output unilaterally by 500,000 bpd to reduce the oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that under the U.S. pressure, Saudi Arabia was
planning in conjunction with other producers to raise output in a
matter of days if high prices do not come down to satisfactory
levels.

<HEADLINE> Tehran, Cairo in Agreement on Expanding Ties: Iranian MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Amid a thaw in the relations frozen
for more than two decades, a senior Iranian parliamentary official
said here on Wednesday his country and Egypt are in agreement on
boosting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been taking steps aimed at expanding the
bilateral ties, Mohsen Mirdamadi, chairman of the Iranian
parliament's foreign affairs committee, said after meeting with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Mirdamadi, who was leading Iran's delegation to an Islamic
parliaments conference in Cairo, also said the bilateral ties are
proceeding in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed its diplomatic ties with Egypt after the latter
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and then gave shelter to
the former Shah, who was deposed in Iran's Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts exerted in the past few years have significantly
improved the ties.
</P>
<P>
Moussa met Mirdamadi after talks in Kuala Lumpur last week with
Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on the sidelines of a
foreign ministers meeting of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said last Sunday Egypt and Iran have held high-level
talks aimed at normalizing the ties, which he added "are making
progress."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on June 21, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami held a telephone conversation in
the first direct contact between leaders of the two countries since
1979.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said on Wednesday he will attend a three-way summit slated for next
week in the United States to try to work out a peace agreement with
the Palestinians ahead of a September target for a final peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Israeli Embassy in Paris, Barak told reporters
that "this is undoubtedly an important moment in the history of the
attempt to solve the conflict between us and the Palestinians,"
reported Israeli Radio on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I will take my place at the head of our delegation to Camp
David next week with a heavy feeling of responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced at the White House on
Wednesday he will call the summit with Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat early next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat will also attend the summit, a senior
palestinian official said in the same day.
</P>
<P>
"We committed to (U.S. Secretary of State) Madeleine Albright
when she came here that when President Clinton invites us to a
summit we would accept, and we accepted," Palestinian cabinet
Minister of International Cooperation Nabil Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
Barak was in Paris to hold talks with French President Jacques
Chirac on the Middle East peace process after visiting British
Prime Minister Tony Blair in London earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Barak was due to return home later on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Lifting of U.N. Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will do its best to urge
the United Nations to lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq ever since
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Pakistani Minister of Oil and Natural
Resources Ausman Amien Al-Dien said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dien made the remarks while meeting with Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Al-Dien criticized the continuation of the
sanctions, saying Pakistan will make efforts to alleviate the
sufferings of the Iraqi people, who have been the hardest hit by
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani minister expressed willingness to promote economic
cooperation between Pakistan and Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ramadan appreciated the stand of Pakistan and
condemned the continued aggressions of the United States and
Britain against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive policy by the U.S. and Britain against Iraq
constitutes gross violations of the international law and the U.N.
Charter, Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have been enforcing the two no-fly
zones in southern and northern Iraq, with the claimed aim of
protecting Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from
the so-called persecution by the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dien arrived in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Sunday evening
for a visit aimed at closer bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Pakistan have been intensifying efforts to strengthen
bilateral relations. Pakistani Commerce Minister Abdul Razzak Daud
visited Iraq in February, saying his country is prepared to
renovate Iraq's electrical and oil installations, which have become
dilapidated after the decade-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is ready to supply Iraq with products and goods under
the U.N. oil-for-food accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's electrical and oil facilities were severely damaged
during the 1991 Gulf War, and repairs have been hampered by a lack
of spare parts because of the U.N. sanctions imposed on the country
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions are partly alleviated by the oil-for-food deal
which went into effect in December 1996 and allows Iraq to export
limited quantities of oil in order to purchase daily necessities
under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
Part of that income goes toward the rebuilding of Iraq's
electrical and oil sectors.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Opposition Welcomes President's Call for Reconciliation Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Sudanese opposition
National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Mohamed Othman Merghani on
Wednesday welcomed the Sudanese president's call for a meeting
within a month between the Sudanese government and NDA members.
</P>
<P>
President Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir called late last month for
a meeting between the government and the opposition under an
Egyptian-Libyan peace initiative, which was proposed last year and
demands permanent ceasefire and a peace conference aimed at
realizing national reconciliation and ending a 17-year civil war in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of a two-day meeting in Cairo,
Merghani said the Egyptian-Libyan initiative forms the basis for
realizing peace between the Sudanese government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The NDA comprises Sudan's northern Muslim political parties,
which want to share power with el-Bashir's government, and southern
rebel groups, mainly the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has
been fighting for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian and
animist southern states. About two million people have died in the
war and war-related disasters. It has an office in the Egyptian
capital.
</P>
<P>
Merghani spoke highly of the efforts exerted by Egypt and Libya
in seeking a peaceful solution to the Sudanese problem and bringing
the viewpoints of the two warring sides closer.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the NDA's stance toward an overall political
solution to the Sudanese issue for stemming bloodshed and
realization of a just and comprehensive peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been keen on mediating a peace agreement between the
Sudanese government and the opposition, for fear that a possible
disintegration of the southern neighbor will jeopardize its major
water source, the Nile.

ABU DHABI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- With oil prices rising sharply
since the middle of 1999, the prospect of the gold demand in 2000
is good, the World Gold Council has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The demand for gold in the Middle East in 1999 went up by three
percent compared with that in 1998, said the World Gold Council,
according to a report released Wednesday by the Dubai World Trade
Centre (DWTC).
</P>
<P>
Gold and Jewellery Shopper will also provide an opportunity in

Emirates, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large number of the worldwide leading jewellers has
been attracted here for promoting the sale of a variety of their
gold, diamond and other types of jewellery, whereas the regional
demand is on rise.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Reed, international project manager of the DWTC, which
will conduct a large jewellery display later in this year, said a
number of leading jewellers from the Middle East have firstly shown
their interest in participation.

Sharansky Wednesday announced the withdrawal of his party, Yisrael
Ba'aliya, from the coalition government of Prime Minister Ehud

</P>
<P>
Sharansky made the statement just after U.S. President Bill

</P>
<P>
Sharansky announced his decision to pull out of Barak's
government at a rally of new immigrants in Jerusalem. Some 300
buses brought thousands of new immigrants to the rally.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, whose party has four seats in the Knesset

in the dark about the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian final-status
talks. He also accused Barak of making too many concessions to the
Palestinians regarding territorial transfer.

peace agreement with the Palestinians ahead of the September 13

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are expected to
complete the first plant genome map by the end of July, according
to a report in the latest issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
The report said that an international research team had
sequenced 108 million nucleotide bases of the 120-million-base
Arabidopsis, a wispy, ankle-high mustard plant, by the end of June.
And the genetic information is publicly available.
</P>
<P>
The five participating international groups hope to finish the
genome mapping job by the end of July, well ahead of the original
2004 target date.
</P>
<P>
Government funders and sequencers boast that the Arabidopsis
genome is extremely accurate, with only one error in every 20,000
bases, and contains few gaps, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Although its completion will mark the first detailed genetic
record of a plant, scientists say, the real value will be as a
template for the rice genome, some four times larger.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Wednesday that he will host a summit with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp
Davis, Maryland, early next week in a bid to deal with difficult
core issues on the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
"The objective (of the summit) is to reach an agreement on the
core issues that have fueled a half century of conflict between
Israelis and Palestinians," Clinton said at a White house briefing.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed an intense effort by Clinton and his
advisers to bring the parties together. Clinton talked to Barak
and Arafat on the phone last week to persuade them to agree to a
summit at Camp Davis, a presidential retreat where Egypt and
Israel held a summit with President Jimmy Carter in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"After lengthy discussion with the two leaders and after
listening to Secretary Albright's report, I have concluded that
this is the best way -- indeed, it is the only way -- to move
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright had made a trip to the Middle East region late last
month to assess the possibility of a three-way Mideast summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted, "The negotiators have reached an impasse.
Movement now depends on historic decisions that only the two
leaders can make."
</P>
<P>
But he warned that "there is clearly no easy answers, and
certainly no painless ones, and therefore, there is clearly no

</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians agreed last year to set September
13 as the deadline for the two sides to work out a final status
pact. But three rounds of talks since early this year have so far
failed to narrow their differences even for a framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said he will declare a Palestinian state even if the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Fall In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Index of Leading
Economic Indicators fell in May, showing a new sign of slowdown in
the U.S. economy after six hikes in interest rates, the Conference
Board said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent business research group, said
in a survey that the composite index declined by 0.1 percent to
106 in May after no change in April and a 0.1 percent rise in
March. It stood at 100 in 1996, its base year.
</P>
<P>
"The modest pace in the Leading Indicators in recent months
clearly indicates some loss of momentum in the pace of economic
activity," said Conference Board Economist Ken Goldstein. "The
signals now point to sustained expansion, but not at the rapid
pace we saw at the start of 2000."
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the U.S. economic activity was in response to
the monetary tightening. The Federal Reserve has raised interest
rates six times in the past year in an effort to steer the economy
toward a moderate growth rate of between 3.5 percent and 4 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reported that the Coincident Index rose 0.2
percent in May after a 0.3 percent rise in April, showing some
strength still left in the economy. Gains in employment, income
and industrial production continue to drive the Coincident Index
ahead, even as the Leading Indicators point to a more modest pace
of expansion, it added.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the Lagging Index also rose by 0.2 percent in
May after a 0.5 percent increase in April and no change in March.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators was a key
gauge of the U.S. economic activity, forecasting economic trends
for the next three to six months.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Bringing the benefits of the
information technology (IT) revolution to the developing world was
a formidable take and it faced major difficulties in the areas of
connectivity, capacity and content, said a senior U.N. official
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the high-level meeting on information
and communication technologies and development organized by the
United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), U.N. Deputy
Secretary-General Frechette Louise said the digital resolution
held great promise for economic growth, poverty eradication and
development.
</P>
<P>
It had already brought extraordinary benefits to the developed
world, and it could improve the chances for poor countries to
leapfrog some long and painful stages in the development process,
thereby saving considerable time and resources, Frechette said.
</P>
<P>
"Information technology is empowering only when it is easily
and cheaply accessible. So the question is how to ensure IT access
for the poor," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Capacity means not just the computers to connect to the
Internet, but the technological skills needed to use IT facilities
and service them. Technological literacy is a must," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The third obstacle is content, which must be relevant to
local needs. Because the majority of hosts are located in the
developed world, the information available reflects the interests
of the population in that part of the world. In addition, 80
percent of the material currently on the Internet is in English, a
language that 75 percent of the world's people do not speak. The
creation of both local and automatic translation technologies must
be encouraged," the deputy secretary-general noted.
</P>
<P>
The high-level meeting, to be held from July 5 to 7, will be
focus on the measures to overcome the lag in IT use in the less
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The ECOSOC meeting is expected to issue a ministerial-level
declaration which will endorse a global action plan involving the
U.N., international agencies, countries and the private sector.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Full Ugandan Withdrawal From Kisangani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan forces have
completed their withdrawal from Kisangani, the third largest city
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a United Nations
spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a press
conference here that the Ugandan troops left the DRC city by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Four Ugandan battalions had withdrawn to the city of Banalia,
about 100 kilometers north of Kisangani," Silva said, citing the
report from the U.N. Mission in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops, who jointly put Kisangani under
their control, last month agreed to withdraw to positions at least
100 kilometers outside Kisangani after fighting each other for a
week in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan troop withdrawal was confirmed by the U.N.
Mission on June 21," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda back rival factions fighting the DRC
president, Laurent Kabila, supported by Angola, Namibia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, troops from the rebel Rally for Congolese Democracy
(RCD) are refusing to withdraw from Kisangani as stipulated in a U.
N. Security Council resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The refusal came "in violation of the latest Security Council
resolution calling for the demilitarization of the city," the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Arrest Over 200 People After Blasts in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- By Wednesday, Russia have detained
more than 200 people in Chechnya and its neighboring republic of
Dagestan on suspicions of involving in the terrorist blasts Sunday
night, which caused over 100 person casualties to Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
About 50 persons have been detained in the breakaway republic
of Chechnya, eight of whom may have taken part in the suicide
bombing in the city of Argun, 10 kilometers southeast of the
Chechen capital of Grozny, Russian presidential aide Sergei
Yastrzhembsky on Chechnya told an interview in Moscow Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the federal forces had possessed information
that rebels were preparing more terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 168 Chechens were detained in a large-scale police
operation in the town of Khasavyurt in Dagestan Tuesday, the
Interfax news agency cited the Dagestani Interior Ministry press
service as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The center said the suspects' identities and affiliation with
rebel units are being verified.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said he does not expect any end to federal
operations in Chechnya in one or two months, since "the long
survival and resistance of the bands' leaders exert a moral,
psychological and political influence on part of the Chechen
population."
</P>
<P>
"As long as those men, such as Basayev, Khattab, Barayev,
remain at large, we can expect a stealthy attack at any time," he
said, adding that neutralizing these men is the main purpose of
the current federal special operations.
</P>
<P>
According to the military's data, the rebels continue to
recruit replacements from local populations and still have some 1,
500-2000 fighters, said Yastrzhembsky.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Albania to Fight Criminal Gangs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday urged Albania to
take measures to deal with criminal gangs in the neighboring
country following a barrage of gunfire aimed at a predominately
ethnic Greek village in southwestern Albania.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the Albanian government must realize
that bilateral relations were not a one-way street and this must
be displayed by the Albanian side through certain actions.
</P>
<P>
"Albania's authorities must understand that such incidents
create a problem for Albania itself," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mostly ethnic Greek residents in the
village of Dervitsani spent most of Monday night in shelters after
receiving a barrage of gunfire from the neighboring village of
Lazarati over a five-hour period.
</P>
<P>
The attack is believed to be aimed at forcing members of the
Greek minority in Albania to abandon their property.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 300,000 ethnic Greeks are living in southern
Albania.

<HEADLINE> Greece Condemns Petrol Bomb Attack Against Turkish Consulate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday strongly condemned
a petrol bomb attack against the Turkish consulate in the
southeastern Greek island of Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
"These are irresponsible acts that are condemned by the Greek
people in their entirely and they will not affect the positive
climate in the two countries' bilateral relations," Greek Foreign
Ministry spokesman Panayiotis Beglitis said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Greek police had launched an investigation
for the arrest of those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, an unknown assailant threw a firebomb at
the Turkish consulate building, but no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after Greece slashed Turkey for its
intransigent stance in the Cyprus problem in regards to the recent
advance of Turkish troops in the divided island.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey have been at odds over their
territorial dispute in the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries have since last June taken steps
to improve their strained relations, but Greece has insisted that
the Turkish side has so far not shown any goodwill gesture.

In a written speech delivered at the airport, Jiang said that
the friendship between the two countries can be traced far back in
history. Through the ancient Silk Road, Chinese ancestors brought
horses back to China while Turkmenistan business people carried
tea, silk and porcelain back to their country.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Jiang will exchange views with Niyazov on
furthering the bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Time For Israel, Palestinians to Make Big Decisions: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said here Wednesday that it is time for both Israel and
Palestinians to make big decisions when they hold a tripartite
summit with the United States next week in Camp David.
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a critical period of the peace process which
asks for decisions of great importance from the leaders of both
sides," said Barak after a meeting with French President Jacques
Chirac at the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement almost at the same time as U.S. President
Bill Clinton announced in Washington that he will host a summit
meeting with Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Camp
David early next week.
</P>
<P>
"There are great chances but also great risks.... We are
determined to do our best to ensure a best future for Israel
thanks to a peace agreement with all our neighbors, if it does not
put into peril our vital national interests," said the Israeli
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
France, which took over the six-month rotating presidency of
the European Union (EU) this month, has welcomed the summit but
remains prudent about its results.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman of the Elysee presidential palace, Catherine
Colonna, said that the summit will be useful on the condition that
it is well prepared and both sides bring with them "a spirit of
peace."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister, who arrived here Wednesday from
London, wanted to seek the EU's help to stop the Palestinians from
unilaterally declaring an independent state in September.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders decided Monday to declare an independent
Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on September
13 in accordance with agreements signed with Israel in Washington
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a statement of principle on the Palestinian problem released
in Berlin in December 1999, EU countries said they recognize the
right of Palestinians to establish their own state and are ready
to recognize an independent Palestinian state at an opportune time.

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges 100 Mln Euro for Chernobyl Shelter Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Wednesday
pledged another 100 million euro (95 million U.S. dollars) for the
Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made in Berlin at the second pledging conference
which aimed at providing the necessary funds to rehabilitate the
sarcophagus sheltering reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant.
</P>
<P>
"This very substantial EU effort is fully in line with repeated
expressions of the EU in support of Chernobyl," said Christopher
Patten, EU external relations commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The union has so far provided Ukraine with 350 million euro (
332.5 million dollars) as special funds for Chernobyl and
Chernobyl-related projects.
</P>
<P>
The commission believes that the potential danger associated
with the damaged unit will persist until the highly radioactive
material contained under the existing sarcophagus shelter is
permanently isolated from the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian authorities announced earlier in the year that
they are closing definitely the last operating nuclear reactor at
Chernobyl on December 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The recent decision of President Kuchma and the Ukrainian
government to stick to the commitment made under the 1995
Memorandum of Understanding with the G-7 and to definitely shut
down the last operating reactor at Chernobyl on 15 December 2000
paved the way for continued substantial support by the
international community and the EU," said Patten.

BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Belgium Wednesday issued an arrest
warrant against a Congolese government official on charges of
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The wanted is Congolese Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia who
was accused by refugees of inciting hatred against them in August
1998 in speeches using such discriminative words as "vermin" and "

The arrest warrant was signed on April 11 by Brussels
Magistrate Damien Vandermeersh but was only issued almost a month
later Wednesday due to legal and technical reasons, according to
legal sources.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued in line with a 1993 Belgian law
that demands arrest of those who have committed crimes against
international human rights no matter where they have committed the
crimes and what nationality they are of.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese foreign minister is now liable to arrest if he

<HEADLINE> The Netherlands to Auction UMTS Phone Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands is scheduled to
auction Thursday third-generation UMTS mobile telephone licenses,
reports reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On offer will be five UMTS mobile phone licenses. UMTS stands
for universal mobile telecommunications standard, the newest
generation of cellular phone service. UMTS boasts of a
transmission speed 40 times faster than that of the existing GSM
standard.
</P>
<P>
The higher telecommunication speed makes possible new
capabilities such as mobile phone connection to the Internet and
video displays.
</P>
<P>
Eight companies have been allowed into the scheduled auction,
including five already having established telecoms services in the
Netherlands. The bidders are KPN Mobile, Libertel, Telfort,
Dutchtone, Ben, Nogenta Swedish Acquisition, Hutchison 3G
Netherlands and VersaTel.
</P>
<P>
KPN Mobile and Libertel are the largest and second largest
mobile phone operators in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The opening price for the auction has been set at a total of
470 million Dutch guilders (202 million U.S. dollars). Dutch
Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said that he expected an auction
yield of some 20 billion guilders (19 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Treasury has canceled a July bond issue because of
anticipated UMTS license revenues.
</P>
<P>
In April, the British government got 22.5 billion pounds (34
billion U.S. dollars) from the auction sales of five UMTS licenses,
more than five times the sum formerly expected.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Uzebekistan's Involvement in "Shanghai 5" Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin met with Uzebekistan President Islam Karimov here
Wednesday and said that Uzebekistan's involvement in the "Shanghai
Five" summit meeting was of major importance in promoting regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Karimov attended the summit meeting of the heads of state from
China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, or the "
Shanghai Five" nations, in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe for the
first time, but as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders from the five countries held their first summit to
exchange views on regional and international issues of common
concern in Shanghai, China, in April 1996. And the annual summit
mechanism of the five nations is thereafter referred to as the "
Shanghai Five."
</P>
<P>
"I welcome you to attend the 'Shanghai Five' meeting," Jiang
said to Karimov, noting that Uzebekistan is a country of important
influence in the central Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Uzebekistan's participation in the "Shanghai Five" mechanism
was of important significance to the further development of the
five-nation cooperation process and it opened a new channel for
cooperation between China and Uzebekistan, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said his country highly appreciates China's principled
stance in world affairs and that Uzebekistan is a reliable and
trustworthy partner of China.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude to China and the other four
countries of the "Shanghai Five" mechanism for inviting him to
attend the Dushanbe Summit.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two presidents also exchanged views
on issues of common interest, Chinese Foreign Ministry officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Ecuador To Promote Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Ecuador will promote border
trade through a bilateral agreement, said Julian Gamero, director
of bilateral affairs in the Industry, Tourism, Integration, and
International Commerce Negotiations Ministry (MITINCI), here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental goal of this agreement will be to promote
industry, agriculture, and agro-industrial activities and the
handicraftsmen of the border zone between the two countries by
means of the organization of fairs and festivals," said Gamero.
</P>
<P>
Gamero said that this region has a very dynamic commercial
activity in spite of the small size of its transactions because it
accumulates an important volume of trading.
</P>
<P>
The government official said that the new agreement will update
the one signed in 1972 because the conditions of the commerce
between the two nations have changed considerably.
</P>
<P>
"The 1972 agreement on fairs was outdated in relation to the
integration advances achieved through the Accord of Cartagena,"
said Gamero.
</P>
<P>
Gamero said that the implementation of each fair or festival
will have to be approved by the MITINCI authorities in the
Peruvian case, and one of the conditions will be the exhibition of
a certificate of origin.
</P>
<P>
"In that way, the agreement will become an agile mechanism that
will permit the active participation of the economic agents of the
region," said Gamero.
</P>
<P>
The MITINCI official said that the agreement involves not only
the fairs, but will include the promotion of cultural exchanges
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Austria on Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission warned
Wednesday that Austria could become an even bigger pariah if the
scheduled referendum decided to block EU decisions.
</P>
<P>
If Austria blocked European Union legislation or reforms, that
is only counterproductive and will backfire, said Peter Guilford,
spokesman for the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel announced Tuesday
that his country will hold a referendum to show popular anger with
the political sanctions imposed by Austria's 14 other EU partners
since early February.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed as a protest against Austria's
incorporation of the far-right Freedom Party into the governing
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Austria asked the European Union summit held last month at
Feira of Portugal to consider lifting the sanctions but was
refused consideration.
</P>
<P>
Austria warned to consult with public opinion about whether to
use its veto right to block the functioning of the union in
retaliation against the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
One of the six questions to be included in the referendum will
be: "Should the (Austrian) federal government ensure with all
possible means that the unfairly imposed sanctions on Austria from
the other members of the European Union be lifted immediately?"
</P>
<P>
"We don't think a referendum is going to bring a solution,"
said the European Commission spokesman. "If a referendum is held,
we would deeply regret it."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman cited as a useless example the British vetoing EU
decisions for several months in 1996 after its beef exports had
been banned due to the outbreak of madcow disease.
</P>
<P>
Yet EU observers believe that Austria can do considerable
damage with its power to veto EU decisions that need support of
all 15 member governments.
</P>
<P>
Austria's support will be critical to such EU decisions as
enlargement to include 12 eastern and southern European countries
into the union and institutional reforms to overhaul the EU's
decision-making mechanism.

<HEADLINE> UK Enjoys Record Inward Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Britain by overseas
companies is at record levels, Andrew Fraser, chief executive of
the Invest in Britain Bureau, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference entitled "Review Of Operations 2000,"
Fraser said that in the year to 31 March 2000, foreign companies
brought in 757 inward investment projects which created 52,783 new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the UK is particularly successful in
attracting investment in industries linked to the knowledge-driven
economy -- computer software, Internet, telecoms and e-business
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The figures also provide an analysis of investment from key
geographic markets -- the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe. The U.S.
continues to be the No 1 investor, accounting for some 48 percent
of all projects followed by Japan (7.7 percent), Germany (7
percent), Canada (6 percent) and France (6 percent).
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the results, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said,
"The figures are a clear vote of confidence in this country and
the economic policies we are pursuing."
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said, "These figures
show that the UK is an excellent place to do business. We have the
skills, business environment and sound economic base that is
essential to attract overseas investors."

<HEADLINE> EU Tries Again to Break Banana Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Wednesday put
forward new proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock of its banana
import scheme.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, has been striving to work out a banana import system that
complies with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
But months of efforts to settle the trade row over banana
imports have met a deadlock, commission officials admitted.
</P>
<P>
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said Wednesday that he
hoped the commission's new proposal would breathe new life into
the process.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is under pressure to solve the dispute
because the United States has imposed 191 million U.S. dollars of
sanctions on EU goods in retaliation for its banana quota system.
</P>
<P>
Equator, the world's leading exporter of banana, has been
authorized by the WTO to slap 201 million dollars of sanctions on
EU goods.
</P>
<P>
The WTO sided with Latin American countries and the United
States which argued that the current EU quota rules favored EU
territories and former European colonies in the Caribbean over
Latin American exporters and U.S. marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the European Commission proposed that the EU
move to a tariff-only banana import system by January 1, 2006,
after a transitional period involving a complex tariff rate quota
system.
</P>
<P>
Yet intense discussions with the United States and Latin
American countries failed to enable the EU to come up with a way
to divide the quota that satisfies all parties.
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposals, the European Commission will push for
a transitional system of tariff quotas that would be allotted on a
"first come, first served" basis while the tariff-only system
would take effect in 2006 as previously proposed.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that if no agreement could be reached on
the "first come, first served" basis by mid-October this year, it
planned to start negotiations on a tariff-only system.

<HEADLINE> Wages of Zimbabwean Clothing Workers Increased by 47.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Workers in Zimbabwe's clothing
industry have been awarded a 47.5 percent wage increase with
effect from the beginning of this month, an official said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the National Union of the Clothing
Industry Fredy Mpofu told reporters that negotiations with
employers for the wage increase were concluded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The 47.5 percent is an addition to the 10 percent cost of
living adjustment awarded at the beginning of May," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 47.5 percent increment, 6 percent would be effected in
February next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, despite the increment, workers are
still concerned with the future of the industry which he described
as hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
The influx of second-hand and new clothes from countries such
as Mauritius are threatening the viability of the local industry,
he said, noting that "the shortage of foreign currency in the
country is worsening the situation because the local industry
cannot afford to import special raw materials."
</P>
<P>
He said people now prefer imports which are of good quality and
sold at a cheaper price.
</P>
<P>
"Out government has to take steps to protect the local industry
because a large number of people will lose their jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean clothing industry, which has been on the
downturn for the past few years due to economic difficulties, has
a workforce of over 20,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Launch National Hygiene Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government is to launch
a participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST)
program to involve the participation of the rural population in
the improvement of their hygiene and sanitation, Rwanda News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Katabarwa, an official in charge of public health in the
Ministry of Health, said the PHAST approach would teach and
stimulate the public on hygiene and sanitation concepts but more
importantly, it will enable people to overcome the constraints of
behavioral change.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the PHAST program will achieve a lot
 especially at the village level, where hygiene and sanitation are
at stake.
</P>
<P>
As more village health committees are formed, there will be an
increased awareness and knowledge of hygiene and health matters at
household and community levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
PHAST is also intended to deal with issues related to
environmental health, Katabarwa said, noting that the program has
been successful in such countries as Botswana, Kenya, Uganda and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation
methodology was first initiated by the World Health Organization
and the Regional Water and Sanitation Groups for East and Southern
Africa in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls to Revitalize Congo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Wednesday appealed to set the Lusaka peace
agreement back on track and to give the people of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) a new start.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists before leaving Lusaka after a two-day
visit to Zambia, Mkapa said the appointment of a governing
assembly by DRC President Laurent Kabila is a violation of the
Lusaka peace agreement signed by all belligerents concerned in the
DRC conflict last July.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka agreement provided for the formation of a
transitional government after wide consultation but the
appointment did not follow this procedure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those who have been appointed by Kabila should be educated on
the provisions of the Lusaka agreement, he said, describing their
appointment as a "non-starter".
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president said he has come to consult with
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba over fighting between Rwanda
and Ugandan troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was affecting the Lusaka peace agreement and
posing a danger to the existing cease-fire in that country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the need to use influence to increase the
momentum for the Lusaka accord as a way of resolving the conflict
in the DRC.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho police Wednesday
displayed about 700 illegal weapons which had been confiscated in
sporadic raids throughout the country, the South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted police spokesman Superintendent Sekoateng
Serabale as saying that some of the weapons were believed to have
been stolen from the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Police would continue the raids because they believe that there
are many illegal firearms in circulation in the country, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said rewards have been offered for information which would
lead to the successful recovery of more firearms and the cash
incentive ranges from 100 rand (14.7 U.S. dollars) for a small
weapon to 200 rand (29 dollars) for rifles.
</P>
<P>
All illegal weapons confiscated by the police will be destroyed
in accordance with an order issued by Lesotho's cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Opposition Party to Challenge Election Results on Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC) Wednesday threatened to file an
application to cancel the election results in at least 27
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The legal process is expected to begin next week, the Zimbabwe
News Agency quoted MDC Secretary General Welshman Ncube as saying.
</P>
<P>
The MDC, which won 57 seats out of the 120 contested in the
June 24-25 parliamentary elections, said that it is not happy with
results from 20 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The party has now gathered sufficient evidence of violence and
intimidation in 27 constituencies, which witnessed the flouting of
the electoral procedure and the manipulation of voters, Ncube
said.
</P>
<P>
"In some cases we discovered that members of the Central
Intelligence Organization replaced polling officials to count the
votes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the MDC would seek a re-run of polls in such
constituencies as Bindura, Chinhoyi, Marondera East, Mberengwa
East and West, Chengutu and Masvingo South.
</P>
<P>
Most of the contested constituencies were tightly contested
with candidates of the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) beating the MDC candidates by
narrow margins.
</P>
<P>
According to Ncube, the MDC is confident of winning the case as
it has enough evidence to support its argument.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Education Makes Remarkable Progress: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's education has made
considerable progress in the past five years following the
government's big and successive investment into the field, a
senior official told Xinhua here on Wednesday in an exclusive
interview.
</P>
<P>
The annual education budget of the state has increased from
about 500 million birr (one U.S. dollar equals 8.12 birr) in 1996
to nearly 2.5 billion birr in the fiscal year 1999/2000, said the
country's Vice Education Minister Teklehaimanot Haileselassie.
</P>
<P>
He said of the total national budget, the education portion has
 accounted for 14 percent from 9 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the enrollment of primary school pupils has also
more than doubled from about 20 percent to some 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total enrollment of students in primary and secondary
schools as well as universities and schools of higher learning in
Ethiopia has come up to more than 6 million by last fiscal year
from 2 million five years ago, Haileselassie said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the remarkable progress to the priority that the
government has given to the education field.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian government has considered education as a very
much important area to eliminate poverty and to develop national
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said to popularize education, private schools have been
encouraged for years by the government, which has given effective
support to the effort to promote national education.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice minister, dozens of Ethiopian graduate
students are being sent abroad annually to take master and doctor
courses in an effort to speed up training of senior intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Many people, who were conferred doctorate abroad, are playing
an important role in state construction, he said, noting that some
have filled in the gaps in the teaching and scientific research
fields in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Angola Sets New Planks for Peace Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has set new
planks for its "peace platform", focusing on the respect for the
Lusaka Peace Protocol and ruling out the possibility of any
mediation in the civil conflicts, informed sources told Xinhua
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the new planks were set out by
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos during Monday's meeting
of the Council of Republic, a consultation organization for the
president.
</P>
<P>
The new planks emphasized that peace with the rebels led by
Jonas Savimbi should be based on the respect for the Lusaka accord
signed by all belligerents last July, the collapse of which led to
the renewed civil war last year.
</P>
<P>
The other three clauses are to revise the ongoing
constitutional and electoral law, to hold elections as soon as
appropriate conditions are created and to reintegrate all rebels
who abandoned their weapons, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The government must base its actions "on discussion, openness,
and regular, permanent and fruitful dialogue with all sectors of
society", the sources quoted Santos as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president also ruled out any possibility of mediation in
the country' s civil conflict, saying the government must continue
to act as the " protagonist" in conducting the peace process and
"not allow this part of its power to be transferred to the hands
of others".

JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Four people died and three
were injured Wednesday when gunmen opened fire on a taxi full of
people in Umlazi, KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal police spokesman Captain Vishnu Naidoo said that

</P>
<P>
The taxi then overturned in a nearby ravine and three
passengers subsequently died.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said it was not known if they died as a result of
gunshot wounds or because of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened this afternoon when commuters were going
home from work.
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating the motive behind the killing. The
area has been hit by a spiral of violence involving different taxi

<HEADLINE> WFP Urges Rapid Response to Drought in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
appealed here Wednesday for 88 million U.S. dollars to feed 3.3
million starving Kenyans from August to December this year.
</P>
<P>
"We need international donors to quickly pledge food and cash
to address the spiralling needs," said David Fletcher, WFP's
Deputy Country Director for Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing everything possible to have sufficient food for
people in July, but we've absolutely nothing in-hand for the month
of August, which spells potential disaster for tens of thousands
of people relying on our help," said Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
The increased food aid needs were announced last month as part
of an overall U.N. appeal for 13.4 million drought victims in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The number of Kenyans in need of food aid are second only to
Ethiopia where 10 million people rely on relief food.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is really struggling to cope with this drought which has
hit the entire Horn of Africa," said Fletcher, adding "millions
of people throughout the country have never managed to recover
from an almost non- stop string of devastating droughts and floods
during the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
Fletcher noted that the failure of the March to May rainy
season has deteriorated the situation throughout the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
In the worst-hit areas, about 80 percent of livestock have
died. Crops have withered, and people are selling their few
remaining possessions at throw-away prices.
</P>
<P>
For pastoralists, it takes years for livestock herds to be
replenished. This means that large quantities of relief food may
be required for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure that the most vulnerable people receive
food, a new streamlined system has been established with greater
community participation in Kenya, according to the WFP.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Seeks Ban on Sierra Leone Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council,
after several days of delay, hopes Wednesday to adopt a resolution
to impose a global embargo on diamond exports from Sierra Leone,
where a gems-for-guns trade is financing a civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council plans Wednesday morning to discuss a
draft resolution, initiated by Britain, which would ban all rough
diamonds from Sierra Leone until the government of the West
African nation could set up a proper certification system for the
gems -- as well as regain access to lucrative diamond-mining areas
under the control of the rebel United Revolutionary Front.
</P>
<P>
Central at issue is whether the embargo should run for 18
months as France wants, or 36 months as the United States prefers.
</P>
<P>
Diamonds, gold, iron ore and bauxite accounted for about two
thirds of Sierra Leone's exports before war in the 1990s wrecked
the economy of the West African country. Rebels control some 90
percent of the diamond mines, which yield among the best stones in
the world.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for "War of Liberation" Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Armed with findings that HIV/
AIDS infects six people under 24 every minute, the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said here Wednesday that if nations hope
to defeat the disease, they must commit to the "largest
mobilization of resources in their history" and organize
themselves if they were fighting "a full-blown war of liberation"
with young people in the forefront.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS constitutes the greatest threat many societies have
ever faced," said Carol Bellamy, executive director of the UNICEF.
"Unfortunately, in many ways it has been a hidden enemy, aided and
abetted by a general reluctance to acknowledge its strength and
our own vulnerability. Thus we have not confronted AIDS with the
full force we are capable of."
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every society understands what it means to wage a
struggle for liberation," Bellamy said, noting that the concept
has particular resonance in Africa. "It means mobilizing every
available resource; it means involving men and women on an equal
basis; it means accepting the vital role to be played by young
people; and it means sparing no effort and brooking no diversions
until all of society is liberated.
</P>
<P>
"That's what is needed now -- nothing less," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy's comments came as the UNICEF unveiled a new report
detailing the enormous impact of HIV/AIDS among young people, who
the UNICEF said "hold the key to breaking the transmission rate
and ultimately defeating AIDS."
</P>
<P>
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HARDEST AFFECTED
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF report, the Progress of Nations 2000, finds that
almost a third of all people with HIV/AIDS are between the ages of
15 and 24 -- a total of some 10 million young people, every minute,
six young people up to age 24 become infected with HIV, the virus
that can cause AIDS disease, girls and young women are more than
50 percent more likely to contract HIV than boys and young men.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, an estimated 860,000 primary school children in
sub-Saharan Africa lost their teachers to AIDS, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"What this report tells us is that, so far, our efforts to
stop the spread of HIV have not been sufficient," Bellamy told a
large audience which gathered in Durban for the International AIDS
Conference this week.
</P>
<P>
YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
</P>
<P>
"Particularly disturbing is the evidence that large numbers of
young people in HIV-prevalent countries are not clear on how to
protect themselves," she said. "Many don't know they are at risk
at all -- especially girls -- and that's a disaster."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Progress of Nations report finds that:
</P>
<P>
-- In several countries, almost half of all girls aged 15 to
19 do not know that a person who looks healthy can be infected
with HIV and transmit it to others;
</P>
<P>
-- In a number of countries where AIDS is epidemic, nearly
half of sexually active girls aged 15 to 19 believe they face no
risk of contracting the disease;
</P>
<P>
-- And in surveys in 17 countries, more than half adolescents
could not name a single method of protecting themselves against
HIV/AIDS. In fact, more girls than boys are in the case.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF, the only United Nations organization dedicated
exclusively to children, works for child protection, survival and
development within the framework of the Convention on the Rights
of the Child.

<HEADLINE> Russia Successfully Launches Military Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia Wednesday successfully
launched a military satellite Cosmos-2371 with a two-stage Proton
booster rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, said
the Russian Strategic Missile Force press service.
</P>
<P>
The rocket fired off from the base at 3:44 a.m. Moscow time (
0044 GMT) and brought the satellite into a geo-stationary orbit at
10:20 a.m. Moscow time (0720 GMT) Wednesday, the press center told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The launch was prepared and actuated by the Russian Aerospace
Agency, and the Strategic Missile Force was responsible for launch-
control and will control its orbiting flight, said the press
center.
</P>
<P>
The satellite has been added to the Russian orbiting system and
raised its efficiency. The launch has demonstrated the quality of
the Proton-K rocket-booster, modernized by the recommendations of
the state commission investigating the Proton crashes in July and
October 1999.
</P>
<P>
The next launch of the modernized Proton-K rocket-booster,
manufactured by the Khrunichev Space Center, is scheduled for July
12. The rocket will send into orbit the Russian "Zvezda" service
module for the planned international space station.

<HEADLINE> Canada Disappointed at U.S. Court Ruling on Tobacco Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada is disappointed over the U.S.
court ruling released Tuesday to dismiss Ottawa's land-mark
tobacco lawsuit against cigarette smuggling into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Justice Department said Tuesday that the
government is "disappointed with the ruling" and "will review to
determine the best way to redress the injuries that Canada has
suffered."
</P>
<P>
"As in other cases involving rulings on points of law, an
appeal is not out of the question," said Justice Department lawyer
Gordon Bourgard.
</P>
<P>
In a 51-page ruling, a New York district court decided to
accept the defendants' argument that the case is an attempt by the
Canadian government to collect invaded duties and taxes, which is
barred by the U.S. "revenue rule."
</P>
<P>
Canada has spent more than 4 million Canadian dollars (about 2.
7 million U.S. dollars) on legal fees since the country launched
its most high-profile lawsuit against U.S.-based RJ Reynolds
Tobacco Co., five related companies and the Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers Council last December.
</P>
<P>
The government accused the defendants of smuggling at least two
billion cigarettes into Canada between 1991 and 1994, undermining
the country's goal of protecting young people from smoking by
levying heavy taxes on cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> "Shanghai Five" Nations Pledge Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of the "
Shanghai Five" nations pledged here Wednesday to deepen
cooperation in the fields of politics, foreign affairs, economy
and trade, as well as military affairs to turn Central Asia into a
region of peace, good neighborhood, stability and equal
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan made the remarks in a joint statement at their one-day
meeting, commonly known as the "Shanghai Five" summit, that has
been held annually since 1996.
</P>
<P>
While expressing their satisfaction with the mutual trust and
cooperation among them, the five nations reaffirmed opposition to
any conflict, threat and external interference that would
complicate the situation in Central Asia, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
They said that their accord on the resolution of border issues
and reinforcement of military trust demonstrated a new concept of
security based on mutual trust, equality and cooperation, which
helps to strengthen mutual understanding and good-neighborhood and
makes constructive contribution to the regional stability.
</P>
<P>
All the five countries would faithfully implement the
agreements signed in Shanghai, China, in 1996 and in Moscow,
Russia, in 1997 on deepening trust in the military field and
cutting down military forces along the border areas, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The five heads of state called for speeding up the process of
strengthening trust in the military field, with measures including
joint military exercises and drilling, exchange of experience in
peacekeeping activities, and relevant seminars and sport
competitions.
</P>
<P>
The five nations agreed that meetings of their defense
ministers and consultations among their defense institutions are
helpful to further strengthening their mutual trust and friendly
cooperation in the military field as well as jointly maintaining
regional peace and stability, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the five nations reiterated that their cooperation
is not directed against any other country and is open to other
countries for participation in concrete programs and projects on a
country-to-country basis or other levels.
</P>
<P>
The top leaders of the five countries started their first
summit in Shanghai, China, in April 1996 to exchange views on
bilateral and multilateral cooperation and other regional and
international issues of common interest.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes Austria's Referendum on EU Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- France warned Austria against any act
of "blackmail" on the reform of European institutions on Wednesday,
one day after the Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel announced
to hold a referendum on European Union (EU) sanctions against his
country.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry, Anne Gazeau-
Secret, said that France has taken note of the decision by
Schuessel to hold a referendum in October or November if the EU
does not lift its sanctions imposed on Vienna by mid-October.
</P>
<P>
"It would certainly not be in the interests of Austria to
practice such a blackmail", said Gazeau-Secret when asked about a
possible blocking by Austria in the talks on EU institutional
reform.
</P>
<P>
France, which took over the six-month rotating EU presidency
this month, plans to complete by the end of the year the inter-
government negotiations between the 15 EU countries on
institutional reform in order to pave the way for admitting new
members in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Austrian far-right Freedom Party, Joerg
Haider, said on Sunday that Austria would block the reform of EU
institutions because of EU sanctions. He had repeatedly threatened
that Austria could consider pulling out of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel apparently yielded to the pressure from Haider by
announcing the holding of a referendum, which will ask the
Austrian population to express its view on the EU sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed sanctions on Vienna in late January after the
Freedom Party entered a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include the suspension of bilateral meetings with
Austrian ministers and refusal to support Austria's candidacy for
international posts.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said on Monday that the EU
sanctions will stay in force until the experts designated by the
European Court of Human Rights submit their report on the
political and human rights situation in Austria.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Government Urges Weapons Stealers to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government is
appealing to the group of criminals who stole weapons from two
army camps in Gerik in the northern state of Perak on Sunday to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to their good sense, if they have any, to surrender
and give up whatever they are doing," Defense Minister Najib Tun
Razak said at a news conference after meeting Deputy Prime
Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On how the government would go about handling the surrender
offer, he said the details would be jointly determined by the
police and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Najib said that if the offer to surrender themselves is not
taken up the government has the right to take whatever action
necessary.
</P>
<P>
"And there's no limit to that action because the government is
firm in this matter and we don't want this group of robbers and
criminals to achieve their aim," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that no formal contact has been established
with the criminals so far and that they had not made any demands.
However, he added, the government would not give in to demands
made by criminals, if there were any.
</P>
<P>
Najib did not rule out the possibility of ex-servicemen being
involved in the arms heists, saying that from the assessment made,
there was a big possibility that all members of the group are
still together at their hideout on a hillock at the small town of
Sauk in the state.
</P>
<P>
The hideout of the weapon stealers has been tightly cordoned
off by security forces to the extent that there is no possibility
for the criminals to get out from the area, he said, adding "We
have adequate security forces to ensure the cordon was very tight
and was impossible to be penetrated by the group."
</P>
<P>
The minister said a shoot-out took place earlier Wednesday
between the security forces and the group as the criminals wanted
to test the effectiveness of the cordon.
</P>
<P>
In the shoot-out incident Wednesday morning, one of the raiders
was shot by the security forces but the extent of his injuries
could not be ascertained as the group retreated into the jungle
with the injured man.
</P>
<P>
Najib said the presence of three hostages complicated matters
and the government was sensitive to the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police called for cooperation from the families of
the criminals to help in negotiations between the security forces
and the group.
</P>
<P>
The group of 15 impersonators struck at the two camps in the
state within three hours early Sunday and made off with a haul of
more than 100 rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Dutch Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The HAGUE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji met here Wednesday with Dutch Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina
Armgard and parliament leaders.
</P>
<P>
Zhu had brief talks this morning with the parliament leaders,
First Chamber President Koethals Altes and Second Chamber's First
Vice-President Frans Weisglas. He also met with some Dutch
lawmakers in the parliament building in The Hague, the political
center of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
At noon, the Chinese premier attended a luncheon hosted by
Dutch Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard. They had very friendly
talks.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who came here Tuesday after a visit to Luxembourg, also
had one-hour talk with Dutch Prime Minister Vim Kok Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after his meeting with Kok, Zhu
said he and Kok had a friendly, frank and fruitful meeting on the
development of Sino-Dutch relations and a wide range of
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Kok said there is mutually beneficial cooperation between the
Netherlands and China not only in the traditional areas of economy
and trade, but also in the fields such as technology,
environmental protection, agriculture, water management and harbor
building.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch prime minister told Zhu that his country firmly
supports China's early entry into the World Trade Organization (
WTO). China's WTO admission will serve its own interests and will
surely create more opportunities for effective cooperation between
China and the Netherlands, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of Taiwan, Zhu said that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin set forth an eight-point policy on the Taiwan issue in
1995, which is still the basic and all-around policy for China to
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that the Dutch government will continue to uphold
the "One China" policy, Kok said the Netherlands will not develop
any kind of official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on human rights issue. Zhu
briefed Kok on the development of human rights situation in China
and China's position on the promotion of international cooperation
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the dialogue between the European Union and
China on the human rights issue has made positive achievements.
Kok said it is necessary for different countries to develop
constructive dialogue on the basis of mutual respect, since there
are differences between countries in history, economy and social
development, among others.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is willing to improve understanding through
cooperation with China at all levels, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is the Chinese premier's fourth leg of his trip
to six European nations.

<HEADLINE> EU Pledges Another 100 Million Euro for Chernobyl Shelter Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Wednesday
pledged another 100 million euro (95 million U.S. dollars) for the
Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made in Berlin at a conference for funding
rehabilitation of the sarcophagus sheltering reactor 4 of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
"This very substantial EU effort is fully in line with repeated
expressions of the EU in support of Chernobyl (closure),"  EU
external relations commissioner Christopher Patten said at the
meeting, the second of its kind.
</P>
<P>
The union has so far provided Ukraine with 350 million euro (
332.5 million dollars) in special funds for closing down Chernobyl
plant and Chernobyl-related projects.
</P>
<P>
The commission believes that the potential danger arising from
the damaged unit would persist unless the highly radioactive
material guarded by the existing sarcophagus shelter was
permanently isolated from the environment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Ukraine assured the closure of the last
operating nuclear reactor on December 15 at Chernobyl, the site of
the world's worst ever nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
"The recent decision of President (Leonid) Kuchma and the
Ukrainian government to stick to the commitment made under the
1995 Memorandum of Understanding with the G-7 and to definitely
shut down the last operating reactor at Chernobyl on December 15,
2000 paved the way for continued substantial support by the
international community and the EU," said Patten.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Ten people were arrested and a dozen others pepper-sprayed
in scuffles with police in Morristown of New Jersey State in the
United States Tuesday when a white supremacist's Independence Day
speech against affirmative action drew about 400 protesters.
</P>
<P>
-- President-elect Vicente Fox, confident and conciliatory
after his victory over the world's longest-ruling party, Tuesday
put forth an ambitious blueprint for revamping Mexico's most
notoriously corrupt institutions and for governing a country
reshaped by unprecedented political pluralism.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A man shot and wounded five people early Tuesday and then
held 15 others hostage on the Santa Monica Pier for several hours
before surrendering in Santa Monica of California State, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
-- Israelis and Palestinians alike reacted cautiously Tuesday
to a declaration by the Palestinian leadership on Monday that a
Palestinian state would be declared by mid-September, uncertain
whether it was a promise, a threat or another deadline that could
be massaged.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. auto market remained relatively flat in June, but
despite rising interest rates and spiking gasoline prices, sales
of the industry's cash cows -- its biggest sport-utility vehicles -
- continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
-- Sri Lanka Tuesday reimposed censorship on domestic and
foreign media, revising rules to comply with last week's high-
court decision to bar the practice. Meanwhile, India said it is
ready to broker a truce with Tamil rebels, a role that it played
unsuccessfully in 1987.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Grant Hill confirmed that he was
to sign with the Orlando Magic next season and wished his old team
of Detroit Pistons well.
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaning toward signing with Orlando, it's not 100 percent,
but it's close," said Hill. "This is just a golden opportunity,
for basketball reasons."
</P>
<P>
However, NBA rules prevent any free agent from signing any
contract until August 1.
</P>
<P>
Hill has spent his entire career with Detroit and the Pistons
reached the playoffs in four of his six seasons but never won a
series.
</P>
<P>
Last season, he averaged 25.8 points per game, third-best in
the NBA. He shot 48.9 percent from the field and 79.5 percent from
the free throw line. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists.
</P>
<P>
The Magic are offering Hill and San Antonio free agent forward
Tim Duncan six-year deals worth 67.5 million US dollars, the most
allowed under the collective bargaining agreement.

LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Twice U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter
was the first to reach last four by powering to a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6
triumph over 114th-ranked German Alexander Popp on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian, seeded 12th, played solid serve and volley
tennis while Popp struggled with jangling nerves which subjected
himself to numerous errors including five doubles faults in his
first service game.
</P>
<P>
Popp, who beat current and former French Open champions Gustavo
Kuerten in the earlier round, did show flashes of brilliance on
the backhand and he broke Rafter's serve to force the third set
tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
But he could not match Rafter's touch and anticipation,
dropping four of his service games during the match and losing the
tiebreak 7-1.

HOHHOT, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A search for more water resources in
the northwestern part of China has produced results, said a senior
official from the Ministry of Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
Tian Fengshan, minister of land and resources, said that more
than 50 new water sources have been discovered in deserts, lava
areas, and bitter and salty water areas in the northwestern region,
since the program was launched during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (
1996-2000) period.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that more than one billion cu m of water can be
extracted annually from these water-bearing areas. The program has
also completed digging over 350 wells, each with a daily water
output of 660,000 cu m.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the ministry has launched more projects
to explore water resources in the Ordos Basin in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Hexi Corridor in Gansu
Province and the Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mass Media Urged to Devote More to Reporting Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- An environment reporting project
was launched in Hong Kong Wednesday to encourage the local media
to devote more efforts to reporting environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
"It is with a sense of urgency that we are launching what we
believe is Asia's first university-based program for training
professional and student reporters in environmental journalism,"
Lily Yam, secretary for the environment and food, said when
announcing the project at a conference on environmental journalism
at the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"By fostering quality environmental journalism, we will help
monitor government actions while keeping the public informed of
its good deeds," Yam said.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll by the university's public opinion program shows
that about half of the Hong Kong residents think the media pay too
little attention to environmental issues. It also shows that
nearly 70 percent of residents think the public has a low level of
awareness about environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Criticism also came from academic studies that have found local
newspapers devoted little efforts to reporting environmental
issues. "Some of the local journalists often ask very stupid or
irrelevant questions on the environment," said Hung Wing-tat,
director of Hong Kong Conservancy Association.
</P>
<P>
He attributed lower financial incentives to reduce air and
water pollution to less devotion given by the mass media to the
issue. "In fact, the mass media are the most useful machines to
promote the initiatives to improve local air and water quality,"
Hung noted.
</P>
<P>
"We depend on the mass media to win support, but we are
disappointed, because TV stations only devote 15 seconds to
environmental reporting every day with no features and analyses,"
Hung added.
</P>
<P>
Other scholars believed that they were quite impressed by some
TV journalists' deep insights into the issues. "The point is that
environmental reporting is intrinsically political," said William
Barron, director of the Center of Urban Planning and Environmental
Management.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of environment is inherently one of politics, and it
ends at the government's decision," Barron said. "We are gratified
that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has
finally made cleaning up the environment a top policy priority."
</P>
<P>
The panelists of the conference, who have dealt extensively
with the media in their various roles as policymaker, expert and
activist, believed that the new environmental reporting project
will help working journalists across the region acquire the tools,
information and training they need to produce quality
environmental reporting.
</P>
<P>
According to the Journalism and Media Studies Center, under the
project, seminars, workshops and short courses will be held in the
coming years for working journalists and interested parties in
Hong Kong, China's mainland and the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
As one key ingredient of the project, a website designed
especially for reporters working on environment-related stories
was unveiled at the conference.

Chan said at a luncheon of international chambers of commerce.
</P>

There will be additional opportunities for both business and
investment, she said.

She said that Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang is

HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Tai Fook Securities Group Limited,
a leading financial services company of Hong Kong, reported a net
profit of 211.2 million HK dollars (27 million U.S. dollars) for
the year ended March 31, 2000.

million HK dollars (71.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Peter Wong, group managing director of Tai Fook, attributed the

launch of online brokerage services in the third quarter of 1999
and the booming local stock market buoyed by the influx of foreign
investments and the demand for Initial Public Offerings in the
telecommunications, technology and Internet sectors.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Ready for MILF Attacks: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday the Armed Forces of the Philippines remain ready to curb
any offensive launched by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF),
following reports that the rebel group had threatened to defeat
the military in a protracted war in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"If we respond to everything said by the MILF's so-called
spokesman, we'll never get any job done. We have to ignore their
claims," Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A MILF spokesman was earlier quoted as saying that the rebel
group is ready to mount a fullscale war against the government,
even after the military overran most of their strongholds.
</P>
<P>
Zamora stressed the government is pushing for socio-economic
development in Mindanao, instead of a military solution, to
reverse the decades-old official neglect of the south and ring
peace and prosperity to the island.
</P>
<P>
Zamora noted earlier that military operations in Mindanao
against the MILF are "defensive, preemptive and retaliatory."

<HEADLINE> Peace Process With MILF to Continue: Govt Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government maintains
open lines of communication with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) in its desire to secure a just and enduring peace in
Mindanao, a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno, who is also presidential
spokesman, said in a statement that the MILF has already declared
its willingness to work with the government peace panel in
hammering out a "comprehensive and peaceful resolution to the
Mindanao situation despite the ongoing conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Consultations are currently being conducted by the MILF with
their political leaders and commanders on the political package
offered by the government as contained in House Bill No. 7883,"
Puno said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The results of the MILF's consultation shall be presented
during the July 29, 2000 meeting of the government and the MILF
peace panels, Puno noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Puno, House Bill No. 7883 pertains to the measure
expanding the coverage of the existing Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM) to include other provinces and cities in the
island.
</P>
<P>
This amended act will still have to undergo a plebiscite to
secure the approval of the people covered by the expanded ARMM, in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Puno stressed the two conditions set by President
Joseph Estrada -- for the MILF to give up its bid for an
independent Islamic state and to stop its terrorist and criminal
acts -- "must be satisfied for the peace talks to progress."
</P>
<P>
Puno also made it clear that the continued military operations
against the MILF in Mindanao is a legitimate act by the government
to "protect its citizenry, uphold the law and defend the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the military confirmed that starting from Saturday
evening, the government troopers launched an air attack at the
Camp Abubakar, the MILF's headquarters in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
This was the first ever wave of military offensive against the
MILF's biggest camp, that was staged following the June 30
deadline set by President Estrada.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reportedly failed to sign an interim peace accord
before the end of the government-set deadline.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of "Shanghai Five" Summit Pledge to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- In their annual summit
meeting here Wednesday, presidents from China, Tajikistan, Russia,
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan pledged to enhance cooperation among
their nations.
</P>
<P>
President of the hosting country, Emomali Rakhmonov, presided
over the meeting, commonly known as the "Shanghai Five" summit
since it first began in Shanghai, China in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Attending this year's summit are Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev, and Tajik President
Rakhmonov.
</P>
<P>
Uzebekistan President Islam Karimov attended the meeting for
the first time as an observer.
</P>
<P>
All the five presidents highly commended the development of the
"Shanghai Five" summit process. Starting as a forum aimed at
reducing hostility along the border lines, the mechanism has
turned out to be a new niche for regional cooperation in political,
security, law enforcement, and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state called for concrete cooperation among the
five nations, ranging from state level to government department
level, on bilateral and multilateral basis.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made a four-point proposal to
turn the meeting mechanism to a cooperation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade cooperation was a hot topic for the five
leaders. Each of them briefed the summit on the economic situation
in his country and presented specific projects open to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
China's Jiang welcomed the countries at the summit to
participate in China's development of its vast western areas.
</P>
<P>
Kyrzyrstan President Askar Akayev invited others to join the
energy and communication program linking up the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on separatism, terrorism and extremism was also
high on the agenda of the meeting. While condemning the terrorist
activities rampant in the region, all vowed to enhance cooperation
among security and law enforcement departments.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Putin said that the crackdown on terrorists "
is not enough," (and) efforts should be made to disarm them
ideologically so that they could not plan terrorist activities in
the pretext of "fight for faith."
</P>
<P>
All agreed to maintain the authority of the United Nations as a
global framework to safeguard world peace and stability.
Khazakstan President Nazarbayev said the maintenance cannot go
against the recognized norms governing international relations.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, the presidents of "Shanghai Five" nations
signed the Dushanbe Statement.
</P>
<P>
The Dushanbe meeting marked the conclusion of the first round
of the "Shanghai Five" summit. The presidents agreed that the next
summit will be held in Shanghai, China in early June next year.

<HEADLINE> EU to Regret Austrian Referendum: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Wednesday that it would regret the fact that Austria will have to
hold a referendum on its relations with the bloc.
</P>
<P>
The commission will "deeply" regret the referendum if Austria
holds it as planned in late October or November, said Peter
Guilford, a spokesman for the European Commission, the executive
body of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
He added that, however, the commission would follow the
yardstick it had followed throughout the crisis between Austria
and its EU partners.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been maintaining a business-as-usual
approach toward Austria after 14 EU member states jointly imposed
political sanctions on Austria for its incorporation into the
governing coalition of the far-right Freedom Party in February.
</P>
<P>
Austria had asked for lifting the sanctions by the EU summit
held last month at Feira, Portugal. The appeal was rejected though
Portugal, then holding the rotating EU presidency, said it would
work out a sanction-lifting process before its term expired on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the commission would deeply regret it
too if the Austrian referendum would decide to block EU
institutional reforms or other decisions needing unanimous support
to become law.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel said Tuesday that
the decision to hold the referendum was reached after six hours of
discussion by a government special committee including former
leader of Freedom Party Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
Haider warned that Austria would block EU legislation that
requires consensus unless sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
An Austrian government statement said Tuesday that the
referendum would not be held if the sanctions are lifted ahead of
the event, which would take place on October 29 or November 26.

<HEADLINE> Best WNBA Player to Retire after the Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Cynthia Cooper, who won the MVP
award at the WNBA finals all three years of the league's existence,
plans to retire at the end of the season to go into broadcasting
or coaching.
</P>
<P>
"This is my last year in the league," the Houston Comets star
said, "I will retire after this year."
</P>
<P>
Cooper, 37, was the league's scoring champion in its first
three seasons and the regular season MVP in 1997 and 1998. In
this year's season opener, she became the first player in the
league to reach 2,000 career points.
</P>
<P>
But she grew increasingly disgruntled about her reduced role in
the Comets' offense.
</P>
<P>
With the emergence of Sheryl Swoopes, Tina Thompson and Janeth
Arcain as more potent weapons, Cooper felt her role with the
Comets was changing.
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a lot more basketball in me, but I'm not happy,
" she said. "And I'm not going to play for another team. Houston
is where I started, this is where I wanted to finish."

Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates on Wednesday

Reiterer also charged that some of Australia's top swimmers and

BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The adoption of the rule of law
regarding the promotion and popularization of the common language
is of great importance for safeguarding national unity,
strengthening solidarity between people of different ethnic groups
and boosting social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
This was a call made by members of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC) at a meeting today to discuss
a draft of the law on the national common language. The lawmakers
reached a consensus on the promulgation of such a law.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the discussion, the legislators showed their
concern over widespread errors in the use of Putonghua, or
standard Chinese, especially in advertisements and other business
activities.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that such errors may have a negative effect on young
people, they proposed that the teaching of Putonghua and standard
characters be compulsory in all schools.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese language is also used in Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Macao and Singapore, as well as other parts of the world where
overseas Chinese live, the State Language Working Committee under
the Ministry of Education should make efforts to spread Chinese
worldwide, according to the legislators.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, some of the speakers suggested that overseas
Chinese be consulted before publishing any new simplified
characters to avoid misunderstandings.

<HEADLINE> Campus Ideological, Ethical Education Emphasized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's educational authorities
today urged schools nationwide to enhance ideological and ethical
education among both students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Chen Zhili said here today that greater
importance should be attached to ideological and political work,
as well as the work of building the Chinese Communist Party on
campuses in the new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
More young and highly-qualified intellectuals in colleges and
universities will be encouraged to join the Party. Courses to
introduce Marxism and Deng Xiaoping theory and to enhance students
' ethical awareness should be available at more colleges, Chen
said at a national meeting on Party building in colleges.
</P>
<P>
The main ideological trends on the Chinese campuses are steady,
healthy and positive, Chen noted at the meeting, which was
attended by provincial-level educational officials and Party
secretaries of some 100 colleges. But, she pointed out, lots of
prominent problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
At another national meeting here today, Vice-Minister of
Education Lu Fuyuan stressed that measures should be taken to
strengthen ethical education among students and teachers in
primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
The official said some schools have failed to enable their
students to develop morally, even though intellectual education
has been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"Some teachers are unqualified in terms of working abilities
and professional ethics. Some students lack a sense of sympathy
and responsibility, as well as political and legal awareness," Lu
said, calling it a major cause of the rise of juvenile delinquency
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said innovative measures should be taken to educate students
to be diligent, while teachers should be urged to love, treat
equally and respect students.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Urge Putting Trust Firms Under Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese legislators today urged
that a study be made of the chaotic situation of the trust
companies in the country and that the industry be brought under
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers discussed the draft law on trust business here
today at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress. They criticized some local trust firms for
their irresponsible or illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, many local governments are depositing big money in
trust companies, regardless of the fact that the money is going
nowhere, as some of the trust firms are on the brink of bankruptcy,
said Wei Jisong.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqing said that the current draft of the law on trust
business does not cover trust companies. If trust firms are beyond
the reach of the law on trust business, the implementation of the
law will be hampered, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also called for punishment for illegal activities
involving trust companies by means of the law.

<HEADLINE> Survey: HK People's Drinking Habits Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people have become more
health-conscious thanks to continuous health education to promote
drinking eight glasses of beverage a day, experts at the
University of Hong Kong said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey results unveiled by researchers
of the university, Hong Kong people's awareness of the eight
glasses per day level of fluid intake has significantly improved
from 47 percent in 1998 to 62 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The drinking habit of citizens in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, in
terms of actual fluid intake per day, is similar, the survey said,
indicating that still 34 percent of people in Hong Kong and 38
percent in Guangzhou failed to achieve the healthy level of fluid
intake.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the findings in 1998, more people in Hong Kong
have coffee, tea and alcoholic drinks daily. Daily drinkers of
milk and bottled water in Hong Kong have also increased in 2000
compared with 1998, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Knesset Lifts Mordechai's Immunity to Allow Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament) House
Committee on Wednesday removed former Transport Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai's immunity so that he can stand trial on criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen members of the committee voted in favor of lifting
Mordechai's immunity while Roni Milo from Mordechai's Center Party
abstained.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Mordechai made his comment in the Knesset on
the attorney general's decision to indict him on sexual harassment
charges.
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of the affair, an unprecedented and
unbridled crusade of abuse and instigation was held against me," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I was indicted, convicted and punished without a trial ... all
I have to say in my defense -- and I have a lot to say -- I will
say in court," He added.
</P>
<P>
"In the present circumstances I request my immunity to be
lifted, so that trial can be held," Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
The case against Mordechai came as a result of a complaint by a
Transport Ministry female staffer in March that Mordechai sexually
harassed and assaulted her. Two other women also came up to accuse
Mordechai of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai resigned from his post as transport minister and from
the Center Party leadership in May following the announcement of
plans by Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein to arraign him.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein detailed on Wednesday to the committee the main
charges against Mordechai and asked the committee to lift
Mordechai's immunity, allowing him to face trial.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the lifting of Mordechai's immunity, an indictment
will be submitted to the Jerusalem magistrate's court. The trial
may go on for many months as Mordechai denies the accusations
against him and the prosecution wants to bring 39 witnesses to the
stand.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses include head of the police investigation
department and the three women who made the complaints.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Fears New Demarcation Map in Israel's Favor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon fears that a new map drawn by
a United Nations team over the verification of Israel's withdrawal
from south Lebanon will be in Israel's favor and at Lebanon's
expense.
</P>
<P>
The "blue line" map, which was submitted to the Security Council
on Monday night, will be presented to the Israeli government on
Thursday and the Lebanese government on Friday by U.N. Middle East
envoy Terje Roed Larsen and chief U.N. cartographer Miklos Pinther
during their upcoming trip to the region, An Nahar newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The new map raised fears among Lebanese officials that certain
adjustments would be introduced on the withdrawal line to exonerate
Israel's current border encroachments, An Nahar said.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers said Israeli pressure was behind the
projected introduction of the new line that involved three major
changes from the original "blue line" map, drawn last month by
Larsen and Pinther to measure the compatibility of Israel's
withdrawal with U.N. resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is determined to reject the new line, which includes
some changes on the border, and insist on the "original demarcation
that was based on the 1923 internationally recognized border line
with Israel," officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Pinther "has drawn a new line that removes
all Israeli trespasses" while the chief cartographer said he used
82 maps from the archives of the U.N., Britain and France to draw
the new map.
</P>
<P>
Safir newspaper said the main objective of Larsen and Pinther in
the upcoming trip is to bring about a consensus between Lebanon and
Israel on the demarcation. "He also carries an urgent U.N. request
for Lebanon to permit the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping force
(UNIFIL) in liberated south Lebanon before the end of July," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL, which had verified the border with Lebanese authorities,
acknowledged the existence of 12 Israeli encroachments on Lebanese
land in its latest report to the Security Council on Sunday, which
supports Lebanon's official accusation of border violations.

<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has come under the spell of a
heat wave Wednesday, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees
centigrade in the country's west.
</P>
<P>
The intense heat wave had been predicted by the State
Meteorology Office, which warned the upsurge would reach its height
in Turkey on July 5-6, raising temperatures to 40 degrees in the
Marmara region and 43 degrees in the Mediterranean and the Aegean
regions.
</P>
<P>
The expected temperatures in Central Anatolia and the Black Sea
region would be below 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Meteorology experts say that the sizzling hot weather will
continue to be in effect for a few days, and warn people against
direct exposure under the scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
They also advise people not to allow kids, elderly and heart-
troubled people out if not necessary.
</P>

Turkey's school year ends in June and it is fortunate that all
students are now on summer vocation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urges Lebanon to Deploy Troops in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh on Wednesday attacked the Lebanese government for its
delay in redeploying its troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese government delayed its troop redeployment in south
Lebanon due to its weak excuses and such a move could not help
maintain the peace along the border," Sneh told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Sneh also warned the Lebanese government not to let the local
military group such as Hezbollah to resume military activities
against Israel in south Lebanon, saying any anti-Israel activities
will be met with harsh retaliation.
</P>
<P>
A potentially dangerous vacuum has been created in south Lebanon
due to the delay in full implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 425, foreign diplomats here have said.
</P>
<P>
The lingering uncertainty over the international boundary and
absence of a full U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon since
Israel's troops withdrawal on May 24, mean a flare-up of violence
is still possible, the diplomats added.
</P>
<P>
Special U.N. Middle East envoy Terje Roed Larsen and other U.N.
experts are due to arrive here Wednesday evening in an effort to
resolve the problems concerning the border line.
</P>
<P>
Larsen reported to the Security Council on Monday about the
delineation of the border between Israel and Lebanon, saying 12
points along the border need modification.
</P>
<P>
Most of these disputed points were reported to be relatively
minor, where Israeli patrol routes, installations or equipment
encroached on Lebanese territory. The only major problem was
reported to be north of border town of Metulla, where Israel
Defense Forces were said to have been seen in trenches on land
considered to be inside Lebanon.

<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates has emerged as the largest
producer of condensates in the Middle East, followed by Saudi
Arabia, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
"We expect condensate output from Adnoc-operated projects to
reach 400,000 barrels per day (bdp) this year, compared with 300,
000 bdp by Saudi Aramco," an oil trader was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trader added that with ongoing works by the Abu Dhabi Co for
Onshore Oil Operations, Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Co and the Abu
Dhabi Liquefied Gas Co, the UAE is expected to increase production
further over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt led Arab countries in the number of oil and
natural gas discoveries last year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt made 19 discoveries in 1999, accounting for 42 percent of
the total made by the 10-member Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OAPEC), a English-language newspaper quoted
the OAPEC annual report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The organization called on the Egyptian government to continue
widening the scope of prospecting activities in Northern Sinai, the
Red Sea, the Nile Valley and Delta, and the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt Telecom is planning to cut prices by 25 percent
for telephone calls to a number of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Okail Hamed Basher, newly appointed chairman of the company,
said on Tuesday that a working team has been formed to specify the
prices for various services offered, including international calls
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Basher, meanwhile, denied any imminent cut of the prices for
domestic and mobile phone calls. But he said the issue needs to be
studied.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish State Planning Organization (DPT) gave green
light to 16 out of 29 power projects with a total 1,034 megawatt
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The projects, which are planned to be launched by 2002, also
include natural gas, hydroelectric, wind plants.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the reason why the 16 projects were chosen
was because their financing was in order and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
They indicated that many of the projects waiting for approval by
the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry were not supported by the
Treasury because it can only guarantee a limited amount of funds.
The DPT does not support them because it believes that excess
capacity will emerge in the energy sector in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Large Scale Fabric Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka on Wednesday launched a
large scale fabric project which is the single largest investment
in the industrial sector approved so far for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Board of Investment Thilan Wijesinghe said the
project worth 3 billion rupees (38 million U.S. dollars) is a
joint venture between a local company and a British company to
manufacture weft knitted fabric.
</P>
<P>
MAS Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. will share the equity investment with
Textured Jersey Ltd. of Britain on an equal basis to set up the
joint venture at the Sitawaka Industrial Zone, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Textured Jersey will provide the state-of-the-art technical
expertise while MAS will provide the personnel and professional
and operational management.
</P>
<P>
The venture, the first to manufacture weft knitted fabric in
Sri Lanka, will provide 23 percent of the fabric that Sri Lankan
garment manufacturers require after being put into production in
July next year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka annually imports 41 million square meters of weft
knitted fabric at the cost of 123 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Garments are Sri Lanka's major export item. However, the
country has to import most of the fabrics which are used to
manufacture garments because domestically made fabrics are scarce
here.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Cracks Down on Illegal Emigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in east China, an
area plagued by emigration problems, has intensified its crackdown
on stowaways after 58 illegal immigrants were found dead in a
truck at the English port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, local governments at all levels have
taken various measures to crack down on illegal emigration. "
Snakeheads," or those involved in human trafficking, have received
severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
Courts at all levels in the province handled 296 emigration
cases involving 595 people last year, and 97 of them were
sentenced to two years imprisonment or more.
</P>
<P>
By June this year, 900 snakeheads had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has launched two three-month long anti-emigration
campaigns since last December, resulting in the arrests of 289
people allegedly involved in organizing and shipping illegal
stowaways.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, only 17 emigration cases have been
investigated, involving 79 people, down 72.6 percent and 92.6
percent, respectively, compared with the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has adopted strict measures to
supervise ships and fishermen in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Following the Dover accident, the provincial government also
tightened control on exit applications and called for rapid
development of the economy to solve surplus labor and to improve
people's living standard
</P>
<P>
Fujian was one of China's first provinces to initiate the
reform and opening policy in the late 1970s. At present, the
province's gross domestic product has reached 10,900 yuan (1,313
dollars), ranking seventh in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Police in Shantou, south China's
Guangdong Province, are holding two men and a woman suspected of
kidnapping a Hong Kong businessman and taking him from Shenzhen to
Chaoyang, both in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
According to police, the Hong Kong businessman was kidnapped on
June 8, when 38-year-old Huang Zhaolin and an unnamed party broke
into his residence in Shenzhen and took him to Chaoyang.
</P>
<P>
After beating and torturing the businessman, the kidnappers
demanded that a ransom of one million Hong Kong dollars be
transferred into two bank accounts in Hong Kong.
</P>

On June 9, relatives of the kidnapped man sent the money, but
the kidnappers added another three million Hong Kong dollars to
the original sum, saying they would kill their hostage if the
money did not appear.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Institute to Train More Teachers for Deaf Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- An institute was set up here today
to train professional teachers to help deaf children retrieve
their hearing.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Hearing and Language Recuperation Technologies
Institute was founded by the China Disabled Persons' Federation
and Beijing Union University. It will train teachers to help deaf
children improve their hearing and speaking abilities through a
series of scientific programs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has 800,000 deaf children under
seven years old, most of whom still have some hearing ability and
could recover with the help of effective training.
</P>
<P>
Yet China at the moment only has about 3,800 teachers working
to help these children. Some of them have not received enough
professional education or training.
</P>
<P>
High-school graduates anywhere in the country can apply to be
trained at the institute.

<HEADLINE> Amendments to Patent Law to Encourage Individual Creativity: Legislators (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Does a patent belong to an
individual or the unit he works for when he creates an invention
using his unit's funding and equipment?
</P>
<P>
This became a hotly debated issue in this morning's
deliberation of the draft amendments to the Patent Law among the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China'
s top law-making body.
</P>
<P>
Luo Yifeng, one of the committee members, suggested that the
law protect the patent rights of the unit in such circumstances,
citing the case of some would-be-retirees. They usually take
advantage of the research conditions provided by their units to
develop their own research projects, he said, and upon the
retirement register the results of the projects as their own
patents.
</P>
<P>
"This infringes on the patent rights of the unit," he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yizhong, another legislator, thought otherwise. "It's true
that they take advantage of the equipment of the unit, but the
creative idea and design belong to the individual rather than the
unit. Therefore, the individual should claim the major part in the
patent," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Xie Songkai, also a member of the law-making body, sat on the
fence. He felt that both parties play some role in the invention,
and simply stipulating that the patent belongs to the unit doesn't
encourage creativity.
</P>
<P>
Thus, "the researcher and the unit should sign an agreement on
the patent issue as well as on the percentage of the distribution
of the profits beforehand," he said.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Symposium on Heritage Protection Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Experts from China and world
organizations today convened at Beijing's Palace Museum to discuss
solutions to the dilemma of how to promote rapid urbanization and
heritage protection at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, "China -- Cultural Heritage Management and Urban
Development: Challenge and Opportunity," is the first of its kind
in China, a 5,000-year-old country which is undergoing breakneck
urban construction amid an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium's opening ceremony, Minister of Culture Sun
Jiazheng said that the growing population and accelerating
urbanization process in China are gradually eroding its
traditional cultural environment.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the holding of the symposium itself shows the
resolution of the Chinese government to properly preserve the
country's treasured heritage while speeding up economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, director of the State Cultural Heritage
Administration (SCHA), suggested establishing a joint meeting of
administrative bodies concerned with relics protection and urban
landscaping.
</P>
<P>
Some cities in China have organized experts to provide
consultations for urban development policy-making bodies, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
Discussions during the symposium are expected to focus on the
establishment of cultural heritage lists, the planning and
protection of historical sites, rational use of ancient buildings
and sites, and the relationship between relics protection and
tourism promotion.
</P>
<P>
A document on relics protection and urban development may be
issued after the meeting, said an official with the SCHA.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now boasts 400,000 relics sites,
including 750 sites under the state's top protection.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 cultural relics sites and scenic spots in China
have been included in world heritage list of the United States
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

NPC Vice Chairman Zhou Guangzhao held that the international
practice in this regard should be relied upon to solve the problem.
He noted that some researchers and units steal the patents of some
State-funded research projects.
</P>
<P>
"The patents of such projects should belong to the State, and
of course, the researcher and the unit should gain their due
profits from the project," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other lawmakers put forward various proposals for the draft
amendments.
</P>
<P>
Qin Chijiang, an NPC deputy, suggested that the law stipulate
that the government provide some economic and legal aid to those
important patent projects that are especially in need of funding.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee member Wang Mingshi said that strict
punishment was designed for any patent administration departments
that actively promote patented products by abusing their power.
</P>
<P>
Nie Li, Wang Xuan and Song Qingwei, members of NPC Standing
Committee, urged that stricter measures, especially administrative
measures, be in place to fight the rampant infringement of patent
rights.
</P>
<P>
They proposed that patent administration offices be established
in the governments below the provincial level when necessary.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Expects World's 1st Bottlenose Dolphin by Artificial Insemination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expecting the birth
of the world's first baby bottlenose dolphin by artificial
insemination in May 2001, researchers at Hong Kong Ocean Park said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Project leader Fiona Brook of the Hong Kong Polytechnic
University and his colleagues at the Ocean Park confirmed the park
's unprecedented success in producing the pregnancy by artificial
insemination of a bottlenose dolphin.
</P>
<P>
The new mother-to-be "Ada" is among four female dolphins chosen
to receive artificial insemination in April this year, but the
other three's pregnancy has not been confirmed yet, Brook said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an exciting breakthrough for the care and
understanding of marine mammals," said Brook. "We have been able
to study and learn so much more about dolphins here and that
knowledge will help to ensure the health and well-being of
dolphins in captivity worldwide," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Ocean Park and the Hong Kong Polytechnic
University began a collaborative research program to investigate
the reproductive physiology of dolphins and ways to control
breeding with the aim of maximizing their genetic health.
</P>
<P>
The program, acknowledged as being at the forefront of marine
mammal care and breeding science, has since attracted attention
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are now able to access the maturity of each dolphin
and identify and monitor ovarian cycles in female dolphins, which
makes it possible for them to artificially create dolphin
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
"There are many advantages of artificial insemination," added
Ocean Park's Chief veterinarian, Natalie Rourke, suggesting the
project's scientific significance. "It means that there may be no
need to take more dolphins from the wild; there will be less risk
and disruption to the animals; new genes can be introduced into
isolated groups of animals and it may be possible to enhance
reproduction in endangered species."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Size Down Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian army is to reduce its
size by 4, 000 annually, according to the country's Chief of Army
Staff General Vitor Malu.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Wednesday quoted him as saying that the
downsizing of the 84,000 strong army was in line with the vision
of the present administration to have a more compact, mobile and
effective troop.
</P>
<P>
He said here on Tuesday that about 5,000 soldiers would be
disengaged from the force before the end of the year while 1,000
would be recruited to bring the "net attrition rate" to 4,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
Malu also confirmed that some of the officers accused of
wrongdoings under former military regimes have been sacked from
the service.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian army's main goal is to keep the "oneness" of Nigeria,
which is currently under threat of ethnic clashes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The army would no longer allow itself to be cajoled into
politics, he said, as "the present generation of the military is
quite aware that our orders come from the political class."
</P>
<P>
The armed forces ruled the country in more than half of the
years after it gained its independence in 1960.

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Yangpu Still Attractive to Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- There's plenty of proof that
investors still regard the Yangpu Economic Development Zone on the
Chinese island province of Hainan an ideal destination for their
cash.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,100 domestic and overseas investors gathered in the
zone in the northwestern coast of Hainan for a two-day economic
cooperation and entrepreneurs' fair in late June.
</P>
<P>
Participants held active discussions with local administrative
officials and other government departments about the detailed
procedures regarding zone investment.
</P>
<P>
The development zone is located inside the 150-sq-km Yangpu
Peninsula on the northwestern coast of Hainan and covers an area
of 30 sq km. The zone is about 140 kilometers away from Haikou,
capital of China's southernmost province and largest special
economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula has a 110-kilometer coastline and is known as an
excellent natural port, with its calm, silt-free water. It is
suitable for building 26 deep-water berths each of which can
accommodate ships with at least 10,000 dead weight tonnage(dwt).
</P>
<P>
Located in the central belt of the Asian and Pacific Economic
Rim and the center of the international sea-lane, the peninsula
can be developed into a key international cargo collection and
distribution center.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu Peninsula is endowed with rich natural resources. A
survey shows that the sea areas in its southern and western parts
abound in natural gas and oil, and the peninsula itself has
plentiful salt and titanium deposits. In addition, deposits of
coal, oil shale, high-quality quartzite and limestone have been
found in areas near Yangpu.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu Economic Development Zone, founded in 1992, was
originally planned to be built into an export-oriented industrial
district emphasizing advanced technology and the development of
tertiary industry.
</P>
<P>
The district is a bonded area and various preferential policies
are introduced for foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
But now it has faded from the limelight, as the plan to attract
multinationals to invest in the zone was dashed following the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, leaders from the
Administration for Yangpu Economic Development Zone and the Yangpu
Land Development Co. Ltd. have stepped up efforts to promote
Yangpu.
</P>
<P>
In addition to hosting investment promotion fairs in Haikou,
Wenzhou and Shanghai in the first half of the year, Yangpu will
also sponsor similar fairs in Beijing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and the
United States in the later half of the year, said Zhu Xiancheng,
head of the administration for zone.
</P>
<P>
Those efforts have started to pay off. A great number of new
projects have been approved for the zone this year and will soon
start construction, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Zhu suggested investors spend more on projects that use local
resources as raw materials in processing, or projects that rely on
imported raw materials but produce commodities for overseas market.
</P>
<P>
They might also consider starting up trading companies by
taking advantage of the preferential policies Yangpu enjoys as a
bonded area and Yangpu's location near Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentences go to Two Men Making, Trading Fake Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Cai Xiong and Xie Zhuxin, who
were both found guilty of counterfeiting currencies, were recently
sentenced to death by the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
The court also handed down a death sentence but with a two-year
probation to Chen Zongqiang, who was convicted of collaborating
with Cai in making phony currencies.
</P>
<P>
In the same ruling, the court sentenced another 26 criminals to
imprisonment from set terms to life for making, trading and
smuggling counterfeit money.
</P>
<P>
According to court reports, in July of 1995, Xie Zhuxin, a
resident of Guiping City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, sold 1,000 counterfeited ten-Hong-Kong-dollar coins to Cai
Xiong, a Hong Kong resident, for a price of 1,600 yuan (about 193
U.S. dollars in Zhongshan City, also in Guangdong Province. Cai
resold the fake coins in Shenzhen for 2,300 yuan (about 277.11 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Cai also collaborated with Xie in
counterfeiting 10,000 new Taiwan dollar coins with a face value of
50 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, Cai, emboldened by his success in counterfeiting
currencies, continued to make fake Hong Kong dollar coins by
colluding with Chen Zongqiang, a contractor of a hardware and
plastic molding factory in Shenzhen. By March 1997, the two had
made more than 100,000 fake Hong Kong ten-dollar coins.

<P>
LHASA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A modern cosmic ray research center
is being built at Yangbajain Township in southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The center, located in the existing cosmic ray observation
center, is a joint venture by China and Italy. China invested 30
million yuan in the project while Italy provided 6 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
When the center starts operation at the end of this year, it
will use new detectors to observe cosmic rays, which will collect
more data than conventional observation equipment.
</P>
<P>
The observation center, the only one in China, was set up by
Chinese and Japanese scientists in 1989. Yangbajain is considered
the best spot for cosmic ray observation in the world as it stands
at 4,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The center has increased its number of detectors from 49 in
1989 to the present 527.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development Zone in Hainan Ready for Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yangpu Economic Development
Zone (EDZ) in south China's Hainan Province today hosted a
conference to explain the advantages of its investment environment
and preferential policies for investors.
</P>
<P>
Hainan governor Wang Xiaofeng told the audience that since the
zone was approved by the State Council in March 1992, the
developer and local government have invested up to 4.5 billion
Hong Kong dollars on port, road, electricity and other
infrastructure facilities in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Now all the facilities are in place and the time is ripe for
other investors to start their businesses in the zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu Xuancheng, head of the EDZ's administration,
Yangpu is an EDZ, high-tech industrial zone and free-trade zone in
one, and also enjoys the central government's preferential
policies for special economic zones and ethnic minority areas, all
of which have distinguished Yangpu from the other development
zones in China.
</P>
<P>
Among all the preferential policies, enterprises in Yangpu
would automatically have the rights to export and import
independently. They could reserve their income in foreign
currencies and remit their earnings out of China freely, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 500 government officials, business leaders, and
representatives from foreign missions and chambers of commerce in
Beijing were present at the conference.

<HEADLINE> Weapon Stealer Wounded in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Security forces Wednesday shot
and wounded a man during a brief skirmish with a group of weapon
stealers who are surrounded on a hillock in Sauk in Malaysia's
northern state of Perak, police said.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the man's injury could not be ascertained as his
fellow members dragged him away, Inspector-General of Police
Norian Mai told reporters at a police station near Sauk, Bernama
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of fire occurred Wednesday morning at the Bukit
Jenalek jungle, he said, adding that during the exchange, the
group fired three shots first and when the security forces
returned fire, a shot hit one of the gang members.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said the gang could be politically motivated
and its members are part of a mystical cult.
</P>
<P>
Norian also confirmed that the group is still holding three
people hostage, including two policemen.
</P>
<P>
The group of 15 impersonators raided two army camps in the
state within three hours early Sunday and made off with a haul of
more than 100 rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Sauk town is the center of a massive combined police-military
operations against the group, who are trapped on the hillock.

<HEADLINE> More Bombs Found in Indonesian Attorney General's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Following a bomb blast at the
Indonesian Attorney General's Office (AGO) Tuesday afternoon, a
cardboard box containing two bombs was reportedly found again by
the police in a toilet on the third floor of the AGO Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But police told reporters that the bombs had been defused by
bomb specialists of the National Police (Polri) in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police are still investigating the origin of the
bombs. There are also no reports about whether the new bombs have
anything to do with the one which exploded in the AGO the day
before.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a bomb explosion rocked the AGO, just hours after
the youngest son of former President Soeharto underwent
questioning in connection with corruption charges. No casualties
were reported in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Polri Gen. Rusdihardjo said Wednesday that the
police still do not know whether any links existed between Tuesday
's explosion and the questioning of Soeharto's son, Tommy.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know whether there is a link between the blast
and Tommy's questioning," Rusdihardjo said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said he will not
be afraid of confronting such bomb terror.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be afraid," Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
He said his office's work pace would not slacken following
Tuesday's bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, we are determined to work as one man to
complete the cases we are handling," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai, HK Attract Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a new strategy of Hong Kong to attract Shanghai
citizens to the region.
</P>
<P>
More and more Shanghai citizens visited Hong Kong after it was
returned to the motherland in 1997. At the same time, Hong Kong
people's interest in ever-changing Shanghai is also growing.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, the number of Shanghai
tourists to Hong Kong increased by 56 percent. Some 68,000 Hong
Kong people traveled to Shanghai, more than the figure for the
corresponding period last year, according to statistics released
by the HKTA Shanghai office.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's new tourism attractions include the Orient Pearl
Tower and the International Conference Center. And its traditional
places of interest are Yu Park and the Jade Buddha Temple.
</P>
<P>
The rural areas outside Shanghai, Chongming Island, as well as
the ancient town of Zhujiajiao and rivers in the vicinity of the
city were also appealing to Hong Kong citizens.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai residents most often head for Hong Kong's Ocean Park,
Victoria Port, the former residence of late Taiwan popular music
star Teng Li-chun, watch dragon boat races, or go shopping.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Shanghai tourist arrivals in
Hong Kong surpassed 15,000, a jump of 31 percent over the same
period last year. The majority of the people went to Hong Kong on
a three-person family tour package.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies predicted that people from Shanghai and
neighboring Zhejiang Province will visit Hong Kong in large
numbers this summer.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Tourism Association, in cooperation with China
International Travel Service (CITS), will encourage Shanghai
students to travel to Hong Kong in groups and visit science,
culture and space centers.

<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 China International
Exhibition on Housing, sponsored by China's Ministry of
Construction, is scheduled to be held between July 12-16.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 real estate enterprises and household product
producers from Canada, the United States, Denmark, Austria, China
and other countries and regions are expected to display their
latest technologies and goods at the show.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be divided into six parts, displaying the
evolution of comfortable housing in China, real estate firms, new
technologies and products from abroad, China's quality household
products and housing development in various Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
According to Nie Meisheng, director of the Housing
Industrialization Promotion Center under the Ministry of
Construction, China is in the midst of a massive housing
construction drive, building more than 400 million square meters
of floor space annually with investment exceeding 400 billion yuan
(about 48 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Massive housing construction and increasing sales have spurred
China's economic development, and have become a major focus of
consumer spending, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese T-bond Up on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese T-bond trade rallied
broadly on Wednesday, but with thinner trading.
</P>
<P>
The trading volume on the market totaled 1.09 billion yuan,
down 501 million yuan in comparison with the already sluggish
trade on Tuesday, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 (10-year bond with a rate of 9.78 percent),
recouped some losses with a jump of 0.32 percent, pressing the
yield down to 4.00 percent. Bond 009908 (10-year bond with a rate
of 3.30 percent) also saw a firm rise of 0.35 percent to 101.39
yuan, with yield down 0.05 percentage point to 3.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bond 010004, the only bond with floating interest rate on the
market, gained 0.17 percent to close at 101.74 yuan with a yield
of 2.67 percent. It is still the most active with the biggest
turnover of 411 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking turnover on the T-bond market indicated that most
would-be investors are still cautiously watching and waiting. But
as market insiders expect the domestic stock market to fluctuate
downwards and drive some conservative investors into fixed-income
government securities market in the near future, bonds may turn
upbeat in the weakness of domestic shares, Homeway analysts said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Fund Market Corrects Slightly on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's fund market corrected
slightly Wednesday, with 4 funds rising, 6 unchanged and 16
declining.
</P>
<P>
Among the 22 funds that were in discounted trading, most
changed within 0.01 yuan from the last close. Fund Taihe, which
announced the interim divident allocation plan, still gained the
most attention and continued to go upwards, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
This reflects that market investors pay attention to the cash
return of funds, Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The other 4 restructured funds dropped between 4 percent and 7.
5 percent, following strong rises in the previous days. Market
experts said that it was because the speculation in the old fund
market was brought into the new fund market, according to Homeway.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Stresses Developing Arab Ties With Turkey, Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has stressed the importance for
Arab countries to develop ties with both Turkey and Iran, two
Muslim heavyweights in the Middle East, the Egyptian Gazette
newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first annual meeting of the non-governmental
Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
on Tuesday called for proper handling of strains, if any, between
the Arab world and the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We can not think of the future of peace in the Middle East
without taking into consideration the Arab world's relations with
Turkey and Iran," Moussa told the audience.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, set up in June 1999,
is an independent think tank on regional and international issues
which groups former diplomats, military commanders, businessmen and
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
"The international political environment is still in a state of
flux and the future of the Middle East will be greatly affected by
the changes taking place in this amorphous system," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized Egypt's keenness on maintaining good relations
with Ankara, saying that Turkey plays a key role in the Mideast
political and economic arena.
</P>
<P>
A predominantly Muslim but politically secular nation, Turkey
has become a regional ally of Israel. The Arabs were dubious of
their relations with Turkey, although it claimed that its
cooperation with Israel is not aimed against any third party and it
attaches importance to ties with Arab and Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also said that progress has been achieved in improving
Cairo-Tehran ties, adding that positive steps are being taken
toward a normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
Tehran cut off diplomatic ties with Cairo in 1979 after Egypt
signed a peace agreement with Israel, which it refused to recognize
but viewed as its arch-enemy. The two sides, nevertheless, have
come closer in the past few years due to joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said last Sunday that Egypt and Iran have held high-level
talks aimed at normalizing the ties, which "are making progress."
</P>
<P>
The talks followed a telephone conversation June 21 between
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his Iranian counterpart
Mohammad Khatami, the first direct contact between leaders of the
two countries in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office nearly three years ago, Khatami, a moderate,
has been advocating a policy of detente, instead of the previous
policy of exporting Islamic revolution. This change enabled Iran's
Arab neighbors, especially the Gulf states, to seek warmer
relations with it.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Relieved over U.S. Backing for Iraqi Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey was reassured that the Iraqi
opposition groups, which are trying to topple President Saddam
Hussein, got "no concrete" support from the U.S. government after
week-long talks, analysts here said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oppositions had asked for anti-tank weapons to be used
against Saddam's army, but the request was rejected by Washington,
unwilling to see conflicts in northern Iraq escalating, Turkish
Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States only agreed to train up to 145 members of the
Iraqi oppositions-in-exile for an unarmed struggle in the fields of
medicine, logistics, computer, communications, broadcasting and
power generation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meetings, Turkey expressed concerned over a revival
of the U.S. ambitious plan to overthrow the Saddam regime as the U.
S. presidential race gears up.
</P>
<P>
Turkey prefers a stable Iraq with territorial integrity to
getting rid of Saddam, which could cause serious consequences,
including a possible Kurdish state in northern Iraq bordering
southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This is because Ankara loathes to see a spillover of Kurdish
independent movement in northern Iraq into its own restive Kurdish-
populated southeast.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's capture of Abdullah Ocalan, chieftain of the
outlawed Kurdistan workers Party (PKK), Turkey has successfully
suppressed the PKK, which had been fighting for 15 years for self-
rule in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Turkey would not permit the founding of an
independent Kurdish state in the region, urging Baghdad to
reinforce control over its Kurdish-populated area.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is now considering upgrading diplomatic representation to
ambassadorial level in a bid to improve bilateral relations and
join efforts to check the separatist movement.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Govt Expands Partnership With Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
chaired a public forum here Wednesday to hear concerns raised by
the private sector about its investment difficulties in this
country.
</P>
<P>
"I gave instructions to increase the time of our meeting ... so
that all investors and business people will be able and have
enough time to discuss and air their grievances and concerns
pertaining to the general investment and business environment in
Cambodia," Hun Sen said in an opening speech to about 200 forum
participants.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the government's strategic motto is "poverty
reduction through high economic growth over the long term by
ensuring environmental sustainability and social equity."
</P>
<P>
Security and corruption are among the biggest concerns raised
by the private sector about investing in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"I am never tired of repeating that Cambodia enjoys today
unprecedented favorable conditions conducive to development never
seen during the last few decades," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said his government has been committed to
one-stop service since last year, which paves the way for
investors to get approval within a period of 28 days.
</P>
<P>
The government-private sector forum is held twice a year
starting from last December.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, meanwhile, said his government should strengthen the
government-private sector structure by setting up joint sectoral
working groups, such as those on legal affairs and regulatory
measures,tax policy, banking and finance, processing and garment
industry.
</P>
<P>
So far, the garment industry gets the most investment in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
There were just 70 garment factories in 1997 and 120 in 1998
and now the number has increased to 178. Many are owned by
companies based in South Korea, China's Hong Kong, Malaysia and
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Non-Oil/Gas Exports to Reach US$44 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The value of Indonesia's non-oil
and gas exports in the current year is expected to reach 44
billion U.S. dollars or significantly up from last year's 38
billion dollars, a senior official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the value of our non-oil and gas export within
this year will reach 44 billion U.S. dollars or up from last year'
s figure of 38 billion U.S. dollars," Minister of Trade and
Industry, Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, said at a hearing of the House
of Representatives Commission V on trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will hammer out a plan to meet the
target. "And if we are able to reach such targets, we think we
will also be able to provide huge job opportunities," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that Indonesia is still facing trouble in
enhancing its industrial capacities due to lack of investment.
</P>
<P>
"This condition (lack of investment) has something to do with
the current security condition in the country where riots are
still taking place in some areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (
BPS) showed that the country's non-oil and gas exports dropped by
3.99 percent in May this year to 3.8 billion dollars against 3.9
billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
A decline of 2.94 percent was also recorded in May in total
exports, which amounted to 4.8 billion dollars, compared with 4.9
billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
But the trade surplus in May this year rose by 18 percent to 2.
47 billion dollars from 2.1 billion dollars in the same period
last year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Operation to Round Up Army Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched an
islandwide operation to round up thousands of army deserters who
failed to report back during the latest period of amnesty which
expired on June 20, the state radio said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 soldiers of active service have deserted their
ranks during the last few years, the radio said, adding that most
of the army deserters are directly or indirectly responsible for
the recent wave of crime.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense has requested the public to provide
information about army deserters to their respective police
stations.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of army deserters will encourage efforts of crime
prevention, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
It added that those who hide information regarding army
deserters will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The 118,000-strong army, plagued by desertions, needs more
soldiers to fight Tamil Tiger rebels, who have been waging a war
to carve out a homeland called Eelam for the minority Tamils in
Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, the government has announced
amnesty three times, but only 5,000 deserters have returned to the
barracks, the military said. At least 30 soldiers desert each
month, a senior official said on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for Afghanistan's
ruling Taliban Maulvi Abdul Hai Mutmain said Wednesday that the
militia has great interest in exchanging prisoners with the
opposition and is making all-out efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media in Kandahar, South Afghanistan, he said
delegations from both sides had met the prisoners of war and they
exchanged lists of prisoners as well, according to the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Prior to recent fighting between the Taliban and the opposition,
the two factions had exchanged delegations in preparation for a
prisoners swap.
</P>
<P>
The delegations were satisfied after meeting the prisoners,
Mutmain said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the opponents were also satisfied to see that
their prisoners are safe and sound and in good health.
</P>
<P>
Having controlled over 80 percent of Afghanistan, the Taliban
are combating the north-based opposition to rule the whole country.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Troops Complete Withdrawal From Kisangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defence Forces
(UPDF) has completed withdrawal from the city of Kisangani in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) after repeated clashes with
Rwandan army, Ugandan Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima confirmed
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Katirima told Xinhua: "The Ugandan troops are moving to Buta,
some 300 kilometers away from the northeast Congolese city of
Kisangani."  The last Ugandan soldier in Kisangani arrived at
Banalia, 128 kilometers north of the war-torn city, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council demanded both Rwanda and Uganda to
withdraw their troops from Kisangani after the two armies shelled
each other in early June.
</P>
<P>
Leonida Grecu, officer of U.N. Observer team in Congo (MONUC)
overseeing the withdrawal, said he was happy with the Ugandans'
pullout, according to a New Vision daily report.
</P>
<P>
"The roads are bad but the Ugandans are now far from the 100
kilometers mark. This is a victory for the U.N. mission here,"
Grecu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Rwandan soldiers had also withdrawn from
Kisangani, but "a few were still at 75 kilometers on
Kisangani-Lubutu road. They are moving with another MONUC team
following them."
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops began implementing an agreement to
demilitarize Kisangani in the wake of clashes in early May.
</P>
<P>
The two former allies have sent their troops to DRC to support
rival rebel factions fighting against the DRC President Laurent
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government not to Interfere in Maize Price: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will not
interfere in maize price although some farmers of the country are
complaining of low price offered by what they call greedy buyers,
according to a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted Deputy Agriculture Minister
Enock Chikamba as saying here on Tuesday that the peasant farmers
who are being exploited by greedy maize buyers should not expect
the government to fix the price because it has created a
liberalized environment for them.
</P>
<P>
He said the farmers are to blame for their exploitation by
unscrupulous buyers who have been buying a 90-kg bag of maize at
about 5,000 Kwacha (1.7 U.S. dollars) instead of the commercial

If they are selling maize they have suffered for at a given
away price then they have only themselves to blame, he said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the country's liberalized economy, the government
can only facilitate the sale of products when it is necessary, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister made the statement in a reaction to
allegations by some peasant farmers that they are exploited by the
maize buyers because the government does not have a proper

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Sugar Export Quota to EU Rises to 12,000 Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's export quota for
sugar to the European Union countries has increased by 2,000 tons
to reach 12,000 tons in this financial year, the Guardian
newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Finance Crispin Hauli was quoted as saying
in the parliament in the central town of Dodoma on Tuesday that
Tanzania obtained the additional 2,000 tons of sugar to the EU
market for the year 2000/2001 after Uganda decided to stop
exporting sugar to EU market.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1975 Lome Convention between the EU and
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, Tanzania is
allowed to export 10,000 tons of sugar to the EU market at special
rates annually.
</P>
<P>
"Failure of some ACP countries to export sugar to the EU in
accordance with their quotas accounts for the surplus export of
sugar for Tanzania," explained Hauli, who is also Tanzanian
Ambassador to the EU in Brussels, Belgium.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Pledge to Strengthen Cooperation in World Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia
agreed here on Wednesday to further strengthen their mutual
support and cooperation, and unite other countries to play a
greater role in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached during a meeting between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Vladimir Putin, both
here attending the annual summit of the "Shanghai Five" nations,
which also brings together the heads of state from Tajikistan,
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between the
two presidents since Putin took office in May this year, though
they have had several telephone conversations over the past
several months.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang said both the fundamental interest of
the two countries and the special duties the two countries bear
for the world demand that China and Russia strengthen and deepen
the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, China and Russia can play an even greater
role in opposing hegemony and power politics, and push forward the
process of multi-polarization of the world, so long as the two
countries support each other, cooperate closely with each other
and unite other countries of the world in their efforts to this
effect, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also expressed his appreciation of
Russia's principled stance on the Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty,
and said that China and Russia should continue to strengthen and
deepen their cooperation in this field in a joint effort to
maintain the strategic security and stability of the world.
</P>
<P>
On the "Shanghai Five" mechanism, Jiang said that in the past
four year since the establishment of the mechanism, mutual
understanding and trust among the five nations had been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
With the further development of the "Shanghai Five" process,
China and Russia can do even more for safeguarding and promoting
regional peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin agreed with Jiang and said that Russia and China should
further strengthen their cooperation within the "Shanghai Five"
framework, which is playing a more and more important role in
world affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China and Kyrgyzstan
vowed here on Wednesday to beef up their joint efforts and
cooperation on fighting separatism, terrorism and extremism, which
are menacing peace and stability of the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
The two countries made the pledge during a meeting between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Kyrgyzstan President Askar
Akayev, who are here for the annual summit meeting of the "
Shanghai Five" nations.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Jiang said that since China and
Kyrgyzstan share a common position on fighting separatism,
terrorism and extremism, the two countries should continue to
support each other and cooperate with each other more closely to
this effect.
</P>
<P>
He said that China fully supports Akayev's proposal for
establishing an international anti-terrorism center within the
framework of the "Shanghai Five" summit.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the center is not only in the fundamental
interests of the two countries, but also is conducive to
maintaining peace and stability of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Akayev expressed his gratitude to China for firmly supporting
Kyrgyzstan's efforts to crack down on terrorist activities and
Kyrgyzstan's proposal of setting up the international anti-
terrorism center.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the signing of a border pact among Kyrgyzstan,
China, and Tajikistan on Wednesday was an important event in the
region. Agreeing with him, Jiang said that the signing of the pact
reflected the firm determination of the three countries to
strengthen their good-neighborly friendship and cooperation.

BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen composite index closed

The sub-index closed at 4735.26 points, 18.22 points lower than

The turnover hit 8.81 billion yuan (1.06 billion U.S. dollars),
8.23 percent less than yesterday's 9.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen composite index dipped slightly today with thin
trading. Hi-tech stocks performed actively, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
However, investors were concerned about IPO (Initial Public
Offering) pressure. Four new shares will be listed and two new

Shanghai and Shenzhen tomorrow, Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. was the top

BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
dipped 0.76 points or 0.68 percent to close at 111.15 points at
Wednesday close, extending losses in the last hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 65.48 million HK dollars, up 14.05
million dollars or 27.32 percent from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The market disregarded a series of positive news, which should
support the idea that China will speed up reforms of the stock
market as the country prepares to join the World Trade
Organization, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage foreign companies to list on its domestic
bourses, the domestic media quoted assistant foreign trade
minister Ma Xiuhong as saying yesterday. Qualified candidates can
seek listing either on the yuan-denominated A-share market or the
foreign currency B-share market, the first official confirmation
since British consumer goods maker Uniliver Plc filed its
application for a listing on China's A-share market last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's securities regulator is considering a
proposal to let companies that have already listed H shares in
Hong Kong to sell yuan-denominated A shares in the country. The
China Securities Regulatory Commission may pick some H share
companies as "trial cases" to conduct the experiment, Homeway said.

The total turnover was 12.30 million U.S. dollars, 73.73

China will encourage foreign-invested companies to list on its

<HEADLINE> Kenya Appeals for Food Aid Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has appealed once again to the international community to assist
Kenyans in combating famine.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya has never experienced drought and famine of this
magnitude," Moi was quoted as saying by the newspaper Daily Nation
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drought was threatening the lives of millions all over the
continent, he said when speaking during celebrations to mark the
224th anniversary of American independence at the residence of
U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Johnnie Carson in Muthaiga, Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The president thanked the United States for responding
"generously to supplement the (Kenyan) government's efforts".
However, he did not divulge how much the Americans have donated.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, Moi made an emotional appeal for an immediate 11.5
billion shillings (about 15.3 million U.S. dollars) donation for
starving Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program said Tuesday that accelerated food aid
for 3.3 million Kenyans was urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
So far, Kenya has received indications from donors to provide
25 to 30 percent of the food aid which it requested.

LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Nigerian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- In a move that has sent shockwaves through oil producing
nations of the world, Saudi Arabia has unilaterally decided to
increase oil production by 500,000 barrels per day with a view to
forcing crude oil price down to 25 U. S. dollar per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:
</P>
<P>
-- Military officers and soldiers currently standing trials for
alleged atrocities committed during the late General Sani Abacha
era have been disengaged from the services of the Nigerian army,

The Punch:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor leaders across the country on Tuesday rejected the
5,500 naira (55 U. S. dollars) proposed by the 36 state governors

festering industrial dispute between some state governments and
their workers.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Consider Implementing Customs Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) will consider implementing a Customs
Union and the Common External Tariff (CET) after the launch of the
Free Trade Area on October 31, a senior COMESA official has
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General of the COMESA Sondiso Ngwenya told
Wednesday' s Zambia Daily Mail that COMESA member states have
already committed themselves to the implementation of a CET by the
year 2004 of zero percent, 5 percent, 15 percent and 30 percent on
capital goods, raw materials, intermediate goods and final goods
respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said economic growth can not be addressed by trade policies
alone but through an integrated package of industrial and trade
policies.
</P>
<P>
"These policies must focus on mitigating the impact of factors
that inhibit producers from adjusting and improving productivity,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Pledges Cooperation With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and the United States will
continue to work closely for peace and security in the Horn of
Africa and the Great Lakes region, Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has said.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks Tuesday at a reception marking the 224th
anniversary of American independence at the American ambassador's
residence in Nairobi, media here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed satisfaction with the cordial and fruitful
relations enjoyed by the two countries at bilateral and
multilateral levels.
</P>
<P>
The government and people of Kenya were grateful for the
support the U.S. government had extended, especially in
humanitarian and development assistance, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Moi also thanked the U.S. for generous response towards his
appeal in earlier June for international assistance to supplement
the government's efforts in tackling the effects of the drought.
But he did not mention how much the Americans had donated.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Kenya considered the enactment of the
Africa Growth and Opportunities Act by the U.S. Congress as a
significant step in opening the American market to exports from
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is looking forward to the implementation of this Act and
hopes to see tangible results in the forms of American investment
and substantial increase in trade between the two countries, Moi
added.

<HEADLINE> International Telecom Union Agrees on New Standards for Voiceband Modems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) has agreed on three important new standards for
voiceband modems, the ITU announced in a press release received
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Building on the success of the now ubiquitous V.90
Recommendation for modems at data rates up to 56kbit/s, important
enhancements have now been agreed on in new Recommendation ITUT-T
V.92. The enhancements are:
</P>
<P>
-- An increase of more than 40 percent in the maximum data rate
towards the network to a new maximum of 48 kbit/s on the best
connections;
</P>
<P>
-- Significantly quicker start-up times on recognized
connections, and
</P>
<P>
-- The ability to put the modem "on-hold" when the network
indicates that an incoming call is waiting.
</P>
<P>
These enhancements will give significant benefits to the modem
user with improved access to interactive services, and the option
of exploiting voice response facilities associated with Internet
browsing, according to the ITU.
</P>
<P>
The new recommendations were made in Edinburgh, Scotland, last
week at a meeting of the ITU-T Working Party responsible for modem
specifications.
</P>
<P>
These important new features will further improve the Internet
users' experience by significantly reducing connect times and
providing improved access to new Internet services, said an ITU
official.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Protests at U.S. Serviceman's Alleged Molesting of Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The assembly of Japan's southernmost
island prefecture of Okinawa on Wednesday adopted a resolution
protesting at the recent alleged molesting of a 14-year-old girl
by an Okinawa-based U.S. Marine, the Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
The assembly unanimously approved the resolution demanding the
Japanese and U.S. governments take measures to prevent recurrence
of such incidents and apply strict discipline to U.S. soldiers,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Japanese police arrested a drunk 19-year-old U.S.
Marine based at the Futemma Air Station in Ginowan on suspicion of
breaking into a home in the city of Okinawa and molesting a junior
high school girl while she was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
"The frequent crimes committed by U.S. soldiers are causing
great anxiety and shock on the people of Okinawa Prefecture," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
"The prefectural assembly has been protesting at such acts, and
it is absolutely unpardonable it has happened again," it said
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 80 members of local civic groups gathered in
front of the U.S. Marine headquarters in the prefecture to protest
at the incident.
</P>
<P>
In response to the allegations, Earl Hailston, chief of U.S.
forces stationed in Okinawa, issued a statement Wednesday
expressing his apologies to the family involved and his regret at
the anxiety the incident has created.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Better Out-Patient Services Key for Poor People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Better organized out-patient
services could make the biggest immediate health gains for the
poor in most of the world's developing countries, according to the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
In low-income countries, most people turn to these services for
the prevention or treatment of the most common diseases, including
childhood diarrhea, lower respiratory infection, tuberculosis,
sexually transmitted diseases and acute malaria, said WHO in an
article in the latest issue of the Bulletin of World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
These are among the top 10 conditions responsible for the
overall disease burden in developing countries while out-patient,
or ambulatory, services deal with 80 percent of the disease burden
caused by these conditions. Out-patient services also account for
the largest share of total health expenditure in most developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the care provided is often costly and substandard, and
imposes a heavy financial burden on poor households. Professor
Peter Berman, author of the article, believes that one reason is
that governments have been paying too little attention to the
organization of these ambulatory health services.
</P>
<P>
"To do this wisely, much better information on primary care
organization will be needed as well as more experience with
diverse approaches to improve performance. This agenda has become
even more pressing with growing global attention to more complex
clinical problems such as reproductive health, integrated
management of sick children, and treatment of HIV/AIDS," the
author said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two decades, the countries of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have introduced
exciting innovations in governance, incentives, organization and
information to improve public management of health care, but few
of these innovations have migrated to lower income countries,
Berman said.

<HEADLINE> More Smuggled Drugs Seized in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at Gongbei
Checkpoint of south China's Guangdong Province has seized 250
grams of drugs from 37 smuggling cases since the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Gongbei Customs checkpoint is the second largest land port in
the Chinese mainland with the authority to handle procedures of
exit and entry for people from overseas. Every year some 30
million overseas people pass through the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, customs officers of Jiangmen City,
also in Guangdong Province, confiscated 4,267 tranquilizer tablets
from out-bound mail in the first five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The volume is more than five times the figure for the whole of
1999. The sharp rise is attributed to price cuts for tranquilizers
at home and abroad. Tranquilizers are under tight state control in
China.
</P>
<P>
Jiangmen is famous for being the hometown of many overseas
Chinese. Most of the seized medicine was hidden in parcels
destined for Canada, the United States, and other countries,
according to customs sources.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River to Go West, North (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- While China's west is to pipe
natural gas to the east, Chinese engineers are planning to channel
water into the west in order to support local development.
</P>
<P>
The plan to divert water from the Yangtze River in the south to
northern part of the county is progressing smoothly, and the first
phase of the project is expected to start in 2010, said Tan Yingwu,
chief engineer of the western route of the gigantic water
diverting project.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand of developing the vast west, water from the
upper reaches of the 6,300-kilometer-long Yangtze River, the
longest river in China, will be re-routed to the west via the
Yellow River, the second-longest river in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that water from the Yangtze would therefore be able to
flow westward into the eastern part of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, Hexi Corridor, an 1.1 million square kilometers area of
land with oasis west of the Yellow River, and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and Hebei Province in the north as well.
</P>
<P>
The western route will run across highlands with the lowest
altitude of over 3,400 meters. The Yangtze water in higher
elevations will easily flow into the Yellow River at a lower
altitude.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that a water conservancy system will then be
established in north and northwest China by making use of the
Yellow River's water course.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage has become a knotty problem restricting the
development of China's western region. It is estimated that areas
in the upper and middle reaches of Yellow River will face a water
shortage of four billion cubic meters by the year 2010. And the
figure will skyrocket to 11 billion cubic meters in 2030.

<P>
A series of severe sandstorms which hit Beijing and the Inner
Mongolia in April and May alerted the authorities and the public
to the urgency of the water crisis.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, with its water table and key reservoirs at their
lowest levels in the past two decades, is expected to impose water
quotas on industries, hotels, restaurants and universities during
the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that a project is in the planning stages to divert
three billion cubic meters of water from Daduhe River, a major
branch of Yangtze, into Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
China started research on the western route diversion plan in
1987. Over 1,000 engineers and researchers contributed to a report
on the north-to-south water diverting project submitted in 1996,
which focused on moving 19 billion cubic meters of water to the
north from the headstream of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The 19 billion cubic meters of water will increase the average
annual runoff volume of the Yellow River by one-third, and will
substantially ease the water shortage in the drought-prone
northwest.
</P>
<P>
Tan, who has been involved in the south-north water diversion
project since the 1950s, said that he has a dream that one day the
ancient Silk Road will reappear with its lush green prairie and
winding streams.

Sichuan to Tap Its Rich Hydro-Electric Power Resources
</P>
<P>
Zou Guangyan, vice governor of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, said that his province will open wider to the outside
world, and welcomes domestic and overseas power firms to tap its
rich hydro-electric power resources.
</P>
<P>
The province boasts 103 million kilowatts in potential hydro-
electric power resources, accounting for one-fourth of the
national total. The current installed generating capacity of the
province stands at 16 million kilowatts, supplying 80 billion kwh
of electricity annually.

<P>
Sino-German Afforestation Project in Ningxia
</P>
<P>
A Sino-German afforestation project has built more than 8,000
hectares of oasis in the eastern foot of the Helan Mountain, a
former desert area, along the middle and upper reaches of the
Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The project was kicked off in 1997 under an agreement between
the German Government and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 hectares of barren hills in the project area
were covered with trees in the past five years. The income of
local farmers was increased by over 23 million yuan (2.77 million
U.S. dollars) in the period.
</P>
<P>
 Resettlement Introduced to Help the Needy in Tibet
</P>
<P>
Farmers and herdsmen who are living in higher mountainous areas
with bad living conditions in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region will be relocated to places with better living environment
in the coming three to five years, according to sources from the
regional government.
</P>
<P>
The relocation will be carried out under the condition that
local farmers and herdsmen are willing to leave their native land,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has introduced a series of measures to
help poverty-stricken people in Tibet since the 1980s. As a result,
770,000 out of the 870,000 poverty-stricken people now have
sufficient food supply at present.

<HEADLINE> Toy Exports Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China exported 1.88 billion US
dollars-worth of toys in the first five months of this year, up 16.
4 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Toys made in China are popular in the global market. Statistics
show that China-made toys now account for nearly 30 percent of the
global market; nearly 70 percent of the toys in the United States,
the world's largest toy market, were imported from the country.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts noted that China-made toys will have even more
market opportunities in the future, citing that demand from Asian
and EU markets will pick up, and the domestic toy consumption
market is also expanding.
</P>
<P>
However, the added value of China-made toys is relatively low;
Chinese toy enterprises are weak in design skills and lack of
their own namebrand products; and the enterprises are not fully
aware of the importance of protecting their intellectual property
rights, resulting in too many counterfeit and shoddy toys, they
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> China Cuts Prices for Some Medicine by Big Margin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's pricing authorities have
decided to cut the retail prices for some medicine by an average
of 30 percent as of July 10.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts cover nine categories of 57 specifications,
including interferon and some other antibiotics, according to a
news release issued today by the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
"New prices will save consumers 800 million yuan of medical
fees annually," a SDPC official said, adding that the effort will
also facilitate the government-initiated medical care reform in
cities.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the price cuts mainly to lowered prices
of raw-material-based medicines, lowered costs due to production
expansion, and fierce market competition.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC also will take more steps to narrow the space for
kickbacks in medicine sales.

TIANJIN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese party leader has urged
town and township officials to increase transparency of government
work and promote democracy, so as to boost rural reform and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party Central Committee, made the remark during
his study tour in Tianjin, 100 km east of Beijing, from July 2-4.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is mainly responsible for the Party's disciplinary
issues, visited Baodi County, Tianjin, and talked with local
officials and ordinary people on promoting grassroots democracy
and openness of government work.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of the issue, Wei urged all
localities nationwide to participate in the effort.
</P>
<P>
The transparency plan should be combined with the strengthening
of internal supervision and management, so that any officials who
attempt to sidestep the rules with illegal activities will be
discovered, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the trickle-down effect of the work, saying that
boosting transparency of grassroots government work can lead to
the improvement of village level operations.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to announce Wednesday
whether he intends to call for a summit meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who spoke with both Arafat and Barak twice this week,
is leaning toward convening the summit at the end of the month, but
is waiting until after the July 4 (U.S. Independence Day) weekend
to make the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The White House denied reports that July 17 had already been
chosen for the start of the summit, stressing that "there has not
been a decision."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior political sources close to Barak said that as long as
prospects exist for progress in talks with the Palestinians and the
Syrians, "there is no point in talking about bringing the Likud
into the government, as that will be interpreted as a toughening of
the Israeli positions."
</P>
<P>
However, the failure of the talks with the Palestinians and the
eruption of violence could lead to the formation of a broad
government with Likud, according to senior sources in both the
opposition right-wing Likud party and the ruling One Israel bloc.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- An expanded panel of 11 Israeli Supreme Court judges will on
Wednesday continue its hearings on whether to recognize non-
Orthodox conversions to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
The last hearing was held on April 11, during which
representatives of the State Attorney's office presented the
Interior Ministry's position.
</P>
<P>
They said that every conversion performed in Israel must have
the approval of the Chief Rabbinate before the would-be convert can
be registered as a Jew on his ID card.
</P>
<P>
Conversions performed abroad will only be recognized (if they do
not have the Chief Rabbinate's approval) if the convert has been
part of the community in which the conversion was carried out for
at least a year, it added.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A joint panel of members of the Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Law and Internal Affairs committees on Tuesday approved in the
first reading an amendment to the Basic Law: Jerusalem, barring the
government from ceding any part of it or any national or municipal
prerogatives over it to a foreign entity.
</P>
<P>
The initiator of the bill, Yehoshua Matza from Likud, made it
clear that he had in mind the reports of possible custodial or
limited self-government arrangements with the Palestinians in the
framework of a peace treaty, including granting the PNA control of
the Temple Mount or allowing broad autonomy in the Palestinian
neighborhoods of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was sponsored by 80 Knesset members, was
approved on May 17 by a vote of 68 to 21.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament Passes Budget for Fiscal 2000-2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Parliament Wednesday
passed the national budget for fiscal 2000-2001 totaling 92
billion rupees(1.3 billion U.S. dollars) with an overall deficit
of 26.8 billion rupees(374 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Though the ambitious budget, presented to the parliament on May
30, had drawn mixed reactions from the opposition and the public,
it got passed in the parliament by voice vote without much
hindrance.
</P>
<P>
The budget set aside 43.5 billion rupees (603 million dollars)
for regular expenditure, including expenses by the government,
military, police and judiciary, while 48.1 billion rupees (688
million dollars) will be allocated to development projects,
including those related to poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
It aims to raise 64.82 billion rupees (927 million dollars)from
revenue and new tax proposals, besides receiving about 20 billion
rupees (300 million dollars) from bilateral and multilateral
grants.
</P>
<P>
While defending his budget proposal in the parliament, Finance
Minister Mahesh Acharya said the new budget had laid emphasis "on
the reforms of the Nepali economy and accorded high priority to
the agricultural and social sectors in line with the goal of
poverty alleviation," which is the imperative task of the Nepali
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the substantial increase in the salary of government
employees, police, army and teachers proposed in the budget is
feared to enhance inflation, further marginalizing the ordinary
people, about 50 percent of whom are living below the poverty line
(an average daily income of less than 1 U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
Bharat Mohan Adhikary, chief whip of the Communist Party of
Nepal-United Marxist and Leninist (CPN-UML), the leading
opposition party,criticized the budget for "failing to introduce
concrete programs for the agriculture, industry and trade sectors
and to encourage the poor and people of downtrodden communities
for the upliftment of their lives."
</P>
<P>
The new fiscal year is to start on July 16.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai people can expect to enjoy
cheaper mobile phone service next year as the government has
approved a new 1900-megahertz cellular phone system with an
investment of 4.2 billion baht (25.6 million U.S. dollars),
Thailand News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet approved the grand project at its weekly meeting on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new mobile phone service will offer a lower monthly fee of
300 baht (7.69 dollars), compared with the 500 baht (12.8 dollars)
fee charge now.
</P>
<P>
The system will be owned and operated by three state agencies
that will set up a new company to run it.
</P>
<P>
The Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT) will hold 54.98
percent of the new company while the Communications Authority of
Thailand (CAT) and Aeronautical Radio of Thailand will hold 40
percent and 0.02 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
CAT and TOT employees will hold a combined 5-percent stake in
the newly established company.
</P>
<P>
TOT and CAT are preparing to give up their roles as regulators
and providers of telecommunication concessions and to compete with
former concession holders after privatization.
</P>
<P>
The new company will compete with three existing private
cellular phone operators, which operate under concessions from CAT.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to begin in 13 months with Greater
Bangkok as its first service area. It would be expanded to the
provinces within three years.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder:Togo to Host 36th OAU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) will hold its 36th annual summit of heads of state and
government in the Togolese capital of Lome from July 10 to 12.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming summit will be preceded by the 72nd ordinary
session of the council of ministers on July 6-8, which will make
preparations for the summit.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that African leaders will focus their
discussions mainly on the three themes of regional cooperation and
integration, security and stability, and the challenges of
widespread AIDS and poverty in Africa.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the draft treaty on the establishment of the
African Union and the draft protocol to the treaty setting up the
African Economic Community, as follow-up steps to implement the
decisions to accelerate African integration reached during an
extraordinary summit on September 9, 1999, in Syrte, Libya.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are also expected to discuss ways to end various
conflicts on the continent, particularly in Angola, Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone, and the related
situation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, Angola, Namibia and Cape Verde have threatened to
boycott the Lome summit on account of alleged violation by the
Togolese government of the U.N. sanctions against the rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The OAU was founded on May 25, 1963, in the Ethiopian capital
of Addis Ababa and the Charter of the Organization was signed on
that occasion by heads of state and government of 32 independent
African states.
</P>
<P>
Its purposes are to promote the unity and solidarity of the
African states, defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and
independence of members, coordinate and intensify the cooperation
and efforts to achieve a better life for the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The organization is also aimed at eradicating all forms of
colonialism from Africa and promoting international cooperation
having due regard to the Charter of the United Nations and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa-based OAU, which is composed at present of 53
independent African states except Morocco, held the first summit
in Cairo, Egypt, in 1964 and the 35th summit in Algiers, Algeria,
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Algiers summit, the largest ever gathering with 46 heads of
state and government attending, ended with a declaration calling

<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The French Development Agency has
granted Kenya a credit of 15 million euros (14.23 million U.S.
dollars) to help restore El Nino-devastated infrastructure, the
Kenya Times daily reported Wednesday.

<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo said Tuesday that the loan
would be utilized for general overhaul and rehabilitation of
roads, water and sanitation facilities in the capital Nairobi and
other districts.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the loan are highly concessionary with the
interest rate of about 2.3 percent per year over a duration of 25
years with a grace period of eight years, Okemo said.
</P>
<P>
The minister estimated the cost of the El Nino related damages

DUSHANBE, Tajikistan -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin called
here on Wednesday for fleshing out and perfecting the "Shanghai
Five" mechanism and deepening cooperation among China, Tajikistan,
Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in security, trade and other
international arenas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call at an annual summit meeting of the heads of
state of the five nations. The annual event, commonly known as the
"Shanghai Five" summit, was started in Shanghai, China, in April
1996, when the top leaders of the five countries held their first
summit to exchange views on bilateral and multilateral cooperation
and other regional and international issues on common interest.
Also attending the Dushanbe summit are hosting Tajik President
Emomali Rakhmonov, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Track and Field
Championships and the Asian Amateur Athletics Association (AAAA)
congress, initially scheduled to take place here in early August,
will be delayed for about four weeks due to the holding of the
General Session of the People's Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Amateur Athletics Association (PASI) secretary-
general Tigor Tanjung said he had received a noticed from the
police that the organization would not be allowed to stage the
event at the Senayan from August 2 to 6.
</P>
<P>
"The police notice said that the event was too close to the
session being held in the nearly legislative complex, which is
also in Senayan, from August 7 to August 18," Tanjung was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"After we got the information, I contacted the AAAA to ask them
to reschedule. The association then agreed to convene an emergency
council meeting in Pattaya, Thailand, on July 1 to discuss the
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eight members of the AAAA -- China, Singapore, Thailand, Hong
Kong, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Sri Lanka --
attended the meeting, which recommended that PASI stage the event
from August 28 to September 1.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven of 43 AAAA members have confirmed their

<HEADLINE> China Needs More Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's oil industry continues to
be plagued by the scenario of demand exceeding supply, according
to sources from the State Petroleum and Chemical Administration.
</P>
<P>
China still needs large amounts of oil from abroad as no major
discoveries of oil or technical breakthroughs in the industry have
been made, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil demand reached 200 million tons this year,
and the figure will increase by four percent every year, industry
officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
However, the oil output stood at 160 million tons last year,
with no big increases in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that China has ranked fifth in the world in
oil output for 13 years running, the country is also a big oil
consumer. It shifted to an oil import-oriented country from an oil
exporter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that China's oil imports will probably
account for 40 percent of the total oil consumption by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
China has very rich oil and gas resources. By the end of last
year, the country had found 20.3 billion tons of oil resources,
but experts believe that the figure represents only 20 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that China is set to develop a number of large oil
and gas fields to increase its annual oil and gas output up to 300
million tons by 2010. These oil and gas fields will be located in
the Songliao Basin in the northeast, around the Bohai Sea, in the
west and northwest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will strengthen its cooperation with other
countries in oil-gas development, so that it can obtain from
abroad 50 million tons of oil and some 50 billion cu m of natural
gas.

<HEADLINE> Experts Attribute China's Abnormal Weather to "La Nina" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Meteorological experts here
attributed the abnormal weather plaguing China during the first
half of this year to the La Nina phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The climatic anomalies, including 15 sand storms, droughts in
north China and rainstorms and floods in south China, have caused
economic losses and casualties in some regions, said Wen Kegang,
director of the China Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"La Nina" is the name given to a weather phenomenon where
unusually cool water from the Pacific Ocean affects weather
conditions nearly the world over, explained experts from the
National Climatic Center.
</P>
<P>
This spring the average high temperature across China reached
its second-highest since 1961. From February to April, the average
precipitation in north China was only 23 mm, the lowest in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, about 20 million hectares of land suffered from
drought, and over 20 million people were short of drinking water
during the three months, according to Wen.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, heavy rain storms hit some regions in the
south of the Yangtze River and caused flooding in some places,
affecting more than 85,000 hectares of farmland and millions of
people.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu Jun, a senior engineer with the climatic center,
believed that the hot weather in north China was the result of
global warming, and the rainfall in south China was still within
the normal range.

<HEADLINE> Sci-Tech Museum to Draw More Students in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- In order to attract more students,
China's only national science and technology museum will extend
its opening time from mid-July until October.
</P>
<P>
During the summer holidays from July 15 to August 31, the newly-
enlarged China Sci-Tech Museum located in northern Beijing will
open every day, with visitors having two more hours over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The new exhibition hall of the museum made its debut at the end
of April, and crowds of science enthusiasts have visited the
museum since then.
</P>
<P>
Inside the new exhibition hall are displayed more than 300
items in the fields of space, energy, communications, new
materials, information, life and environmental sciences, as well
as 250 examples of China's ancient sci-tech achievements.
</P>
<P>
The "No Touching" signs which once were common in China's
museums have vanished from the new hall, so that patrons can have
a truly hands-on experience, from space-walking to virtual
football.
</P>
<P>
The Sci-Tech Museum was built in the 1980s under the direction
of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. About 700,000 Chinese,
mainly school children, visit the museum every year. The new
facility is expected to greet 1.5 million visitors annually.

<HEADLINE> Developing Mining Industry in New Zealand Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior New Zealand scientist
has called for the development of the mining industry in the
country, saying a more vibrant mining industry would create
thousands of new jobs in regions of high unemployment and inject
an extra 1 billion NZ dollars (about 470 million U.S. dollars)
into the economy.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that New Zealand is a high consumer of
minerals and mineral-based products, New Zealanders appear
increasingly unenthusiastic about doing their global bit to supply
minerals, said Andrew West, chief executive of the Institute of
Geological and Nuclear Sciences Ltd. (GNS) in the July issue of
the company newsletter, Globe.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand seems to have adopted an import approach to the
whole industry because of strict environmental standards that
apply in the country, he said in the issue, which came out here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"For the minerals sector, the equivalent is to allow rational
access to minerals outside of the national parks while maintaining
strict standards for low-environmental impact harvesting and
sophisticated rehabilitation," West said.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent use of natural resources should be an important
part of moves to stimulate regional growth, especially economic
growth in regions of high unemployment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minerals sector has the potential to grow from 12,000 to 20,
000 regional jobs and from 1 billion to 2 billion NZ dollars (from
470 million to 940 million U.S. dollars) in annual turnover, West
estimated.
</P>
<P>
GNS conservatively estimates that New Zealand has at least 86
billion NZ dollars (40.4 billion U.S. dollars) worth of metallic
mineral resources in known and undiscovered deposits, he said,
adding that some of New Zealand's non-metallic minerals are
valuable,niche materials such as zeolite, perlite and diatomite.
</P>
<P>
"They can earn valuable export revenue and some can be used as
the base for developing innovative materials such as sophisticated
ceramics," the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
He concluded by saying the minerals sector "has a lot to offer
New Zealanders. Local, regional and central government should help
unlock its social and economic contribution."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Perfecting "Shanghai Five" Mechanism at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin called here on Wednesday for fleshing out and
perfecting the "Shanghai Five" mechanism and deepening cooperation
among China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in
security, trade and other international arenas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the call at an annual summit meeting of the heads of
state of the five nations. The annual event, commonly known as the
"Shanghai Five" summit, was started in Shanghai, China, in April
1996, when the top leaders of the five countries held their first
summit to exchange views on bilateral and multilateral cooperation
and other regional and international issues on common interest.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the Dushanbe summit are hosting Tajik President
Emomali Rakhmonov, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev.
Uzbek President Islam Karimov is present at this year's summit for
the first time as an observer.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the summit, which was presided over by Tajik
President Rakhmonov, Jiang Zemin put forward a four-point proposal
for fleshing out and perfecting the "Shanghai Five" mechanism,
deepening the five-nation cooperation in national and regional
security and stability, expanding bilateral and multilateral
economic and trade cooperation, and strengthening coordination
among the five nations in the international arenas.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the annual summit of the heads of state of
the five countries as the center-piece and a driving force,
meetings of the relevant government departments of the five
countries should be promoted so as to push forward specific
cooperation projects among them in every possible field, thus help
shaping a multi-level, multi-area consulting mechanism within the
"Shanghai Five" framework, and in due course, help developing the
present five-nation meeting mechanism into a five-nation
cooperation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
On upgrading the five-nation cooperation on national and
regional security, Jiang called for joint actions of the five
countries to crack down on all forms of extremist forces,
separatist forces and terrorist forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot overlook the disrupting and sabotaging factors
coming from within and outside of the five-nation region that are
threatening peace and stability of the region," Jiang said against
the background that all the five countries want an environment of
long-term peace and stability to concentrate on national economic
buildup in the face of the world trend of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also urged the five countries to create
necessary conditions, bring into full play their respective
advantages, expand mutual investment, and explore different ways
of economic and technological cooperation, so as to push forward
their overall bilateral and multilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he welcomed the other four nations to actively
participate in China's national undertaking of developing the
western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the field of international affairs, Jiang stressed the
importance of strengthened cooperation among the five countries in
maintaining the authority of the United Nations, particularly that
of the U.N. Security Council, and in upholding such principles in
international relations as respecting national sovereignty, and
non-interference in other country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the five nations strengthen their
coordination of positions in opposing hegemony and power politics
in world affairs, and in the joint efforts to promote the multi-
polarization process of the world politics.
</P>
<P>
Describing the "Shanghai Five" mechanism as "a historic outcome
" of today's world development in the conclusion of his speech,
Jiang called on statesmen and politicians of the five nations to
demonstrate their sense of responsibility and sense of mission to
work for the world's multi-polarization process, for the
establishment of a just and rational new order in the world
politics and economic development, and for peace and stability of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here on Monday on a two-day state
visit to Tajikistan before attending the summit meeting of the "
Shanghai Five."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Army to Withdrawal from Chittagong Hill Tracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Army, now deployed to
guard borders of Chittagong Hill Tracts and maintain internal
peace, will be withdrawn from the region and the duty will be
vested in Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), which is ill-equipped and short
of personnel.
</P>
<P>
The New Nation Wednesday quoted a report by Sector Commanders
of BDR as saying that the BDR would immediately need some 5,000
additional personnel backed by at least half a dozen helicopters
to keep mobility in this mineral-rich rugged one-tenth part of
Bangladesh. Without such support security and sovereignty of the
region will remain vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Besides, some 500 kilometer-long border with India in the
region is unguarded as there are no border outposts there, it
added. The BDR would need another 13,000 personnel to guard it,
because, both Indian militants and their pursuers, the Indian
Border Security Force and Indian army, often enter the area
unobstructed.
</P>
<P>
If Bangladesh has to establish sovereignty on this chunk of
land, action has to be taken now or else, situation could go out
of control, the commanders said in their report, adding the
current transition period which began after the signing of the
Chittagong peace accord on December 2, 1997, would be completed
when the army is to be withdrawn to the cantonments of Chittagong
within next six months.
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, there were violence and conflict in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts region. The present government had solved
the long-prevalent crisis after signing a peace accord with the
tribal population in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Defense analysts have maintained that the borders of Bangladesh
with the north eastern India and Myanmar remain sensitive. The
borders of fragile north eastern India in future will be more
unstable as movement in the Indian area for greater self-rule
gains momentum.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Official Media Call for Dissolution of NLD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The official newspaper The New Light
of Myanmar Wednesday called for dissolution and outlawing of the
National League for Democracy (NLD), a winning political party in
the 1990 General Election held by the present military government
under a free and fair basis.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper noted in an unsigned article that the NLD is
harming the non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of
the national solidarity and perpetuation of sovereignty -- the
three main causes laid down by the government.
</P>
<P>
It also charged the NLD with constantly committing acts that
bring great disservice to Myanmar, calling it a defunct political
party.
</P>
<P>
The NLD, which was formed and registered in late 1988 after the
military took over the state power on September 18 that year in
the height of the country's political crisis, participated along
with 92 other political parties in the general election held in
May 1990.
</P>
<P>
It then won 396 or 82 percent of the 485 parliamentary seats in
the election.
</P>
<P>
The article said the NLD won the election because the public
was tired of the situation and thus voted for NLD for a change.
</P>
<P>
The article went on to accuse Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD general
secretary, of playing a major role in attempts to top the
government by trying to destroy the Tatmadaw (armed forces).
</P>
<P>
Charging Aung San Suu Kyi with associating with crooked
politicians and accepting outside assistance, it said she seeks
destruction of the nation from outside.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, the NLD demanded the government to implement the
result of the 1990 general election, but was ignored.
</P>
<P>
On September 16, 1998, it unilaterally set up a Committee
Representing the People's Parliament (CRPP) Elected in the 1990
General Election to work for the convening of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It also charged the government with applying various means to
stop and disturb the emergence of a people's parliament, warning
the country would continue to be in the crisis in politics,
economy, education, social and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
According government statistics, only 169 parliament
representatives-elect out of 485 remained valid as of May this
year. The other 316 include those who resigned, died and
disqualified or canceled.
</P>
<P>
Of the 169 who remained valid, 110 were from NLD.

<HEADLINE> June Inflation Down to 3.9 Percent in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine's year-on-year inflation
declined slightly in June to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent in May
following a slowdown for food and services, the government said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time this year that inflation registered a
decline, bringing the January-June average to 3.5 percent, the
National Statistics Office (NSO) said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in the first half of this year was also well
below the government's 5 percent to 6 percent goal for the whole
year, the government agency added.
</P>
<P>
Compared to June last year, tuition fee increases are
relatively less, resulting in the slowdown in inflation for
services, the NSO noted.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, lower prices of food items in Metro Manila,
particularly rice, fish, fruits and vegetables, contributed to the
situation.
</P>
<P>
However, the NSO said, higher month-on-month inflation in the
indexes of services and miscellaneous items resulted in a 0.7
percent increase in June.

<HEADLINE> Another Thai Opposition Party to Quit Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Another main opposition party of
Thailand, the Social Action Party (SAP), has decided to have its
19 members of parliament (MPs) quit the House of Representatives
in three days, further diminishing the opposition's presence in
the House, the Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, at least nine of the MPs are set to defy the decision
and the SAP threatens to expel them from the party.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the nine MPs, though technically still
under the SAP's roof, are no longer in the opposition since they
were poised to defect to the coalition parties Chart Pattana and
Seritham.
</P>
<P>
The New Aspiration Party (NAP), the largest opposition party,
will also push for the resignation of 34 dissident MPs who plan to
defect.
</P>
<P>
These 34 MPs remained in the House, ignoring the party's
pulling-out resolution at the end of last month. About 50 NAP MPs
resigned from the parliament in an effort to push for an immediate
House dissolution and an early election.
</P>
<P>
If all the NAP and SAP rebels are expelled from their parties,
they will automatically lose their MP status and thus leave the
House without an opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, they can put up a legal fight by citing article 47 of
the constitution, which allows them to appeal to the Constitution
Court if they feel their parties' decisions obstruct their
legitimate parliamentary duties.
</P>
<P>
With about half of SAP MPs poised to resign from parliament and
the remaining opposition MPs considered de-facto "government MPs",
pressure for an immediate House dissolution is expected to mount
again, but whether it will reach the point of forcing the prime
minister to actually call a new election remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was quoted as saying that he had
anticipated the outcome of SAP's decision and he would not
dissolve the House as long as there were still some opposition MPs
left.
</P>
<P>
The government insists that it will not dissolve the parliament
until the budget bill for fiscal year 2001 and the amendments to
the election laws are passed by the House.
</P>
<P>
The government has to call a general election before November
when its term ends.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Aid to Bangladesh Decreases Sharply in Fiscal 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Flow of foreign aid was 41 percent
less during the first 11 months of fiscal 1999-2000 than that in
the corresponding period of the previous year, The Daily Star
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign aid was 1.2 billion U.S. dollars from July
1999 to May 2000 against 2.05 billion dollars in the corresponding
period of fiscal 1998-1999, sources in the Economic Relation
Division ERD) said
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry sources said the flow of foreign aid,
particularly food aid, was very high in fiscal 1998-1999 because
of the devastating flood in the country, worth 269.8 million
dollars. It came down to 50.5 million dollars in the following
year.
</P>
<P>
Food aid is declining also because donors are reluctant to
disburse food aid as the country is nearing food autarky, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1999-2000, the disbursement of aid is also far less
than the donors' commitments. ERD estimates show that donors
pledged 2.04 billion dollars, but the disbursement was only 1.2
billion dollars till May this year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria in his budget speech
announced an annual development program of 175 billion taka (3.36
billion dollars) for fiscal 2000-2001, more than 49 percent of
which was projected to come from external sources.
</P>
<P>
Evaluating the aid flow, the ministry sources said the
government will have to go for massive borrowing to fulfill the
target for the development program.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Form Workers' Welfare Committee in EPZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will form
a workers' welfare committee in the Export Processing Zones (EPZs)
as an interim measure before introducing full rights of trade
union activities there, The Financial Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A high-level meeting held at the Board of Investment (BOI)
Tuesday took the decision aimed at solving the thorny issue of
allowing trade union activities in the country's EPZs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting observed that workers in the EPZs would get all
facilities under the new system which they usually get through
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
It hoped the setting up of the committee would solve all the
problems relating to rights of trade union activities.
</P>
<P>
Besides forming the welfare committee, the government is making
preparations to face the hearing in the office of the U.S. Trade
Representative in Washington where Bangladesh will explain its
position. A high-level government delegation will be sent to
defend the country's stand.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh remains under strong pressure from the U.S.
government to allow trade union activities in the EPZs following a
petition from the American Federation of Labor and Congress for
Industrial Organization (AFL-CIO).
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO submitted a petition to the U.S. government to
cancel Generalized System of Preference facilities on Bangladesh
exports if trade union activities are not allowed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major investors in the EPZs, including South Korea
and Japan, expressed their grave concern over the U.S. move,
terming it a conspiracy to destroy the investment-friendly
environment in the EPZs.

BERLIN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
here Tuesday urged more efforts to turn cities into places where
everybody feels safe and worthy.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of a global conference on the urban future in
the 21st century, he said while cities are engines of growth and
incubators of civilization, they at the same time can be places of
disease, violent crime, unemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
In his address "The future of mankind lies in the cities," he
said within 25 years the number of city dwellers in the world
will grow to two-thirds from the nearly half at present, and that
most of growth will be in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have entered the urban millennium," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 representatives from more than 100 countries and
regions are attending the three-day world conference, which will
focus on issues such as problems urbanization has brought to both
developed and developing countries and how to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Chancellor Gerhad Schroeder said at the opening that
one of the serious issues mankind is facing is how to keep cities
developing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
A report, drafted by a special committee and presented to the
conference, predicted the global trend of urbanization and made
recommendations for dealing with them.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to adopt a statement before it
closes on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> University, Villages on Fire as Violence Intensifies in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- State Pattimura University and
three surrounding villages in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku
province, were set on fire by armed attackers as violence
intensified on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were killed and hundreds of houses went up
in flames.
</P>
<P>
According reports reaching here Wednesday, the violence broke
out in the predominantly-Christian villages of Poka, Rumahtiga and
Wailela on Monday and continued through Tuesday. The dispute area
housed the 30-hectare campus of Pattimura University, the most
prestigious university in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Numbering in the thousands, armed attackers descended from the
predominantly-Muslim Jasirah Leihitu, Batu Merah and Galunggung
areas. They attacked the villages from three directions.
</P>
<P>
"No troops were available when the rioters arrived. They just
kept on ransacking and destroying the villages and sprayed bullets
everywhere. They burned everything," a survivor from Poka was
quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted witnesses as saying that the university was
destroyed by fire on Tuesday. The main building, administration
office, the library, schools, a laboratory, a gymnasium, the
Bethesda Church, which was built during Dutch colonial era, and a
Catholic church were all destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's incident was likely the worst since the imposition of
a state of civil emergency on June 26. It was a continuation of
similar armed mob attacks on the area which began on Saturday and
has claimed at least five lives, or an overall of 76 since the
violence resurfaced in Ambon in May.
</P>
<P>
Also in Maluku Tuesday, the local subdistrict police chief was
arrested for alleged involvement in smuggling weapons to the
ravaged islands. Security forces in recent weeks have stepped up
the search for illegal weapons and seized 17 vessels containing
thousands of weapons to be smuggled to Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"From one of the vessels, we have arrested Daruba Subdistrict
Police Chief Inspector N. Saimima," Commander of the Indonesian
Eastern Fleet Vice Admiral Adi Haryono was quoted by the Antara
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In North Maluku province, four people were killed and eight
others injured on Monday as a fresh clash broke out in Leloda town
in Halmahera island.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence in Maluku and North Maluku is the
continuation of a strife that has troubled the two provinces for
one-and-a-half years. More than 3,000 people have died in the
strife.

build a new pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Under the document signed by prime ministers Jens Stoltenberg
of Norway and Jerzy Buzek of Poland, the two countries will
conclude a contract this year and build a pipeline via the Baltic
sea that could deliver 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas
annually starting from 2004 or 2005.
</P>
<P>
Norway will provide Poland with 4 billion cubic meters of
natural gas before 2010, and the amount is expected to double in
2020.
</P>
<P>
Polish and Norwegian gas companies signed a contract last year
for gas supplies, with the first high-volume deliveries due to
reach Poland in October.
</P>
<P>
Poland consumes 11 billion cubic meters of gas every year, two
thirds of which is imported from Russia. Poland's buying gas from
Norway is seen as an attempt to wean itself from dependence on
Russian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg, who is on an official two-day visit to Poland, met
parliament speakers during his visit and traveled to the city of
Gdansk.
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg's visit has also seen the signing of an agreement
on converting 27 million U.S. dollars, part of Polish debt to
Norway, into investment in environment-related projects in Poland.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Police Seize 104 Kilograms of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Austrian police seized 104 kilograms
of heroin at the Schwechat airport last month, security
authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was found inside 102 cartons loaded with textile
goods coming from Turkey, security officials said.
</P>
<P>
The drug, valued at 20 million U.S. dollars on the black market,
was the biggest seizure ever by Austrian police.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of a Turkish drug trafficker earlier last month on
the Norway-Sweden border provided clues for the seizure, according
to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Two Austrian suspects and five others from Turkey and Sweden
have been detained so far. Austrian officials believe that a big
drug-trafficking ring is behind the case.
</P>
<P>
International drug-trafficking rings are more often using
European airports for drug transfer, said officials from the
Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released in June by the European
Commission, 20 tons of drugs, including 340 kilograms of heroin,
were confiscated at European airports in 1999, and 3,000 people
were arrested, 80 percent of them passengers.

<HEADLINE> Austria to Hold Referendum on EU Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel announced a plan Tuesday evening to hold a nationwide
referendum on the European Union's sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said that the decision to hold the referendum was
reached after six hours of discussion by the coalition government
comprising the Freedom Party and the People's Party. He said if
the EU would not lift its sanctions in the fall, the national
referendum will be held in October or November.
</P>
<P>
In the plan, the Austrian coalition government also asked the
EU to ensure equal rights and duties of all EU member countries
and guarantee basic rights on electing their governments and
opposed the attempts of a few big countries to dominate other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the far-right Freedom Party joined the coalition
government, 14 EU member countries began to impose sanctions on
Austria in February. At the end of June, the EU decided to keep
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The idea for a referendum was first proposed by former leader
of the Freedom Party, Joerg Haider, in April, but it was opposed
by the People's Party. Since the sanctions continue, specially
when France, a main proponent of sanctions against Austria, took
over the EU's rotating presidency on July 1, the People's Party
changed its attitude. In May the Austrian government worked out an
18-point policy including the plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the referendum aims to exert pressure on
the EU. But other Austrian parties are against the decision.
Austrian President Thomas Klestil said that he was afraid the
referendum would instigate anti-EU emotion in his country.
Austrian opposition parties said the plebiscite could not help
lift the sanctions, but only waste money.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's foreign minister warned last month that the
referendum means suicide.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivoire Imposes Curfew Following Army Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Cote d'Ivoire imposed a curfew
Tuesday evening after troops took to the streets, firing in the
air and demanding money from the ruling military junta for their
part in the December 24 coup, reports from Abidjan said.
</P>
<P>
The curfew will run from 7:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) until 6:00 a.m. (
0600 GMT).
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the National Committee of Public Salvation
said the restrictions were imposed "because of present
circumstances" and called on everyone to "scrupulously respect
this exceptional measure."
</P>
<P>
Soldiers moved onto the streets before dawn on Tuesday, who,
witnesses said, later commandeered private vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In the northern cities of Bouake and Korhogo, mutineers looted
banks.
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, calm had returned to Abidjan, the commercial
capital of this west African country, apart from occasional
gunshots.
</P>
<P>
In December, junior soldiers staged a coup, the first since the
country's independence from France in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers demanding a bonus for their role in the December coup
were reportedly behind Tuesday's events.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address, military ruler General Robert Guei said,
"I remain open to dialogue. You can send your delegations to me."
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday's acts threatened to tarnish the army's image
and would lead to soldiers being blacklisted.
</P>
<P>
He said his government had already fulfilled promises on pay
and was in the process of delivering promises of help for soldiers
to own their own homes.
</P>
<P>
However, Guei denied having promised to grant 6 million CFA (8,
700 U.S. dollars to each soldier for their part in the coup.
</P>
<P>
National television afterwards broadcast a statement by a
corporal, Aboubakary Kone, who called on all soldiers to return to
barracks, saying he had received assurances from the president
that "all our grievances will be satisfied."
</P>
<P>
"From today (Tuesday) a commission composed of members from
each force will be formed to put in motion the measures taken by
the president of the republic regarding the total satisfaction of
our claims," said the corporal, who is the mutineers' spokesman.

Finnish President Tarja Halonen said at the opening ceremony of
the session that women and children are always among the first to
suffer from poverty in the world, and that gender discrimination,
lack of education and improper medical treatment have inflicted a
vast amount of tragedies on women.
</P>
<P>
The most crucial thing to do at present is to guarantee basic
education for female children, the President added.
</P>
<P>
The five-day session, which started from Sunday and is being
attended by more than 300 representatives from about 40 member
states, has elected a new council and admitted five new members
including Ukraine, Burundi, Azerbaijan and Senegal.

<P>
HANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China faces more attacks by
typhoon this year, officials at meteorological and oceanic
departments have predicted.
</P>
<P>
Three to five disastrous storms may take place in the coastal
areas, according to a national meeting on typhoon prevention held
here recently.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has
urged local government officials to reinforce dikes and reservoirs
and keep a close watch on tropic cyclones.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters has also sounded warnings about the
simultaneous attacks of wind, storm and tide.
</P>
<P>
China is prone to typhoon attacks. Every year, about eight
typhoons visited the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting revealed that 56 percent of 13,580-kilometer-long
seawalls in the country have not reached the standard, and ten
percent of 328 coastal cities or counties are short of
telecommunications facilities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Zhejiang Province in east China and
other coastal regions have done a lot on flood prevention projects.
</P>
<P>
Before flood season this year, more than 98 percent of the
coastal cities and counties have set up systems to receive
satellite cloud pictures.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Doubt Russian Find of Pyramids in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts expressed their
suspicion over Russian's finding of pyramids on Kangrinboqe
Mountain in Tibet, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily quoted the experts as saying that
the Russians may have mistaken mountains shaped like pyramids to
be pyramids.
</P>
<P>
A group of Russian scientists claimed that they had found more
than 100 pyramids and many cultural relics last year on Tibet's 6,
656-metre-high Kangrinboqe, the highest peak in the Gangdise Range.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yichou, a geographer with the Institute of Geography under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, attributed the pyramid-like
appearance of these mountains to the combined efforts of the
geological movements and wind erosion.
</P>
<P>
The Russian scientists did not support their discovery with any
archaeological evidence, Yang added.
</P>
<P>
Du Yongbin, a historian with the Chinese Center for Tibetan
Studies in Beijing, said all the historical documents on Tibet,
both in Tibetan and Chinese, do not ever mention pyramids at all.

<HEADLINE> Sea Level Rising Near Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Due to a side effect of its
breakneck pace of development, Shanghai is slowly sinking into the
sea, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The relative sea level will rise 50-70 centimeters by 2050,
said Huang Runde, a senior engineer of the Shanghai Bureau of
Water Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
There are two factors contributing to rising sea level, one is
the global warming that melts the ice in polar areas, the other is
the sinking of the city caused by excessive use of groundwater, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The city has been sinking at the speed of nearly ten
millimeters a year," said Zhang Xiangyu, director of the Shanghai
Water Supply Administration Office.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out the exploitation of groundwater to support
the huge population, underground construction of subways and
basements below skyscrapers and overpasses has all led to ground
sinkage.
</P>
<P>
He said the city drafted laws on the annual drawing of
groundwater.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Attorney General Slams "Old Power" For Tuesday Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Marzuki
Darusman slammed "old power" for Tuesday's bomb explosion in the
Attorney General's Office (AGO) which caused major damage to the
building's first floor.
</P>
<P>
"This is the work of the 'old power' who want to divert
attention from the real issue," Darusman was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The blast came just an hour after prosecutors questioned former
president Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra in
connection with his father's alleged involvement in graft.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said the bomb blast is only a "replay" of a March
shooting at the parliament building, which also took place shortly
after lawmakers grilled Tommy.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, when legislators questioned Tommy at the
parliament building over the use of funds from the now-defunct
Clove Marketing and Buffer Stock Managing Agency, an unidentified
man opened fires at the House Commission V's room, smashing glass
windows of the path leading to the room.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutor Suryansyah said probe into Tommy would be
continued as planned.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that South Jakarta police are currently
investigating the explosion, the first such case in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the blast, police had arrested a man
identified only as Benny, a driver employed by PT Bahana. The
police suspected Benny of being the culprit because when the
explosion happened he was near the scene of incident.
</P>
<P>
The explosion ruined the ground floor's bathroom, the glass
door next to it and the windows of the bathroom on the second and
third floors. It also shattered a part of the building's wall.
</P>
<P>
The explosion is believed to be a warning to both the AGO and
the Attorney General over the current probe into the former
president's suspected involvement in a multi-billion U.S. dollars
graft case carried out during his 32 years reign.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been facing corruption charges in his 32 years
rule of the country. He was declared as suspect early this year
and was put under house arrest by the AGO in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China produced some 500,000 mini

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai residents, students in
particular, have more chances to know the secrets of weather
changes as they now can tour meteorological centers and radar
bases.
</P>
<P>
A meteorological science travel agency, the first in China,
will help them to find these excitements.
</P>
<P>
During a one-day "weather tour" organized by the agency, which
was set up here recently, people will follow meteorologists-turned
tour guides to enter a weather forecast studio to act as a
weatherman.
</P>
<P>
They can know the weather conditions of the day when he or she
was born by consulting computer databank.
</P>
<P>
The visitors can also roughly make simple weather forecast
themselves by combining weather factors including temperature, air
pressure and humidity.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they can also experience cyclones by watching
movies.
</P>
<P>
The travel agency is contacting more observatories, seismic
stations and experimental outer space centers so that travelers
would have more places to visit.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor of Shanghai Feng Guoqin said that such tour is a
good form of spreading weather knowledge.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Top women's seed Martina Hingis was
crashed in the quarter-finals as the Williams sisters made the
semi-finals at the Wimbledon tennis championships on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis lost to Venus Williams 6-3, 4-6, 4-6 in a fantastic
match at the center court. Venus will meet her younger sister
Serena Williams in the semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Serena crushed fellow American Lisa Raymond 6-2, 6-0 in a
comfortable quarter-final match.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time either sister has reached the last four at
the All England Club tournament.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Lindsay Davenport booked a meeting with
unseeded Australian Jelena Dokic, conqueror of Hingis in the first
round last year, after fellow American Monica Seles ran out of
steam in a 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 6-0 defeat.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy to get through and I'm really happy about how I
hung in there," said Davenport after she recovered from a
tentative start to overwhelm Seles, who has never won Wimbledon,
in the final set.
</P>
<P>
Dokic had followed Serena Williams on to Court One, scene of
her stunning 1999 win over Hingis, and was almost as ruthless as
the American in defeating Magui Serna of Spain 6-3, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unveils New Police Powers to Combat Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- British police will be given new
powers to crack down on suspected football hooligans, Home
Secretary (Interior Minister) Jack Straw has announced.
</P>
<P>
Ministers desperate to stop thugs causing mayhem during the
2002 World Cup qualifying tournament, which starts later this year,
hope to rush through the legislation before Parliament breaks for
its summer recess on July 28.
</P>
<P>
Action was promised after violence marred England's Euro 2000
games and will require the co-operation of the Tory opposition to
go through in time.
</P>
<P>
Straw told MPs that football hooliganism abroad was no longer
confined to a "small minority of troublemakers".
</P>
<P>
In future anyone who receives a banning order will be subject
to both domestic and international bans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Everyone subject to a ban would have to surrender their
passport while major overseas games were on.
</P>
<P>
Police would also be given new powers to prevent a person from
leaving the country where officers believed they were out to cause
trouble abroad, he said.

Venables insists he has no plans for a return to management
despite hinting last week he would be willing to accept a second
spell in charge of the national team if Kevin Keegan were to stand
down.
</P>
<P>
"I've said this before - it's always very difficult to say
never on something, because if you did do something later on they'
d say you were lying in the first place," said Venables.
</P>
<P>
"But I've got no intentions to go back into football - I've
said that many times now. That's the way I feel at the moment and
I can't see me changing my mind. No-one's asked me anyway, so," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Venables, who has managed a number of club sides, including
Spurs and Barcelona, was named England coach in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
But after leading the team to the semi-finals of Euro 96,
Venables resigned in order to concentrate on a series of legal
wrangles.
</P>
<P>
He later became manager of the Australian national team, and
has also had brief stints at Portsmouth and Crystal Palace.
</P>
<P>
When asked on Monday if he would fill the void if the FA did
ask him to lead his country again, Venables said: "No, no.
Certainly not."

WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- James Grogan, an American figure
skater who won the 1952 Olympic bronze medal and was a four-time
silver medalist at the world championships, has died at the age of
68.
</P>
<P>
Grogan died suddenly Monday of multiple organ failure at St.
Bernardine's Medical Center, California, said his son, J.D. Grogan.
</P>
<P>
He won Olympic bronze in Oslo, Norway in 1952 as Dick Button
of the United States won the gold. Grogan won the silver medal at
four consecutive world championships, beginning in 1951.
</P>
<P>
He was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Association Hall
of Fame in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He continued to skate while serving in the Army, where he was
pulled from basic training to appear with Olympic skater Sonja
Henie's European troop show, said Cindy Lang, a publicist with the
Ice Castle International Training Center at Lake Arrowhead, where
Grogan was a coach since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Grogan was instrumental in developing the Ice Castle into a
mecca for world-class skaters such as Michelle Kwan, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Yasuko Grogan, daughter Roko
Grogan, and his son.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia will hold a high-profile
high-tech trade fair in south China's prosperous province of
Guangdong this month to advertise its brands.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 high-tech products, many of them are very advanced
judged by international criteria, will be available at the fair,
but their prices are 10-30 percent lower than those made by the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
China has been long anticipating cooperation with Russia, which
leads the world in many high-tech fields including space
exploration and energy development, and leaders of the two sides
have time and again voiced their support for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A Russian government trade delegation will attend the fair, and
expect to provide Chinese enterprises with six varieties of
products. This is the first time Russia directly opens a market in
south China.
</P>
<P>
Most of the attendants will come from Russia's New Siberia high-
tech zone, known as Russia's silicon valley.

<HEADLINE> Taxi Services Improved in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Three thousand taxis with special
head lamps marking quality services have taken to the streets of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The taxis belong to five taxi companies including Capital Taxi
Company and Beijing Taxi Company, which have promised that their
drivers will not refuse to take passengers, nor overcharge.
</P>
<P>
Taxis of a comany have the same color, head lamps and similar
interior decorations, while drivers are required to wear uniforms
and speak politely to passengers.
</P>
<P>
The companies aim to survive in a market where taxi drivers are
competing fiercely with each other in getting passengers. Beijing
also wants to regulate taxi drivers who are rude to or even cheat
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Beijing has 1,008 taxi companies with 67,000 cars
and over 90,000 drivers. Taxis shoulder 12 percent of Beijing's
transportation volume.
</P>
<P>
Traffic administration officials said another 12,000 taxis with
standard services will go into service in the near future in order
to increase the services of taxi drivers.
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers who failed to provide standard service will be
dismissed and head lamps on their cars will be removed.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 5 (Xinhua) --More than 50 well-preserved volcano
craters have been found near Qiongshan city in northern Hainan,
China's southernmost island province.
</P>
<P>
A group of Chinese geologists who have just made an inspection
trip to the area heralded the large number of craters, with intact
lava tunnels, as a modern geological museum of volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
Historical records say that some 70 million years ago, northern
Hainan had more than 30 volcanic eruptions, which produced the
craters. Some of the bigger ones have now been opened to tourists,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that provincial government departments have
also been preparing the site for inclusion on a list of geological
relics enjoying state protection.

<HEADLINE> New Device Flushes Toilet with Glass of Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A newly developed device can wash
clean a toilet with only a glass of water.
</P>
<P>
The device can wash down waste efficiently by spraying about 0.
2 liters of high-pressure water each time. Water that has been
used to wash vegetables or clothes can be used to clean the toilet
with the device.
</P>
<P>
The device will help save some 12 liters of water for each
cleaning, according to its inventor, the Jinniu Environmental
Protection Equipment Plant of Dashiqiao city in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the water tanks of toilets in China ranges from
nine to 13 liters, while the international standard is six liters.
Flush toilets are becoming popular in urban areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 400 of China's 668 cities are facing water
shortages, and of them more than 100 are seriously threatened.

<HEADLINE> More Tourists Flock to Haikou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- This capital of southernmost China's
island province of Hainan expects to have hosted 1.55 million
domestic and overseas tourists in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, this figure is 19.7 percent up
over the same period last year, as Haikou raked in about 1.29
billion yuan (about 156 million U.S. dollars) in earnings from
tourism in January-June, accounting for 19 percent of the city's
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Haikou, on the northern tip of the island, is some 35 km away
from the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong Province. The promising
tourism prospects have been attributed to the fact that in the
past few years, Haikou has invested more on improving urban
transportation and other infrastructure, and building more tourism
facilities. It has also been working hard to become an
international tourism city.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the local Meilan International Airport, built at
an expense of 2.4 billion yuan (about 289 million dollars), has
been in service since May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to this southernmost province mainly come by plane,
but construction of a railway tunnel that will link Hainan with
Guangdong is underway. The project will be completed and put into
use next year at a cost of more than four billion yuan (about 482
million dollars), local sources claim.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Wishes Clinton-Arafat-Barak Summit Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein on
Wednesday hoped for substantial progress in the upcoming summit by
the United States, Israel and the Palestinians over the Middle East
peace.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Abdullah hoped the summit, scheduled for July
11 at Camp David near Washington, will result in an agreement which
will guarantee both the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and
the peace and stability for all peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
The king called on all parties concerned to exert their utmost
efforts to pave the way for a success of the summit and for a just,
durable and comprehensive peace on the Palestinian track of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-
Khatib
said Jordan is looking forward to a success of the three-way
summit,
which will meet the aspirations for peace of all peoples in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib noted that a just and durable solution to the
Palestinian issue is the corner stone for the Middle East peace
process and for peaceful co-existences of all peoples in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Jordan's principled support for the
legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including self-determination
and the establishment of an independent state on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been pursuing a peace policy toward all neighboring
countries since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the
second Arab country, following Egypt, to reach a peace deal with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel
and its Arab neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry
Wednesday condemned a bomb attack on the Turkish consulate on the
Greek island of Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in the early morning hours when
unidentified assailants hurled a gasoline bomb at the balcony on
the roof of the consulate, causing minor damage.
</P>
<P>
"We express regret over and condemn the incident," said the
ministry in a statement issued after the attack. "We consider it an
event that runs counter to the current development of relations
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Embassy in Athens on Wednesday morning presented a
note to the Greek authorities demanding that the culprits be
arrested as soon as possible and duly punished, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also demanded that measures be adopted to guarantee the
safety of the Turkish diplomatic establishments in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, locked in disputes over Cyprus and the Aegean
Sea for decades, began to improve their relations last year after
both countries were hit by devastating earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The rapprochement was furthered during an exchange of visits to
each other's country by foreign ministers of the two countries
earlier this year, which resulted in a series of trust-building
bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, a Greek tourist resort, is located off Turkey's Aegean
coast.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Reaffirms Opposition to U.S. Revision of ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The proposal of the United States to deploy a national missile
defense system breaks the balance of nuclear forces, formed by a
system of accords over recent years," General Vladimir Yakovlev,
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Strategic Missile Force, told a
Tuesday interview, published in the Wednesday issue of the Russian
newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star).
</P>
<P>
A number of European countries also feel negative about the U.S.
deployment of a missile defense system, which would destabilize
the international situation, cause "certain nuclear anarchy" and
ignite the motivation to design more and more methods for missile
defense, noted the general.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. attempt to ignore this violates the principle of
equal security in relations between Russia and the United States
and relations between NATO member-countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for Moscow to reply to the American plans by
equipping its missiles in a different way. "We can equip the
modernized Topol missiles with several warheads instead of one,"
Yakovlev warned.
</P>
<P>
There are cheaper and more efficient ways to guarantee the
breaking of the missile defense system, he noted. For instance,
Russia can change the principles of using and deploying
operational and tactical nuclear armaments. The number of nuclear
warheads in cruise missiles can be increased, and they are hard
for the missile defense system to catch.
</P>
<P>
"The program of medium-range ballistic missiles can be revived,
" he warned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile defense system could take shape by 2010-2015,
but Washington "will hardly gain anything even if they design
several hundreds of anti-missiles," Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
The political essence of Moscow's proposal to make a Russian-
European missile defense system, which could be implemented within
eight to ten years, is aimed to prevent the United States from
revising the ABM treaty of 1972, he emphasized.

SANTIAGO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Supreme Court ministers
plenum decided Wednesday not to authorize radio or television
transmission of the upcoming allegations about the appeal against
the annulment of the privileges of the former military ruler of
this country, Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The public and the communication media will be left in the dark
about the details of the pro and con allegations in the Pinochet
case, as it happened in April and May of this year in the Santiago
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Court of Appeals ruled in first instance on May
23 to annul Pinochet parliamentary immunity to investigate his
possible participation in the so-called case of the "Caravan of
Death" during his mandate.
</P>
<P>
On June 9 of this year, a few days after learning of the
Santiago Court of Appeals decision, Pinochet filed before the
Supreme Court, through his lawyer, an appeal to the annulation of
this legislative privilege.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court President Hernan Alvarez said last week that on
July 5, 6, and 7 the allegations pro and against Pinochet would
be heard, but they were postponed for next Wednesday in the
Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Promotional Products Industry Tripled in Ten Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Continuing a 10-year trend,
distributor sales of promotional products in the United States
have reached record levels, a trade group reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sales of promotional products for 1999 registered nearly 15
billion U.S. dollars, a 13 percent increase over 1998. This figure
round out a 10-year growth rate that tripled the size of the
industry, which sold 5 billion dollars in 1990, said Promotional
Products Association International (PPAI), quoting a new annual
survey of 13,000 distributors in the country.
</P>
<P>
Promotional products, which consists of useful items often
imprinted with a company or organization's logo, name or message,
are a popular marketing tool used by virtually every business in
the United States to help communicate advertising messages.
</P>
<P>
For the 14th consecutive year, wearable items such as T-shirts,
caps, jackets and headwear were the most popular product category,
with almost 30 percent of all sales, according to PPAI. Other
promotional products categories include writing instruments (pens,
pencils, markers, etc), desk/office/business accessories (such as
briefcases, folders and desk pen sets), calendars, bags, and
sporting goods and travel accessories. Business gifts were the
most commonly relied upon programmatic usage.

WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Wednesday that he had invited Mexican President-elect Vicente
Fox to discuss bilateral relations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the White House that he had called Fox and
told him that he would be "welcome here at any time if he would
come up and sort of get our relationship started."
</P>
<P>
"The relationship that we have with Mexico needs to go beyond
individual personalities always, because we have too much in
common and too much of a future to build together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the White House reacted cautiously to Fox's
suggestion at a press conference on Tuesday to transform the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into a common market similar
to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"As far as some of the specific ideas that he's put out there,
although they're quite general, I think we'll wait until he has a
chance to formulate them in more detail and has a chance to come
and talks to the president," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.

WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presumptive Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush Wednesday vowed to improve
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to court Latino
voters.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual convention of the National Council of La
Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group, Bush pledged 500 million dollars
in new spending to cut the average time needed to process a
citizenship application to six months from three to five years at

</P>
<P>
"We will bring to the INS a new standard of service and a
culture of respect," the Texas governor said while campaigning in
San Diego, California. "We've got an INS that is too bureaucratic,
too stuck in the past."
</P>
<P>
Last week before another Hispanic audience, Bush proposed to
split the INS into two agencies, one for legitimate immigrants and
another for border enforcement.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed allowing relatives of permanent residents to
visit the United States while their own immigration papers are
being processed.

WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
confronted France and the European Parliament by questioning the
need for an investigation into reported U.S. industrial espionage.
</P>
<P>
A British journalist reported earlier this year that the United
States used the spy system of satellites and listening posts,
called Echelon, to gain economic advantage over its allies in
Europe.

<P>
A French state prosecutor's office said on Tuesday that he had
launched a preliminary judicial investigation into the workings of
Echelon.
</P>
<P>
And the European Parliament on Wednesday voted to form a
committee to investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters at a briefing that he did not know "what they think they
're investigating or where they intend to proceed."
</P>
<P>
He denied the allegations by saying that "the notion that we
collect intelligence in order to promote American business is
simply wrong."

<HEADLINE> DSL to Overtake Cable, Says U.S. Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The demand for high-speed
Internet access will increase from 2.3 million subscribers in the
United States last year to 42 million in 2005, a U.S. technology
research think tank predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are two technologies available today that allow low-price
multi-megabit data transfer rates -- digital subscriber line (DSL)
and cable modem. So far, cable has been the leader, due in part to
its earlier market entry. As of the end of 1999, high-speed cable
Internet service had 2.1 million U.S. subscribers, while DSL only
had 500,000 subscribers, according to Allied Business Intelligence
(ABI).
</P>
<P>
But DSL could overtake cable modem soon. In the first quarter
this year, some DSL providers in the U.S. were seeing 50 percent
to 60 percent increases in subscription rates. ABI said that the
demand for DSL would maintain such an increase for at least
another year.
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, DSL will rise in popularity due to
aggressive advertising campaigns by DSL providers. As the
subscriber base grows and the industry learns how to deploy DSL
efficiently and economically, the waiting lists will shrink. Right
now, however, the local exchange carriers cannot deploy the DSL
service fast enough. Some providers are already experiencing
significant backlogs because they lack skilled technicians. ABI
said this should be resolved by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to ABI, broadband subscribers worldwide will jump
from 5 million in 1999 to 91 million in 2005, a compound average
annual growth rate of 160 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- British troops were deployed in
parts of the Northern Ireland capital Belfast on Wednesday as a
fourth night of unrest flared in the British province, an army
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Troops have been carrying out public order duties in support
of the (police) in some areas of Belfast tonight," the Reuters
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's police chief Ronnie Flanagan warned earlier
that Protestant hardliners planned to launch bomb and gun attacks.
</P>
<P>
As Flanagan issued his warning, riot police in armored vehicles
drove back 60 masked youths in a Protestant loyalist" stronghold
near Belfast's city center after they had hijacked a bus and tried
to use it as a street barricade.
</P>
<P>
Protestant hardliners, furious at a ban on a Protestant parade
through a Roman Catholic enclave, also set cars and barricades on
fire in the province's capital, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
A steel barrier was also erected at Drumcree as security forces
in Northern Ireland brace themselves for another night of trouble.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, shots were fired in Belfast, and in Drumcree a
water-cannon was used on protesters for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The barrier, 20ft high and 30ft wide, was made up of huge steel
containers filled with concrete and topped with barbed wire and
was put in place at Drumcree bridge by army engineers.

It was expected to stay in place until after this weekend's

<TEXT>
<P>
"We have what it takes to defend ourselves," said FAC commander
General Hector Fabio Velasco to the repeated rebel warnings that
they would repel a foreseen crackdown on illicit cultivated land
the government of Colombian President Andres Pastrana will finance
with United States assistance.
</P>
<P>
Velasco told the press that the FARC threats "stimulate" the
international community to give military assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group, which is holding peace talks with the
government, has rejected the Plan Colombia. The FARC announced
Wednesday that they will combat aircraft and forces sent for the
massive destruction of coca and opium poppy plants cultivation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
This project has a cost of 7.5 billion dollars and its goal is
to finance the eradication of illicit cultivation, an alternate
development, and the peace.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government plans to contribute four billion
dollars and expects to receive 3.5 billion dollars from the
international community, which in the case of the United States
the contribution will be 1.3 billion dollars, most of it in
military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana will finance with this assistance the gigantic
offensive against coca plantations in the department of Putumayo,
in the southern border with Ecuador and Peru, which has an
important FARC presence, and that concentrates almost half of the
110,000 hectares cultivated with coca plans, that according to the
authorities, exist in the country.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will be in charge of dust spraying planes escorted
by armed helicopters and army troops units recently created with U.
S. assistance.

NEW YORK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The technology stocks fell sharply
Wednesday as software makers including Computer Associates
International warned that they will miss profit expectations.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index closed down 128.83
at 3,863.10. The Dow Jones industrial average also fell 77.07 at
10,483.60.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
index fell 23.31 at 1,446.23.
</P>
<P>
Computer Associates warned Wall Street investors that the
company will not meet earnings expectations in the second quarter.
Its shares fell 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, BMC Software said its earnings will be 18 to 21
cents a share in the second quarter, much less than 46 cents in
expectations. its shares also fell 25.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The selloff spread the whole market because the warnings raised
fears that other companies will issue disappointing earnings
results later on.
</P>
<P>
The market was also damaged by the expectations in the Intel's
growth slowdown in the next six to nine months from Salomon Smith
Barney and the downgrade of Oracle stocks from "buy" to "market
performer" by J.P. Morgan. Both Intel and Oracle fell.
</P>
<P>
The latest data showing the slowdown in the U.S. economy failed
to stop the selling. The Conference Board, a prominent business
research group, reported that the Composite Index of Leading
Economic Indicators declined by 0.1 percent in May in response to
six hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the past
year. The report raised hope that the Federal Reserve will leave
rates unchanged at the August 22 meeting.

"The Security Council decides that all States shall take the
necessary measures to prohibit the direct or indirect import of
all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to their territory," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The embargo runs for an initial period of 18 months, the
resolution said. "At the end of this period, it will review the
situation in Sierra Leone, including the extent of the Government'
s authority to the diamond-producing areas, in order to decide
whether to extend these measures for a further period and, if
necessary, to modify them or adopt further measures."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Council before the beginning of the vote, the
Sierra Leonean ambassador to the United Nations said, "the root of
the conflict remains in diamond, diamond and diamond."
</P>
<P>
The "first objective" of the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, and
his supporters in the neighborhood, is "to gain the access to the
nation's diamond," he said. Sankoh and his Revolutionary United
Front has been long taking control of the diamond-producing areas
in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voiced its grave concern "at the role
played by the illicit trade in diamonds in fueling the conflict in
Sierra Leone, and at reports that such diamonds transit
neighboring countries, including the territory of Liberia," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that the legitimate diamond trade is of great
economic importance for many States, and can make a positive
contribution to prosperity and stability and to the reconstruction
of countries emerging from conflict, the resolution said, "Nothing
in this resolution is intended to undermine the legitimate diamond
trade or to diminish confidence in the integrity of the legitimate
diamond industry."

<HEADLINE> 2 Die From Heat-Stroke in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Two people died from heat-stroke in
the northern Greek town of Yiannina as temperatures throughout the
country soared to 44 degrees Celsius Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two people, a man and a woman in their 50s, were the first
victims of a heatwave sweeping through Greece as of Sunday, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Public Power Corporation (DEH) reported demand
for electricity had reached 8,060 MWATT, the highest ever recorded
on any single day, but Greek Development Minister Nikos
Christodoulakis said that the country's power grid was well
prepared to meet the extra demand.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the hottest summers for Greece in a decade and
the temperatures are expected to remain at the same levels in
coming days.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the possible problems stemming from the heatwave,
the country's hospitals, health centers and ambulance services
have made themselves ready for emergencies while state and
municipal air-conditioned sports grounds and halls have been made
available to heat sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The country's fire brigade is also in a heightened state of
preparation, having stepped up patrols of the forested hills
around Athens.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Increasing in Latin America </HEADLINE>

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Poverty increased 50 percent in
Latin America despite the economic advances recorded during the
previous decade, said Wednesday Mexico's Nacional Financiera (
Nafin) general director Carlos Sales.
</P>
<P>
The challenge now is not only to advance the economy, but to
achieve a better distribution of income and better job
opportunities through small and medium enterprises, said Sales.
</P>
<P>
Nafin is the state banking agency for small and medium
enterprises in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The executive said that the dismantling of promotion
institutions similar to Nafinsa was recorded in the previous
decade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sales said that the world development crisis is far from being
surmounted, because half the world population, some three billion
people, survive with the equivalent of two dollars a day, and 1.3
billion with less than one dollar.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Vote on Sierra Leone Diamonds Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council,
after several days of delay, on Wednesday evening will vote on a
draft resolution to impose a global embargo on diamond exports
from Sierra Leone, where a gems-for-guns trade is financing a
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will cast the vote following its closed-
door discussions over the past few days. The draft resolution,
initiated by Britain, would ban all rough diamonds from Sierra
Leone until the government of the West African nation could set up
a proper certification system for the gems -- as well as regain
access to lucrative diamond-mining areas under the control of the
rebel United Revolutionary Front.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution put to vote said the embargo will be
imposed for an initial period of 18 months, suggested by France,
rather than 36 months as the United States prefers, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Mali, one of the 15 Security Council members, is expected to
vote in abstentions, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Diamonds, gold, iron ore and bauxite accounted for about two
thirds of Sierra Leone's exports before war in the 1990s wrecked
the economy of the West African country. Rebels control some 90
percent of the diamond mines, which yield among the best stones in
the world.
