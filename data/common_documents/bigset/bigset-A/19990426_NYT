 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ For today's Rockets quiz, we play ``Pick the worst
loss.'' Is it worse to:
<TEXT>
<P>
   A. Lose to the Mavericks at home;
</P>
<P>
   B. Lose to the Clippers anywhere; or
</P>
<P>
   C. Lose to the Suns by 24?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets don't know, and really don't care, having completed
all of the above with a 95-71 loss to the Suns on Sunday at America
West Arena to send them home with their longest losing streak of
the season and their worst loss since a 40-point blowout in
Portland on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   That loss was understandably blamed on a back-to-back schedule
complicated by travel problems in Vancouver. This time, the Rockets
could only credit the Suns and blame themselves, having lost most
of their offensive touch and all of their defensive intensity in
the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere, we're going to have to make a stand, looking in the
mirror, looking within and saying, `What can I do?''' Rockets coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``You've got to do it with defense, which is
nonexistent. We're not doing anything well right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got an empty feeling watching us play right now. I don't
see that fire. I don't see that fight.''
</P>
<P>
   One week after leading the Spurs by 23 in a game to take a share
of third place in the Western Conference, the Rockets are just a
half-game ahead of the similarly struggling Lakers heading into
their likely playoff preview tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have slipped so precipitously, they matched their
worst scoring game of the season, finishing with the fewest points
anyone has scored against the Suns. And the Rockets considered
offense the bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   They were dominated by Jason Kidd, who began the day sick to his
stomach, was still asleep 30 minutes before tipoff, turned an ankle
and smashed his arm into a television monitor. He was two-thirds of
the way to a triple double by halftime, grabbed his 10th rebound to
a standing ovation with 1:47 left and, when not in the training
room, added 22 points and 14 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before our pre-game meeting in the locker room, he was
sleeping,'' Suns coach Danny Ainge said. ``We had to wake him up.
Then he came out and played the way he did. The guy is amazing.
Then he fell on his shoulder. The guy is unbelievable. He finds a
way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Rockets left America West Arena on Sunday, their
fortunes had changed so radically, the problem on offense had
become getting Scottie Pippen some help.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had a second consecutive 20-point game for the first time
this season, getting 21 points and eight rebounds after his triple
double in the loss to the Clippers on Friday night. Hakeem Olajuwon
and Charles Barkley were each three points below their averages,
scoring 16 and 13 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem offensively, as it was in Los Angeles on
Friday, was that the Rockets got so little from their shooters
circling the Big Three outside. The Other Eight combined to make
just nine of 41 shots and just three of 18 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, against a team that ranks 25th in opponents' field-goal
percentage, the Rockets made just 26 of 74 shots (35.1 percent),
their worst shooting night since the rout in Portland, which was
their season low.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Clippers on Friday, the Suns double-teamed inside
rapidly and confidently, unconcerned that the Rockets' shooters
would burn them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a thousand shots,'' Tomjanovich said. ``When you
shoot that bad, it makes you look like you're playing really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, defensively, they were really bad _ and
have been since the start of the second half against Seattle on
April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns did not have a particularly scorching shooting night,
making 48.6 percent. But they had no trouble getting the sort of
good, open looks that would prevent any sustained Rockets comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we came out and set the tone of our style of
play,'' Pippen said. ``That has to be set on the defensive end.
Teams are coming out and just scoring too many points. It's an
uphill climb from the start of the game because we're not stopping
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our offense is a problem now. We're not stopping
teams. If you keep it in the 90s or the high 80s, you have a chance
of beating teams. We have to come out and lay it all on the line.
Right now, we're in a dogfight.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are not fighting back. Three of the Rockets' past four
opponents have surpassed 100 points. In the first 40 games, the
Rockets allowed more than 100 points eight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not challenging anybody (defensively),'' Pippen said.
``We're not pointing fingers. We all have to step up. But we have
to go and double-team and rotate on every play we run. We have to
take on the (man-to-man) challenge. We're not defending night in
and night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, that prevented the Rockets from putting real heat on the
Suns' lead. They moved to within 12 or 11 points with the
basketball several times but never could get consecutive stops.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Rockets were as close as 11, after a Michael
Dickerson jumper to start the fourth quarter, Kidd was off getting
X-rayed. But Rex Chapman made consecutive 3s and the lead was back
to 17 within one minute of Dickerson's basket.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Antoine Carr hit jumpers to move the Rockets within
13. But Danny Manning flicked the ball away from Pippen and pulled
up on a break for a short jumper. Pippen was called for a technical
foul for arguing that Manning had smacked his arm, and George
McCloud's free throw pushed the lead back to 16.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Kidd returned and the Rockets never challenged again,
making their fourth loss in five games complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with the bad loss to Dallas and has been downhill
from there,'' Olajuwon said, though it might have seemed at the
time that there was nothing further down the hill than losing at
home to Dallas. ``We just have to stop the bleeding and build it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, the more difficult question is, ``Can they do
it?''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ The Los Angeles Lakers don't want to hear any of the
Rockets' sad songs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lakers, the preseason favorites to win the Western
Conference, limp into Houston for tonight's game against the
Rockets at Compaq Center with some sad songs of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the theme of tonight's game could be, ``You've got your
troubles, I've got mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The wilting Rockets have suffered embarrassing losses to the
Mavericks and the Los Angeles Clippers over the past week, but
their situation isn't worse than the plight of the Lakers, who have
tried everything _ firing a coach, signing Dennis Rodman, making a
major trade and then releasing Rodman _ in their quest to get over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Changes like that in a season like this, with no practice time,
no training camp and games crammed together in an unending
procession, make for potentially disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are far from a disaster _ they take a 27-18 record
into tonight's game _ but they are widely viewed as a
disappointment. They are a team in search of wins, rhythm,
chemistry and, most of all, stability, all the things the Lakers
have not had of late, especially over the past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 11, the Lakers have lost to Seattle, Portland (by 27
points), Utah (by 16), Portland again and San Antonio (another
27-point blowout).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play (tonight) like we have in some games, then we have
no chance for a title,'' Shaquille O'Neal said Saturday. ``If we
can continue to improve, then we have a chance. We have to play
smart. We've been doing some stupid things, like not getting the
ball to shooters. I have no idea why.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lakers coach Kurt Rambis, who took over Feb. 26, two days
after Del Harris was fired, comes to Houston looking to improve his
team. If the Lakers win the game, fine. But Rambis is looking at a
bigger picture, which means getting ready for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the changes we've gone through, all the
disruptions that have happened on our ballclub and the struggling
phase that we're going through right now, I'm just looking to make
the team improve,'' Rambis said. ``I want to help the team improve
to give us the best chance in the playoffs. Regardless of whether
we win or lose ballgames, we have to get to the point where we're
improving as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it was kind of disappointing that we didn't take a
step forward in (Saturday's) game, but that's part of the learning
curve. You never learn on a straight, upward motion. You learn a
little bit, fall back and make some mistakes, then you move forward
again and learn from your mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, numbers-wise and all that stuff, it (tonight's
game) is a big ballgame. But to me, if we don't use it as another
game to improve, then we're defeating the purpose of playing right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is how the Lakers' season has gone.
</P>
<P>
   A 61-win team last season, the Lakers were viewed as somehow
wanting this season. Out went Harris, and in came Rambis, a
reminder of the Lakers' glory Showtime years.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming in and making himself at home was Rodman, who was
viewed as the ``thug'' power forward O'Neal had been demanding for
so long. With so much of the offensive burden falling on his
shoulders, O'Neal craved a tough-minded power forward who would
rebound and play post defense. That has always been the bulk of
Rodman's rsum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers weren't done.
</P>
<P>
   Out went longtime Lakers Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, shipped
to Charlotte for disgruntled sharpshooter Glen Rice. But while the
Lakers' super team was being assembled piece by piece, Rodman
appeared just as intent on tearing down everything, missing
practices, refusing to report into games and requesting leaves of
absence for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the brass had enough of the oddball forward, waiving
him April 15.
</P>
<P>
   It has made for interesting watching, and the television
networks took advantage, televising 26 of the Lakers' 50 games
nationally. Included in the package was Saturday's game against the
Spurs, a 108-81 loss that underscored all that is wrong with the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed with our effort (against the Spurs),''
Rambis said. ``They outworked us. We're not going to do anything or
go anywhere if we get outworked, so I was disappointed that our
overall, 100 percent, all-the-time effort wasn't there. There were
guys who did it sometimes, other guys who did it other times, but
that's not the way you improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way you play against playoff teams, and it's
not the way you play against teams that are extremely hot, like the
Spurs. You have to go out there with the maximum effort all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even tonight, against the slumping Rockets, who have dropped
consecutive games to Dallas, the Clippers and the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go in there and play well,'' O'Neal said. ``You
know, we match up pretty well with those guys. We're a similar team
_ dominant big men, dominant (small forwards), a lot of role
players around; they have shooters, and we have shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to play with a lot of fire. We know that they're
going to be pumped up. We just have to be ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal is ready to renew his battle with Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hakeem is the best big man ever, to me,'' O'Neal said. ``Of
course I have to be on my P's and Q's when I play against him, and
I usually play well against him. He's going to do his thing, and
I'm going to do my thing.''

SELANNE REELS, DUCKS FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Teemu Selanne insisted there was nothing wrong
with him, but his tired tone gave him away. That and his eyes.
Usually they sparkle _ but on Sunday, after the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks' third playoff loss in as many games to the Detroit Red
Wings, they were as dull as a scuffed pair of platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   To see the Ducks' emotional leader this way was disconcerting,
disorienting even. The sight left you as woozy as Kris Draper in
the second period right after Stu Grimson's stick tattooed his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played to the level I want to play at,'' Selanne
said in a tinny voice not at all like his usual rich timbre. ``I
feel it's important to be honest with yourself. It's not working
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, your brow really furrowed. No way was this the same
Selanne who oozes joy from his pores the way everyone else oozes
sweat. From the day he arrived in Orange County via Winnipeg in a
blockbuster trade in February of 1996, he has brightened the Ducks'
dressing room like no can of paint or roll of wallpaper possibly
could.
</P>
<P>
   The left winger is the Ducks' primary source of electricity. His
teammates are so used to plugging into his energy and enthusiasm,
they had to be in for quite a shock when Selanne short-circuited in
the team's first home game of these NHL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Selanne was operating at a dangerously low
current on a day the Ducks desperately needed his high-voltage
game. Rarely has Selanne failed to deliver, but in 26 shifts the
skater who led the league in goals this season with 47 couldn't
muster so much as a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a big part of this team and do the right
things,'' he said. ``Obviously it's so frustrating when I can't
help this team as much as I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Only twice in the 1998-99 regular season had he failed to get a
puck to the net. But that wasn't the worst of it. In a game the
Ducks had to win to avoid almost-certain elimination, Selanne had a
hard time keeping the puck on his stick. It kept squirting and
squirming away from him. It was every bit as hard to control as his
rambunctious 3-year-old son Eemil in the desolate Ducks dressing
room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The few Mighty Ducks who were up to talking repeated in
robotic-like voices that Grimson's cross-check of Draper, which
resulted in a match penalty for him and a five-minute power play
for the Red Wings, was the turning point in the Ducks' 4-2 loss in
the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   They were half right.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, Grimson's retaliatory act of thuggery did put the
Ducks down two men for two minutes, an untenable position for a
team so overmatched by the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion
Red Wings that it appears to be skating shorthanded at even
strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' Travis Green elbowed Draper to start the ill will
flowing. Draper reacted by cross-checking the first Duck he saw,
Antti Aalto, and Grimson, seeing that which the referees apparently
didn't, instinctively reacted in kind.
</P>
<P>
   One minute and twenty seconds into Detroit's ensuing
five-on-three, captain Steve Yzerman broke the 2-2 tie with a
rebound goal that proved to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks weathered the remaining 3 minutes and 40 seconds of
Grimson's penalty and had plenty of time to get mad and get even.
Instead, they looked as lethargic as Selanne, engaging Red Wings
goaltender Chris Osgood just twice in the first 18 minutes of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't push myself today,'' Selanne said. ``I tried, but
there was nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   That never was more painfully evident than early in the third
when Selanne and Paul Kariya broke up ice and snapped the drowsy
Arrowhead Pond sellout crowd of 17,174 to attention. Kariya
feathered a pretty pass to Selanne, but the puck skipped off
Selanne's stick and skittered off his right skate. Before he could
recover his dignity or the puck, Selanne was dumped by Detroit's
Wendel Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne was as invisible as a drop of sweat on the ice after
that.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Detroit defensemen Niklas Lidstrom and Chris Chelios
had a hand in making Selanne disappear. Chelios was all over him
and Lidstrom lithely swept away most of the pucks intended for
Selanne that squeezed through the narrow passing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne gave credit where it was due, then heaped the rest of
the blame on his shoulders. If he was carrying some other burden,
he wouldn't unload it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK,'' he said, but you could see his upper lip
stiffening.

AT NAACP DINNER, GORE PRAISES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Proclaiming that his father had been voted out of the
Senate largely for his support of civil rights legislation, Vice
President Al Gore on Sunday night affirmed his commitment to
fighting ``the cruelties of the heart that have been attributed to
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the annual dinner of the Detroit chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Gore
drew a standing ovation as he belittled critics of affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know in your heart, as I know in mine, that there is
absolutely nothing more important to the future of the United
States of America than taking us past the burden of history, taking
us past the barriers of injustice, taking us past the cruelties of
the heart that have been attributed to prejudice,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech at the annual civil rights dinner _ an event so
large that there are four separate daises for honored guests, one
in each corner of the hall _ drew particular attention because it
came at a time when racial discord has emerged as an early issue in
the Democratic presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the only prominent
Democrat seeking the presidential nomination besides Gore, has
moved to seize the issue of race relations. In a speech last week
at Cooper Union in New York, Bradley said ending racial inequities
would be a recurring topic of his campaign and, if he were elected,
a central concern of his White House.
</P>
<P>
   With the speech, Bradley moved to embrace an issue that has been
closely identified with President Clinton during his years as a
national figure. This clearly concerned Gore's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made clear on Sunday night that he shared
Bradley's concern about what both men had described as the
continuing racial turmoil in the country. And like Bradley, Gore
drew on his family history to illustrate that point.
</P>
<P>
   In his New York speech, Bradley recounted the story of an aunt
who had repeatedly used racial epithets. In Detroit on Sunday
night, Gore recalled that his father, who like Gore had served as a
U.S. senator from Tennessee, had voted for civil rights laws _ a
stance, Gore said, that had probably cost his father his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sacrificed his career because he was willing to stand for
what he believed,'' Gore said. ``I thank God my father taught me to
love justice. I thank God that my family taught me to hate
discrimination as the evil that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were clear differences between what Gore and Bradley
said. Bradley mentioned affirmative action only in passing in his
speech at Cooper Union. By contrast, Gore gave it a full-throated
endorsement in his remarks to this mostly black audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the critics of affirmative action,'' Gore said as
the audience rose to its feet, hooting and cheering. He added:
``They talk about a color-blind society. Give me a break! Hel-lo!
They use their `color-blind' the way duck hunters use their duck
blind. They hide behind it and hope the ducks won't figure out what
they're up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides had disparaged Bradley's speech for failing to
offer detailed ideas on how the nation might deal with racism. The
vice president appeared to make the same point on Sunday night,
without mentioning Bradley's name, by suggesting that he had more
substantive proposals to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called on Congress to finance new empowerment zones, urban
areas that use tax reductions and other measures to promote job
development. And he decried the use by police of racial profiling
in identifying suspects for questioning.

CLIPPERS FUTURE IS TAYLOR-MADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers ambassador to
``SportsCenter'' is moving through a diplomatic channel connecting
the dressing room and the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   His young constituents hail him as the rim-slaying ``Mo,'' and
he is wading through them without immunity or a spotter. But an
entourage is not in the current budget. The lead role for
Tinseltown's B-rated NBA franchise requires the 6-foot-8, 260-pound
power forward to perform his own stunts.
</P>
<P>
   They include writing and rewriting, so he scribbles ``Maurice
Taylor'' over and over on typical treasures of memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the market value of one Maurice Taylor autograph may
exceed $70 million scoots.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers should be offering him the pen in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very big summer for this team,'' says
the 22-year-old Taylor, who is hammering stardom's door with one
season remaining on the three-year Clipper contract he signed after
leaving Michigan one year early. ``I would love to stay here, but
that's for them to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Never fear; those Clipper minds hired for the purpose of casting
already have decided. If they had absolute control of the payroll,
Taylor would be offered the league's maximum contract extension of
six years for the aforementioned 70 mil and change.
</P>
<P>
   But until team owner Donald T. Sterling endorses that decision,
Clipper fans (with a success rate of 9-35, they're more like cult
members) won't breathe until the coast is clear. With a dread
constructed by history, they realize their emerging go-to guy could
go to another city. And it's impossible to have a crowd favorite
without a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the go-to guy wouldn't mind staying put here in Mo-town
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we've been playing shows promise for next year,''
Taylor says of the uprising (6-5) the Clippers hope to continue
when the San Antonio Spurs step into the Sports Arena tonight.
``Things are falling into place. Now management has to step up to
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Sterling refuses to part with the prevailing simoleons,
there will be no shortage of teams eager to take a swing at Taylor,
whose first hoop deal was worth a cool $100.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was made seven years ago by his grandfather, Leroy
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice had been a football lifer who stood 6-1 as a freshman at
Detroit's Henry Ford High, but was pushing 6-8 midway through his
sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor winces at the recollection of his personal growth: ``My
knees were killin' me all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't prevent him from exploiting his new altitude in the
heady politics of playground basketball.
</P>
<P>
   His personal review: ``I thought I was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leroy Taylor wouldn't be impressed until Maurice made his
mark in organized ball. The coach at Ford had noticed the kid's
pituitary bonanza and had been pestering him to grab a uniform, so
all young Mo needed was clinical incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather bet me one-hundred dollars that I couldn't hang
with the guys on the high school team,'' Taylor says. ``A little
reverse psychology. So I played the last eight games.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Mo's hang time force his grandfather to pay up?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no doubt,'' Taylor says. ``He had to.''
</P>
<P>
   After Leroy Taylor passed away in 1993, his grandson paid him
back.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed Maurice Taylor in moments of glory, tapping
his right fist on the No. 23 stitched to his Clipper jersey. What
you probably haven't seen is the picture of Leroy Taylor tattooed
on Mo's chest, or the letters spelling out ``Leroy Taylor'' on each
heel of his Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it,'' Maurice explains ``to have him with me, because he
wouldn't be able to see me play anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Taylor's $100 has bought the NBA another precocious turk
with sizzle and enough skill to help bury Clipper tradition. In the
last lap of a tight game, he'll stroll past the skid row of
courtside reporters, sigh in a demonstration of profound fatigue
and announce, ``They're killin' me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has drawn a parallel between questionable officiating and the
animated sitcom ``South Park.'' After a WWF-style run-in with power
forward barometer Karl Malone, he dismissed ``The Mailman'' as
``...just another (compound expletive) on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   He scored 14 consecutive points to rally the Clippers - the same
0-17 bunch that threatened to have its own chump chapter in the NBA
record book - to victory over the mighty Trail Blazers ... in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a good player,'' Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said
after Taylor put a career-high 29 points on his Rockets three
nights back, ``he's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   But his decision to leave Michigan with one year of eligibility
remaining did not inspire absolute joy in the NBA. Marty Blake, the
league's official arbiter of talent, announced that Taylor's choice
was a tactical blunder.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers disagreed. They were stunned when he was available
at pick No. 14 of the 1997 NBA Draft, so they wadded up their
point-guard shopping list and selected Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   He produced 11.5 points per game last season under Coach Bill
``The Rookie Killer'' Fitch, and was named to the All-Rookie second
team.
</P>
<P>
   After the lockout didn't include an embargo on his kitchen,
Taylor reported to this season's abbreviated training camp as more
of a player than he needed to be. His weakened knees recovered in
time for a 21-point, 20-rebound effort in the season's sixth game,
a double-overtime loss to Vancouver. He sprained his right knee
nine days later, bounced back after two games in street clothes,
and played in 19 more before surrendering to double Achilles
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   He missed two more Clipper defeats, but has provided several
``monster games'' - often the subject of pre-game prediction -
since. This Godzilla pantomime includes a 26 points-per-game
average over the last five screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo's just been playing great basketball,'' first-year Clipper
coach Chris Ford says. ``He has the potential to be an outstanding
player.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential is obvious as Taylor attacks the basket like
someone busting curfew at the ATM. And his face-up game now
includes a trusty jump shot that is released at full (contract)
extension.
</P>
<P>
   One area of improvement in Ford's crosshairs is rebounding.
Along with his 17 points per game, Taylor averages a tick over five
rebounds, not enough for a talented power forward who otherwise is
as bashful as the underdog in Round 12.
</P>
<P>
   After tracking down eight rebounds in a recent game, he was
informed that the effort was not lost on Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? I thought it was more than eight,'' Taylor said.
``Well, if it's eight, then he (Ford) has to take what he can
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald T. Sterling should be advised to do the same.

 &HT;    C. Jones to sit with groin pull
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Third baseman Chipper Jones has a strained adductor
(groin) muscle in his left thigh and is expected to miss at least
one game.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pulled up in pain in the third inning Sunday running from
first to third base on a ground ball by Brian Jordan. Jones
continued playing for the next four innings but came out after
hitting into a fielder's choice in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like I had a knot in my groin,'' Jones said. ``It
didn't really hurt that bad, but as more and more time went by and
it moved farther down my leg, it started to hurt. ... It's sharp.
It's tugging pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jones is unable to play today, he'll be replaced by Keith
Lockhart, who made his second start of the season at second base
Sunday and went 2-for-4 with one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Playing time
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Ozzie Guillen, like Lockhart, started for the second
time Sunday. The last time they started was 11 games ago. They each
have one pinch hit this season, in four at-bats for Guillen and
seven at-bats for Lockhart, and have driven in a pair of runs.
</P>
<P>
   But by getting them back in the lineup now, Cox hoped to help
get them more comfortable at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit them too long,'' Cox said. ``You start smelling
when you need to get them in there. It's a feel thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Lockhart had only 12 at-bats. Besides his three
hits in two starts, he's had one other hit, pinch-hitting on April
12. Guillen had only 10 at-bats and went hitless in four that April
11 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work harder when you don't play every day,'' said Guillen,
who was the starting shortstop for the Chicago White Sox for 13
years. ``You take extra batting practice, take ground balls in
different places. When you start, you just show up and play. I just
try to stay focused and stay in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart has had to readjust to life on the bench with the
arrival of Bret Boone. In 1997, when he was used primarily as a
pinch hitter until Mark Lemke got hurt in August, Lockhart was
second in the majors with 18 pinch-hit RBIs and tied for fifth in
Atlanta history with 15 pinch hits.
</P>
<P>
   On hitting No. 8
</P>
<P>
   Sunday might not have been the off day Walt Weiss wanted, but he
could relax and enjoy it, having solved some of the hitting
problems that stifled him to start the season. Weiss is on a
seven-game hitting streak, including two-hit games in each of the
last three, to raise his average from .160 to .269.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss attributes the streak to getting back in the groove of
being a No. 8 hitter. Despite all his experience at hitting eighth
in Oakland and Colorado, he had to remind himself how to go about
doing it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I went overboard,'' Weiss said. ``I tried to expand my
strike zone too much. As an eighth hitter you've got to do that at
times with runners on base and the pitcher coming up behind you.
You have to avoid a walk to make sure they're not pitching around
you. Other times you do want to go deep in the count to turn the
lineup over.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said he made an adjustment in his stance during spring
training, holding his hands higher and further back in his stance,
that was allowing him to drive the ball more. ``Unfortunately I was
successful with it,'' said Weiss. ``It got me away from what I do
best, which is making people pitch deep in the count, get on base
and make contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer update
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer continues to pitch well on his rehabilitation
assignment in Class AAA Richmond as he recovers from back surgery.
He pitched another scoreless inning Saturday night against
Louisville, giving up his first hit and striking out one. In three
innings, he walked none and struck out two.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CINCINNATI _ If you subscribe to the theory that the same things
that make you laugh can also make you cry, it's safe to assume the
Astros could have shed enough tears to float themselves home after
Sunday's loss at Cinergy Field.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day after having a few chuckles at the expense of the
Cincinnati bullpen, they got a lesson in turnabout as the Reds
added to Doug Henry's miseries in beating the Astros 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 5-1 through four innings, the Astros tied
the game with four runs in the fifth, only to see their comeback
bid foiled when the Reds scored twice off Henry in the sixth. After
the game, Henry revealed that his season-long struggles have been
associated with discomfort in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making excuses,'' he said. ``I'm not 100 percent, but
this is the best my elbow has felt. The bottom line is that when I
go out there, I should get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was easier said than done Sunday, not just for Henry
(0-1) but also for starter Sean Bergman, who lasted just four
innings and left the Astros with a four-run deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense did their job, and the defense did their job,''
Bergman said. ``But I didn't do mine. When you score six runs, that
should be enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the first two games of the road trip at Chicago,
the Astros dropped two of three to the Reds before returning to
Houston, where tonight they will open a four-game homestand against
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Astros' record to 9-8 _ the identical mark
they posted after 17 games in 1998, when they finished with a
franchise-best 102 victories and won their second National League
Central title in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied with playing .500 ball, and I don't think
any of our players are,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``We
can play better than we've been playing, and I believe we will.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the criticism the bullpen has taken in the first three
weeks of the season, Sunday was the first time an Astros reliever
has been charged with a loss. The Astros' relievers have combined
for a 3-1 record and a 3.75 ERA, with seven saves in seven
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The most inconsistent performer of the group has been Henry,
whose ERA jumped to 8.64 after Sunday's outing. Henry entered the
game in the sixth inning and gave up a leadoff homer to Reds second
baseman Pokey Reese, who is known more for his slick fielding than
his pop at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the next six batters reached against Henry, including
Mike Cameron, who hit a one-out triple and scored on Greg Vaughn's
single to left. Considering how Henry has struggled this season, it
was somewhat surprising Dierker decided to use him in such a
crucial situation.
</P>
<P>
   Why not stick with Brian Williams, who had retired the Reds in
order in the fifth inning?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about that,'' Dierker said. ``But Brian was pretty
sore. He threw 60-something pitches (Friday) night, and he was
having trouble getting loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Scott Elarton had worked two innings Saturday, it made
sense to save Jay Powell for the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had wanted me to go back out there, I could have,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Reds got a strong effort from their bullpen as
Friendswood native Scott Williamson pitched the final three innings
in relief of starter Pete Harnisch. Williamson retired nine of the
10 batters he faced, including four on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell's two-out solo home run gave the Astros hope in the
ninth, but Williamson struck out Jeff Bagwell to end the game and
pick up his first big-league save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some chances,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio
said. ``We had the tying run at the plate when the game ended; it
just wasn't meant to be. Williamson pretty much got everybody
out.''
</P>
<P>
   After setting down the first three batters he faced, Bergman had
trouble getting just about anybody out. Sean Casey led off the
Cincinnati second with a single and scored on a wild pitch, while
Eddie Taubensee and Cameron each produced RBI singles in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Boone plated another run with a sacrifice fly in the
third, and Vaughn singled home a run in the fourth. The most
un-Bergman-like aspect of Sunday's game was the fact he walked four
batters _ a total he exceeded only once in 27 starts last year. He
also threw two wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't being as aggressive as I should have been,'' Bergman
said. ``The walks are frustrating, because I consider myself to be
a pitcher who is not going to walk a lot of guys. I just didn't
find the strike zone very often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored four runs in a fifth-inning outburst keyed by
Ken Caminiti's two-run homer off Harnisch (2-2). Bagwell hit his
team-leading fifth home run in the fourth.

MARTINEZ DOMINATES CLEVELAND COMPLETELY 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jimy Williams popped out of the dugout and walked
toward the mound. Pedro Martinez stood on the hill and waited. The
Red Sox led, 3-2, Sunday there were two outs in the ninth, and
Martinez had just surrendered a single to Wil Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd booed when Williams walked out, then hushed when he
stood talking to his pitcher. If Williams raised his arm and called
to the bullpen, he surely would get the Antoine Walker/Ulf
Samuelsson treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Williams spun on his heels and ran to the dugout. And
then Martinez struck out David Justice with his 137th pitch of the
day _ a 95 mile-per-hour fastball _ to seal a Red Sox Sunday
matinee victory over the vaunted Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised him I would get that out and I did,'' said
Martinez. ``I told him when he got to the mound, `I'm fine.' He
trusted me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last outing in Detroit, Martinez was lifted in the eighth
inning of a 1-0 victory. The Dominican righty was furious. He
wasn't coming out this time. He stuck around for his first complete
game, improving his record to 4-1 with a 2.21 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a class by himself,'' said Boston pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. ``And that ain't a tossed salad lineup. There's no
breathers over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Tribe has home run power in spots 1-8. The 6-7-8
batters (Cordero, Justice, Travis Fryman) could hit 3-4-5 for most
teams. And yet the Sox were able to take two of three from
Cleveland thanks to a Pedro-led staff that boasts a baseball-best
ERA of 3.28.
</P>
<P>
   This was the rubber game of a crucial early season series that
could have long-term impact on the Sox' fortunes. They were reeling
when they returned home from Detroit, and seemed to find new
purpose after two melees in a 7-6 loss Friday night. The Sox scored
a season-high nine runs in a Saturday victory, then rode their ace
home in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was staked to a 1-0 lead in the first. Hitting against
star Cleveland rocketman Bartolo Colon, Jose Offerman (.386 and
where would they be without him?) led with a Wall double and scored
when Jeff Frye punched a double down the first-base line. Frye went
to third on a ground out, then tried to score when Reggie Jefferson
grounded to second. He was erased on a nice throw by Roberto
Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Colon hit Mike Stanley on the left elbow with two outs and
nobody aboard in the third, and 30,472 knew it was only a matter of
time before Martinez answered. With one out and no one on in the
fifth, Cordero made the mistake of stepping out on Martinez and
that nominated him for Most-Likely-to-be-Plunked. Martinez came in
letter-high and the pitch brushed the front of Cordero's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mound-charging.
</P>
<P>
   After Cordero was hit, Martinez fanned Justice and Fryman to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like we might be in for another 1-0 Pedro victory, but
Cleveland's backup catcher, Einar Diaz (Sandy Alomar has back
spasms), led off the sixth with a double to right-center and
cruised home on Kenny Lofton's hard single up the middle. Lofton
was sacrificed to second, then doubled off by Damon Buford, who
made a nice sliding catch of Robbie Alomar's pop into shallow
center.
</P>
<P>
   Buford's catch was one of several nice plays in Martinez's
defense. Troy O'Leary made a leaping catch in front of the Wall in
the eighth, and Buford made another sliding grab in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Colon left after retiring Nomar Garciaparra with his 124th pitch
to end the sixth, then the Sox won it with a pair in the seventh
off righty reliever Paul Shuey.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley hit a monstrous double off the Wall in center. O'Leary
was intentionally walked after Shuey fell behind, 2-0, then Buford
fought off a 1-2 pitch and dumped a bases-loading single to right.
Jason Varitek was next and he cracked a two-run double inside the
first-base bag to make it 3-1. That's all Martinez would need.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Corsi and Derek Lowe were ready after the Sox went down in
the eighth, but Martinez emerged from the dugout, which ignited the
fandom. With one out he surrendered a double to Manny Ramirez, then
came Cordero's two-out, RBI single. That's when Williams went to
the mound. ``I didn't ask him,'' said the manager. ``I just felt
I'd hang with Pedro. Just go with the man.''
</P>
<P>
   The man did the job. And after going toe-to-toe for three games
and beating the Tribe twice, the Sox took flight with new hopes for
their season.

LAUGHER LIFTS CELTICS' SPIRITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sunday afternoon began with a joke and ended with a
series of them. Before anyone had taken a shot on the FleetCenter
parquet, Rick Pitino approached injured Celtic Antoine Walker. The
smiling coach picked up a towel and draped it over the player's
suit, a two-toned sky blue number with checkers.
</P>
<P>
   Both men laughed at the gesture. They would do that a lot over
the 48 minutes that followed. And so would Paul Pierce, Damon
Jones, Walter McCarty, Dana Barros, Ron Mercer, and most of the
17,211 fans. Everyone was involved. All of their laughter led to
the raucous punch line of the day: Celtics 113, Wizards 84.
</P>
<P>
   With two minutes remaining and the Celtics ahead by 28, Pitino
once again approached the end of the bench. Walker, Pierce, and
McCarty all were telling jokes. Pitino wanted McCarty to go in the
game, but the forward was laughing so hard that he didn't hear the
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter,'' Pitino called again. ``What are you doing,
socializing?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. What else was there to do? The Wizards were no fun.
They shot 40 percent, handled the ball as if they were playing the
old childhood game of ``Hot Potato,'' and reinforced their pregame
advertising as a team that will get coaches (see Bernie
Bickerstaff) fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not here today,'' Jim Brovelli said after the game. In
most cases, that comment would elicit some laughter, too. But
Brovelli is the unfortunate man given the title of Wizards interim
coach. Keep him in your prayers; he is required to watch this team
for six more games.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics didn't make things easier for him. Barros was on the
court for 26 minutes and produced 20 points, 8 assists, and 6
rebounds. He had only one steal, but even that was memorable: He
stripped the ball cleanly from Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a game from which you walked away talking about
favorite plays rather than key possessions. One of those plays was
by Mercer, who finished with 18 points. In the third quarter, the
6-foot-7-inch guard drove the baseline and saw Mitch Richmond in
his face. Both men jumped and suddenly Richmond was looking at
Mercer's chest while the Celtics guard was eye-to-eye with the rim,
finishing a ferocious dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't jumped like that since, probably, last year,''
Mercer said. ``I don't know if I could do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer had missed four games with back spasms. He also had
missed some time with a sore knee and ankle. He said the four-game
layoff bored him but probably helped the strength in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   When Mercer wasn't dunking, he had plenty of entertainment
opportunities. He could have watched Barros, Vitaly Potapenko (16
points), the 15 points and six assists of rookie Jones, or the 17
points of his college teammate, McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shooting was like a Florida State kicker,'' Pitino said of
McCarty's early-season shooting. ``You know: wide right, wide
left.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty laughed when he heard that. ``I haven't even played that
much this year,'' he said, referring to knee and toe injuries.
Before Sunday's season high in points, McCarty's highlight had been
signing a three-year, $8.4 million contract extension on his
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old guard from Houston wouldn't mind a contract like
that. A few days ago, Jones was sweating over his next 10-day deal
with the Celtics. Sunday, he was cracking his teammates up by
diving on the floor in the fourth quarter and doing a little dance
while on his belly. He was asked the name of that dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the Rick Pitino Dance,'' he said. ``You got to get on
the floor or you'll be on the bench. Y'all know how that goes
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff likes Jones because of his hustle and
shooting. The players like him because he specializes in breaking
up a quiet room with a funny comment. And he likes everybody
because, he says, they take care of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying in a hotel right now,'' he said. ``These guys come
by and take me to practice, take me to dinner. It's nice to know
there are guys like that; I love these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the afternoon, most of the Celtics had a feel-good
story. Pitino was saying again that he wished the season could be
extended. Mercer was saying that ``I'm sure we can turn it around''
and that he has wanted to remain a Celtic since the day they
drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the fourth quarter, when it was obvious the Celtics were
going to win their 18th game of the season, Walker shouted to the
court, ``Get the ball to Shin Man.'' He was talking about Dwayne
Schintzius, who averages 0.6 points per game. But Sunday, even
Schintzius scored.

SONICS ON OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Don MacLean could hardly get off the team bus
before having a camera thrust into his face.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the national television crew tailed the suddenly popular
Sonics forward down the halls of the Delta Center. MacLean, who has
played well in the absence of All-Star Vin Baker, was Sunday's
pregame fodder. That alone speaks volumes about how much the Sonics
are stretching to grab a playoff spot this late in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, cameras barely got a glimpse of MacLean because he
was so far at the end of the team's bench.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, though, NBC had a vision before the Sonics were
flattened by the Utah Jazz 98-81 Sunday at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean was the only one who heard the call for action when the
spotlight came on.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Sonics were blinded by it.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain a game where only two Sonics _ MacLean
had 23 points and Dale Ellis had 10 _ score in double figures, and
the team shoots 38 percent?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't make baskets, you can't beat the Jazz in Utah,''
Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``The Jazz are too good. If you're
not sharp, you're not going to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Sonics, MacLean was the only player who
could score. He finished with his third straight 20-plus scoring
night, which had been a great compliment in two previous outings.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gary Payton scored a season-low five points on 2-of-11
shooting, and every other starter was held below 10 points. It is
hard to imagine the Sonics would have beaten many teams with such
little production.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was just as bad.
</P>
<P>
   With Sacramento idle and Phoenix's win against Houston, the
Sonics snuggled up to the ninth seed in the Western Conference
playoff picture. They are one-half game behind Minnesota for the
eighth and final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had their two-game winning streak snapped. Sunday's
game was so lopsided, the starters had plenty of time in the fourth
to look at the scoreboard for scores of games involving the other
playoff hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the season is over because we lost today,''
Hawkins said. ``If we continue to play good basketball, the
playoffs will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are on the outside looking up in the playoff
standings for the first time this season. They are in jeopardy of
missing the postseason for the first time since the 1989-90 season
if their position stays the same through the final six games.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday does not get any easier because the Sonics face Utah in
a rematch at KeyArena. Seattle then travels to Portland on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what the Sonics will do immediately is forget about
Sunday's loss. They led 4-2 after two minutes expired in the first
quarter. The Sonics fought to overcome a double-digit deficit the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was the game?
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, the Jazz mascot stood by the Sonics' bench dressed
in a Grim Reaper costume. Payton, Detlef Schrempf, Olden Polynice
and Hersey Hawkins refused to pay attention to the fourth-quarter
mockery.
</P>
<P>
   They instead watched Utah hold on to most of its 24-point,
fourth-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we were playing the Clippers or somebody,'' said
Hawkins, who was 2-for-7 from the floor with eight points. ``We are
playing the best team in the league. The Jazz are as solid
defensively as any team in the league. You don't come in here and
expect to shoot a high percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   However, that does not address the Sonics' inability to slow
down Utah's Karl Malone (21 points, eight rebounds) and their poor
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of energy on the glass allowed Utah to outscore the
Sonics 19-5 in second-chance points. The Sonics were unable to run
their fast break and create easy shot attempts, which accounted for
eight fewer shots than Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has been inconsistent all year,'' said MacLean, who
hit a few jumpers but mostly drove the lane looking for baskets.
``We've got to make some shots and rebound. With the (small lineup)
we have now, the key is getting out in transition.''
</P>
<P>
   They also need Payton. When he is off as much as Sunday, the
Sonics usually don't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, Payton was not his usual aggressive self.
He passed up shots but dished out 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Payton did not talk to the media after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he'll say it, but I think he was ill,''
Westphal said. ``He just didn't have the energy and he couldn't
make shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton missed five of his first six shots, and the Sonics shot
just 30 percent in the first. They trailed 25-16 after the period.
MacLean scored nine points in the second and kept the Sonics
relatively close at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Utah extended its 50-39 halftime lead to 15 points,
the Sonics charged back. Trailing 62-54 with 5:02 left in the
third, Hawkins had a chance to get the Sonics within five. But he
missed a wide-open 3-pointer in front of the Jazz bench.
</P>
<P>
   Utah then took off. The Jazz led 74-60 heading into the fourth.
The Sonics then fell victim to Utah's 14-2 run that started the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   Game over.

HERE'S HOPING CHANCES AREN'T FLEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON _ If Monday night you're coming to the Vault, the
Hub's hockey home of bountiful profit but dwindling fortune, the
Bruins hope you'll wear something black, something gold. Borrow it,
if you must.
</P>
<P>
   For their sake, they'd like to borrow something old: a
postseason victory on home ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have won only one of their last 11 playoff games on
Causeway Street, dating back to Round 2 in '94, in the beloved
bygone days when the Garden was in its death rattle and a trip to
Boston in the springtime was no tiptoe through the tulips for the
visiting team. In the opening round of the '94 playoffs, the Bruins
bumped off the dreaded Canadiens, clinching the series with a
thrilling 5-3 win over the Habs in Game 7 at the Garden. The Bruins
haven't won a series since then.
</P>
<P>
   Now, enter the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more life now,'' said Boston netminder Byron Dafoe,
following Sunday's workout, ``and we gave it to them. Now we have
to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins stood on the verge Saturday night of taking a 2-0
series lead over the former Forever .500s. But a third-period
turnover in their own zone led to overtime, and another miscue in
OT led to Ray Sheppard's winner. Now here they are, dead even with
their one-time New England rivals and in need of re-establishing
the kind of offense that made them the NHL's hottest club in the
last month of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Even to think about getting to Round 2, the Bruins need a
handful of their forwards to wake up and smell the postseason.
Dmitri Khristich was dreadful in Games 1 and 2, but he was hardly
alone. Anson Carter wasn't a factor. Ditto Sergei Samsonov. Steve
Heinze, hindered by a groin problem in Game 1, too often looked
like a man falling up a staircase. Jason Allison, their No. 1
center and playmaker, never got his game out of second gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to start kicking guys,'' said coach Pat Burns,
assessing the failure of his forwards in the two games in
Greensboro. ``But, yeah, Khristich and Heinze _ those guys really
concern me; they've got to be better. Allison, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In two games, the Bruins' attack was led by their ever-reliable
checking line _ Rob DiMaio, Tim Taylor, and P.J. Axelsson _ and two
of their supertankers, Ken Belanger and Landon Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger matched hit for hit with Carolina behemoth Keith
Primeau and also scored a goal in Game 1. While most of his fellow
forwards only thought about skating, looking as if they were
playing in the midseason All-Star no-hitter, Belanger popped the
transmission into overdrive and played with total emotion and grit.
He wasn't exactly Terry O'Reilly, but he resembled old blood 'n'
guts. When was the last time we said that here? Heck, not since Cam
Neely gave Claude Lemieux that facial in the Garden, banging his
noggin nose-first into the Boston Globe ad in the corner boards,
giving Lemieux a certifiable nose for news.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson shook his ``Landon of the Lost'' tag in Game 2 _ Burns
anointed him the team's first star for the performance _ and played
like a bona fide big boy in Game 2. If Wilson could come with that
performance every time, he would factor among the top nine forwards
of just about any team in the league, save perhaps the Wings and
Avs. He not only dished out some heavy hits, he set up a Samsonov
goal with a dash down left wing and quick pullup, turning Glen
Wesley inside-out and wristing a perfect shot on Arturs Irbe from a
tough angle. Sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you'll see from the 'Canes in Game 3: a ferocious
opening 10 minutes, a stretch when they'll roll four lines over the
boards and hit everything in a black-and-gold sweater (in which
case you might want to reconsider wearing the team colors Monday
night). They come fast and hard. They lack touch and their
offensive attack is metronomically predictable _ corner to behind
the net to out front, jam, jam, and jam some more _ but they're a
sight to behold for their revving legs and stinging hits. Whenever
their Cup run ends, they can package themselves as a demolition
derby act and work theme parks around the country this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins like to say they've got a more controlled attack by
comparison. That's another way of saying they couldn't match the
'Canes for intensity, skating speed, and true hunger in Games 1 and
2. If victories were awarded solely on man-for-man effort, the
Hartford-Greensboro-Raleigh Hurricanes would have a 2-0 series
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a lot more to it than just wanting it, just
going for it. The Bruins do have the skill among their forwards to
outperform the 'Canes. What they need to do now _ and this should
be easier on home ice _ is match Carolina's will and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team's got to play better,'' said Allison, who
should find more room to work with the Bruins getting the last line
change as part of the home-ice adantage. ``We weren't making
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   As they say in 'Cane country, Allison ain't whistlin' Dixie. If
the Bruins don't start making plays, they won't be playing at all.

GARCIAPARRA QUESTIONS MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ People's choice Lou Merloni was optioned to Pawtucket
after Sunday's game. The Red Sox Monday will recall
lefthanded-hitting first baseman Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   That's the small news. The bigger story is Nomar Garciaparra's
stand against management on the Merloni demotion. It was downright
Vaughn-esque.
</P>
<P>
   Merloni was upset about the demotion, saying, ``This is pretty
much (expletive), but it's something I've got to deal with. It
makes no sense. No one can convince me that it makes sense. I'm
shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, never before one to speak out against management,
took his teammate's objections a step further. ``He should be
upset,'' said the franchise shortstop. ``I don't know what you
gotta do. He does everything right. I'm not a numbers guy, but I
think he is doing better than all of us (Merloni is hitting .333, 6
for 18 in six games). I'm sure he has nothing to work on. Why
people do what they do, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality guy in the clubhouse, and you see what he does
on the field. Everybody knows what he's capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   So why send him down?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' answered Garciaparra. ``You're asking the
wrong guy. Here's a guy I played with growing up. We played in the
minors together. I know what he's done. They tell you you've got to
do all this stuff to get to the big leagues, and he's done
everything asked of him and he gets up here and he's got to get
sent down _ for who knows what reason? What do you tell him? You
can't tell him anything. `You belong up here, but you can't be up
here'? It doesn't make sense. What am I gonna tell my boy? I can't
tell him anything. I was speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni, a 28-year-old Framingham native, said, ``No doubt we've
got a numbers problem in the infield, but I've done the job. I
don't need any more at-bats. I don't need to go work on my defense.
There's no reason to go down. You can't justify this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, standing about 25 feet
from where Merloni was speaking, said, ``It makes sense for the
balance of the ballclub. With Jose Offerman playing second, we have
Jeff Frye, Donnie Sadler, and Merloni. That's three extra
infielders, and you only need two. This is more for balance, to
give (manager) Jimy (Williams) a lefthanded hitter on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette may have to deliver his next explanation to
Garciaparra. In the tradition of Mo Vaughn, Boston's best player
has a problem with one of management's moves.

BUHNER BOOSTS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ There are so many things to keep track of
as a hitter, Jay Buhner said, that it's almost as if you need a
checklist every time you come to bat. If you lose a few pounds and
miss a few games, as Buhner did on this road trip, one small part
of a finely tuned swing could go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   So it helps to have others notice the flaws you miss. And after
Buhner struck out in his first at-bat this weekend against the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., a teammate
for 11 years, told him he was dropping his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner brought his hands up, and that slight adjustment brought
a major payoff Sunday. Facing dominating Tampa Bay closer Roberto
Hernandez in the ninth inning, Buhner ripped a two-run homer to
lift the Mariners to a 6-4 victory before 27,163 at Tropicana
Field. It was his fourth hit of the day and sixth in 10 at-bats
since correcting the mechanical error.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I got my hands back up there, it was amazing,''
Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, who also homered Saturday, had a pair of singles and a
double in the early innings Sunday. He came up in the ninth with a
man on second and two outs in a tie game and wondered if he would
be walked or pitched around by Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he blew the first one right by me about 100 (mph), that
took care of that idea,'' Buhner said. ``But I knew he had a good
split-finger and he still hadn't thrown one yet. It's not a real
comfortable at-bat being down 0-2, then 1-2 off a guy like that,
especially as hard as he was throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez hit 98 and 99 mph the first three pitches, then threw
another fastball high and outside that Buhner put just over the
right-field fence. Hernandez said he had no intention of giving
Buhner anything but his best pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole dugout knew how I'm coming after them in that
situation,'' Hernandez said. ``I wouldn't change a thing. I got a
fastball up in the zone; he's just a good power hitter, and he beat
me on it. I'd take my chances that way every time. I'd rather get
beat with my No. 1 pitch the opposite way than have him pull a
slider 450 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The blow brought an end to an eight-game road trip in which the
Mariners went 4-4 but, as manager Lou Piniella noted, had a chance
to win every game. Three of the losses came by one or two runs, and
the other was close until the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   The M's never trailed, but they lost the lead twice. Leading
2-0, the Mariners made three errors in the second inning, bringing
home just the second and third unearned runs of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the errors were by third baseman Russ Davis, who bruised
his hand on the first one. Davis told Piniella he might have
problems gripping the bat, and Piniella inserted John Mabry, who
made a pair of sparkling plays. Davis said he did not expect to
miss any time because of the bruise.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners re-gained the lead in the third, when Dan Wilson
singled home a run, then helped another score with heady
baserunning. With Butch Huskey headed for a close play at the plate
on David Bell's two-out single to left, Wilson, who was at first,
kept running. Third baseman Bobby Smith cut off Quinton McCracken's
throw and trapped Wilson in a rundown, allowing Huskey to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``(First base coach) Sammy Mejias told me if it was going to be
close, make sure to get in a rundown,'' Wilson said. ``I thought it
was going to be close enough to where it warranted that. I just
kept going, and they cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays designated hitter Jose Canseco evened things with an
RBI double in the third and a solo homer off Jeff Fassero in the
fifth. But Mariner pitchers allowed only one single after that, and
Buhner took care of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey would not take credit for the assist Buhner revealed
after the game. But Mariners hitting coach Jesse Barfield was
grateful for the extra pair of eyes on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys help each other all the time,'' Barfield said.
``When I played in Toronto, Cito Gaston was the best batting coach
I ever had, but guys like George Bell, Willie Upshaw, Fred McGriff,
Kelly Gruber _ we all knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The batting coach is watching everybody, and that's a lot of
guys to keep track of. You may miss something sometime. That's
where your teammates pick you up. We're all in this thing. I don't
care who gets the credit as long as we get it done.''

KITNA REFINING MIND-READING SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Forgive Jon Kitna if he did not spend a lot of
time Sunday lauding the epic career of John Elway. The Seahawks'
young quarterback does not have the detailed history.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, now that Denver will be without its quarterback,
who is set to announce his retirement this week, Kitna thinks the
AFC West might be a bit more wide open.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a heretical mindset, even if you think Terrell Davis
keeps the Broncos unstoppable. Confidence comes if you are a
Seahawk whose new head coach is already at work installing the
NFL's latest version of Super Bowl juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for me, who finished as the starter here last season,
every other team in the AFC West is going to have a new No. 1
quarterback starting for them this season,'' Kitna said, running
down a list that included Rich Gannon now starting at Oakland, Jim
Harbaugh in at San Diego and Elvis Grbac in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Say anything you want about Bubby Brister as the Bronco's new
No. 1 QB and how Brister went 4-0 in Elway's injured absence last
season. Or about how Mike ``The Mastermind'' Shanahan can get
anyone plugged into his system and make it come out AFC champion.
The Seahawks seem a serious step or two closer to Bronco-like
respectability, thanks to new franchise leader Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   (If Shanahan has been dubbed The Mastermind by Denver
sportswriters, it is time to come up with a title for Holmgren. How
about The Guru? We base that on his ability to get quarterbacks and
offenses to learn and execute his brand of simple-but-complex
formations and plays.)
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, in the event that there is a tilt of power in the
AFC West, the key now is to get Kitna able to execute the Seahawk
offense, which means getting him to start thinking like Holmgren _
a task Holmgren and his staff worked on this past weekend during
the second spring minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon Kitna's biggest goal is going to be to think like the head
coach,'' quarterbacks coach Mike Sheppard said after the Hawks
wrapped up their three-day crash course.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna did some homework on this subject of ``Being Like Mike.''
For Christmas, Kitna's wife gave him a copy of Brett Favre's
autobiography, which detailed the early career of the Green Bay
Super Bowl MVP and Favre's experience with Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they hired (Holmgren,) I thought to myself, `I better
read that book,' '' Kitna said. That turned out to be a good move
because Favre wrote that it took about two years before Holmgren's
thinking and play-calling had infiltrated Favre's cerebral cortex.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna may never do what Favre has done, but the charismatic
Tacoma native certainly gives you reason to hope the football
comparisons are for real. Sheppard said the Hawks' new coaches
believe Kitna need only be ``an efficient quarterback'' for their
system to work.
</P>
<P>
   But as far back as last spring, during Dennis Erickson's
minicamps, Kitna has shown the toughness, leadership, command and
touch of a starting QB. Now, under these suddenly glorious
conditions, he is ravenously hungry for all this Holmgren-esque
synergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of room in this offense for the quarterback to
have some freedom to throw the ball here or throw the ball there,''
Kitna said. ``But when (Holmgren) calls certain plays, he wants us
to think like he does so we know where he wants us to go with the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   After last season, when the Seahawks' offense fell to 23rd in
the league (24th in passing), there is an extra eagerness for the
offense to click again, to establish an identity _ something
brutalized when Erickson and his staff vacillated between
establishing a Ricky Watters-led running game and making the Hawks'
offense a wide-open passing game designed around Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the final day of this minicamp, a cornucopia of
offensive formations were on display. Holmgren clearly has a
penchant for using his tight ends, an area sorely lacking in
Erickson's offense. Now Shannon Sharpe won't be the only AFC West
tight end keeping opposing defenses honest.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren also is using speedster Galloway in passing patterns
that allow him to catch the ball closer to the line and over the
middle, giving Galloway more opportunities to break off long runs
after the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different variations of formations. We may
have six or seven base formations, but there are so many different
alignments off of formations for each play. Guys are never really
lining up in the same spot,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. It's great because it causes problems for the
defenses. They never know when you're coming out of the huddle
which way you're going to line up.''
</P>
<P>
   The variety and potential mismatches and crossing routes are
what will give Holmgren the pieces to play his sideline chess
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the whole thing,'' Kitna said. ``Just
knowing how good of grasp (Holmgren) has on the offense just gives
everyone a sense of calmness. Hey, if this guy calls a play, he
knows it's going to work. We just have to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna is busting to make it all work.

PARENTS SEEK TEST AID, FIRMS RESPOND WITH `STUDY SKILLS' PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The ink is barely dry on the AIMS forms. Students who take the
test this year won't have to pass it to graduate. Yet the phone has
been ringing for weeks at the Sylvan Learning Center in the
Ahwatukee Foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are calling and saying, `The AIMS is coming up . . .
do you have something that will help my kid pass the math?' '' said
Pat Cunningham, director of the private tutoring firm in southeast
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Sylvan doesn't have a specific program to help kids
ace the Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards, better known as
AIMS.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the Kaplan Educational Centers nor the Princeton
Review, Tempe firms that aim to help high schoolers boost scores on
college entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvan does have a $1,000, 30-session high school ``study
skills'' tutoring program that Cunningham says can help improve
grades and raise scores on a number of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   And Princeton and Kaplan have copies of the Arizona Department
of Education's AIMS study guide and expect to use it to develop
specific AIMS prep programs for high schoolers by next year _ when
the first class that has to pass it to graduate takes the test.
</P>
<P>
   State Testing Director Kelly Powell said Arizona has no policy
against programs like Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prep programs can be helpful,'' he said. ``And we wouldn't
want to cut into private enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction,
applauds the programs _ as long as they are based on the state's
1996 academic standards, the basis for the AIMS test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support any model that helps students prepare for AIMS,''
she said. ``I don't agree that `prepping' programs defeat the real
purpose of AIMS. Instead it encourages students to do what they
should be doing, which is learning the standards in reading,
writing and mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   But other educators question the value and ethics of test prep.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for these firms' current programs range from $75 into the
thousands of dollars, depending on the length and intensity of the
preparation that students want.
</P>
<P>
   At such programs, instructors _ who often are moonlighting
certified teachers _ show teens the formats of standardized tests
and coach them about how to best handle questions they aren't
certain how to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If students know what they are supposed to do on these tests
ahead of time they tend to do a lot better than if they just go in
cold,'' said Ben Mauk, executive director of the Princeton Review's
Tempe office.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University West education Professor Tom Haladyna
is one of many testing experts who question the ethics of such
programs. He thinks they can lead to artificially inflated scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public and the students are deceived into thinking real
learning is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schaeffer, spokesman for the Massachusetts non-profit
National Center for Fair and Open Testing, thinks prep programs
``dumb down'' education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not on the test, kids don't learn it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other educators think it's simply unfair that private programs
can give middle-class kids an edge over low-income teens on an
important test like the AIMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can already see the carpetbaggers hawking their wares,''
sighed Bob Welton, testing director for the Bisbee Unified High
School District, who dislikes private prep programs.
</P>
<P>
   To help even the score for low-income kids, some districts are
developing AIMS prep programs of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Reilly, testing director for Mesa public schools, said his
district most likely will have free AIMS prep by next year. &QL;

THE END IS NEAR: ELWAY LIKELY TO RETIRE THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ John Elway entered the NFL not as an icon but
an irritant.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1983, and the brash young quarterback with the howitzer
arm and toothy grin was thumbing his nose at the league.
</P>
<P>
   Select me with the first pick overall in the draft, Elway told
the then Baltimore Colts, and I'll play baseball instead.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's edict forced the Colts to trade the pick to the Denver
Broncos, and the rest, well, it has had a historic impact on the
entire league, not just those two franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen seasons and 51,475 yards later, Elway is all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   A retirement that was anticipated after he led the Broncos to
their first Super Bowl championship 15 months ago and has been
expected since the Broncos defended their title and Elway was named
Super Bowl MVP in January should become official this week.
</P>
<P>
   The usually elusive Elway tipped his hand over the weekend when
he told a Denver TV station, ``I really accomplished everything I
wanted to. There's no real upside to coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost gone, but never forgotten, especially for those who have
played against him and grown to admire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``John made a decision (in 1983) that was best for him, and he
was in a position to execute it. Not everyone has that leverage,''
Seahawks guard Pete Kendall said Sunday after the fifth and final
practice in the team's three-day minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you look at the whole picture of what John has done and
what a good guy he is and what a good player he has been,'' Kendall
said. ``That was an isolated incident where a lot of people thought
he was being petty and stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway apparently has made another decision that is best for him.
This time, no one can blame him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At age 38 and doing what he has done, what does John have to
prove?'' said Seahawks safety Mark Collins, who first played
against Elway in 1986. ``He's won his championships. He's earned
his money. It's time for him to enjoy his family and his
retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway's departure will complete a quarterbacking alchemy in the
AFC West. A division that featured Dan Fouts (Chargers), Jim
Plunkett (Raiders), Bill Kenney (Chiefs), Dave Krieg (Seahawks) and
Elway in the mid-80s will now be armed by Jim Harbaugh (Chargers),
Rich Gannon (Raiders), Elvis Grbac (Chiefs), Jon Kitna (Seahawks)
and Bubby Brister (Broncos).
</P>
<P>
   Transition? Or transgression?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy and accurate to say there never will be another John
Elway, but the league somehow managed to muddle along despite the
retirements of Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana.
Their old clubs not only continued to field teams but won
championships after the departures of the best quarterbacks of
their eras.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are currently doing a multimillion-dollar expansion
and renovation of their headquarters. Not included in the plans is
a place to hang the 1999 AFC West championship banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shift in power?'' Sinclair asked with a laugh. ``First,
you've got to make yourself a contender. I could see it if we were,
say, the 49ers and all of a sudden (Green Bay quarterback Brett)
Favre was out of the picture. But we haven't even established
ourselves as a power.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kendall pointed out, Brister was 4-0 last season when Elway
was out with injuries and actually had a better passer rating
(99.0) than Elway (93.0). Also, Elway might be retiring, but
All-Pro running back Terrell Davis is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver is still a great team,'' Sinclair said. ``Last time I
checked, No. 30 (Davis) is still back there running the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elway has been especially lethal against the Seahawks. He
has more victories (20) and more touchdown passes (44) against them
than any other QB. In the Broncos' 28-21 victory over the Seahawks
in last year's regular-season finale, Elway threw for four TDs. In
a 1985 game at the Kingdome, Elway undressed the Seahawks' defense
for a career-high 432 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, Elway always has driven the Seahawks nuts. And he
always seemed to take a particular delight in beating the team from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember his smile,'' Sinclair said. ``Even if he
makes a mistake, he'll smile and hit himself on the head because he
knows he's going to beat you the next time. So many guys are always
tense out there, but John was a guy who basically smiled after
every play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair, who led the NFL with 16{ sacks last season, cherishes
the times he was able to get to Elway because it was so difficult
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is like Houdini,'' Sinclair said. ``You think you have
him, then you're laying on the ground looking out of one eye as he
fires a 60-yard pass. He's the kind of guy you're glad you got to
play against.''
</P>
<P>
   In a violent game where few ever leave on their own terms, Elway
walks away with nothing left to accomplish or prove. Not to
himself, to his teammates or to those he has tormented over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always marveled at his talent,'' Collins said. ``As with
any great player, you want him to stay around as long as possible.
But you don't want to see that great athlete stay there too long
and erode. I want to remember him as a great athlete, not a guy
who's just hanging on.''

ANGST OVER AIMS: TODAY IS TEST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA L. JONES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an increasingly common complaint among today's
AIMS-anxious.
</P>
<P>
   At the mere mention of the looming state graduation test,
students shriek, ``But I'm a bad test taker!''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include blurred vision, stomach pains, sometimes loss
of sleep and bad dreams, and, of course, a bad test grade.
</P>
<P>
   And today, when high school sophomores take the first of the
controversial new Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards tests,
some of these symptoms will reach their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   But is there really a quantifiable deficiency among so many
students?
</P>
<P>
   Or are students just afraid that their knowledge of English and
algebra is too weak to earn them a diploma under the state's new
standards?
</P>
<P>
   Educators say there is truth in both.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they are truly nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I take tests, I just blank out,'' said Red Mountain High
School sophomore Nahum Cruz. ``The words scramble all over the
place. If they didn't say it was a test, I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Davis, 16, who said he's never been good at tests, said
AIMS could hurt students like him.
</P>
<P>
   Since grade school, he has believed that so long as he shows up
for class and does the work, he'll make it to a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bombed the test, you'd still be OK,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the Class of 2002. Not on this test.
</P>
<P>
   Today, members of the Class of 2001 will answer multiple-choice
questions, write extended answers and essays and be required to
show their work on math problems as they complete the state's
graduation test.
</P>
<P>
   This year the sophomores will guinea-pig the test and need not
worry about a passing grade.
</P>
<P>
   Although their scores will be slapped on their diplomas,
sophomores do not need passing marks on the exam to toss their
mortarboards come 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge has been saved for the Class of 2002, today's
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   They won't take the test until next year, but for them, the
stress is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people can do the work, but when it comes to taking the
test, their brain doesn't connect,'' said Jennifer Zimmerman, 14, a
Chandler High School freshman. ``And the bubbles, the bubbles are
the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All your teachers hype it up, your parents hype it up,'' said
Seth Sweeden, a 15-year-old freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Said freshman Chris Martin, ``I'm nervous because it determines
my whole future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference between typical test anxiety and a
nervousness that keeps you from being able to read, said Maryann
Santos de Barona, associate professor of psychology in education at
Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there are physical symptoms of test anxiety,'' said
Santos de Barona. ``For some individuals, as you might imagine, it
is more severe than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking into hives and experiencing nausea are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nervousness is normal, but some students simply do not test as
well as others, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think historically there have always been individuals who
know a lot more than they can show on a standardized test, and
certainly that is problematic,'' said Santos de Barona.
</P>
<P>
   A prepared student who blanks out and has problems simply
understanding questions might need help from a school counselor,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Special-education students or those with limited English could
have additional problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that you can assume that their level of anxiety is
going to be higher just because some of the other factors are going
to be compounding, such as language,'' she said. ``For limited
English proficiency students, the test becomes a language test more
than a knowledge test.''
</P>
<P>
   Mild learning disabilities that might not qualify a student for
special-education services could still hurt students on such a
test, said Camelback High School counselor Claudia Armer.
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder is
not uncommon on high school campuses in mild forms, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many educators are worried about everybody taking the test,
whether they're special-education students or not.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason, they said, to be nervous for a test for
which passing grades have not been established and the full test
has never been seen by most teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the fear of the unknown,'' said Patricia
Tobin, director of special education for the Phoenix Union High
School District.
</P>
<P>
   If past experience on high-stakes testing is any indication,
antacid could be handled out with No. 2 pencils.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Hoopes, 16, developed stomach pains when she tried her
luck at the ACT last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the test I like totally freaked,'' Hoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Todaro, 16, had a similar experience with another college
entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the PSAT, I like freaked out on the math part,''
Todaro said.
</P>
<P>
   More knowledge of the fledgling test would calm the nerves of
school officials and their students.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler freshman Zimmerman and her friends said they would like
to see the AIMS study guide that has been circulated to sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the tests, many high school sophomores had not
seen the student guides produced by the state Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   In the schools, teachers said they are sharing as much as they
can about a test most of them have not seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we actually see the test, we don't know what degree of
difficulty will be on any given question,'' said Corona del Sol
math teacher Stan Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, students simply need to do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often some of the cause of test anxiety is related to the
fact that students are not prepared, don't know what to expect of a
test, have not covered the material extensively,'' said Santos de
Barona. ``More often than not, that plays a very large role.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, teachers said, there is help.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that is the reason kids go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is you have to have that grounding _ one
year of algebra and one year of geometry,'' said Larry Strom, math
department chairman at Desert Vista High School in Ahwatukee
Foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the grounding, then you panic,'' said Strom,
who helped develop the recommended passing score for the math
portion of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Students not taking the right courses will have problems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are reminding students of some universal testing tips:
</P>
<P>
   Eat a good breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Get a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the test in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A decent attitude helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of saying, `Boy, I'm going to blow this test,' saying,
`I know this material,' '' Santos de Barona said.
</P>
<P>
   Going over the organization of the test is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Simple things like the number of questions, format, organization
and knowledge of who will grade the test can ease a student's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that AIMS is not a timed test also should alleviate
some pressure, educators said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky charms help, too.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Davis wears a lucky necklace.
</P>
<P>
   Nahum Cruz has a lucky coin with Queen Elizabeth on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray,'' said Alfreda Toddy, 16, a Chandler High sophomore.
``It calms me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools are trying to boost kids' confidence, trying to balance
stressing the importance of AIMS and simply stressing students.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Union High School District brought in Intel Corp.
volunteers to talk with sophomores about taking the test seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's message: Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Students were reminded that if they ever want a professional
job, as a doctor, lawyer, engineer or accountant, chances are they
will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, even John F. Kennedy Jr. took three times to pass
the New York State Bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   These students have five chances over three years to pass the
AIMS test.
</P>
<P>
   By the third try, everyone should be a little more comfortable
with AIMS, said Red Mountain counselor Owen Rentschler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll all be a lot wiser a year from now,'' Rentschler
said. &QL;

MCGWIRE'S HAMSTRING TIGHTENS, FORCES HIM OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark McGwire sneezes and the flashes from cameras
are blinding. When he's walked, the stadium boos.
</P>
<P>
   And when McGwire leaves a game in the third inning with an
injury, it's time to gasp and wonder when he'll get the opportunity
to crush another homer.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that last part is possibly Tuesday. Or maybe
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, whose availability was in question when the three-game
series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers
began, is listed as day-to-day again after feeling tightness in his
left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals slugger left Sunday's 6-4 win after the top of the
third inning after scoring from second on Eric Davis' single to
right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just felt kind of a drag, a tightness in his hamstring,''
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``I took him out just in
case.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire leaves Los Angeles the same way he came _ having never
hit a homer in Dodger Stadium. He was 0 for 1 with a walk Sunday,
and finished the series 1 for 9 with five strikeouts. St. Louis is
off today.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sheffield settles in: So much for the worries of Gary
Sheffield moving from right to left field this season. After
struggling early in spring training, Sheffield is comfortable and
has shown he's capable of playing left field for the Dodgers. Look
no further than Sunday when he played Fernando Tatis' line drive
off the wall perfectly and held Tatis to a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to like it,'' Sheffield said of left field. ``I'm
feeling better and I work on it every day. I don't just sit around.
I study the hitters. One thing I learned is that in left field you
have to make a quick decision. It's, `I can play it into a double
or go for it or back off and hold them to a single.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have every angle down. Sometimes I feel I take the
wrong angle. It's just positioning yourself right.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Maddux signs deal: Journeyman right-hander Mike Maddux, 37,
signed a minor-league contract with the Dodgers, then promptly went
out and gave up three runs (two earned) on three hits in an inning
of work with Single-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Dodgers in an interesting situation on what to do
with Maddux. In a bullpen with three rookies, the Dodgers clearly
need help. Maddux could wind up with the club during the upcoming
nine-game road trip, but the outing wasn't what the Dodgers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux hadn't pitched in nearly two weeks, but the Dodgers'
plans for Maddux are evident in that they didn't send him to
Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no promises, no guarantee,'' Malone said. ``What
does he have to do? He has nothing to prove in Albuquerque. We just
needed insurance. We need healthy pitchers. He's insurance in case
someone gets hurt, someone can't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra bases: Barring rain or snow or anything else
unforeseen, Dodgers ace Kevin Brown will face Philadelphia's Curt
Schilling next Sunday. . . . Right-hander Antonio Osuna allowed one
unearned run on two hits in one inning in a rehab stint at San
Bernardino. . . . Cardinals center fielder J.D. Drew left the game
in the bottom of the third with a sprained left thumb, the result
of a collision with Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort at first base.
. . . The crowd of 53,857 was the second straight sellout. The
three-day series drew 154,508, the most for a three-game series at
Dodger Stadium since 159,541 saw the Padres and Dodgers battle
Sept. 27-29, 1996.

PATRIOTS AGAIN HAVE BACKS AGAINST WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Whether it's a rookie orientation or a
mandatory veteran camp, the focus of the Patriots' preseason is
going to be squarely on who will replace Robert Edwards as the
starting running back.
</P>
<P>
   With the weekend rookie orientation over, coach Pete Carroll
acknowledged Sunday there was no ``flag-bearer'' among a trio of
backs who will contend for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was impressed with veteran free agent Lamont Warren and
second-round pick Kevin Faulk, and even threw last year's
sixth-round pick, Harold Shaw, into the mix of backs who could take
the starting job with a strong training camp.
</P>
<P>
   While many Patriots fans may feel unsure about the position,
Carroll says he's not as uneasy about it as he was after the
Patriots lost Curtis Martin last year. The reason? He's been
through having to break in a rookie running back and now feels more
confident that, whether it's Faulk, Warren, Shaw, or a combination
of the three, the Patriots will run the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more comfortable entering this unknown period,'' said
Carroll, who worked with 60 players, including most of the veterans
except for the starting defensive and offensive lines and Ben
Coates, whose wife is having a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the addition of Lamont,'' said Carroll. ``He's fast and
quick and can really catch the football. He's going to help us.
Whether it's as the feature back, I don't know. He'll get the
chance. I know that Kevin is definitely going to contribute. Kevin
is very durable. We had talked last year about Robert's physical
problems in college, and he turned out to be very productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin hasn't had problems a lot. He's been the lead featured
back. I'm not going to put any limits on it right now, how much
he'll wind up carrying the ball. He can run fast and catch the
ball, and shows excellent moves. He's got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said most of the rookies were in ``college shape,''
meaning they were not at the level of many of the veterans, who
have been involved in Johnny Parker's strength program. He said
having the veterans on hand gave the staff and the rookies a good
indication of where the rookies need to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed them their conditioning test to show them how far
they have to come to get to the shape we're expecting,'' Carroll
said. ``We are able to learn their ability to absorb the
information. We spent a lot of individual time with the younger
guys, and we're able to see what they're able to handle. It seemed
good across the board. We don't have any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begin to see how they look in our schemes _ can we plug
them into certain roles? _ and start to formulate an idea of that.
We did a lot of special teams work to determine which guys are
catchers or play some roles on special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious by Carroll's comments that Faulk, Ohio State
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, Kansas State quarterback Michael
Bishop, and Brown receiver Sean Morey were the most impressive
rookies. Both first-round pick center Damien Woody from Boston
College and Baylor offensive tackle Derrick Fletcher have natural
ability but need some work with Jenny Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll continued to gush over Katzenmoyer, a player he
described as ``quiet, trying to absorb everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He made strong first impressions,'' said Carroll. ``He
understands football. He has a knack for learning the game. He's a
physical presence, and it's unusual a large man like that can move
that quickly. He looked well-conditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought Katzenmoyer could step in and start,
Carroll said, ``I think he's taking a lot in right now. We'll have
to see when the time comes. He has to be a great hitter for us, and
if he can run sideline to sideline, he'll threaten to play right
out of the camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said Bishop would stick to quarterback for now but
maybe in time will grow into a ``Slash'' type role. ``Michael is a
quarterback,'' Carroll said. ``It's going to take all of our focus
and attention to get him to understand it. He showed some very good
things. He has a tremendously strong arm; it's gonna be interesting
to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Morey, who is from Marshfield, competed hard. ``He
was a guy who gave us great effort, who laid out for balls, worked
hard on special teams, and hustles,'' said the coach. ``He's going
to give himself a chance to make the team. He can really catch the
football. He has tremendous hands. He has good speed. He also
caught the ball well on kick returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Woody got used to snapping the ball to Drew Bledsoe
in drills before each of three sessions. The coach said it's
important Woody get into camp as soon as possible and learn the
playbook and the calls he needs to make at the center spot if he
intends on starting immediately.

TEEN SHOT BY OFFICER AFTER PROM: HOTEL PARTY WENT OUT OF CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The post-prom party broke up when police knocked on
the hotel room door, but as one student tried to scramble out the
window to avoid being caught past curfew with beer, an officer's
bullet struck his head.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Franco, 18, a junior at Barry Goldwater High School in
north Phoenix, is expected to recover fully from the wound _ the
bullet entered his cheek and lodged near his spinal cord, his
father said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Patrick Brutto, who has been on the Phoenix police force
for three years, told investigators he didn't intend to fire his
gun at the teenager Saturday night. He'll work behind a desk while
the department investigates, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin stuck his head out and the cop shot him. No warning,''
said Adrian Rivera, 16, of Phoenix, who attended the party at
Homewood Suites Hotel at Interstate 17 and Peoria Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Officers showed up at the hotel about 11 p.m. because security
wanted the roomful of teenagers kicked out, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When the two officers knocked at Room 119, they heard the teens
planning to scurry out the ground-floor window, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers went outside to the back of the room where they saw
Franco leaning halfway out. Both officers pulled their guns
thinking that something shiny they saw was a weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   As Brutto drew closer, he realized there was no weapon and
started putting his gun back in its holster, police said. With his
other hand, he tried grabbing Franco, and as he did so, he pulled
the trigger, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is investigating whether Brutto squeezed the
trigger out of a natural reflex to his other hand grabbing
vigorously for Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not say what the shiny object was.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers in the hotel room described a chaotic scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hear any warnings or nothing. A bullet came through
the window and my eye gets cut up,'' said Bryan Zahariades, 19, of
Phoenix, who was sporting a white bandage around his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Justin) fell back in and kids were going crazy,'' said Cara
Graulich, 15, a freshman at Goldwater High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was blood everywhere. Kids thought they got shot
because there was blood on their faces and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cara Graulich and her brother, Corey Graulich, knelt by Justin.
She said she grabbed a pillow and held it to his head. Soon it
became soaked with blood, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cara said her brother was angry and she told him to keep cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `This may be the last chance to talk to him. Calm
down.' So he stayed there, rubbing his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cara said she made sure Justin didn't lose consciousness by
repeatedly asking his name and telling him to focus on her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't talk,'' said Corey Graulich, 17, a junior at
Goldwater. ``He was trying to talk, but couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   An officer came through the window and told everybody to move
back from Justin, Cara Graulich said.
</P>
<P>
   Brutto was a paramedic before he became a police officer and he
tended to Franco until paramedics arrived, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives rounded up the partygoers and interviewed them
through the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers said there was beer in the room. Police said they
also found marijuana. The teenagers said there were about 20 people
at the party.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the hotel told them there were about 50 in the
two-bedroom suite, and that only a dozen remained when officers
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The partygoers kept pressing police for the reason the officer
shot Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them . . . about 20 times and they would never give us
a straight answer,'' Zahariades said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Police Chief Harold Hurtt planned to meet with the
Franco family, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tragedy comes on the heels of too many violent events
involving officers these past weeks,'' Hurtt said in a written
statement. ``Our concern is for Justin to recover quickly and
completely from his injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet lodged right at the teenager's spinal cord, said his
father, Cruz Franco, 47, of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some effects, but we don't know what yet,'' Cruz
Franco said, standing outside John C. Lincoln Hospital &AMP; Health
Center. ``The doctors said if it had been 1 inch over on either
side, I wouldn't have no more son.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Franco, a fullback who wore No. 35 on his football
uniform for the Goldwater Bulldogs, had thoughts of playing for a
college team, but his father said he might not be able to put on
the pads next year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Cruz Franco said his son is strapped to his hospital
bed, a brace holding his neck, his reconstructed jaw wired shut.
Doctors told him not to move.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to smile and open his eyes on command for a doctor,
a promising sign, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be the same, but he'll be all right,'' Cruz
Franco said. ``He's alive.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ Tonight will be telling. Tonight's the night when we find
out who's sicker, the Rockets or the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Until they actually play this almost certain preview of the
postseason's first-round pairing, it seems a wash. Los Angeles
staggers into Houston reeling from a 27-point blowout bashing at
San Antonio. The Lakers have dropped five of seven, leaving them
6-7 in April. The friction and finger-pointing is omnipresent in
their tense, divided locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times' headline Sunday morning: ``Laker Mystique
is Now Mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Sight unseen, Scottie Pippen suggests the Rockets are
in a bigger jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anybody struggling more than we are right
now,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   His case is a strong one. At least the Lakers' sudden slump
could be passed off as the not-unexpected byproduct of a brutal
patch of scheduling, or perhaps a touch of melancholy over the
firing of Dennis Rodman. Regarding the former, five of LA's last
six losses have been inflicted by Portland, Utah and the Spurs, who
stand a combined 64 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the latter ... just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, on the other hand, have suddenly gone due south
against a trio of teams well to the south of them in the standings
(although Phoenix, 7-3 of late, is gaining ground rapidly). And in
their own recent loss to San Antonio, they found a way to succumb
after leading by 23 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   While there isn't necessarily great shame in taking a header
here _ as opposed to going face down consecutively against the,
ouch, Mavericks and the, double ouch, Clippers _ how they did it
was rather shocking. The only thing worse than the Rockets' anemic
71 points of offense _ which equaled their season low _ on dismal
35 percent shooting against a somewhat sorry Suns defense was the
Rockets' own lazy defense.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Phoenix didn't score more than 95 points is
because to do so would have been pointless. The Rockets never
competed. Their final lead _ by one point _ came in the middle of
the first quarter. From there, the Suns gradually left the Rockets
in the desert dust.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rockets appear to be in the midst of a lack-of-heart
attack. As do the Lakers, who have yielded an average of 105 points
over their last seven games with indications of a disintegrating
relationship between Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant becoming more
pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys know the real problem,'' Shaq complained to reporters
recently. ``You're just scared to write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal believes the precocious Bryant's immature, undisciplined
play is the real problem, as opposed to the mess the failed Rodman
experiment left behind. The Rockets, for all their own chemistry
concerns wrought by Pippen's difficulties fitting in, have at least
maintained a united front when questioned about same.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley was asked Sunday to reflect on the internal
discord in LA. He demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my own stuff to worry about,'' Barkley said, refusing
to analyze LA's stuff. ``I don't have time to be worrying about
them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For public consumption, however, the Chuckster went on to insist
he isn't that bothered by what has befallen the Rockets just as
they looked to be on the brink of a major breakout. A shrink would
likely suggest he's in total denial. Also, a straw poll of coach
Rudy Tomjanovich and Barkley's fellow players reveals he's
definitely in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing our jobs,'' Hakeem Olajuwon admitted, his
brow furrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have already backed into the playoffs, securing a
berth when Seattle lost to Utah on Sunday, the Rockets are well
aware they have lost their edge. They are a mediocre 5-8 in April,
which is no way to prepare for May. Asked to explain why this is
happening, Tomjanovich thumped his chest. No, he was not mimicking
the Phoenix gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any fire and fight in us on the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not challenging anybody on defense,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   How the trend can be reversed overnight _ literally _ remains to
be seen. The Lakers will be more rested, having slunk into town
Sunday from San Antonio. And they figure to hold something of a
psychological advantage in light of their 2-0 head-to-head record
vs. the Rockets. A season sweep would leave them a half-game up on
the Rockets in the competition for home-court advantage with nine
days remaining in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Which matters just a bit, because the Rockets haven't won a road
game against a team currently over .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest game of the year,'' Tomjanovich called tonight's
matchup. ``We're fighting for our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important for us, this game,'' Hakeem added. ``It can
be a steppingstone.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, should they lose again, further reduce them to doormat
status.

VARITEK HITS HIS STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-VARITEK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jason Varitek didn't want to talk about his three hits,
or that he had bunted for one of them, or that his two-run double
in the seventh inning was the winning hit in the Red Sox' 3-2
victory over the Indians Sunday at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek says he concentrates on defense first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but discuss his hitting, however. Varitek, after
going 3 for 4, is hitting .333 lifetime against the Indians (6 for
18), with his biggest blow the double down the right-field line
with the bases loaded in the seventh Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a split-finger,'' said Varitek, who connected on a 1-1
count. ``(Bartolo) Colon left it up a little bit, and I was able to
get a good part of the bat on the ball. He was trying to get a
ground ball, and I'm trying to get it somewhere in the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Varitek's bases-loaded hit, the Red Sox were only 3 for
19 this season in such situations. And Varitek had entered Sunday's
outing having gone 0 for 9 in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been facing some quality pitchers and you're not always
swinging at your best in the game. Stats can be thrown out the
window. The game changes every day,'' said Varitek, who has caught
nine of the last 10 games with Scott Hatteberg on the 15-day
disabled list with right elbow inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   On Varitek's bunt single down the third-base line in the fourth
inning, he noticed Indians third baseman Travis Fryman was playing
deep. ``We were getting guys on base with one out, so I figured I
might as well try it with no out, to see if I could get something
started,'' Varitek said. ``Fryman was playing in left-center, so I
figured I had the third-base line.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek is batting just .234, but he's enjoyed being in the
lineup lately. ``It's fun to play every day,'' he said. ``I knew I
can hit, and it's frustrating when things don't go the way you want
them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had 12 hits Sunday in taking the rubber game of the
three-game series. ``It's a good feeling to go out and beat a team
like Cleveland,'' Varitek said. ``We have guys who have hit .300 in
their careers, and we haven't hit .300 (as a team) yet. That will
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played three quality games this weekend. It's just taking
time to get our hitting going a little bit. I think we're on our
way.''
</P>
<P>
   During warmups, Varitek didn't believe Pedro Martinez would
allow just seven hits and strike out 10. ``Pedro didn't have his
best stuff, and that shows you his competitiveness,'' Varitek said.
``If you asked early in the game if he'd pitch a whole game, I'd
say you're crazy, but his competitiveness kept him in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fell behind a lot of hitters, which is unlike him. He just
competed and got them out on 3-2 or 2-2 counts rather than 1-2 or
0-2 counts. I was just trying to (call pitches) to Pedro's strength
and he was able to mix in all four pitches and effectively use the
breaking pitch. I don't think he threw quite as many changeups as
he has in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek tried to keep the Indians hitters off balance, and it's
helped that he's seen them a lot over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   But ``that's Pedro's pitching,'' too, the catcher said.

CHINA MAKES STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN-CHINA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They've been saying that the road to
Pasadena, and the World Cup final in July, won't be any fast-lane
cruise. And now the US women's soccer team knows it for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a disappointing loss,'' coach Tony DiCicco
said Sunday, after China had handed the Americans a 2-1 defeat on
Zhang Ouying's goal four minutes into added time at Giants Stadium
and ended their 50-match unbeaten streak on home soil. ``But China
right now is the best they've been since I've been with the
national team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time the Chinese had beaten the Yanks in their
last three meetings and it was a fitting turnabout for Thursday's
finish in Hershey, Pa., where the United States won by the same
score on Tisha Venturini's goal in the 94th minute.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Ouying, an 82d-minute substitute, who caught
the Americans' back line flat-footed with their attackers pressing
upfield and blasted the winner past keeper Briana Scurry from just
past the penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sending everyone forward like we were losing,'' said
DiCicco. ``This team thinks a tie is a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese had been playing for a tie on Thursday when
Venturini stung them on a rebound off a Mia Hamm cross. Since they
won't have another shot at the United States before the Cup final,
the Chinese wanted badly to lay a parting trump card on the hosts
in their ongoing head game.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first 10 minutes Sunday, the Americans toyed with
their guests like they do with most of the world's teams, setting
up housekeeping in the Chinese half and creating a couple of
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Then Michelle Akers, still a midfield mainspring after 14 years
and 135 caps, rolled an ankle and came off the pitch for four
minutes and her teammates lost their rhythm. Just after Akers
returned, Sun Wen, who scored China's goal in Hershey, took a ball
from Liu Ailing off a restart, blew into the US area and roofed the
ball over Scurry in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the second half, after the Chinese had nearly
gone up, 2-0, on a Sun boomer that Scurry deflected off the
crossbar, that the Americans regained their balance and drew even
on a goal by midfielder Julie Foudy off a Cindy Parlow feed in the
58th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lucky deflection,'' said Foudy. ``That's what happens
when you have that many bodies in the area. The keeper was off her
line and I snuck it by her.''
</P>
<P>
   So it came down to added time again, with Venturini coming off
the bench again in the 90th minute looking to stick in the dagger.
``She almost did it, didn't she?'', said DiCicco, after Chinese
keeper Gao Hong tipped Venturini's header off Hamm's free kick over
the bar.
</P>
<P>
   So determined were they to pull out the victory that the
Americans forgot about preserving a draw and the domestic streak
that had created an aura of invincibility around them. Zhang, who
had played only 23 international matches and only scored two goals,
dashed past defenders Carla Overbeck and Christie Pearce as referee
Kari Seitz was considering the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, the hosts were left shaking their heads, hands on
hips as the Chinese leapt and wept for joy, then bolted from the
stadium without bothering to shower. After seven weeks on the road,
they just wanted a ``W'' and an exit visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned from this is, anything can happen,'' said
Kristine Lilly. ``We have to remember it's a 90-minute game.''

REVOLUTION HAVE REVERSED FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution struggled to establish an
identity in their first three years. Losing became a habit and
fatalism a doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Revolution seem to be reversing those trends. Their 3-2
win over D.C. United Saturday gave them five successive games
without a defeat over 90 minutes, the best regulation-time record
in the Eastern Conference. Officially, the Revolution are 2-3, with
all three defeats in the shootout, but even this shows significant
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three-plus years of Major League Soccer, the
Revolution had failed to win at RFK Stadium and had not defeated
D.C. United in regulation time in 12 matches.
</P>
<P>
   This victory was the result of the Revolution's positive
mindset, combined with a weakened United team, which lost defensive
midfielder Richie Williams (ankle sprain) and no longer has John
Harkes (now with the Revolution), Tony Sanneh (Hertha Berlin), or
the team's creator and inspiring force, Bruce Arena, who has been
replaced by Thomas Rongen as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Most encouraging, though, was the Revolution's transformation
into a possession team, with nearly every player suddenly
comfortable on the ball and willing and able to string together
passes in midfield, at least during the first half, when they took
a 3-1 advantage. They might have been taking the example of D.C.
United, which normally control games by turning their ball-control
game in swift attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution players credited the change in tactical mindset
to their work in practice under the direction of Giuseppe
Galderisi, who recently joined player-coach Walter Zenga as an
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   If this continues, it indeed will be a revelation for a team
that seldom had displayed such awareness and skill in its first 100
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a great game for the first 45 minutes,'' Joe-Max
Moore said. ``That was because of our ability to keep the ball in
midfield. When you can stay composed on the ball, it makes a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be far less tendency to panic than in the
previous week, when midfielder Edwin Gorter complained vociferously
about the Revolution's unwillingness to keep the ball on the
ground. Ironically, Gorter missed the United game because of a
stomach virus, but Jair and Kris Kelderman set the tone in the
central midfield, the Moore-Giovanni Savarese strike combination
was effective, and Ivan McKinley provided two goals from the left
side of midfield. The coherency of play became contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter is never overly critical about mistakes,'' Moore said,
``especially in the attacking third. He wants us to be smart. If we
keep the ball moving, we'll find holes in the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution survived the last three weeks, playing twice
against two-time MLS Cup champions United, plus the Columbus Crew.
The situation could become complicated now, as Gorter, Imad Baba
(groin), and Harkes (right knee ligament) are scheduled to return.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is available, they will be part of an evolution toward
the style of play of Galderisi and Zenga, who bring more than 30
years of experience, combined, in Italy's top divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mentality is different,'' Zenga said. ``But if we mix it
with the USA mentality, maybe we will arrive at the top level.''

ALLISON'S WINNING FORMULA SELF-EVIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ The Greensboro Coliseum ice was as smooth as
giblet gravy and the Hurricanes were on them like a nagging spouse
and the hotel housecleaning staff forgot to leave mints under their
pillows . . .
</P>
<P>
   Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison readily acknowledged that the Bruins lacked a
smoking gun on Tobacco Road as they split the first two games of
their best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal playoff series.
But he would tolerate no alibis involving the conditions, the
opponent, or the venue. The Boston offense's problems, he believes,
were self-generated.
</P>
<P>
   And as the team's scoring leader the past two seasons, the
23-year-old center realizes that, rightly or wrongly, much of the
burden to produce falls on him. He did contribute an assist in each
game as the Bruins won the opener, 2-0, before suffering a
deflating 3-2 overtime loss Saturday night. But he knows that
something's not quite right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get frustrated when things don't go well because of
something I'm not doing,'' he said Sunday at Ristuccia Center,
where the Bruins held an optional practice on the eve of Game 3 at
the FleetCenter. ``I've got to get in the flow better.''
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly alone, as coach Pat Burns emphasized. ``The
difference is that their forwards are skating and ours aren't,'' he
said, exempting only Rob DiMaio and Landon Wilson from culpability.
``They've got to skate, not just stand around. They've got to skate
the way Keith Primeau is skating, the way Ray Sheppard is
skating.''
</P>
<P>
   While Burns was giving the Hurricanes deserved credit, Allison
feels the Bruins were extending their hosts too much of it. ``They
came out hard and we kind of panicked,'' he said. ``We started
throwing the puck off the glass, dumping it. We've got to relax,
pass the puck three or four times if that's what they give us. It's
one of those things where Carolina is coming at us and we say, `We
don't want to let them score,' instead of saying, `What can I do to
put us in better position?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were rarely in position to do much damage against
Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe. But while their lack of finishing
touch is being generally decried, Allison believes the problem is
at the other end of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind not scoring,'' he said. ``We can't get anything
started when we're throwing the puck around like that. I think some
days we go out there almost scared, scared to lose. We're still a
young, inexperienced team as far as the playoffs go. Maybe we were
a little jittery the first two games. In their building, with the
ice so bad, it was as if we didn't want to make a mistake, give up
a goal, so we'd just dump the puck. We were always wanting to do
the safe thing, worried about them scoring instead of us attacking
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the trick, of course: transferring the concern to the
other guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to move the puck, make the passes,'' said Allison.
``Then they say, `Oh no, here come the Bruins.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bruins left North Carolina in good shape, having
seized the home-ice advantage from the Hurricanes. ``If you go on
the road and you're 1-1,'' said Allison, ``you're not
disappointed.'' The flip side in this case was that a Carolina
sweep was well within the Bruins' grasp until they squandered a 2-1
lead Saturday on Robert Kron's goal with 5:32 left in regulation
before being done in by Sheppard's second score of the night at
17:05 of OT. ``When you have the lead with six minutes left in
regulation and lose,'' said Allison, ``we're disappointed we lost
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Allison is more determined than daunted. If anything, he
believes that excess adrenaline, not nerves, betrayed him in
Greensboro _ ``I think I might have been overexcited, wired, in the
first game,'' he said _ and he's over that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little better in the second half of yesterday's
game,'' said Allison. ``I was in the flow better. I know I have to
play better, I can play better, and I will play better. I'm not
worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been too much of that already.

ARIZONA THEATRE CO.'S `GERSHWIN'S FASCINATING RHYTHMS' REACHES
BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Ira Goldstein is putting on weight. Not
physically. The artistic director of Arizona Theatre Company is
swelling with pride as he stands in front of the Longacre Theatre,
a landmark of Manhattan's theater district since 1913.
</P>
<P>
   On the stucco wall in front of him is a poster for ``The
Gershwins' Fascinating'' ``Rhythm.'' Its flashy graphics haven't
caught Goldstein's eye. He's wrapped up in the fine print. One
incomplete sentence in particular has set his pulse racing:
``Subsequent development production at Arizona Theatre Company.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the theater company's name has appeared on a
Broadway poster. Every troupe dreams of transferring a show from
its stage to New York, the center of the theater world. Goldstein's
company has done it.
</P>
<P>
   History of another sort is being made here. Not only is this
ATC's New York debut, it marks the first time a show has gone
directly from Phoenix to the Great White Way. It is a validation of
the Valley's cultural coming of age, one more indication that local
arts groups are transforming themselves into world-class
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 ATC supporters from Phoenix and Tucson flew into New
York for Sunday's gala opening. Caught up in the excitement of
having one of their own on Broadway, the Arizonans were in a mood
to party, and had no trouble satiating their desire.
</P>
<P>
   Two events were on everyone's list: a pre-show brunch at the
Park Avenue apartment of Selma and Walter Kaye, parents of ATC
board member Joan Biegle-Kaye, and a post-show celebration at the
glamorously chic Emporio Armani boutique on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who arrived Saturday to see the revue's final
preview, isn't thinking of parties as he pulls his overcoat around
him.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is typical of New York in the spring: 48 degrees and
rain drizzling from an overcast sky. A stiff wind is blowing in
from Times Square, a couple of blocks away. It's a chilly welcome
to a guy just off the plane from Phoenix, but, to borrow a song
title from the revue's score, ``Who Cares''?
</P>
<P>
   On his way here, he passed the Brooks Atkinson Theatre where,
last night, Kevin Spacey stood at the stage door, signing
autographs after the four-hour marathon of ``The Iceman Cometh.'' A
few hours before, at the Barrymore Theatre, Dame Judi Dench,
Academy Award winner for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' stepped out of a
limousine on her way backstage for a performance of ``Amy's View''.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein waves his hand in the direction of those theaters,
starts to say something, then just shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a college basketball team, this would be the finals
of the NCAA Tournament,'' he says, finally. ``It means we're going
to be able to do even better theater in Phoenix, because we're
going to be able to recruit better players. People in the business
now know that good and important work is being done at our company.
Already, I'm hearing from playwrights, producers and actors about
projects they would like to bring to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the theater on Saturday, it's the eye of the hurricane.
An eerie calm prevails. For the past several weeks, the winds of
change have been howling. The revue, built around 27 tunes by the
legendary team of songwriting siblings, George and Ira Gershwin,
has been undergoing constant tweaking as director Mark Lamos,
choreographer David Marques and their creative team fine-tune the
production for New York audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Ramirez is one of five members of the Phoenix cast to be
featured in the New York production. (The others are Chris Ghelfi,
Brian J. Marcum, Karen Lifshey and Jill Nicklaus.)
</P>
<P>
   The actress seems remarkably composed for someone who's being
bandied about as a potential Tony Award nominee. Doesn't she feel
the pressure? She shrugs off the question. She made her Broadway
debut in Paul Simon's ``The Capeman,'' which flopped. She knows how
dumb it is to fall victim to what she calls the ``snow job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to get wrapped up in the critics and the hype and
the press and the stress _ this is Broadway, after all, and if
you're a theater person, you can't help but feel the strain. For
us, this is it, this is Mecca,'' she says, stopping to catch her
breath after climbing the precipitous stairs to her dressing room
on the upper floors of the Longacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's all going to come down on me Sunday. Right now, I'm
just trying to relax and have a fun time and remember why I do
this. New York is the pinnacle, I have to say that, but Phoenix was
great, too. The truth is, just as long as I'm onstage somewhere,
I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Previews of ``Rhythm'' did well in the Big Apple, which delights
Goldstein since ATC participates in any profits. On Friday, only a
dozen or so seats were available, and the preview audience rewarded
the performers with constant laughter and applause. Two people
jumped to their feet at the finale. Actor Michael Berresse, one of
the new additions to the cast, grinned at them and gave them a
little bow. Friends, maybe. The rest of the audience applauded
enthusiastically but didn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez isn't surprised: ``New York audiences are harder to
please,'' she says. ``You don't see them out of their seats as
often. We were pampered in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences at the Herberger were particularly demonstrative, she
recalls nostalgically. Which is not to say everyone in Phoenix
embraced ``The Gershwins''' ``Fascinating Rhythm'' with the same
fervor. Some found it too sexual, too blatant in its references to
contemporary relationships and issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Longacre crowd seems comfortable with Lamos' efforts to
bring the composers into the new millennium. The sharp intakes of
breath that greeted the lesbian duet, ``Isn't It A Pity,'' at the
Herberger are missing. ``They Can't'' ``Take That Away From Me,''
with its overtones of grief for those lost to AIDS, is received in
an almost reverential silence. In the reflected glow of lighting
designer Peggy Eisenhauer's lights, tears can be seen coursing down
several cheeks. New York has been hard-hit by the plague. It is a
city of remembered deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been an attempt to cater to the conservative eye,
but then, again, we want to make audiences happy,'' Ramirez says.
``We've reined in some of the ideas a little _ toned some things
down after Phoenix. It's still sexy, and I like to think, hip. It
certainly is not your traditional musical. That's a response to the
changing New York audience. Shows like ``Rent'' and ``Bring in
'Da'' ``Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk'' have created new expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' has raised the
artistic bar in Phoenix. Valley theatergoers have a tendency to
believe that if it's in New York, or from New York, it's superior,
says Rusty Foley, director of corporate affairs for Salt River
Project, during Sunday's brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to change. This show proves that the best of
Phoenix theater can hold its own with theater anywhere. Even more
importantly, its commercial success at the Herberger means that
when Valley arts groups do exceptional work, it will be
recognized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, everyone gathers at the Armani boutique to
air-kiss and make merry while gawking at the cast and celebrities
like playwright Terrence McNally and supermodel Reni. The reviews
from the ``New York Times'' and the other Big Apple media fail to
arrive by press time, but a grinning Goldstein isn't in any hurry
to read them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they love it,'' he says, ``but this has been one of the
greatest experiences of my career. Let me steal something from the
Gershwin brothers. Whatever the critics say, they can't take that
away from me.'' &QL;

WILSON HAS BIG IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ He is a player they had banked on. He is a
guy they had hoped somehow would reach his potential at a critical
time. He was Toronto's second pick in 1993, then traded to Quebec,
then Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins dealt for him Nov. 22, 1996, in a trade with
Colorado (where the Nordiques moved), they were hoping
6-foot-2-inch, 216-pound Landon Wilson, now 24, would make a big
difference.
</P>
<P>
   After a career of fits and starts, when management wasn't sure
if it had done the right thing by trading its No. 1 pick for
Wilson, he did make a difference in Game 2 against the Carolina
Hurricanes Saturday night. Despite Boston's loss, coach Pat Burns
talked about Wilson, a player he seemed to have a hard time warming
up to, as the Bruins' best forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our best forward, by far,'' said Burns. ``He and Robbie
DiMaio were uncontestedly our two best forwards. If he plays like
that, he'll play. That's what I told him.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who throws around compliments like manhole covers, said
he felt it was a measure of maturity. ``It takes a while for young
players to realize that,'' said Burns. ``He's a big, strong kid and
if he wants to play that way, he's going to play. The only
difference between us and their forwards was they were skating and
ours weren't. That's the only difference. Our forwards have to be
skating. We were sort of waiting for something to happen instead of
going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he is hoping to take advantage of the most recent
opportunity. ``I was playing with Sergei Samsonov and Dmitri
Khristich and Joe Thornton and Shawn Bates and Kenny Belanger,'' he
said. ``When you go out there, you've got to be physical because
it's playoff hockey, get your nose dirty. Go to the net hard and
work as hard as you can, just banging away.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to have been a hard lesson for Wilson to learn, but
like Thornton before him, it might be that Wilson is finally
getting it. He thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing hockey,'' he said. ``Anything I can do to help
the team, I'm going to try. I just feel like I have more confidence
over the last couple of weeks. That one game I played with Sammy
and Joe in Buffalo, that was the starting point there. I felt
strong after that. I felt confident that I know I can play at this
level. I want to prove that when I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was a focal point of the Bruins' attack in Game 2,
whereas in previous games he was more of a role player, given more
to spot duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen that much ice time since that Buffalo game,''
said Wilson, referring to the game just shy of the end of the
regular season. ``I understand my position on the team: I'm a
fourth-liner and whatever happens happens. But if I have an
opportunity to play as much as that, I'm going to make the most of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he has met with the coaching staff and understands
what it expects. He said Burns knows when a player is on his game.
``I think the whole coaching staff does,'' said Wilson. ``When guys
have it, they usually stay with them. You've just got to be
focused. When I first got called up, I was only playing a little
bit, and that's very tough on your confidence. Mentally, it's
really kind of devastating because you're expecting to play but you
know you've just got to accept your role. The role I was in was
that of a fourth-line player _ keep it simple, get the puck in or
out. I'm not satisfied. I want to continue to stay here and play
well here.''

RICHMOND A WIZENED WIZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He adorns the cover of this year's Wizards media guide,
supposedly a symbol that times have changed for him and for the
franchise. Mitch Richmond may now be with Washington instead of
Sacramento, but that is not the change he'd hoped for in his
basketball life.
</P>
<P>
   With another season winding down, the soon-to-be 34-year-old
guard and his team are in a very familiar spot: out of the playoffs
and in a lather.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way, not this time. That's what
Richmond thought when he was liberated from the drudgery that was
Sacramento. He had had one four-game playoff experience with the
Kings. That was it. Washington, with Rod Strickland as a running
mate, was supposed to change all that.
</P>
<P>
   You know by now that things are worse in Washington than they
are in Sacramento. The Kings totally have rebuilt themselves and
may well make the playoffs with a dynamic, running team that has
one missing piece: a quality shooting guard. Washington? The
Wizards were a flat-out disgrace Sunday at the FleetCenter,
submitting a pathetic effort that resulted, not surprisingly, in a
113-84 loss to the Celtics. They're going to a very familiar place:
Secaucus for the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond was as guilty as anyone; he had a Rotisserie League 18
points in 35 minutes but basically went through the motions like
everyone else in blue. He wasn't pointing fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose, you point at a lot of things,'' he said.
``That's why you don't try to lose too much. We're all sulking.
It's a difficult time. We just gotta play, including myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through periods like this, it's easy to hang your
head. I think I've been at fault for some of that, hanging my head,
getting down. A lot of guys have. We know it's a tough time. We're
out of the playoffs, and these losses add up. It gets to you. I've
been through a lot of them; it's a hard period. You see a lot of
negativity going on. Hopefully, we can try to pick it up. That's
all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   As an NBA fan, there's a part of you that feels a little for
Richmond and his plight, forgiving the occasional pig-like
performance he's been known to submit. He deserves better. It was
difficult to listen to him try to explain away a totally
humiliating experience. In between sighs and a lot of head-shaking
_ at one point, he blurted, ``I don't know, man, ask me some
questions'' _ he owned up to being utterly exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating, because my expectations were a lot
higher than what's happening now,'' he said. ``It's a tough time, a
tough period. I never thought anything like this would happen to
this team. We're going through a real difficult period. It's really
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond doesn't have a lot of quality time left; his hoop
biological clock is ticking. His career has been one of individual
excellence (1996 gold medal from Atlanta, six-time All-Star,
five-time All-NBA) but lacking in the one area where the great ones
measure themselves against the others: team success. His four-game
playoff series with the Kings in 1996 represents his only
postseason appearance since 1991, when he was with the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   He's a free agent at the end of this season and he will have a
couple choices: Take the money and stay, or go elsewhere for less
and be on a contender. Washington would like to think it could be a
contender and, having traded Chris Webber for Richmond, will do all
it can to make its argument. But we know better. The Wizards have
been in one playoff series this decade _ as the No. 8 seed two
years ago, losing, 3-0, to Chicago _ and haven't won a playoff game
since May 4, 1988, or a seven-game playoff series since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't hear Richmond say he was going to stick around and
see this one through, albeit with a fatter wallet. That, in itself,
could be a signal. But he also didn't say that he's fed up with
what he's seen, which would have been understandable given the way
the Wizards are mailing in the season; Sunday was their fifth
straight loss, the last two by 19 and 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to wait until the end of the season to make a
decision,'' he said. ``I didn't want to make my decision the first
game I played here, and I don't want to make it now. I'll look at
the alternatives, weigh everything, and see what's best for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is look at the playoff elite and see how many
of them lack what Richmond provides: San Antonio, the Lakers,
Miami, Houston, even Utah with a hobbling Jeff Hornacek. All could
use help at shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   That's the dilemma that Richmond soon will face. For all of
these players, basketball at one time in their life was a sport. It
was about playing and winning and nothing else. Richmond finally
has a choice for the first _ and last _ time in his career: How do
I want to go out?
</P>
<P>
   Based on what he and we saw Sunday, it's hard to imagine him
adorning the cover of the Wizards media guide for the 1999-2000
season.

`MATRIX' LARGER THAN `LIFE' AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Science-fiction blockbuster ``The Matrix''
continued to dazzle moviegoers as it led at the nation's
multiplexes for the third time in four weekends with an impressive
$12.9 million at 2,903 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros. release, highlighted by never-before-seen
special effects amid a computer-controlled reality, has hit $117.4
million in 26 days and is headed toward becoming the biggest box
office success since ``A Bug's Life,'' which went past $162
million. ``The Matrix'' is already the 121st-highest domestic
grosser ever, passing ``Die Hard 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's winner, Eddie Murphy's prison-comedy ``Life,''
captured second with a still-solid $11.6 million at 2,598 theaters
despite losing 43 percent from its opening. The Universal/Imagine
release has gone past $37 million in 10 days and could wind up with
$70 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The only other solid performance came from 20th Century Fox's
third weekend of Drew Barrymore's romantic comedy ``Never Been
Kissed'' with $6.2 million at 2,495 sites to push its 17-day total
past $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight weekend, the same three films accounted
for nearly half of all tickets sold. The strong returns for
holdovers contrasted sharply with lukewarm openings for new
releases with Fox's ``Pushing Tin,'' a drama focused on New Jersey
air traffic controllers, finishing a distant fourth with $3.6
million at 1,283 theaters to top Warner's eighth weekend of
``Analyze This'' with $3.2 million at 2,130 locations. Warner's
``Lost &AMP; Found,'' a romantic comedy with David Spade in an
unaccustomed leading role, followed in sixth with a disappointing
$3.1 million at 2,469 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, said the weekend's results underscored Hollywood's ongoing
need for star power and product aimed at teen and young adult
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to have an A-list actor to succeed when there
are so many star-driven films in the market,'' Bucksbaum said.
``Movies that are oriented toward teen-agers are also holding up
well.'' He predicted ``Pushing Tin,'' which received generally
strong reviews, could take in $25 million overall but saw a dim
future for ``Lost &AMP; Found'' with a final gross of no more than $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Though overall business totaled an unimpressive $65 million,
that was slightly ahead of the same weekend last year when ``The
Big Hit'' opened with $10.8 million. Movie analyst Arthur Rockwell
said the results were predictable and noted that late April tends
to be a slow moviegoing period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time when studios hold back a little bit because there
usually are good pictures already out and more good pictures coming
in May,'' Rockwell added. In this case, Fox should generate solid
business next weekend from the opening of action-thriller
``Entrapment,'' with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, while
Universal could see break-out returns from ``The Mummy'' on May 7,
12 days before ``Star Wars Episode' 1: The Phantom Menace'' begins
its expected obliteration of box office records.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date grosses have reached $1.7 billion and trail 1998's
by about 5 percent due to ``Titanic's'' success last year.
</P>
<P>
   Holdover comedies rounded out the rest of the top 10, led by
Disney's fourth weekend of ``10 Things I Hate About You'' in
seventh with $2.7 million at 2,235 theaters, followed by
Paramount's fourth weekend of ``The Out-of-Towners'' with $2.03
million at 2,128 theaters, Sony's third weekend of ``Go'' with
$1.96 million at 1,563 locations and DreamWorks' sixth weekend of
``Forces of Nature'' with $1.7 million at 1,950 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   October Films' fourth weekend of ``Cookie's Fortune'' followed
with $1.3 million at 559 sites, edging Miramax's 20th weekend of
``Shakespeare in Love'' with $1.28 million at 1,181 theaters.
``Shakespeare,'' with seven Academy Awards including Best Picture,
has totaled $91.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's ``Life Is Beautiful'' came in 13th with $1.19 million
at 1,019 theaters as the Italian-language favorite hit $51.8
million after 27 weeks of U.S. release. Less impressive was the
studio's opening of offbeat sci-fi thriller ``eXistenZ'' with
$800,000 at 256 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount generated solid returns from its limited opening of
``Election,'' a well-reviewed comedy set at an Omaha high school,
with $120,000 at six theaters in Los Angeles and New York.
Bucksbaum said the studio had made a sensible decision to open the
film slowly since it may appeal more to adults than teen-agers.

TEEN-AGE SUSPECTS SIGNALED VIOLENCE TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON and JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Something in Dylan Klebold's voice had
spooked his mother that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goodbye had an edge to it,'' the mother, Susan Klebold,
told a family pastor, describing her son's tone last Tuesday
morning as ``almost fatalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought, maybe he's in a bad mood,'' the Rev. Don
Marxhausen said. ``Maybe he's got a test today or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan's father, Thomas Klebold, 52, a former geophysicist who
runs a mortgage business from his house, told the pastor he had
detected ``this slight tension'' in his son a few days before the
attack. Klebold made a mental note of it and thought he would get
back to it, the pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold never did. On Tuesday, Dylan Klebold, 17, and his best
friend, Eric Harris, 18, ambushed their classmates and teachers at
Columbine High School with a storm of gunfire and pipe bombs,
taking 13 lives before fatally shooting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As new details of the young men's behavior come to light, there
is an emerging portrait of their friendship and of their
relationship with their families. It is a portrait that remains as
puzzling as their attack on their school.
</P>
<P>
   Many students in the school have described the young men as
being obsessed with Nazi history, and the police now say that the
two planned the attack for Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But Klebold is the great-grandson of a prominent Jewish
philanthropist. His father is Lutheran, and for a time the family
attended a church. At Passover this year, the Klebolds had a seder,
Marxhausen said, and Dylan Klebold asked the traditional four
questions at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances of the gunmen have said they detested athletes
because of the way they were treated by them. But Klebold played in
a baseball fantasy league, a game in which participants form teams
of Major League players and compete based on the players' actual
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of the Boston Red Sox, he was one of a dozen students who
took part recently in a fantasy baseball draft party, said one of
the participants.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent display of his penchant for slurs, Klebold called
his team the Border Hoppers and chose the Taco Bell logo as his
team symbol.
</P>
<P>
   While Klebold, 6-foot-4 and lanky, was often outgoing, Harris
was much quieter. Other students say Harris often scowled in
response to a greeting.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times, Marxhausen said
Klebold's parents described Harris as having an ``incredibly strong
personality with a lot of rage.''
</P>
<P>
   A former teammate of Harris' in youth baseball when the family
lived in Plattsburgh, N.Y., said young Eric lacked self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really like baseball a lot but said his dad pushed
him to play Little League because every kid in Plattsburgh played
it,'' said the former teammate, Brendon LaPier. ``He was the kind
of kid who didn't mind being alone, and he spent a lot of time in
the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harris family also lived for a time in Oscada, Mich. The
Rev. William Stone, a neighbor there, said he recalled the father,
Wayne Harris, putting up a basketball backboard in the driveway and
playing ball with Eric and his brother, Kevin, who is two years
older. Kevin would go on to play football for the Rebels of
Columbine High. He was seen as popular with the athletic crowd,
``just the kind of guy his brother was gunning for,'' said Steve
Berg, a classmate of the elder Harris brother.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said that the Harris family ``cared for each other'' and
that the parents ``seemed to enjoy their children.''
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the Harris family lives in a newer two-story house
at the end of a cul-de-sac. The Klebold home is much grander, a
sleek glass-and-cedar house that backs up to the spectacular Dear
Creek Canyon. The Klebolds also have a carriage house that they
rent out.
</P>
<P>
   Marxhausen said the Klebolds had bought the house for a low
price and fixed it up.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of both boys, described by friends as decent and
caring people from stable homes, have issued statements of sympathy
over the attack. But the authorities have come to the conclusion
that the parents should have had some idea of what was going on in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John P. Stone of Jefferson County said on Saturday that
the sawed-off barrel of a shotgun and bomb-making materials were
``clearly visible'' in the bedroom of one of the young gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the weapons were in places where stuffed
animals might be found in the bedrooms of other teen-agers. ``The
parents should have known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marxhausen, one of the clergymen who conducted a private funeral
for Klebold on Saturday, said the young man's father told him he
``felt Dylan was his soul mate, and felt that he knew what was
going on all the time.'' The pastor said Klebold had told him, ```I
thought I was ready to let him go _ he was a finished product.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marxhausen said Klebold was not a ``gun man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've just got a BB gun to shoot the woodpeckers.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before the shootings, Mr. and Mrs. Klebold had mailed a
deposit for their son's dormitory room at the University of
Arizona, where they believed he planned to enroll in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the diary found by the police shows that the two young men
expected to die in the attack they had been plotting for a year, an
act of revenge on the popular crowd they blamed for making them
feel like outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Most young people who knew Klebold and Harris were shocked at
the shootings. But some friends said they had heard Klebold and
Harris comment about blowing up the school.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend before the shootings, neighbors said the two
young men had made such a ruckus smashing glass in the Harris
garage _ making shrapnel for bombs, residents now suspect _ that
the noise disturbed children playing in the nearby cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think you'd be aware that kids are building
bombs in your house,'' said Debbie Wilder, who lives a few doors
from the Harrises.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were fond of role-playing games
and the violent computer games Doom and Quake. They listened to
German techno-rock, music tinged with sadomasochism. They were
arrested last year for breaking into a car to steal tools, and were
placed in a diversion program for juveniles, where they earned high
marks in an evaluation for being bright and cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   But these young men were also good students with jobs, who had
caused no problems for school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lau, who owns the Blackjack Pizza franchise where
the young men worked three to five nights a week, said they always
showed up on time and worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking for answers and looking for answers,'' Lau
said. ``There's no clear answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Valentine, who runs a computer store in Littleton, said
Klebold had applied for a job, sending a resume that claimed he
``built my personal computer and helped build those of friends and
family.'' He said he offered the young man a job _ ``He has all the
right stuff to be a technician'' _ but that Klebold did not show up
on the day he was supposed to start work.
</P>
<P>
   Marxhausen said that the Klebolds came to his church about five
years ago for about nine months. ``It didn't work for them,'' he
said. ``They just didn't get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the families in his church is close to the Klebolds, so
Marxhausen told them to let the Klebolds know he would conduct the
funeral if they wanted. The Klebolds called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them how they were doing. They used the word
`devastated,''' the pastor said. ``I didn't want to ask them any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the funeral home, he first saw Mr. Klebold,
who seemed to say, simply, ``This was not my son. What you see in
the papers was not my son,'' Marxhausen said. Mrs. Klebold, he
said, ``just fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   She was ``sobbing for about a minute and a half in my arms,
which is a long time,'' the pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started to come. I felt this terrible need not to have
a service but to talk,'' he said. So he shut the door to the wake
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this one couple, they just poured out their hearts,
they loved Dylan,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The dead youth's brother sat between the parents and was mostly
quiet, Marxhausen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finally just said, `I want to thank you all for being here
today for my parents and myself. I love my brother.''

ISLAMIC RELIEF RAISING FUNDS FOR KOSOVARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Phone number and address for donations is at end of
story.) 
By DONNA HUFFAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The circles under Anwar Khan's eyes reflect
the human suffering he's seen in Albania and the endless hours he
has spent working to help Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising coordinator for Islamic Relief in Burbank,
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, Khan recently returned from
Albania and now works around the clock soliciting donations for
food, tents and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Islamic Relief has raised about $425,000 to
help refugees who were forced from their homes by Serbian soldiers,
Khan said. A dinner on April 18, hosted by the international
organization and Islamic Shura Council of Southern California,
brought in $300,000, Khan said. The money has been sent to the
group's Albanian office.
</P>
<P>
   At Islamic Relief's Burbank headquarters, Khan, 27, talked about
the oppression and chaos he captured on videotape and described how
the magnitude of the tragedy outweighed what he has seen in Bosnia,
Iraq and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of thousands of people are in complete misery. Truck
after truck, convoy after convoy, the people just kept coming. Some
of the children were smiling; they don't understand what's going
on. But the grandmas, they were totally dazed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khan said a tent the size of a small office would house 12
people in Albania. Damp tents with muddy floors are the best
accommodations many refugees know, he said, noting host families
have been exhausted and collection centers are filled.
</P>
<P>
   So Islamic Relief, a registered consultant with the United
Nations, has concentrated its efforts to create a tent city for
4,000 to 5,000 people, Khan said. The agency is trying to clear
space for the thousands of refugees pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Khan began his 10-day journey in Kukes, site of the largest
refugee camp in Albania, he said. From there he trekked to Shkoder
in western Albania, where he delivered packets of food.
</P>
<P>
   While Khan told of what he saw, fellow Muslims at the relief
headquarters were at work around him, soliciting donations,
organizing additional fund-raisers and stacking checks. Check
amounts and donors' information are stored on computer disks.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign coordinator M. Abdul-Hafiz Ameer said the relief
efforts for Kosovars have taken precedence in his and his
colleagues' lives. The aid workers have knocked on strangers' doors
in addition to calling on fellow Muslims to ask for donations.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how long the efforts will continue, Ameer said, ``As
long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the donated funds are used to pay for air fare for Khan,
who flies across the country showing his documentary of refugees.
Born in Pakistan and educated at the University of Birmingham in
England, Khan said once people view despondent images of hundreds
of thousands of refugees, it will be easier for them to write a
check for relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has to give. This is a humanitarian problem,'' he
said, gearing up for his lecture and fund-raising trip to Brooklyn
last week. He has also spoken in Dallas and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone number for Islamic Relief is (818) 238-9520.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said those who want to donate to Islamic Relief may
write checks out to the agency and send them to Islamic Relief,
P.O. Box 6098, Burbank, CA 91510-9979.

Stars rally, takes 3-0 series lead 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Maybe the Stars' alternate sweaters do have
some magical power after all.
</P>
<P>
   After lucking out all game against a determined bunch of
Edmonton Oilers, the Stars fired in three third-period goals and
took a stunning 3-2 victory in Game 3 of the best-of-seven Western
Conference quarterfinal series.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:28 left, Joe Nieuwendyk zipped in a 50-foot shot past a
stunned Tommy Salo to give the Stars their second come-from-behind
victory in the series and a three-games-to-none lead.
</P>
<P>
   Getting third-period goals from Mike Modano and Mike Keane, the
Stars somehow crawled back into a game they appeared to have lost
three times over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought \REdmonton\S played really well,'' Keane said. ``I
thought we pushed back when we had to. We battled back. We got some
not pretty goals and stuck to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers had a 2-0 lead in the third period and probably
should have had two more that were disallowed by referee calls.
</P>
<P>
   Getting two power-play goals from winger Ryan Smyth, who was a
healthy scratch the game before, the Oilers grabbed their lead
before a frenzied crowd of 17,100 that threatened to overturn the
Skyreach Centre after the Oilers lit the lamp three times and saw
none of the goals count.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lucked out on all three _ maybe it was the snappy
``green star'' jerseys they were wearing for the first time in the
playoffs _ and entered the third period trailing, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   With the Oilers skating in a 4-on-3 situation, Smyth picked up a
loose puck off the end boards and shoveled it past Stars goalie Ed
Belfour, who had laid out to try to make a save. However, it took
officials another two minutes to decide that Smyth did not have his
skate in the crease _ allowing the goal to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team had much luck in the injury department as Stars
defenseman Richard Matvichuk left with a strained groin in the
second period and will be re-evaluated today. It is the same groin
that kept Matvichuk out for the final 14 games of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers also lost a defenseman, Roman Hamrlik, with a knee
sprain. However, it never seemed to affect their energy. Despite
the low score, the Oilers were in control for most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was luck that the Stars weren't down by more as the Oilers
had three goals negated for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The worst transgression, as far as Oilers fans were concerned,
came at the 12:53 mark of the second period. With Belfour wandering
far from the net to break up a potential breakaway opportunity, the
puck was rimmed around to the blue line where Oilers winger Rem
Murray was able to whip it into a vacated net from 50 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   However, Oilers winger Pat Falloon and Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor collided with Belfour, who had skated all the way out to the
right circle. Falloon was called for goaltender interference on the
play, meaning the puck was dead as soon as Murray touched it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, Falloon missed pushing the puck over the
goal line by inches. The goal light went on, but the goal was
overturned on review. In addition, the Oilers had another goal
overturned on review when Todd Marchant chipped in a loose puck
with 57.1 seconds remaining in the first period, but Oilers winger
Ethan Moreau was called with the tip of his skate blade in the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   No offensive player is allowed to precede the puck into the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers worked their plan almost perfectly as they backed off
slightly on the physical play and concentrated more on making
offensive plays. Neither team was able to stay away from the
physical stuff, and referees Dan Marouelli and Dave Jackson sent a
procession of players to the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Stars continued to squander chance after chance on
the power play _ and the Oilers simply fed off that energy. With
the Skyreach Centre _ one of the loudest buildings in the NHL _
humming from the start, it was clear this was a different Oilers
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers received great efforts from Smyth, Falloon, Marchant
and Doug Weight as they had twice as many scoring chances as they
created in the first two games combined.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars threw plenty of shots at Oilers Salo, but he continued
to prove himself a frustrating figure for the Stars until Keane
beat him on a freaky 40-footer that was screened and Modano chipped
in a rebound to tie the game.  &LR; tagtop:Mike Heika, (817) 390-7760

PHOENIX ARTS CROWD UPSET ABOUT PLAN FOR JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Maricopa County planners look along Phoenix's
West Jackson Street, they see a desolate corner of downtown that
could be improved by a new 10-story jail, parking garage and
morgue.
</P>
<P>
   But artists and historic preservationists see warehouses ripe
for renovation into shops, galleries, lofts and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   The two visions collide at Jackson Street and Fourth Avenue in
downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   It is a crossroads once bustling with passengers from the train
station at the south end of Fourth Avenue, trucks spilling fruit
along Jackson Street, and workers loading rail cars with produce
and 300-pound blocks of ice.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is bleak. The streets here have been forgotten by
all but homeless squatters in the alleys, a handful of businesses
and artists like Helen Hestenes, who's making a stand to salvage
remnants of the warehouse district near Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all we have left,'' she said in making her pitch for
preservation. ``You can't always take out the heart and soul of a
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County's $850 million jail project is targeting three
sites along Jackson Street for a 1,200-bed jail, six-story parking
garage, offices for the medical examiner and county records
storage.
</P>
<P>
   County planners believe the project can enhance the area, and
they are willing to work with the artists to ``do what's right for
downtown,'' said Norm Hentz, county director of facilities
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision for it is a people-friendly place,'' he said. ``It's
hard to do that with a jail. They're just not friendly places, but
we can improve its curb appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The jail would occupy the former Borden dairy block, just west
of the Madison Street Jail.
</P>
<P>
   A 1,500-space parking garage, combined with space for the
medical examiner, is planned for the southwest corner of Jackson
and Fifth Avenue. The county intends to demolish an empty freight
depot on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The county also is considering buying the Mayflower-Chambers
building, 301 S. Fourth Ave., to store records.
</P>
<P>
   County voters in November authorized up to $900 million in
funding for the jail and other adult and juvenile correctional
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Planners want to build the jail near the county courthouse at
Third Avenue and Jefferson Street so prisoners can be safely led to
court appearances in existing underground tunnels, said Bob
Williams, county criminal justice facilities development director.
</P>
<P>
   The county has not finalized its plans, but Williams insists
that the jail will be downtown. It's safer there, and it would be
too costly to transport prisoners to the courthouse from a more
remote location, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the county's plans aren't opposed to a jail downtown
but are pressuring the county to rethink the Jackson Street sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hestenes, who over the past 10 years has transformed a 1910
warehouse into the Icehouse gallery and performance art space, said
the 10-story jail doesn't belong towering over the warehouse
district.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix City Councilman Phil Gordon, a longtime historic
preservation advocate, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a 10-story structure would literally and figuratively
be a crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The county needs to sit down with all the interested parties _
artists, the city, historic preservationists and developers _ to
come up with a better plan, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Skip Rimsza plans to appoint an ad hoc committee on the
warehouse district, his spokesman Scott Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the county needs a place to build near the
courthouse and there aren't a lot of options, said Joy Mee,
assistant city planning director.
</P>
<P>
   Hestenes suggested building it on the other side of the Madison
Street Jail in a block occupied by a county parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   But county officials said that would be too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Hestenes also is fighting the county's plan to tear down the
freight depot and use the historic Mayflower-Chambers building for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings are central to plans for the area created by the
South Downtown Area group, SODA for short.
</P>
<P>
   Artists' lofts are envisioned for the Mayflower-Chambers
building along with restaurants, a farmers market, bakery and
coffeehouse. The depot, a dilapidated concrete building with
loading docks and freight doors, is targeted for retail shops, a
cafe and a sculpture garden.
</P>
<P>
   The group also envisions commuter rail service reviving the
train station, which, with an adjacent park, would be the
centerpiece of the restored warehouse district, Hestenes said.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Ed Mell has agreed to donate his services for a sculpture
titled ``Digging In'' for the Union Station park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it's very important to me to save what little
early history we have,'' said Mell, who remembers from his
childhood the once-thriving area near the train station.
</P>
<P>
   Mell said he envisions an inviting public place in the blocks
surrounding Union Station, rather than a stark streetscape for
prisons, parking and a morgue.
</P>
<P>
   The city is supportive of the artists' ideas for southwest
downtown but funding is problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to have money to invest,'' Mee said. ``The artists
haven't had a lot of money to invest and neither does the city.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of developer interest in the area if the
county doesn't overrun the area, Hestenes said, pointing to the
success of redevelopment along East Jackson Street near Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Artists were pushed out of warehouses near the county-developed
ballpark, and they don't want to lose out again at the other end of
Jackson Street, Hestenes added.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Arts Commission has recommended that the historic
buildings on West Jackson Street be preserved. But there is only so
much the city can do because the county has condemnation powers for
a public purpose, such as the jail, Mee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know as we have the power to stop them from doing
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the city, county and community is to find a way
to fit the jail downtown and protect the character of Jackson
Street, said John Meunier, dean of Arizona State's College of
Architecture and Environmental Design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think the county isn't going to steamroll in
there with a huge jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Terry Goddard, who recently met with the county
about its plans, said he thinks it's ``important that we not slam
the door on something that could be a real important people place
for Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Fe depot is a jewel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the station's heyday, travelers arriving there saw Phoenix as
a garden spot when they stepped off the train onto Fourth Avenue,
the former mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, if they get off the train and they're met by a
jail and a morgue, I don't think they'll see us as a garden
spot.'' &QL;

DODGERS AGAIN OUT OF SYNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have seen the best the
National League has to offer in Arizona, San Diego, Atlanta and now
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And, for now anyway, those teams have much more to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' slide continued as they finished a six-game
homestand with a 6-4 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday in
front of a sellout crowd of 53,857 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After beginning the season 5-1, the Dodgers are 9-10. They've
lost four straight series, one each to the aforementioned clubs,
and followed a 2-5 road trip with a 2-4 stretch at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Dodgers center fielder Devon White said of
what's wrong. ``It seems like we're on and off. We can't pinpoint
what's going on right now. I think the players are all working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are working hard, but they're not working together.
On days the offense is clicking, the pitching falters. When the
pitching is strong, the clutch hits disappear. And on a day when
both are average, like Sunday, the opponents' are just a bit better
than average.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers couldn't even win a series in which the Cardinals'
Mark McGwire went 1 for 9 (single) with five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's luck. A lot of things have been going wrong,''
Dodgers reliever Pedro Borbon said. ``We are expected to win and we
have the people to win. There's always going to be frustration when
things are not going right, but there's not a guy on the team who
doesn't think we're going to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we find a formula, we're going to be fine. I really think
we're going to turn it around soon. No way this team is going to be
below .500. We have too many talented players in here for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the series finale against the Cardinals it was more of the
Dodgers helping the Cardinals win.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis hit a two-run homer in the first and had an RBI
single in the third, but errors set up both innings as St. Louis
built a 5-0 lead. The Cardinals' three-run first inning was aided
by Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort's inability to handle a comeback
bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals added two more runs in the third, the second of
which scored when Dreifort dropped Eric Karros' toss at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cost the team four runs because I blew two plays,'' said
Dreifort (3-1), who gave up five runs on seven hits in four
innings. ``I screwed up a ground ball back to me and I screwed up a
play at first base. You have to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers committed four errors, pushing their season total to
19. Even so, Mark Grudzielanek's solo homer in the fourth started a
comeback that saw the Dodgers trim a 5-0 lead to 6-4 on Eric
Young's groundout in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi then had an opportunity to pull the Dodgers closer,
but he grounded into a force play with runners on first and second
and two outs. Again, the clutch hit was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really worry about the physical errors, I worry about
the mental ones,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``We have
our work cut out for us, but we certainly have the strength and
character (in the clubhouse) to come back. This is nothing. We
haven't had it going our way yet. If it was easy, it wouldn't be
any fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Ken Bottenfield (4-0), who left in the sixth
inning with a strained left buttock, allowed two runs on five hits
for the win. Juan Acevedo pitched the final 12/3 innings for his
third save.

PROPOSED CAMPUS FOR PHOENIX HOMELESS PRAISED, CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A group of Phoenix players _ people with clout and
access to plenty of money _ is proposing a 4-acre downtown campus
to house a shelter and services for homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   These services now work out of crumbling buildings, mostly along
Madison Street, where the new campus would be built between 12th
and 13th avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed site is a mostly empty, city-owned lot except for
an emergency shelter still operated by Central Arizona Shelter
Services 14 years after it was officially designated ``temporary.''
It remains the largest emergency shelter in the Valley of the Sun,
as the greater Phoenix area is known.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Phoenix Community Alliance board, which is headed
by Jerry Colangelo, were once set on moving the shelter and
surrounding services, such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society
dining hall, the homeless post office and medical clinic.
</P>
<P>
   These services and the people they serve became a nagging and
emotional problem in the way of the group's aggressive plans to
redevelop the state Capitol area.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debate and research, the group's members are now
ready to take a bow for what they see as a sensitive, efficient,
good-neighbor solution.
</P>
<P>
   But the applause from service providers is sparse and polite,
and some neighbors are disappointed, and nearing hostility. The
loudest cheering is from people who use the services.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Donovan, 54, is back for his second visit to the CASS
shelter in a year. His legs were crushed in a work accident in 1991
and neither his legs nor his life have been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the skids, started drinking, started feeling sorry for
myself,'' said Donovan, who likes the idea of a new, secure campus
and not only because it hurts to walk to the scattered services,
such as the St. Vincent de Paul dining hall. Donovan said the walk
and wait in line is harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just going down there _ with the amount of illegal drugs,''
Donovan said, his voice trailing off. ``You're waiting in line and
they come up and ask if you want to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   A secure campus would make it easier for the police to separate
those in real need, those who are content to flop on a sidewalk,
and what locals call the ``homeless impersonators,'' people who are
there simply to sell drugs to a vulnerable group of people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Creighton, 34, lost several construction jobs recently and
is visiting the shelter for the second time in a year. He is
working as a volunteer during his stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of changes in some people,'' said Creighton,
but motivation is a problem with the often depressed and worn
shelter visitors. A campus of new buildings and lush landscaping
could give the guests a little pride and move them to clean their
bodies, wash their clothes and change their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some business owners along Madison are finding the proposal
hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   They expected the relentless and intimidating parade of homeless
men and women who use the services _ and spend much of the rest of
the day sprawled along their sidewalks _ to be dispersed as part of
the redevelopment pushed by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare,'' said Leslie Harlan, whose family has owned
a heating and air-conditioning wholesale business in the
neighborhood for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my customers drive in here and look at the guys on the
streets and say `What is this?' '' said Harlan, who admits that the
campus could improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just corral them and put them in one area and stop
them from moving up and down the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the local homeowners association at
first seemed surprised _ even shocked _ to hear about the proposal
to keep the services in place and then seemed politely
noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board needs to review the proposal,'' said Tammy Bosse,
who runs the Capitol Mall Association, which receives $50,000 a
year from the powerful alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But one neighbor didn't hesitate to offer an opinion about the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got so much crime going on anyway and these people are
right in the middle of it. This is ridiculous,'' said Jess
Gillespie, a long-retired Army colonel and a 15-year neighborhood
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie's been through two wars and now spends much of his
time sitting on his front porch with a police scanner, a cell phone
and a 9mm pistol strapped to his hip. At night his equipment
includes infrared binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he was honored by Phoenix police for his work with the
local Block Watch and for his assistance in helping police make
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, he sees no progress and no hope for the future
if the homeless services, even consolidated into new buildings,
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be one of the worst places I've ever lived
in,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from service providers such as St. Vincent de Paul and
Andre House is tentative. Their leaders are worried about details,
such as who will manage the complex and who will build affordable
housing for people graduating out of the campus shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Holleran calls himself a practical Republican businessman,
who also happens to run the CASS shelter.
</P>
<P>
   He understands the alliance comes bearing money and clout to
make or break the Madison Street services, but he also knows a nice
campus will not solve the homeless problem downtown.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of his shelter guests are seriously mentally
ill, another third are straight out of jail and between a half and
75 percent are addicted to drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   They have problems that can't be solved in a 90-day stay in a
shelter, even a pretty shelter. Once their limited stay is over,
there are no permanent rentals they can afford and no counseling
they can rely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ready to move out and here's the brick wall they run
into,'' said Holleran, who often sees these same people returning
for help.
</P>
<P>
   He and the CASS executive committee support the new shelter and
a consolidated campus, but only if the alliance makes it part of a
countywide system of homeless services.
</P>
<P>
   That network would need to include more entry-level shelters,
affordable supportive housing with on-site counseling,
single-room-occupancy hotels and family shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is committed not only to build the campus but help
to put into place just such a countywide network to help the
homeless, said Martin Shultz, chief lobbyist for Arizona Public
Service Co., who is spearheading the capital redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   Don Keuth, alliance president, said the campus is simply a
prototype the group hopes to duplicate throughout the Valley of the
Sun. Members are already talking with other cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite neighbors, business owners and original intentions,
the alliance no longer considers moving homeless services out of
the Capitol area an option. Shultz calls the proposed campus the
end product of ``a revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   The awakening came after years of often-heated debate with
people providing homeless services, was pushed along by research
commissioned from Arizona State University and by experience.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, when the same group of movers helped to resurrect
the downtown area that now includes Arizona Center and Bank One
Ballpark, the homeless were pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a homeless and transient problem we never dealt with,''
said Shultz, which created conflict with business owners, their
customers and people living in the area but never created a
solution to the fundamental problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a revelation that we had to deal with the homeless
issue with sensitivity and passion,'' said Shultz, adding: ``It
wasn't an unnatural act for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shultz rejects the idea that services attracted the homeless,
noting a homeless ``tent city'' had formed before volunteers opened
a shelter to provide for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``By default, not by design, this area is the highest
concentration of homeless men and homeless families,'' Shultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the alliance wants the campus to become part of its plans to
make the forlorn area around the state Capitol the next showcase
for Phoenix's downtown revival. The proposed site is ``naturally
buffered'' from most of the redevelopment area by industrial
buildings, a cemetery and a railroad, Shultz said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts ``an outpouring'' from the Valley's business
community along with city, county and state grants when leaders see
an organized and efficient, as well as humane, effort to help
homeless people off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, along with nervous neighbors and service providers,
don't bother Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only guy not nervous is me,'' he said. ``I know it's the
right thing to do.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX _ Members of the Phoenix Community Alliance were looking
for a humane solution to the problem posed by homeless people who
stood in the way of their latest redevelopment project.

<P>

longer connected with the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the familiar
charitable arm of the Catholic Church, spokesman Brian Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   Hom describes the village as a one-stop campus of homeless
services with eight separate centers covering two square city
blocks. Alliance members came back convinced a smaller version
could work in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one example of homeless services coexisting with
development,'' said Martin Shultz, the Arizona Public Service Co.
lobbyist heading up the project. ``Instead of forcing separation,
you can develop a campus in a way that's consistent and
compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego center, started in 1987, has shelters for singles,
families and teens; three homes and a 47-unit apartment complex of
permanent affordable housing; medical center; counseling services;
job training and a dining hall open for three meals a day to all
900 of its residents, and to the public for lunch, Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   The campus has won awards for its architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Now it wants to expand, but the center is meeting resistance
from businesses and the sparse neighbors in what Hom calls the
dilapidated community surrounding it. It's also meeting resistance
from people beginning to redevelop the area, Hom said
</P>
<P>
   Their complaint: too much loitering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people hanging around,'' Hom said. The
homeless hang around not to be close to services, Hom said, but
because it's one of the last downtown areas where there's still ``a
lot of squatting ground and lots of room to flop.''
</P>
<P>
   These squatters are made up of people unable to find a bed in a
city where there are 5,000 to 7,000 homeless people but only 2,400
emergency beds. Others are made up of what Hom calls `'the helpless
hopeless'' who can't abide by the campus' strict no-drink, no-drugs
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would rather sleep on the street and drink than go
indoors,'' Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   Redevelopment of the area is inevitable, he said, and as it
happens the street people will lose their ``comfort zone,'' driving
them into the campus or into some other neighborhood or city.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz said he understands that the campus proposed for Phoenix
will not completely sweep away the loitering problem, but he
expects those people unwilling to seek help inside the campus
``would be handled by additional enforcement'' from Phoenix police.
</P>
<P>
   The campus would give homeless people an option, Shultz said,
whose object is not to move homeless out, but move them in.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix police Sgt. Wiley Chlarson suspects expectations for
the new campus may be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep people in there,'' said Chlarson, who has worked
on and off in the area since 1985. ``We can't keep people anywhere,
unless they're under arrest. There will always be a group of people
who will not stay in the shelter or who are eighty-sixed from the
shelter because of the way they behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar debate for Hom and the people who run the San
Diego campus. Despite its shortcomings, the campus concept is a
trend in homeless care and St. Vincent de Paul Village has been
asked to develop similar campuses in Las Vegas and Indio, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The one-stop campus provides efficient, clean, respectful
services to people who want them, Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People donate to us with the expectation we're going to end
homelessness,'' he said. ``We can't.'' &QL;

Modano starts to contribute just in time 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ For the first 170 minutes of the playoffs,
Tom Hicks deserved a refund. He hadn't been getting his $12 million
worth.
</P>
<P>
   That, give or take a few Jaguars, is what the Stars owner is
paying Mike Modano and Brett Hull to take his team to the Stanley
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was on the verge of filing missing
persons reports on his two leading scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Stars once again found a way to win, getting the
game-tying goal from Mike Modano with about 10 minutes to play in
the final period and the game-winner from Joe Nieuwendyk less than
three minutes later as the Stars took a commanding 3-0 lead in the
best-of-seven first-round playoff series with Oilers at Skyreach
Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, the pretty boys had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, if you're going to win, your scorers are going to
have to score,'' Hitchcock had prophesied at yesterday morning's
pregame skate. ``I think both teams scorers are going to have an
impact on these games in this building.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Hitchcock was right.
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored 34 goals and Hull 32 to lead the Stars this
season, but until Modano's shot found the net midway through the
third period, they hadn't had a sniff of a goal in the first three
games of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this style of rough-and-tumble hockey isn't exactly
the flavor they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Their impact in these three games had been, to put it mildly,
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Mildly is how the Stars' two leading scorers have played in a
series marked by crashing hits, flying bodies and grind-it-out
offense. Until the third period last night, they had been totally
upstaged by little-known Oilers goalie Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had been on the verge of allowing the Oilers to get
back on their skates with a chance at taking it to six or seven
games, which has been their humble goal all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``As important as Game 2 is for the home team \Rthe Stars\S, I
think Game 3 is equally important for the home team \Rthe
Oilers\S,'' Hitchcock said. ``If \Rthe Oilers\W win Game 3, then
you know there's a race on. If \Rthe Oilers\S lose Game 3, then the
distance can become pretty deep.''
</P>
<P>
   It has long been an NHL axiom that teams who are truly Stanley
Cup bound don't waste time or energy in the early rounds of the
playoffs. It is to their great advantage to dispose of lesser teams
quickly, thus saving themselves for the tougher challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That is a particularly cognizant point in this rugged series,
where the Stars, even if they prevail, can ill afford to allow the
Oilers to beat them to a green pulp and go helplessly staggering
into the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lost inspirational leader Guy Carbonneau at the end of
Game 2 in Dallas with a torn ligament in his right knee and saw
defenseman Richard Matvichuk limp off last night with a groin
injury.
</P>
<P>
   They came into the series already missing Derian Hatcher
(suspended) and Pat Verbeek (knee sprain).
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when the Stars particularly need Modano
and Hull to step up their games, especially in igniting a power
play that has now gone 0-for-17 in the first three games of the
series, including a disgusting 0-for-7 last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things concern me,'' Hitchcock had said before the game.
``We haven't been able to spread the gap offensively \Rin Games 1
and 2\S, even though the shots and opportunities have been there.
And we haven't played a full 60 minutes yet. We've gotten away with
40 and we're going to have to play 60 to win in this building.''
</P>
<P>
   His words turned out to be more than prophetic, even before the
first period had concluded. Though they couldn't get the puck in
the net, the Stars dominated the first 10 minutes of the game and
at one point held a 7-1 advantage in shots.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually their malodorous power play sucked the energy out
of their game. They refused to benefit from three manpower
advantages. Not so the Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Given a 5-on-3 opportunity after Shawn Chambers and Richard
Matvichuk both took penalties inside the five-minute mark, veteran
center Doug Weight bided his time, spotted Ryan Smyth breaking to
the net behind Darryl Sydor and put the puck on Smyth's stick with
a perfect pass.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth easily deflected the puck past Ed Belfour and into the net
for a 1-0 Edmonton lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth and the Stars' Mike Keane swapped goals before Modano and
Nieuwendyk shocked the Oilers with two goals down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, an Oilers' fan waved a pointed sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modano,'' it read, ``wears panties.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's back from the dead, it's at least something we can
check.  &LR; tagtop:Jim Reeves, (817) 390-7760

EDMONTON TURNS UP AGGRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ The Edmonton Oilers had this problem in
Games 1 and 2. They were getting hardly any shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   They were shooting, mind you, but not enough, and the shots they
were getting weren't getting to Stars goalie Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a team to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot more,'' Oilers captain Kelly Buchberger said before Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot more,'' Oilers winger Rem Murray repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot more,'' Oilers winger Todd Marchant echoed.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what they did in Game 3 last night at
Skyreach Centre. They were much more aggressive offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers finished with 22 shots on goal and lost, 3-2, to the
Stars, putting them down 3-0 in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   The problem?
</P>
<P>
   They shot more, and the shots actually reached Belfour. He
simply stopped enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we have to get those shots through and then get
in front of \RBelfour\S and not let him see the puck,'' Murray
said, laying out Edmonton's plan before the game. ``He's too good
of a goaltender for that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the main reason the Oilers' Ryan Smyth was back in the
lineup after being a healthy scratch in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they needed me to stand in front of the net,'' Smyth
said when informed he had been reinserted in the lineup for Game 3.
``That's my job: Stand in front of the net and wreak havoc and pick
up the garbage goals.''
</P>
<P>
   One man's trash turned out to be the Oilers' treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth scored with 4:25 remaining on the first period, a tip-in
of a Doug Weight pass to give Edmonton a 1-0 lead. It was the first
power-play goal in the series.
</P>
<P>
   He scored another ``garbage'' goal 24 seconds into the third
period, also on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The power play was one of the main reasons the Oilers were
finally able to register first-period shots. They had eight last
night, double their first-period totals in Game 1 (4) and Game 2
(4).
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the first period last night, the Stars had
outshot the Oilers, 7-1. Penalties to Shawn Chambers, Richard
Matvichuk, Joe Nieuwendyk and the ensuing power plays near the end
of the first period helped to even that up in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the period ended, the Oilers had one more shot than
the Stars, 8-7. It was the first time the Oilers had outshot the
Stars in any period in the playoffs. Belfour faced 13 shots in Game
1 and 19 in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between then and last night?
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots we have gotten,'' Murray said, ``the traffic hasn't
been there.''
</P>
<P>
   The traffic was there last night. Belfour couldn't see the blue
line with Smyth and Ethan Moreau constantly in his face.
</P>
<P>
   The shots slowed considerably for the Oilers in the second
period. They were without a shot until Marchant's short-handed
breakaway with less than 10 minutes remaining in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, the Oilers had made their point.
</P>
<P>
   They were going to shoot more. They were going to be aggressive.
They were going to make Belfour win the game for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   They, at least, made him work.

ROADS TO DANGER: AGGRESSIVE DRIVING ON RISE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB PETRIE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Zabriskic, who's been driving _ and surviving _ in the
Valley since before the freeways, adheres to a simple credo
whenever he gets behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to operate under the assumption everyone on the road
is a total idiot,'' the north Phoenix resident said.
</P>
<P>
   It's Zabriskic's way of dealing with aggressive driving, a
phenomenon that quickly can ratchet up to road rage, something
police believe led to the fatal shooting April 17 of a Phoenix
youth.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials say violence resulting from traffic
altercations is rare, there's no doubt drivers in the Valley _ and
around the country _ are becoming more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can count on two or three a week, fights related to traffic
accidents,'' said Mark Jeffrey, veteran traffic reporter for
KFYI-AM (910).
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago it was kind of an odd thing, now it's kind of a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case resulting in the death of 17-year-old Jamison
Morrison, Peoria police say the trouble started with a
vehicle-bumping incident on Lake Pleasant Road involving pickup
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   One was driven by Morrison, the other by Luis Salas, who tried
to drive away.
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison continued to follow Salas until he stopped near
104th Avenue and Beardsley Road.
</P>
<P>
   Salas, who was unarmed, got out of his truck. Jamison Morrison
and his father, William Jay Morrison, confronted Salas. The father
pulled a .357-caliber Magnum and pointed it at Salas, while the son
fired a BB gun at Salas, hitting him in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Salas then got control of the .357 and shot and killed Jamison
Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   The father was charged Tuesday with aggravated assault and is
being held in a Maricopa County jail in lieu of $170,000 bail.
Salas has not been charged, because Peoria police believe he acted
reasonably in defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's episodes such as this fueling the fears of drivers that
they, too, could become road rage victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really afraid of other drivers,'' said Stephanie
Faul, spokeswoman for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington, D.C.-based organization did a national study,
tracking 10,000 violent traffic incidents from 1990 through 1996,
concluding there's a 7 percent annual rise in aggressive driving
during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some evidence it is getting worse,'' Faul said.
``Certainly, the public perception is it's getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, one national study shows it is. In March, the
Surface Transportation Policy Project listed Phoenix the third
worst metropolitan area for death rates from aggressive driving;
9.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature passed a road rage bill in 1998, calling
for stiff fines, jail terms and revoked licenses for motorists who
speed and endanger others with their driving behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police also have an aggressive-driving program, which
since early 1997 has resulted in more than 3,800 citations.
</P>
<P>
   Zabriskic, a retired state employee, has had several run-ins
with angry drivers. Recently, he was followed by an aggressive
motorist on Camelback Road for several miles, before the driver
finally passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't about to follow that jerk,'' he said. ``It's a
lose-lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon James, a University of Hawaii professor who has been
studying aggressive driving since 1979, says people need to change
their behavior toward others while out on the road.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly adds it takes a lot of work, and preparation, since
his own surveys show most people rank themselves as excellent
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not prepared, it catches you unexpected, and up goes
a finger,'' said James, who calls himself ``Dr. Driving,'' for his
studies on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   James suggests drivers carry a notebook, or turn on a tape
recorder while driving, to catch moments of anger toward others, as
well as eliminate their own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Bob Stein of the Department of Public Safety says if you
inadvertently cut someone off, it doesn't hurt to say you're sorry
_ with a shrug of the shoulders or a friendly wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``People usually take that the right way,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Stein says turn the other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody comes up to you and flips you off, you don't want
to encourage it by flipping them off back,'' Stein said. ``Just let
'em rant and rave a little, and let 'em go on their way.'' &QL;

GATHERING AT ARIZONA CAPITOL MARKS VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Lori Clarke crouched over the grass, carefully setting
each cardboard steppingstone around a pine tree outside the state
Capitol on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, she wrote the names of 432 dead children, each
in her perfect elementary schoolteacher penmanship in thick black
felt-tip pen on the cardboard stones.
</P>
<P>
   MARGIE MENDOZA. CINDY CHANDLER. RICHARD W. BOECK.
</P>
<P>
   She continued setting the stones until they stretched out 7
feet, circling the tree, each representing a child lost from
someone in her group, Parents of Murdered Children.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes the symbolic gesture will help people remember crime
victims this week during the National Crime Victims' Rights Week.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke doesn't need this special day to remind her of what is
now gone from her life _ her 18-year-old son, Matthew _ shot to
death when he tried to walk away from an argument five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never goes away,'' said Clarke, a teacher at Rose Linda
School in Phoenix and a member of Parents of Murdered Children, as
she straightened out the stones.
</P>
<P>
   SEDONA PERRY. PATRICK PENNINGTON. BRIAN SETH PATTISON.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 members of the support group and their friends gathered
near the stones Sunday evening, reciting poems, listening to songs
and telling stories for their annual Victims' Rights Vigil. They
spoke of the pain of the families in Littleton, Colo., where two
students killed 12 others and a teacher before turning their guns
on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They talked of how Arizona was one of the first states to pass a
victims' rights bill, but that there is much more to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the vigil will help encourage state legislators to
pass a bill this session that would give families of murder victims
a chance to speak at killers' sentencings.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said the bill recently
passed the Senate and now is in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families need to be heard,'' Romley said during another
victims' rights rally where about 100 people gathered at Cesar
Chavez Memorial Plaza on Saturday afternoon. ``Murder victims feel
a real loss. This would be their opportunity to let the court know
the impact. It's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley said only a handful of states have passed similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same families who pinned red, white and blue ribbons
on their clothes at the afternoon rally then went to the vigil at
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   They walked around the steppingstones, searching for their loved
ones' names.
</P>
<P>
   JULIA AVANT. SCOTT HAZELIP. ROBERT OTIS III.
</P>
<P>
   The stones didn't tell the stories of how these people, some
only a few months old, others senior citizens, were killed. But the
people at the gathering did.
</P>
<P>
   There were victims of drunken-driving crashes and fathers who
shook babies. Drunken brawls and random gunshots. Stabbings and
murder-suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Fiero, a board member for the support group, scanned the
stones, searching for her little boy's name, Aaron Fiero.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago in Portland, Maine, her son, then 2{, was
killed by a teenage baby-sitter. And 26 years later, her pain
remains.
</P>
<P>
   The business consultant found the support group only a few years
ago. When she first attended one of the meetings, another member
said to her: ``Whatever your story is, someone else's is worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiero knows you can't compare grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I realize, at least I got to say goodbye. At least
there was a body,'' she says. ``You can take comfort in strange,
little things.''
</P>
<P>
   A snapshot of her sandy-haired boy with chubby cheeks smiles
from a big pin on her blouse.

ARIZONA THEATRE CO.'S `GERSHWIN'S FASCINATING RHYTHMS' REACHES
BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS STORY ALSO MOVED IN THE ``E'' CATGORY'') NEW YORK _ David
Ira Goldstein is putting on weight. Not physically. The artistic
director of Arizona Theatre Company is swelling with pride as he
stands in front of the Longacre Theatre, a landmark of Manhattan's
theater district since 1913.
</P>
<P>
   On the stucco wall in front of him is a poster for ``The
Gershwins' Fascinating'' ``Rhythm.'' Its flashy graphics haven't
caught Goldstein's eye. He's wrapped up in the fine print. One
incomplete sentence in particular has set his pulse racing:
``Subsequent development production at Arizona Theatre Company.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the theater company's name has appeared on a
Broadway poster. Every troupe dreams of transferring a show from
its stage to New York, the center of the theater world. Goldstein's
company has done it.
</P>
<P>
   History of another sort is being made here. Not only is this
ATC's New York debut, it marks the first time a show has gone
directly from Phoenix to the Great White Way. It is a validation of
the Valley's cultural coming of age, one more indication that local
arts groups are transforming themselves into world-class
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 ATC supporters from Phoenix and Tucson flew into New
York for Sunday's gala opening. Caught up in the excitement of
having one of their own on Broadway, the Arizonans were in a mood
to party, and had no trouble satiating their desire.
</P>
<P>
   Two events were on everyone's list: a pre-show brunch at the
Park Avenue apartment of Selma and Walter Kaye, parents of ATC
board member Joan Biegle-Kaye, and a post-show celebration at the
glamorously chic Emporio Armani boutique on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who arrived Saturday to see the revue's final
preview, isn't thinking of parties as he pulls his overcoat around
him.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is typical of New York in the spring: 48 degrees and
rain drizzling from an overcast sky. A stiff wind is blowing in
from Times Square, a couple of blocks away. It's a chilly welcome
to a guy just off the plane from Phoenix, but, to borrow a song
title from the revue's score, ``Who Cares''?
</P>
<P>
   On his way here, he passed the Brooks Atkinson Theatre where,
last night, Kevin Spacey stood at the stage door, signing
autographs after the four-hour marathon of ``The Iceman Cometh.'' A
few hours before, at the Barrymore Theatre, Dame Judi Dench,
Academy Award winner for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' stepped out of a
limousine on her way backstage for a performance of ``Amy's View''.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein waves his hand in the direction of those theaters,
starts to say something, then just shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a college basketball team, this would be the finals
of the NCAA Tournament,'' he says, finally. ``It means we're going
to be able to do even better theater in Phoenix, because we're
going to be able to recruit better players. People in the business
now know that good and important work is being done at our company.
Already, I'm hearing from playwrights, producers and actors about
projects they would like to bring to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the theater on Saturday, it's the eye of the hurricane.
An eerie calm prevails. For the past several weeks, the winds of
change have been howling. The revue, built around 27 tunes by the
legendary team of songwriting siblings, George and Ira Gershwin,
has been undergoing constant tweaking as director Mark Lamos,
choreographer David Marques and their creative team fine-tune the
production for New York audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Ramirez is one of five members of the Phoenix cast to be
featured in the New York production. (The others are Chris Ghelfi,
Brian J. Marcum, Karen Lifshey and Jill Nicklaus.)
</P>
<P>
   The actress seems remarkably composed for someone who's being
bandied about as a potential Tony Award nominee. Doesn't she feel
the pressure? She shrugs off the question. She made her Broadway
debut in Paul Simon's ``The Capeman,'' which flopped. She knows how
dumb it is to fall victim to what she calls the ``snow job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to get wrapped up in the critics and the hype and
the press and the stress _ this is Broadway, after all, and if
you're a theater person, you can't help but feel the strain. For
us, this is it, this is Mecca,'' she says, stopping to catch her
breath after climbing the precipitous stairs to her dressing room
on the upper floors of the Longacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's all going to come down on me Sunday. Right now, I'm
just trying to relax and have a fun time and remember why I do
this. New York is the pinnacle, I have to say that, but Phoenix was
great, too. The truth is, just as long as I'm onstage somewhere,
I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Previews of ``Rhythm'' did well in the Big Apple, which delights
Goldstein since ATC participates in any profits. On Friday, only a
dozen or so seats were available, and the preview audience rewarded
the performers with constant laughter and applause. Two people
jumped to their feet at the finale. Actor Michael Berresse, one of
the new additions to the cast, grinned at them and gave them a
little bow. Friends, maybe. The rest of the audience applauded
enthusiastically but didn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez isn't surprised: ``New York audiences are harder to
please,'' she says. ``You don't see them out of their seats as
often. We were pampered in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences at the Herberger were particularly demonstrative, she
recalls nostalgically. Which is not to say everyone in Phoenix
embraced ``The Gershwins''' ``Fascinating Rhythm'' with the same
fervor. Some found it too sexual, too blatant in its references to
contemporary relationships and issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Longacre crowd seems comfortable with Lamos' efforts to
bring the composers into the new millennium. The sharp intakes of
breath that greeted the lesbian duet, ``Isn't It A Pity,'' at the
Herberger are missing. ``They Can't'' ``Take That Away From Me,''
with its overtones of grief for those lost to AIDS, is received in
an almost reverential silence. In the reflected glow of lighting
designer Peggy Eisenhauer's lights, tears can be seen coursing down
several cheeks. New York has been hard-hit by the plague. It is a
city of remembered deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been an attempt to cater to the conservative eye,
but then, again, we want to make audiences happy,'' Ramirez says.
``We've reined in some of the ideas a little _ toned some things
down after Phoenix. It's still sexy, and I like to think, hip. It
certainly is not your traditional musical. That's a response to the
changing New York audience. Shows like ``Rent'' and ``Bring in
'Da'' ``Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk'' have created new expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' has raised the
artistic bar in Phoenix. Valley theatergoers have a tendency to
believe that if it's in New York, or from New York, it's superior,
says Rusty Foley, director of corporate affairs for Salt River
Project, during Sunday's brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to change. This show proves that the best of
Phoenix theater can hold its own with theater anywhere. Even more
importantly, its commercial success at the Herberger means that
when Valley arts groups do exceptional work, it will be
recognized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, everyone gathers at the Armani boutique to
air-kiss and make merry while gawking at the cast and celebrities
like playwright Terrence McNally and supermodel Reni. The reviews
from the ``New York Times'' and the other Big Apple media fail to
arrive by press time, but a grinning Goldstein isn't in any hurry
to read them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they love it,'' he says, ``but this has been one of the
greatest experiences of my career. Let me steal something from the
Gershwin brothers. Whatever the critics say, they can't take that
away from me.'' &QL;

ANGST OVER AIMS: TODAY IS TEST DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA L. JONES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an increasingly common complaint among today's
AIMS-anxious.
</P>
<P>
   At the mere mention of the looming state graduation test,
students shriek, ``But I'm a bad test taker!''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include blurred vision, stomach pains, sometimes loss
of sleep and bad dreams, and, of course, a bad test grade.
</P>
<P>
   And today, when high school sophomores take the first of the
controversial new Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards tests,
some of these symptoms will reach their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   But is there really a quantifiable deficiency among so many
students?
</P>
<P>
   Or are students just afraid that their knowledge of English and
algebra is too weak to earn them a diploma under the state's new
standards?
</P>
<P>
   Educators say there is truth in both.
</P>
<P>
   Students say they are truly nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I take tests, I just blank out,'' said Red Mountain High
School sophomore Nahum Cruz. ``The words scramble all over the
place. If they didn't say it was a test, I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Davis, 16, who said he's never been good at tests, said
AIMS could hurt students like him.
</P>
<P>
   Since grade school, he has believed that so long as he shows up
for class and does the work, he'll make it to a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bombed the test, you'd still be OK,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the Class of 2002. Not on this test.
</P>
<P>
   Today, members of the Class of 2001 will answer multiple-choice
questions, write extended answers and essays and be required to
show their work on math problems as they complete the state's
graduation test.
</P>
<P>
   This year the sophomores will guinea-pig the test and need not
worry about a passing grade.
</P>
<P>
   Although their scores will be slapped on their diplomas,
sophomores do not need passing marks on the exam to toss their
mortarboards come 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge has been saved for the Class of 2002, today's
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   They won't take the test until next year, but for them, the
stress is mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people can do the work, but when it comes to taking the
test, their brain doesn't connect,'' said Jennifer Zimmerman, 14, a
Chandler High School freshman. ``And the bubbles, the bubbles are
the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All your teachers hype it up, your parents hype it up,'' said
Seth Sweeden, a 15-year-old freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Said freshman Chris Martin, ``I'm nervous because it determines
my whole future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference between typical test anxiety and a
nervousness that keeps you from being able to read, said Maryann
Santos de Barona, associate professor of psychology in education at
Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there are physical symptoms of test anxiety,'' said
Santos de Barona. ``For some individuals, as you might imagine, it
is more severe than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking into hives and experiencing nausea are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nervousness is normal, but some students simply do not test as
well as others, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think historically there have always been individuals who
know a lot more than they can show on a standardized test, and
certainly that is problematic,'' said Santos de Barona.
</P>
<P>
   A prepared student who blanks out and has problems simply
understanding questions might need help from a school counselor,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Special-education students or those with limited English could
have additional problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that you can assume that their level of anxiety is
going to be higher just because some of the other factors are going
to be compounding, such as language,'' she said. ``For limited
English proficiency students, the test becomes a language test more
than a knowledge test.''
</P>
<P>
   Mild learning disabilities that might not qualify a student for
special-education services could still hurt students on such a
test, said Camelback High School counselor Claudia Armer.
</P>
<P>
   Attention deficit disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder is
not uncommon on high school campuses in mild forms, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many educators are worried about everybody taking the test,
whether they're special-education students or not.
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason, they said, to be nervous for a test for
which passing grades have not been established and the full test
has never been seen by most teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the fear of the unknown,'' said Patricia
Tobin, director of special education for the Phoenix Union High
School District.
</P>
<P>
   If past experience on high-stakes testing is any indication,
antacid could be handled out with No. 2 pencils.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Hoopes, 16, developed stomach pains when she tried her
luck at the ACT last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the test I like totally freaked,'' Hoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Todaro, 16, had a similar experience with another college
entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the PSAT, I like freaked out on the math part,''
Todaro said.
</P>
<P>
   More knowledge of the fledgling test would calm the nerves of
school officials and their students.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler freshman Zimmerman and her friends said they would like
to see the AIMS study guide that has been circulated to sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the tests, many high school sophomores had not
seen the student guides produced by the state Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   In the schools, teachers said they are sharing as much as they
can about a test most of them have not seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we actually see the test, we don't know what degree of
difficulty will be on any given question,'' said Corona del Sol
math teacher Stan Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, students simply need to do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often some of the cause of test anxiety is related to the
fact that students are not prepared, don't know what to expect of a
test, have not covered the material extensively,'' said Santos de
Barona. ``More often than not, that plays a very large role.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, teachers said, there is help.
</P>
<P>
   After all, that is the reason kids go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is you have to have that grounding _ one
year of algebra and one year of geometry,'' said Larry Strom, math
department chairman at Desert Vista High School in Ahwatukee
Foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the grounding, then you panic,'' said Strom,
who helped develop the recommended passing score for the math
portion of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Students not taking the right courses will have problems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are reminding students of some universal testing tips:
</P>
<P>
   Eat a good breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Get a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the test in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A decent attitude helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of saying, `Boy, I'm going to blow this test,' saying,
`I know this material,' '' Santos de Barona said.
</P>
<P>
   Going over the organization of the test is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Simple things like the number of questions, format, organization
and knowledge of who will grade the test can ease a student's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that AIMS is not a timed test also should alleviate
some pressure, educators said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky charms help, too.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Davis wears a lucky necklace.
</P>
<P>
   Nahum Cruz has a lucky coin with Queen Elizabeth on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray,'' said Alfreda Toddy, 16, a Chandler High sophomore.
``It calms me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools are trying to boost kids' confidence, trying to balance
stressing the importance of AIMS and simply stressing students.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Union High School District brought in Intel Corp.
volunteers to talk with sophomores about taking the test seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's message: Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Students were reminded that if they ever want a professional
job, as a doctor, lawyer, engineer or accountant, chances are they
will be tested.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, even John F. Kennedy Jr. took three times to pass
the New York State Bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   These students have five chances over three years to pass the
AIMS test.
</P>
<P>
   By the third try, everyone should be a little more comfortable
with AIMS, said Red Mountain counselor Owen Rentschler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll all be a lot wiser a year from now,'' Rentschler
said. &QL;

PARENTS SEEK TEST AID, FIRMS OFFER `STUDY SKILLS' PRO GRAMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The ink is barely dry on the AIMS forms. Students who take the
test this year won't have to pass it to graduate. Yet the phone has
been ringing for weeks at the Sylvan Learning Center in the
Ahwatukee Foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are calling and saying, `The AIMS is coming up . . .
do you have something that will help my kid pass the math?' '' said
Pat Cunningham, director of the private tutoring firm in southeast
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Sylvan doesn't have a specific program to help kids
ace the AIMS.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the Kaplan Educational Centers nor the Princeton
Review, Tempe firms that aim to help high schoolers boost scores on
college entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvan does have a $1,000, 30-session high school ``study
skills'' tutoring program that Cunningham says can help improve
grades and raise scores on a number of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   And Princeton and Kaplan have copies of the Arizona Department
of Education's AIMS study guide and expect to use it to develop
specific AIMS prep programs for high schoolers by next year _ when
the first class that has to pass it to graduate takes the test.
</P>
<P>
   State Testing Director Kelly Powell said Arizona has no policy
against programs like Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prep programs can be helpful,'' he said. ``And we wouldn't
want to cut into private enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction,
applauds the programs _ as long as they are based on the state's
1996 academic standards, the basis for the AIMS test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support any model that helps students prepare for AIMS,''
she said. ``I don't agree that `prepping' programs defeat the real
purpose of AIMS. Instead it encourages students to do what they
should be doing, which is learning the standards in reading,
writing and mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   But other educators question the value and ethics of test prep.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for these firms' current programs range from $75 into the
thousands of dollars, depending on the length and intensity of the
preparation that students want.
</P>
<P>
   At such programs, instructors _ who often are moonlighting
certified teachers _ show teens the formats of standardized tests
and coach them about how to best handle questions they aren't
certain how to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If students know what they are supposed to do on these tests
ahead of time they tend to do a lot better than if they just go in
cold,'' said Ben Mauk, executive director of the Princeton Review's
Tempe office.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University West education Professor Tom Haladyna
is one of many testing experts who question the ethics of such
programs. He thinks they can lead to artificially inflated scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public and the students are deceived into thinking real
learning is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schaeffer, spokesman for the Massachusetts non-profit
National Center for Fair and Open Testing, thinks prep programs
``dumb down'' education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not on the test, kids don't learn it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other educators think it's simply unfair that private programs
can give middle-class kids an edge over low-income teens on an
important test like the AIMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can already see the carpetbaggers hawking their wares,''
sighed Bob Welton, testing director for the Bisbee Unified High
School District, who dislikes private prep programs.
</P>
<P>
   To help even the score for low-income kids, some districts are
developing AIMS prep programs of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Reilly, testing director for Mesa public schools, said his
district most likely will have free AIMS prep by next year. &QL;

PHOENIX ARTS CROWD UPSET ABOUT PLAN FOR JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Maricopa County planners look along Phoenix's
West Jackson Street, they see a desolate corner of downtown that
could be improved by a new 10-story jail, parking garage and
morgue.
</P>
<P>
   But artists and historic preservationists see warehouses ripe
for renovation into shops, galleries, lofts and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   The two visions collide at Jackson Street and Fourth Avenue in
downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   It is a crossroads once bustling with passengers from the train
station at the south end of Fourth Avenue, trucks spilling fruit
along Jackson Street, and workers loading rail cars with produce
and 300-pound blocks of ice.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is bleak. The streets here have been forgotten by
all but homeless squatters in the alleys, a handful of businesses
and artists like Helen Hestenes, who's making a stand to salvage
remnants of the warehouse district near Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all we have left,'' she said in making her pitch for
preservation. ``You can't always take out the heart and soul of a
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County's $850 million jail project is targeting three
sites along Jackson Street for a 1,200-bed jail, six-story parking
garage, offices for the medical examiner and county records
storage.
</P>
<P>
   County planners believe the project can enhance the area, and
they are willing to work with the artists to ``do what's right for
downtown,'' said Norm Hentz, county director of facilities
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision for it is a people-friendly place,'' he said. ``It's
hard to do that with a jail. They're just not friendly places, but
we can improve its curb appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The jail would occupy the former Borden dairy block, just west
of the Madison Street Jail.
</P>
<P>
   A 1,500-space parking garage, combined with space for the
medical examiner, is planned for the southwest corner of Jackson
and Fifth Avenue. The county intends to demolish an empty freight
depot on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The county also is considering buying the Mayflower-Chambers
building, 301 S. Fourth Ave., to store records.
</P>
<P>
   County voters in November authorized up to $900 million in
funding for the jail and other adult and juvenile correctional
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Planners want to build the jail near the county courthouse at
Third Avenue and Jefferson Street so prisoners can be safely led to
court appearances in existing underground tunnels, said Bob
Williams, county criminal justice facilities development director.
</P>
<P>
   The county has not finalized its plans, but Williams insists
that the jail will be downtown. It's safer there, and it would be
too costly to transport prisoners to the courthouse from a more
remote location, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the county's plans aren't opposed to a jail downtown
but are pressuring the county to rethink the Jackson Street sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hestenes, who over the past 10 years has transformed a 1910
warehouse into the Icehouse gallery and performance art space, said
the 10-story jail doesn't belong towering over the warehouse
district.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix City Councilman Phil Gordon, a longtime historic
preservation advocate, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a 10-story structure would literally and figuratively
be a crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The county needs to sit down with all the interested parties _
artists, the city, historic preservationists and developers _ to
come up with a better plan, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Skip Rimsza plans to appoint an ad hoc committee on the
warehouse district, his spokesman Scott Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the county needs a place to build near the
courthouse and there aren't a lot of options, said Joy Mee,
assistant city planning director.
</P>
<P>
   Hestenes suggested building it on the other side of the Madison
Street Jail in a block occupied by a county parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   But county officials said that would be too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Hestenes also is fighting the county's plan to tear down the
freight depot and use the historic Mayflower-Chambers building for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings are central to plans for the area created by the
South Downtown Area group, SODA for short.
</P>
<P>
   Artists' lofts are envisioned for the Mayflower-Chambers
building along with restaurants, a farmers market, bakery and
coffeehouse. The depot, a dilapidated concrete building with
loading docks and freight doors, is targeted for retail shops, a
cafe and a sculpture garden.
</P>
<P>
   The group also envisions commuter rail service reviving the
train station, which, with an adjacent park, would be the
centerpiece of the restored warehouse district, Hestenes said.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Ed Mell has agreed to donate his services for a sculpture
titled ``Digging In'' for the Union Station park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it's very important to me to save what little
early history we have,'' said Mell, who remembers from his
childhood the once-thriving area near the train station.
</P>
<P>
   Mell said he envisions an inviting public place in the blocks
surrounding Union Station, rather than a stark streetscape for
prisons, parking and a morgue.
</P>
<P>
   The city is supportive of the artists' ideas for southwest
downtown but funding is problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to have money to invest,'' Mee said. ``The artists
haven't had a lot of money to invest and neither does the city.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of developer interest in the area if the
county doesn't overrun the area, Hestenes said, pointing to the
success of redevelopment along East Jackson Street near Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Artists were pushed out of warehouses near the county-developed
ballpark, and they don't want to lose out again at the other end of
Jackson Street, Hestenes added.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Arts Commission has recommended that the historic
buildings on West Jackson Street be preserved. But there is only so
much the city can do because the county has condemnation powers for
a public purpose, such as the jail, Mee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know as we have the power to stop them from doing
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the city, county and community is to find a way
to fit the jail downtown and protect the character of Jackson
Street, said John Meunier, dean of Arizona State's College of
Architecture and Environmental Design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think the county isn't going to steamroll in
there with a huge jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Terry Goddard, who recently met with the county
about its plans, said he thinks it's ``important that we not slam
the door on something that could be a real important people place
for Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Fe depot is a jewel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the station's heyday, travelers arriving there saw Phoenix as
a garden spot when they stepped off the train onto Fourth Avenue,
the former mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, if they get off the train and they're met by a
jail and a morgue, I don't think they'll see us as a garden
spot.'' &QL;

TEEN SHOT BY OFFICER AFTER PROM: HOTEL PARTY WENT OUT OF CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The post-prom party broke up when police knocked on
the hotel room door, but as one student tried to scramble out the
window to avoid being caught past curfew with beer, an officer's
bullet struck his head.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Franco, 18, a junior at Barry Goldwater High School in
north Phoenix, is expected to recover fully from the wound _ the
bullet entered his cheek and lodged near his spinal cord, his
father said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Patrick Brutto, who has been on the Phoenix police force
for three years, told investigators he didn't intend to fire his
gun at the teenager Saturday night. He'll work behind a desk while
the department investigates, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin stuck his head out and the cop shot him. No warning,''
said Adrian Rivera, 16, of Phoenix, who attended the party at
Homewood Suites Hotel at Interstate 17 and Peoria Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Officers showed up at the hotel about 11 p.m. because security
wanted the roomful of teenagers kicked out, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When the two officers knocked at Room 119, they heard the teens
planning to scurry out the ground-floor window, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The officers went outside to the back of the room where they saw
Franco leaning halfway out. Both officers pulled their guns
thinking that something shiny they saw was a weapon, police said.
</P>
<P>
   As Brutto drew closer, he realized there was no weapon and
started putting his gun back in its holster, police said. With his
other hand, he tried grabbing Franco, and as he did so, he pulled
the trigger, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is investigating whether Brutto squeezed the
trigger out of a natural reflex to his other hand grabbing
vigorously for Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not say what the shiny object was.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers in the hotel room described a chaotic scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hear any warnings or nothing. A bullet came through
the window and my eye gets cut up,'' said Bryan Zahariades, 19, of
Phoenix, who was sporting a white bandage around his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Justin) fell back in and kids were going crazy,'' said Cara
Graulich, 15, a freshman at Goldwater High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was blood everywhere. Kids thought they got shot
because there was blood on their faces and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cara Graulich and her brother, Corey Graulich, knelt by Justin.
She said she grabbed a pillow and held it to his head. Soon it
became soaked with blood, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cara said her brother was angry and she told him to keep cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `This may be the last chance to talk to him. Calm
down.' So he stayed there, rubbing his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cara said she made sure Justin didn't lose consciousness by
repeatedly asking his name and telling him to focus on her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't talk,'' said Corey Graulich, 17, a junior at
Goldwater. ``He was trying to talk, but couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   An officer came through the window and told everybody to move
back from Justin, Cara Graulich said.
</P>
<P>
   Brutto was a paramedic before he became a police officer and he
tended to Franco until paramedics arrived, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives rounded up the partygoers and interviewed them
through the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers said there was beer in the room. Police said they
also found marijuana. The teenagers said there were about 20 people
at the party.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the hotel told them there were about 50 in the
two-bedroom suite, and that only a dozen remained when officers
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The partygoers kept pressing police for the reason the officer
shot Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them . . . about 20 times and they would never give us
a straight answer,'' Zahariades said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Police Chief Harold Hurtt planned to meet with the
Franco family, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tragedy comes on the heels of too many violent events
involving officers these past weeks,'' Hurtt said in a written
statement. ``Our concern is for Justin to recover quickly and
completely from his injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet lodged right at the teenager's spinal cord, said his
father, Cruz Franco, 47, of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some effects, but we don't know what yet,'' Cruz
Franco said, standing outside John C. Lincoln Hospital &AMP; Health
Center. ``The doctors said if it had been 1 inch over on either
side, I wouldn't have no more son.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Franco, a fullback who wore No. 35 on his football
uniform for the Goldwater Bulldogs, had thoughts of playing for a
college team, but his father said he might not be able to put on
the pads next year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Cruz Franco said his son is strapped to his hospital
bed, a brace holding his neck, his reconstructed jaw wired shut.
Doctors told him not to move.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to smile and open his eyes on command for a doctor,
a promising sign, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be the same, but he'll be all right,'' Cruz
Franco said. ``He's alive.'' &QL;

ARIZONA THEATRE CO.'S `GERSHWIN'S FASCINATING RHYTHMS' REACHES
BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS STORY ALSO MOVED IN THE ``A'' CATGORY'') NEW YORK _ David
Ira Goldstein is putting on weight. Not physically. The artistic
director of Arizona Theatre Company is swelling with pride as he
stands in front of the Longacre Theatre, a landmark of Manhattan's
theater district since 1913.
</P>
<P>
   On the stucco wall in front of him is a poster for ``The
Gershwins' Fascinating'' ``Rhythm.'' Its flashy graphics haven't
caught Goldstein's eye. He's wrapped up in the fine print. One
incomplete sentence in particular has set his pulse racing:
``Subsequent development production at Arizona Theatre Company.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the theater company's name has appeared on a
Broadway poster. Every troupe dreams of transferring a show from
its stage to New York, the center of the theater world. Goldstein's
company has done it.
</P>
<P>
   History of another sort is being made here. Not only is this
ATC's New York debut, it marks the first time a show has gone
directly from Phoenix to the Great White Way. It is a validation of
the Valley's cultural coming of age, one more indication that local
arts groups are transforming themselves into world-class
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 ATC supporters from Phoenix and Tucson flew into New
York for Sunday's gala opening. Caught up in the excitement of
having one of their own on Broadway, the Arizonans were in a mood
to party, and had no trouble satiating their desire.
</P>
<P>
   Two events were on everyone's list: a pre-show brunch at the
Park Avenue apartment of Selma and Walter Kaye, parents of ATC
board member Joan Biegle-Kaye, and a post-show celebration at the
glamorously chic Emporio Armani boutique on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who arrived Saturday to see the revue's final
preview, isn't thinking of parties as he pulls his overcoat around
him.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is typical of New York in the spring: 48 degrees and
rain drizzling from an overcast sky. A stiff wind is blowing in
from Times Square, a couple of blocks away. It's a chilly welcome
to a guy just off the plane from Phoenix, but, to borrow a song
title from the revue's score, ``Who Cares''?
</P>
<P>
   On his way here, he passed the Brooks Atkinson Theatre where,
last night, Kevin Spacey stood at the stage door, signing
autographs after the four-hour marathon of ``The Iceman Cometh.'' A
few hours before, at the Barrymore Theatre, Dame Judi Dench,
Academy Award winner for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' stepped out of a
limousine on her way backstage for a performance of ``Amy's View''.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein waves his hand in the direction of those theaters,
starts to say something, then just shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a college basketball team, this would be the finals
of the NCAA Tournament,'' he says, finally. ``It means we're going
to be able to do even better theater in Phoenix, because we're
going to be able to recruit better players. People in the business
now know that good and important work is being done at our company.
Already, I'm hearing from playwrights, producers and actors about
projects they would like to bring to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the theater on Saturday, it's the eye of the hurricane.
An eerie calm prevails. For the past several weeks, the winds of
change have been howling. The revue, built around 27 tunes by the
legendary team of songwriting siblings, George and Ira Gershwin,
has been undergoing constant tweaking as director Mark Lamos,
choreographer David Marques and their creative team fine-tune the
production for New York audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Ramirez is one of five members of the Phoenix cast to be
featured in the New York production. (The others are Chris Ghelfi,
Brian J. Marcum, Karen Lifshey and Jill Nicklaus.)
</P>
<P>
   The actress seems remarkably composed for someone who's being
bandied about as a potential Tony Award nominee. Doesn't she feel
the pressure? She shrugs off the question. She made her Broadway
debut in Paul Simon's ``The Capeman,'' which flopped. She knows how
dumb it is to fall victim to what she calls the ``snow job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to get wrapped up in the critics and the hype and
the press and the stress _ this is Broadway, after all, and if
you're a theater person, you can't help but feel the strain. For
us, this is it, this is Mecca,'' she says, stopping to catch her
breath after climbing the precipitous stairs to her dressing room
on the upper floors of the Longacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's all going to come down on me Sunday. Right now, I'm
just trying to relax and have a fun time and remember why I do
this. New York is the pinnacle, I have to say that, but Phoenix was
great, too. The truth is, just as long as I'm onstage somewhere,
I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Previews of ``Rhythm'' did well in the Big Apple, which delights
Goldstein since ATC participates in any profits. On Friday, only a
dozen or so seats were available, and the preview audience rewarded
the performers with constant laughter and applause. Two people
jumped to their feet at the finale. Actor Michael Berresse, one of
the new additions to the cast, grinned at them and gave them a
little bow. Friends, maybe. The rest of the audience applauded
enthusiastically but didn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez isn't surprised: ``New York audiences are harder to
please,'' she says. ``You don't see them out of their seats as
often. We were pampered in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences at the Herberger were particularly demonstrative, she
recalls nostalgically. Which is not to say everyone in Phoenix
embraced ``The Gershwins''' ``Fascinating Rhythm'' with the same
fervor. Some found it too sexual, too blatant in its references to
contemporary relationships and issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Longacre crowd seems comfortable with Lamos' efforts to
bring the composers into the new millennium. The sharp intakes of
breath that greeted the lesbian duet, ``Isn't It A Pity,'' at the
Herberger are missing. ``They Can't'' ``Take That Away From Me,''
with its overtones of grief for those lost to AIDS, is received in
an almost reverential silence. In the reflected glow of lighting
designer Peggy Eisenhauer's lights, tears can be seen coursing down
several cheeks. New York has been hard-hit by the plague. It is a
city of remembered deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been an attempt to cater to the conservative eye,
but then, again, we want to make audiences happy,'' Ramirez says.
``We've reined in some of the ideas a little _ toned some things
down after Phoenix. It's still sexy, and I like to think, hip. It
certainly is not your traditional musical. That's a response to the
changing New York audience. Shows like ``Rent'' and ``Bring in
'Da'' ``Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk'' have created new expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' has raised the
artistic bar in Phoenix. Valley theatergoers have a tendency to
believe that if it's in New York, or from New York, it's superior,
says Rusty Foley, director of corporate affairs for Salt River
Project, during Sunday's brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to change. This show proves that the best of
Phoenix theater can hold its own with theater anywhere. Even more
importantly, its commercial success at the Herberger means that
when Valley arts groups do exceptional work, it will be
recognized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, everyone gathers at the Armani boutique to
air-kiss and make merry while gawking at the cast and celebrities
like playwright Terrence McNally and supermodel Reni. The reviews
from the ``New York Times'' and the other Big Apple media fail to
arrive by press time, but a grinning Goldstein isn't in any hurry
to read them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they love it,'' he says, ``but this has been one of the
greatest experiences of my career. Let me steal something from the
Gershwin brothers. Whatever the critics say, they can't take that
away from me.'' &QL;

PROPOSED CAMPUS FOR PHOENIX HOMELESS PRAISED, CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A group of Phoenix players _ people with clout and
access to plenty of money _ is proposing a 4-acre downtown campus
to house a shelter and services for homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   These services now work out of crumbling buildings, mostly along
Madison Street, where the new campus would be built between 12th
and 13th avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed site is a mostly empty, city-owned lot except for
an emergency shelter still operated by Central Arizona Shelter
Services 14 years after it was officially designated ``temporary.''
It remains the largest emergency shelter in the Valley of the Sun,
as the greater Phoenix area is known.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Phoenix Community Alliance board, which is headed
by Jerry Colangelo, were once set on moving the shelter and
surrounding services, such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society
dining hall, the homeless post office and medical clinic.
</P>
<P>
   These services and the people they serve became a nagging and
emotional problem in the way of the group's aggressive plans to
redevelop the state Capitol area.
</P>
<P>
   After years of debate and research, the group's members are now
ready to take a bow for what they see as a sensitive, efficient,
good-neighbor solution.
</P>
<P>
   But the applause from service providers is sparse and polite,
and some neighbors are disappointed, and nearing hostility. The
loudest cheering is from people who use the services.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Donovan, 54, is back for his second visit to the CASS
shelter in a year. His legs were crushed in a work accident in 1991
and neither his legs nor his life have been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the skids, started drinking, started feeling sorry for
myself,'' said Donovan, who likes the idea of a new, secure campus
and not only because it hurts to walk to the scattered services,
such as the St. Vincent de Paul dining hall. Donovan said the walk
and wait in line is harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just going down there _ with the amount of illegal drugs,''
Donovan said, his voice trailing off. ``You're waiting in line and
they come up and ask if you want to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   A secure campus would make it easier for the police to separate
those in real need, those who are content to flop on a sidewalk,
and what locals call the ``homeless impersonators,'' people who are
there simply to sell drugs to a vulnerable group of people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Creighton, 34, lost several construction jobs recently and
is visiting the shelter for the second time in a year. He is
working as a volunteer during his stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of changes in some people,'' said Creighton,
but motivation is a problem with the often depressed and worn
shelter visitors. A campus of new buildings and lush landscaping
could give the guests a little pride and move them to clean their
bodies, wash their clothes and change their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some business owners along Madison are finding the proposal
hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   They expected the relentless and intimidating parade of homeless
men and women who use the services _ and spend much of the rest of
the day sprawled along their sidewalks _ to be dispersed as part of
the redevelopment pushed by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare,'' said Leslie Harlan, whose family has owned
a heating and air-conditioning wholesale business in the
neighborhood for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my customers drive in here and look at the guys on the
streets and say `What is this?' '' said Harlan, who admits that the
campus could improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just corral them and put them in one area and stop
them from moving up and down the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the local homeowners association at
first seemed surprised _ even shocked _ to hear about the proposal
to keep the services in place and then seemed politely
noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board needs to review the proposal,'' said Tammy Bosse,
who runs the Capitol Mall Association, which receives $50,000 a
year from the powerful alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But one neighbor didn't hesitate to offer an opinion about the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got so much crime going on anyway and these people are
right in the middle of it. This is ridiculous,'' said Jess
Gillespie, a long-retired Army colonel and a 15-year neighborhood
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie's been through two wars and now spends much of his
time sitting on his front porch with a police scanner, a cell phone
and a 9mm pistol strapped to his hip. At night his equipment
includes infrared binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he was honored by Phoenix police for his work with the
local Block Watch and for his assistance in helping police make
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, he sees no progress and no hope for the future
if the homeless services, even consolidated into new buildings,
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be one of the worst places I've ever lived
in,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from service providers such as St. Vincent de Paul and
Andre House is tentative. Their leaders are worried about details,
such as who will manage the complex and who will build affordable
housing for people graduating out of the campus shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Holleran calls himself a practical Republican businessman,
who also happens to run the CASS shelter.
</P>
<P>
   He understands the alliance comes bearing money and clout to
make or break the Madison Street services, but he also knows a nice
campus will not solve the homeless problem downtown.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of his shelter guests are seriously mentally
ill, another third are straight out of jail and between a half and
75 percent are addicted to drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   They have problems that can't be solved in a 90-day stay in a
shelter, even a pretty shelter. Once their limited stay is over,
there are no permanent rentals they can afford and no counseling
they can rely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ready to move out and here's the brick wall they run
into,'' said Holleran, who often sees these same people returning
for help.
</P>
<P>
   He and the CASS executive committee support the new shelter and
a consolidated campus, but only if the alliance makes it part of a
countywide system of homeless services.
</P>
<P>
   That network would need to include more entry-level shelters,
affordable supportive housing with on-site counseling,
single-room-occupancy hotels and family shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is committed not only to build the campus but help
to put into place just such a countywide network to help the
homeless, said Martin Shultz, chief lobbyist for Arizona Public
Service Co., who is spearheading the capital redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   Don Keuth, alliance president, said the campus is simply a
prototype the group hopes to duplicate throughout the Valley of the
Sun. Members are already talking with other cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite neighbors, business owners and original intentions,
the alliance no longer considers moving homeless services out of
the Capitol area an option. Shultz calls the proposed campus the
end product of ``a revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   The awakening came after years of often-heated debate with
people providing homeless services, was pushed along by research
commissioned from Arizona State University and by experience.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, when the same group of movers helped to resurrect
the downtown area that now includes Arizona Center and Bank One
Ballpark, the homeless were pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a homeless and transient problem we never dealt with,''
said Shultz, which created conflict with business owners, their
customers and people living in the area but never created a
solution to the fundamental problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a revelation that we had to deal with the homeless
issue with sensitivity and passion,'' said Shultz, adding: ``It
wasn't an unnatural act for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shultz rejects the idea that services attracted the homeless,
noting a homeless ``tent city'' had formed before volunteers opened
a shelter to provide for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``By default, not by design, this area is the highest
concentration of homeless men and homeless families,'' Shultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the alliance wants the campus to become part of its plans to
make the forlorn area around the state Capitol the next showcase
for Phoenix's downtown revival. The proposed site is ``naturally
buffered'' from most of the redevelopment area by industrial
buildings, a cemetery and a railroad, Shultz said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts ``an outpouring'' from the Valley's business
community along with city, county and state grants when leaders see
an organized and efficient, as well as humane, effort to help
homeless people off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, along with nervous neighbors and service providers,
don't bother Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only guy not nervous is me,'' he said. ``I know it's the
right thing to do.'' &QL;

SAN DIEGO HOMELESS CENTER MAY BE MODEL FOR PHOENIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Members of the Phoenix Community Alliance were looking
for a humane solution to the problem posed by homeless people who
stood in the way of their latest redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their research, some members visited San Diego's St.
Vincent de Paul Village.
</P>
<P>
   The village is run by a private, non-profit organization, no
longer connected with the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the familiar
charitable arm of the Catholic Church, spokesman Brian Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   Hom describes the village as a one-stop campus of homeless
services with eight separate centers covering two square city
blocks. Alliance members came back convinced a smaller version
could work in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one example of homeless services coexisting with
development,'' said Martin Shultz, the Arizona Public Service Co.
lobbyist heading up the project. ``Instead of forcing separation,
you can develop a campus in a way that's consistent and
compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego center, started in 1987, has shelters for singles,
families and teens; three homes and a 47-unit apartment complex of
permanent affordable housing; medical center; counseling services;
job training and a dining hall open for three meals a day to all
900 of its residents, and to the public for lunch, Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   The campus has won awards for its architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Now it wants to expand, but the center is meeting resistance
from businesses and the sparse neighbors in what Hom calls the
dilapidated community surrounding it. It's also meeting resistance
from people beginning to redevelop the area, Hom said
</P>
<P>
   Their complaint: too much loitering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people hanging around,'' Hom said. The
homeless hang around not to be close to services, Hom said, but
because it's one of the last downtown areas where there's still ``a
lot of squatting ground and lots of room to flop.''
</P>
<P>
   These squatters are made up of people unable to find a bed in a
city where there are 5,000 to 7,000 homeless people but only 2,400
emergency beds. Others are made up of what Hom calls `'the helpless
hopeless'' who can't abide by the campus' strict no-drink, no-drugs
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would rather sleep on the street and drink than go
indoors,'' Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   Redevelopment of the area is inevitable, he said, and as it
happens the street people will lose their ``comfort zone,'' driving
them into the campus or into some other neighborhood or city.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz said he understands that the campus proposed for Phoenix
will not completely sweep away the loitering problem, but he
expects those people unwilling to seek help inside the campus
``would be handled by additional enforcement'' from Phoenix police.
</P>
<P>
   The campus would give homeless people an option, Shultz said,
whose object is not to move homeless out, but move them in.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix police Sgt. Wiley Chlarson suspects expectations for
the new campus may be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep people in there,'' said Chlarson, who has worked
on and off in the area since 1985. ``We can't keep people anywhere,
unless they're under arrest. There will always be a group of people
who will not stay in the shelter or who are eighty-sixed from the
shelter because of the way they behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar debate for Hom and the people who run the San
Diego campus. Despite its shortcomings, the campus concept is a
trend in homeless care and St. Vincent de Paul Village has been
asked to develop similar campuses in Las Vegas and Indio, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The one-stop campus provides efficient, clean, respectful
services to people who want them, Hom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People donate to us with the expectation we're going to end
homelessness,'' he said. ``We can't.'' &QL;

ROADS TO DANGER: AGGRESSIVE DRIVING ON RISE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB PETRIE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Zabriskic, who's been driving _ and surviving _ in the
Valley since before the freeways, adheres to a simple credo
whenever he gets behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to operate under the assumption everyone on the road
is a total idiot,'' the north Phoenix resident said.
</P>
<P>
   It's Zabriskic's way of dealing with aggressive driving, a
phenomenon that quickly can ratchet up to road rage, something
police believe led to the fatal shooting April 17 of a Phoenix
youth.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials say violence resulting from traffic
altercations is rare, there's no doubt drivers in the Valley _ and
around the country _ are becoming more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can count on two or three a week, fights related to traffic
accidents,'' said Mark Jeffrey, veteran traffic reporter for
KFYI-AM (910).
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago it was kind of an odd thing, now it's kind of a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case resulting in the death of 17-year-old Jamison
Morrison, Peoria police say the trouble started with a
vehicle-bumping incident on Lake Pleasant Road involving pickup
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   One was driven by Morrison, the other by Luis Salas, who tried
to drive away.
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison continued to follow Salas until he stopped near
104th Avenue and Beardsley Road.
</P>
<P>
   Salas, who was unarmed, got out of his truck. Jamison Morrison
and his father, William Jay Morrison, confronted Salas. The father
pulled a .357-caliber Magnum and pointed it at Salas, while the son
fired a BB gun at Salas, hitting him in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Salas then got control of the .357 and shot and killed Jamison
Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   The father was charged Tuesday with aggravated assault and is
being held in a Maricopa County jail in lieu of $170,000 bail.
Salas has not been charged, because Peoria police believe he acted
reasonably in defending himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's episodes such as this fueling the fears of drivers that
they, too, could become road rage victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really afraid of other drivers,'' said Stephanie
Faul, spokeswoman for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington, D.C.-based organization did a national study,
tracking 10,000 violent traffic incidents from 1990 through 1996,
concluding there's a 7 percent annual rise in aggressive driving
during that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some evidence it is getting worse,'' Faul said.
``Certainly, the public perception is it's getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, one national study shows it is. In March, the
Surface Transportation Policy Project listed Phoenix the third
worst metropolitan area for death rates from aggressive driving;
9.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature passed a road rage bill in 1998, calling
for stiff fines, jail terms and revoked licenses for motorists who
speed and endanger others with their driving behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police also have an aggressive-driving program, which
since early 1997 has resulted in more than 3,800 citations.
</P>
<P>
   Zabriskic, a retired state employee, has had several run-ins
with angry drivers. Recently, he was followed by an aggressive
motorist on Camelback Road for several miles, before the driver
finally passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't about to follow that jerk,'' he said. ``It's a
lose-lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon James, a University of Hawaii professor who has been
studying aggressive driving since 1979, says people need to change
their behavior toward others while out on the road.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly adds it takes a lot of work, and preparation, since
his own surveys show most people rank themselves as excellent
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not prepared, it catches you unexpected, and up goes
a finger,'' said James, who calls himself ``Dr. Driving,'' for his
studies on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   James suggests drivers carry a notebook, or turn on a tape
recorder while driving, to catch moments of anger toward others, as
well as eliminate their own mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Bob Stein of the Department of Public Safety says if you
inadvertently cut someone off, it doesn't hurt to say you're sorry
_ with a shrug of the shoulders or a friendly wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``People usually take that the right way,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Stein says turn the other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody comes up to you and flips you off, you don't want
to encourage it by flipping them off back,'' Stein said. ``Just let
'em rant and rave a little, and let 'em go on their way.'' &QL;

GATHERING AT ARIZONA CAPITOL MARKS VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Lori Clarke crouched over the grass, carefully setting
each cardboard steppingstone around a pine tree outside the state
Capitol on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, she wrote the names of 432 dead children, each
in her perfect elementary schoolteacher penmanship in thick black
felt-tip pen on the cardboard stones.
</P>
<P>
   MARGIE MENDOZA. CINDY CHANDLER. RICHARD W. BOECK.
</P>
<P>
   She continued setting the stones until they stretched out 7
feet, circling the tree, each representing a child lost from
someone in her group, Parents of Murdered Children.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes the symbolic gesture will help people remember crime
victims this week during the National Crime Victims' Rights Week.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke doesn't need this special day to remind her of what is
now gone from her life _ her 18-year-old son, Matthew _ shot to
death when he tried to walk away from an argument five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never goes away,'' said Clarke, a teacher at Rose Linda
School in Phoenix and a member of Parents of Murdered Children, as
she straightened out the stones.
</P>
<P>
   SEDONA PERRY. PATRICK PENNINGTON. BRIAN SETH PATTISON.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 members of the support group and their friends gathered
near the stones Sunday evening, reciting poems, listening to songs
and telling stories for their annual Victims' Rights Vigil. They
spoke of the pain of the families in Littleton, Colo., where two
students killed 12 others and a teacher before turning their guns
on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They talked of how Arizona was one of the first states to pass a
victims' rights bill, but that there is much more to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the vigil will help encourage state legislators to
pass a bill this session that would give families of murder victims
a chance to speak at killers' sentencings.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said the bill recently
passed the Senate and now is in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families need to be heard,'' Romley said during another
victims' rights rally where about 100 people gathered at Cesar
Chavez Memorial Plaza on Saturday afternoon. ``Murder victims feel
a real loss. This would be their opportunity to let the court know
the impact. It's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley said only a handful of states have passed similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same families who pinned red, white and blue ribbons
on their clothes at the afternoon rally then went to the vigil at
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   They walked around the steppingstones, searching for their loved
ones' names.
</P>
<P>
   JULIA AVANT. SCOTT HAZELIP. ROBERT OTIS III.
</P>
<P>
   The stones didn't tell the stories of how these people, some
only a few months old, others senior citizens, were killed. But the
people at the gathering did.
</P>
<P>
   There were victims of drunken-driving crashes and fathers who
shook babies. Drunken brawls and random gunshots. Stabbings and
murder-suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Fiero, a board member for the support group, scanned the
stones, searching for her little boy's name, Aaron Fiero.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago in Portland, Maine, her son, then 2{, was
killed by a teenage baby-sitter. And 26 years later, her pain
remains.
</P>
<P>
   The business consultant found the support group only a few years
ago. When she first attended one of the meetings, another member
said to her: ``Whatever your story is, someone else's is worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiero knows you can't compare grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I realize, at least I got to say goodbye. At least
there was a body,'' she says. ``You can take comfort in strange,
little things.''
</P>
<P>
   A snapshot of her sandy-haired boy with chubby cheeks smiles
from a big pin on her blouse.

   LONDON _ For most of the half-century it is celebrating in
Washington this weekend, NATO's very existence has been rooted in
the idea of a grand design _ to guarantee the safety of the West
against the East, to forge a common defense of democracy against
tyranny, to prepare, in effect, for World War III.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as NATO's forces press their first true combat mission
in a messy conflict in Kosovo, the allies and their neighbors are
discovering that war is not just about the grand design of
thwarting tyranny, but about niggling details and political line
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is more than just America's war or even NATO's war. It is
an ominous prism refracting the national interests of the allies
(and their neighbors) from the most sweeping political
considerations to the most mundane. For each of the nations
involved, the conflict has shades of meaning and ambiguity,
revealing the alliance on its 50th anniversary as an assembly of
agendas in uneasy cohesion _ and raising the question of whether it
can survive an escalation into a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, matters as basic as river traffic on the
Danube halted by NATO's bombing of bridges, or faltering tourism in
Greece and Croatia _ consequences of war that show that the
conflict's price will be paid in many coinages, from Budapest,
Hungary, to Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast those economic consequences with much bigger, almost
metaphysical themes: Germany's fraught dilemma between avoiding
embroilment in war while joining in the common campaign against
horrors all too familiar from its own past. There is also the
perennial fear in Europe _ in Italy, Germany and France in
particular _ of being overwhelmed by unwelcome refugees whose
presence, political leaders fear, would feed domestic tensions and
right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   And consider the dynamics of those lands _ Italy and Greece _
that provide the ports and airfields for a war their people and
political elite do not universally approve. Then there is raw,
geopolitical ambition _ British in particular, but French, too _ to
show military leadership in a continent more used to Uncle Sam's
coattails, and to promote the idea of European cohesion, absent for
much of this decade's Balkan agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the potential for division, the unity has been quite
amazing,'' said Gordon Adams, deputy director of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
</P>
<P>
   To say that NATO's members come to the table with varied baggage
_ both from their histories and from more modern times _ is an
understatement. And it is difficult to categorize their concerns
without oversimplification: Like overlays on a presentation board,
they overlap, cross-reference and sometimes contradict one another.
</P>
<P>
   In purely economic terms, the damage is felt not just by the
allies but by their non-alliance neighbors. At one point last week,
over 100,000 tons of waterborne freight intended for Austria,
Germany and Hungary were marooned on the Danube in Romania. An
Austrian shipping company said it was losing $77,000 a day because
of NATO bombing of Danube bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists in droves have canceled vacations on Croatia's Adriatic
cost _ much too close to the bombing for beach-lounging comfort.
Even in Greece, a tour operator said thousands of Americans had
postponed visits in case the Kosovo conflict spills southward. And
a ground war _ not to mention the likelihood of a massive postwar
reconstruction bill _ would strain budgets across Europe. Even now,
simply to keep one British Tornado warplane airborne for an hour
costs Britain's taxpayers $33,000. A single payload of bombs costs
$640,000, according to defense analysts.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   But economic woes may turn out to be far less intractable than
some of the political conundrums thrown up by the alliance's
embroilment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for a patchwork of uneasy bedfellows. For example,
Spain and Turkey, different in so many other ways, are both NATO
members committed to supporting the alliance's aims in Kosovo. But
both are also locked in their own conflicts against separatists _
respectively, Basques and Kurds _ who are demanding pretty much the
same things sought by the Kosovars whom the two nations purport to
defend in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The totalitarian exclusiveness of nationalism engenders
genocide and ethnic cleansing,'' warned Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's
prime minister. So why wage war in league with Kosovar
separatists? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Spain, of course, doesn't have a strategic interest in the
Balkans, but Turkey does. Its Ottoman forebears drew the very fault
lines of faith and ethnic division that have baffled Western policy
makers in the Balkans through two world wars and now for most of
the 1990s. And that legacy draws an arc of solidarity embracing
Muslim communities from Thrace in Greece to Albania and Bosnia
that, some fear, could pull Ankara toward a wider conflict.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more sensitive to that configuration of faith than the
Greeks, whose mirror-image sense of kinship with the Orthodox
Christian Serbs places the government of Prime Minister Costas
Simitis in a curious position, caught between the powerful pro-Serb
impulses of his compatriots and the broader pro-Western interests
reflected in Athens' enthusiastic drive to join the European single
currency. Orthodox Christianity, indeed, provides a critical link
of religious identities, stretching from Athens to Belgrade and on
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by the Greek Orthodox Church, Greeks have demonstrated
against NATO's Kosovo campaign, even as the Greek port of
Thessaloniki is being used to resupply the 12,000 NATO troops in
neighboring Macedonia. At the same time, Simitis' popularity has
risen sharply in opinion surveys, underlining the keen desire of
many Greeks to see the war contained as far as possible from their
borders, avoiding a broader conflict with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here, too, is another overlay, this time from the Cold War:
If anyone within NATO supports Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, it is Europe's Communists and ex-Communists, who are
usually depicted as discredited and spent. The small Greek
Communist party _ in tacit alliance with the Orthodox Church _ has
helped stage anti-Western demonstrations in Athens. Elsewhere,
ex-Communist leaders from eastern Germany and Italy have rushed to
Belgrade. Significantly, German opinion surveys show support for
the war running at 59 percent in western Germany, but only 38
percent in the formerly Communist east.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, this catalog of diversity has not dented
the high degree of support across Europe for the Kosovo campaign.
Almost universally, Europeans have been horrified _ even ashamed _
by images of refugees streaming out of Kosovo and into a collective
memory of the even more massive upheavals of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, even those former central European lands that have
only just joined the alliance have not broken ranks: Hungary
hasn't, and it is on the very front line, with 300,000 Hungarian
brethren forming a minority in Yugoslavia's Vojvodina region, and
potentially vulnerable to Serbian reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   But, more cynically, it is the refugees that propel policies
that, in the words of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, are
about moral imperatives and a ``just war.''
</P>
<P>
   No European power wants a huge influx of outsiders straining the
social fabric and state coffers at a time of widespread
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Italy thus was among the first to send 2,000 troops to Albania
to help in humanitarian relief. As on many occasions in recent
years, Rome's policy was driven by a calculation that it is
preferable to deal with refugees' distress at long range rather
than at home.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is already home to 400,000 Albanian immigrants, and the
authorities in Athens fear that a flood of Kosovo Albanian refugees
could unsettle their land.
</P>
<P>
   Only belatedly last week did France, with its uneasy immigrant
population, reverse its refusal to accept even small numbers of
refugees. And, after providing sanctuary for some 300,000 Bosnians,
many Germans feel they have done enough. Such thinking underpins
European calls for a postwar reconstruction strategy on the scale
of the Marshall Plan to stabilize the Balkans into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority should be to look after people in the region
where they have sought refuge and with which they are linked by
language and culture,'' said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of
Germany. ``Any other policy would make us de facto accomplices of
Belgrade's policy of deportation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in Germany, of course, that the Kosovo campaign conjures
the sharpest dilemma of all, testing many of the nation's postwar
assumptions and straining the unity of its coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of German troops going to war _ in the Balkans of all
places _ deeply offends many Germans nurtured on postwar pacifism.
But the notion that, as a NATO member and European leader, modern
Germany should stand by is equally repellent, particularly to those
who have learned in school that they bear a special responsibility
to guard against a revival of the atrocities that mark their
nation's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given our German history,'' Schroeder said, ``we cannot leave
any doubt about our reliability, determination and steadfastness.''

VIOLENCE, EVEN BEFORE THE INTERNET

   Long before two teen-aged boys began their shooting rampage last
week at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., long before
violent video games, the Internet and nihilistic industrial rock
music, America's young were committing occasional acts of
destruction and violence. If the following examples fail to show a
pattern, it may be because there is none.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, 17-year-old Kenneth Skinner burned an apartment
building in San Francisco, killing eight people. Although the
building was on his paper route, he said he knew none of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Starkweather was 19 in 1958 when he led Caril Fugate,
14, on a weeklong killing spree across Nebraska and Wyoming in
which 11 people were shot, stabbed and strangled to death. Miss
Fugate, who confessed to killing her mother with a shotgun when she
threatened Starkweather, was sentenced to life in prison. Hours
before his death in the electric chair, Starkweather was asked if
he would donate his eyes for medical use. ``Hell no,'' he said.
``No one ever did anything for me. Why should I do anything for
anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1966, Charles Whitman, 24, an expert marksman and a
former Eagle Scout and marine, killed his wife and mother. Then he
took a footlocker full of ammunition, shotguns, rifles, Spam
sandwiches and water to a 27-story clock tower at the University of
Texas in Austin, where he was a junior. He shot 46 people in an
hour and a half, killing 16 before he was killed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed a tumor pressing on his hypothalamus. The
psychiatrist he had begun seeing a few months before revealed that
Whitman said he was ``thinking about going up on the tower and
shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, 18-year-old Robert Benjamin Smith took seven
female hostages in a beauty school and salon in Mesa, Ariz., and
fatally shot five of them, including a 3-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   He waited for the police, then confessed and cited as his
motivation the crimes of Whitman and those of Richard Speck, who
had killed eight student nurses in Chicago that year. ``I just
wanted to get myself a name,'' Smith said at the time. Smith's
student counselor, who was also the basketball coach at Mesa High
School, blamed his ``lack of physical coordination.'' Smith was
sentenced to death but won an appeal and remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Anthony Barbaro, an 18-year-old in Olean, N.Y., entered
his high school, which was closed for Christmas, and set several

the school's rifle team, shot him dead, then fired from a
third-floor window at firemen and passersby, killing two more

handmade bombs and a diary detailing five months of planning the
attack. Before he hanged himself in his cell, Barbaro told his
uncle that ``the pressure just got the best of me.''

school yard from the window of her house in San Carlos, Calif.
Using the .22-caliber rifle her father had given her for Christmas

   Long before two teen-aged boys began their shooting rampage last
week at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., long before
violent video games, the Internet and nihilistic industrial rock
music, America's young were committing occasional acts of
destruction and violence. If the following examples fail to show a
pattern, it may be because there is none.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, 17-year-old Kenneth Skinner burned an apartment
building in San Francisco, killing eight people. Although the
building was on his paper route, he said he knew none of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Starkweather was 19 in 1958 when he led Caril Fugate,
14, on a weeklong killing spree across Nebraska and Wyoming in
which 11 people were shot, stabbed and strangled to death. Miss
Fugate, who confessed to killing her mother with a shotgun when she
threatened Starkweather, was sentenced to life in prison. Hours
before his death in the electric chair, Starkweather was asked if
he would donate his eyes for medical use. ``Hell no,'' he said.
``No one ever did anything for me. Why should I do anything for
anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1966, Charles Whitman, 24, an expert marksman and a
former Eagle Scout and marine, killed his wife and mother. Then he
took a footlocker full of ammunition, shotguns, rifles, Spam
sandwiches and water to a 27-story clock tower at the University of
Texas in Austin, where he was a junior. He shot 46 people in an
hour and a half, killing 16 before he was killed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed a tumor pressing on his hypothalamus. The
psychiatrist he had begun seeing a few months before revealed that
Whitman said he was ``thinking about going up on the tower and
shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, 18-year-old Robert Benjamin Smith took seven
female hostages in a beauty school and salon in Mesa, Ariz., and
fatally shot five of them, including a 3-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   He waited for the police, then confessed and cited as his
motivation the crimes of Whitman and those of Richard Speck, who
had killed eight student nurses in Chicago that year. ``I just
wanted to get myself a name,'' Smith said at the time. Smith's
student counselor, who was also the basketball coach at Mesa High
School, blamed his ``lack of physical coordination.'' Smith was
sentenced to death but won an appeal and remains in prison.

SHAM SURGERY RETURNS AS A RESEARCH TOOL

<P>
   In 1939, long before high-tech drugs came along to treat the
chest pain known as angina, an Italian surgeon named Fieschi
devised a simple technique. Reasoning that increased blood flow to
the heart would ease his patients' pain, he made tiny incisions in
their chests and tied knots in two arteries. The results were
spectacular. Three quarters of all patients improved.'' One third
were cured.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, the National Institutes of Health paid a
young cardiologist in Seattle, Dr. Leonard A. Cobb, to conduct a
novel test of the Fieschi technique. Cobb operated on 17 patients.
Eight had their arteries tied; the other nine got incisions,
nothing more. In 1959, the New England Journal of Medicine
published his findings: The phony operations worked just as well as
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   That was beginning of the end of the procedure, known as
internal mammary artery ligation; within two years, it became a
footnote in the medical history texts. It was also the beginning
and the end, apparently, for sham surgery in this country. By the
early 1970s, an ethics revolution had transformed human
experiments, and the idea of surgery as placebo was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Unthinkable until now. Sham surgery is on the rise, to the
horror of some doctors who say it is immoral and to the delight of
others who say it is time to apply the same rigorous scientific
standards to surgery as to the rest of the medical profession. And
with it comes a host of thorny questions.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the first sham brain surgery study were reported
last week in Toronto by a team of neurologists. Forty people with
Parkinson's disease participated. Each had neurosurgery: four tiny
holes, drilled through the forehead into the skull. But only half
got the injections of fetal cells that might have repaired their
damaged brains; the other half got nothing. One year later, three
members of the placebo group said their symptoms had improved.
</P>
<P>
   The study has drawn praise from officials at the National
Institutes of Health, who paid for it, but also criticism from
other quarters. ``A placebo is truly inert and harmless,'' said Dr.
Arthur Caplan, the bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.
``This is not a placebo. It is a phony surgical operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Caplan's protests, there are similar studies underway,
in part because the federal government is requiring them and in
part because new, less invasive, surgical methods make them
feasible. Two other groups researching Parkinson's are running sham
neurosurgery tests. A Rhode Island biotech company,
Cytotherapeutics, is using phony operations to study a treatment
for cancer pain that inserts analgesic capsules into the fluid at
the base of the spine. In Houston, the Department of Veterans'
Affairs is sponsoring a program to see if arthroscopic surgery, a
common treatment for knee injuries, works for osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we so well accept a placebo in medicine trials, drug
trials, why don't we accept it in surgery trials?'' asked Dr. Nelda
Wray, chief of general medicine at the VA Hospital in Houston. ``My
hope is for us to critically think about the risk of the placebo,
and if we can reduce it, we should think about doing placebo trials
before we disseminate surgical procedures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Weighing the risks and benefits, however, is not a simple task.
The 180 patients in Dr. Wray's study, for instance, will be placed
under general anesthesia. Dr. Baruch Brody, an ethicist at Baylor
University who advised Dr. Wray, said he approved the design
because the risks of sedation have dropped substantially in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The placebo effect in medicine is well-documented. The word is
Latin, from the Catholic prayer for the dead, meaning ``I shall
please.'' In centuries past, doctors used placebos to placate
problem patients. ``You gave them something to send them away
happy,'' said Anne Harrington, a medical historian at Harvard
University. Experts estimate that 30 percent of all patients
getting placebo treatment today improve.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is profound in disorders like Parkinson's, where
patients have good days and bad, and in those diseases where pain
is common. And it is likely to be especially powerful in an
intervention as dramatic as surgery, said Dan Moerman, a medical
anthropologist at the University of Michigan at Dearborn. ``There
is probably more need for placebo tests in surgery,'' he said,
``than in other areas of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the Food and Drug Administration decreed that
placebo-controlled clinical trials, those in which half the
patients are treated and half get dummy pills, were the gold
standard for new drug approvals. Traditionally, the FDA has taken a
hands-off approach to surgical innovations. But that is changing,
now that biotech firms are using surgery to implant genetically
engineered cells that the agency classifies as drugs. When Genzyme
Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., proposed injecting pig cells into the
brains of Parkinson's patients, the agency insisted on a placebo
design.
</P>
<P>
   The patients in all the studies know they stand a chance of not
being treated. But keeping patients in the dark can pose problems
beyond performing fake operations, as Genzyme found. The patients
getting the pig cells will receive anti-rejection drugs and
antibiotics, standard fare for transplant patients. The placebo
patients will get dummy anti-rejection pills. But making fake
antibiotics that look, taste and smell like the real thing was
impossible, said Dr. J. Stephen Fink, a neurologist at Genzyme, and
so the sham surgery patients will get real antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the ethics board at Columbia Presbyterian Center
in New York City, which helped run the fetal cell experiment
reported last week, to turn down Genzyme's project. The research is
now proceeding elsewhere. ``We really struggled with the
decision,'' Fink said, ``because it isn't an ideal thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom in ethics circles is that in routine health
care, intentionally deceiving patients is wrong. But the debate
over sham surgery raises an obvious question: If phony operations
can help people, why not just do them? ``That,'' said Dr. Wray, the
Texas knee researcher, ``is an important point. What to do with it,
medicine is going to have to decide.''

BOTH A VICTIM OF RACIAL PROFILING _ AND A PRACTITIONER

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The spring day was bright and sunny enough for
sunglasses, yet cool enough to require a sweatshirt and baggy sweat
pants. As I walked along a busy street in the predominantly white
northwest Washington neighborhood where I lived, I hardly thought
that my clothing or, more important, my dark skin would attract the
attention of the police.
</P>
<P>
   But sure enough, after a few blocks, a brown and white cruiser
from the Capital Police suddenly pulled alongside. A white officer
jumped out and demanded to know what I was doing there. I live
here, I stammered, somewhat stunned. Incredulous, he asked to see
some identification. I produced a driver's license verifying that I
lived a few blocks away _ that this was, indeed, my neighborhood.
He seemed satisfied. I was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you stopping me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a burglary in the area and you fit the description
of the suspect,'' he answered, sounding surprised at what he
clearly regarded as a cheeky question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah?'' I replied. ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly gave me the name of a street where the crime
allegedly had occurred and departed, leaving me standing on the
sidewalk, seething. I later called the local police precinct to
check out this supposed burglary, and was not surprised to find out
that there was no report of any break-in on that street. The
officer's explanation, I assumed, had been concocted to cover up
what really had happened _ a random stop of a black man who to the
officer's eye did not fit the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the fatal shooting last month of an unarmed West
African immigrant by members of the Street Crimes Unit of the New
York City police, the issue of whether the police target minorities
for questioning and searches has been thrust onto center stage.
Figures compiled by the New York police show that in the 20
precincts where the Street Crimes Unit has been most active, 63
percent of the people stopped and frisked were minorities. Last
week investigators in New Jersey announced that a two-year study of
random stops on the New Jersey Turnpike showed that roughly
three-fourths of the people whose cars were halted and searched by
state troopers were black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are stark, and to civil rights leaders and liberal
politicians proof of the use of racial profiling by police. But the
figures give little sense of the depth of anger of people like me
singled out evidently because of race or ethnicity. The incident
left me frustrated and irate. (At the time I was in my mid-40s but
often could pass for someone much younger.) I thought: I'm a
middle-class black man who works hard, pays his taxes, keeps out of
trouble and tries to treat people with dignity and respect. Why
should I be an object of suspicion?
</P>
<P>
   I railed at the injustice of it all. Yet, as my anger cooled, I
asked myself a harder question: Hadn't I done the same thing
myself?
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to the time back in the early 1970s when, as a
college student in New York City, I supported myself by driving a
taxi at night. In many ways it was a great job for a student _
flexible hours, good pay, a way to meet interesting people,
especially women. It could also be dangerous. In three years, I was
held up twice; once at gunpoint, once when I let a passenger sit
next to me in the front seat and he put a knife to my throat. Both
times the perpetrators were young black men.
</P>
<P>
   Fear chastens you. I did not quit driving a taxi. I liked the
job too much. But I became more choosy about who I let in my cab. I
still picked up black women, older men, couples, families and men
dressed in suits. But my sense of tolerance and racial solidarity
was tested every time a casually dressed young black man,
especially one in sneakers, tried to hail my cab. Most times, I
drove right by. I sometimes wondered about their reaction, but I
kept thinking that if I guessed wrong, I could pay for my mistake
with my life.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, I was engaging in my own form of racial
profiling. But I rationalized. Racism, I told myself, would be to
decline to pick up every black person who hailed my cab. What I was
doing was playing the odds, playing it safe, taking no chances.
Looking back, I realized that those I declined to pick up looked
remarkably like I did when the cop stopped me as I walked down a
Washington street.
</P>
<P>
   As I contemplated this, my anger spread to many targets: the
police officer who had confronted me, and the young black hoodlums
whose criminal behavior had made the officer suspicious of all
African-American men in the first place. And I resented the
country's history of racism, which helped to ensure that the
presence of a black person in a leafy, affluent neighborhood of
Washington was still a rare sight.
</P>
<P>
   The nexus of race, crime and stereotyping raises difficult
questions that are often ignored. Even as crime rates tumble, young
black men still commit a disproportionate share of serious
offenses, a fact that is driven home in metropolitan areas by
television's seemingly incessant airing of crime news. And whether
the fear stems from real experience or media-driven perceptions,
people _ police and civilian, white and black _ play the odds all
the time when it comes to how they view and respond to young black
men.
</P>
<P>
   Too often the country fails to acknowledge how widespread the
practice is. Two years ago, at a town hall meeting on race in
Akron, Ohio, President Clinton asked a group of whites who had
joined him onstage whether they felt fear when they saw a young
black man on the street who was not well dressed. A number
sheepishly raised their hands. Clinton thanked them for their
honesty. I sat there wondering, ``Mr. President, why don't you ask
the black participants the same question?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the seemingly clear-cut statistics on racial profiling
don't tell the whole story. New York's Street Crimes Unit did
indeed stop and frisk a disproportionately large number of black
men. Yet in those same precincts, 71 percent of the suspects, as
described by their victims, were black men.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, New Jersey state troopers arrested or seized
contraband from 13.5 percent of the minorities whose cars were
searched on the turnpike, compared with 10.5 percent of the whites.
At first blush that seems like a sizable difference. But then
consider that the troopers stopped three times as many non-whites
or Hispanics as others: Racial profiling hardly seems to be
producing enough arrests to justify the effort _ or the heartache.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the biggest argument against targeting some people
as suspects based on their race, beyond the constitutional argument
of equal treatment before the law. With crime rates tumbling in
virtually every big city in the land, racial profiling may have
outlived its usefulness. Perhaps if I were a young New York City
cab driver today I would not be as wary of young black men as I
once was. With the streets safer, it could be time for the public
and the police to shed the kind of attitude I held nearly three
decades ago _ the attitude that followed me into middle-aged
respectability on a Washington street.

   But sure enough, after a few blocks, a brown and white cruiser
from the Capital Police suddenly pulled alongside. A white officer
jumped out and demanded to know what I was doing there. I live
here, I stammered, somewhat stunned. Incredulous, he asked to see
some identification. I produced a driver's license verifying that I
lived a few blocks away _ that this was, indeed, my neighborhood.
He seemed satisfied. I was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you stopping me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a burglary in the area and you fit the description
of the suspect,'' he answered, sounding surprised at what he
clearly regarded as a cheeky question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah?'' I replied. ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly gave me the name of a street where the crime
allegedly had occurred and departed, leaving me standing on the
sidewalk, seething. I later called the local police precinct to
check out this supposed burglary, and was not surprised to find out
that there was no report of any break-in on that street. The
officer's explanation, I assumed, had been concocted to cover up
what really had happened _ a random stop of a black man who to the
officer's eye did not fit the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the fatal shooting last month of an unarmed West
African immigrant by members of the Street Crimes Unit of the New
York City police, the issue of whether the police target minorities
for questioning and searches has been thrust onto center stage.
Figures compiled by the New York police show that in the 20
precincts where the Street Crimes Unit has been most active, 63
percent of the people stopped and frisked were minorities. Last
week investigators in New Jersey announced that a two-year study of
random stops on the New Jersey Turnpike showed that roughly
three-fourths of the people whose cars were halted and searched by
state troopers were black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are stark, and to civil rights leaders and liberal
politicians proof of the use of racial profiling by police. But the
figures give little sense of the depth of anger of people like me
singled out evidently because of race or ethnicity. The incident
left me frustrated and irate. (At the time I was in my mid-40s but
often could pass for someone much younger.) I thought: I'm a
middle-class black man who works hard, pays his taxes, keeps out of
trouble and tries to treat people with dignity and respect. Why
should I be an object of suspicion?
</P>
<P>
   I railed at the injustice of it all. Yet, as my anger cooled, I
asked myself a harder question: Hadn't I done the same thing
myself?
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to the time back in the early 1970s when, as a
college student in New York City, I supported myself by driving a
taxi at night. In many ways it was a great job for a student _
flexible hours, good pay, a way to meet interesting people,
especially women. It could also be dangerous. In three years, I was
held up twice; once at gunpoint, once when I let a passenger sit
next to me in the front seat and he put a knife to my throat. Both
times the perpetrators were young black men.
</P>
<P>
   Fear chastens you. I did not quit driving a taxi. I liked the
job too much. But I became more choosy about who I let in my cab. I
still picked up black women, older men, couples, families and men
dressed in suits. But my sense of tolerance and racial solidarity
was tested every time a casually dressed young black man,
especially one in sneakers, tried to hail my cab. Most times, I
drove right by. I sometimes wondered about their reaction, but I
kept thinking that if I guessed wrong, I could pay for my mistake
with my life.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, I was engaging in my own form of racial
profiling. But I rationalized. Racism, I told myself, would be to
decline to pick up every black person who hailed my cab. What I was
doing was playing the odds, playing it safe, taking no chances.
Looking back, I realized that those I declined to pick up looked
remarkably like I did when the cop stopped me as I walked down a
Washington street.
</P>
<P>
   As I contemplated this, my anger spread to many targets: the
police officer who had confronted me, and the young black hoodlums
whose criminal behavior had made the officer suspicious of all
African-American men in the first place. And I resented the
country's history of racism, which helped to ensure that the
presence of a black person in a leafy, affluent neighborhood of
Washington was still a rare sight.
</P>
<P>
   The nexus of race, crime and stereotyping raises difficult
questions that are often ignored. Even as crime rates tumble, young
black men still commit a disproportionate share of serious
offenses, a fact that is driven home in metropolitan areas by
television's seemingly incessant airing of crime news. And whether
the fear stems from real experience or media-driven perceptions,
people _ police and civilian, white and black _ play the odds all
the time when it comes to how they view and respond to young black
men.
</P>
<P>
   Too often the country fails to acknowledge how widespread the
practice is. Two years ago, at a town hall meeting on race in
Akron, Ohio, President Clinton asked a group of whites who had
joined him onstage whether they felt fear when they saw a young
black man on the street who was not well dressed. A number
sheepishly raised their hands. Clinton thanked them for their
honesty. I sat there wondering, ``Mr. President, why don't you ask
the black participants the same question?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the seemingly clear-cut statistics on racial profiling
don't tell the whole story. New York's Street Crimes Unit did
indeed stop and frisk a disproportionately large number of black
men. Yet in those same precincts, 71 percent of the suspects, as
described by their victims, were black men.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, New Jersey state troopers arrested or seized
contraband from 13.5 percent of the minorities whose cars were
searched on the turnpike, compared with 10.5 percent of the whites.
At first blush that seems like a sizable difference. But then
consider that the troopers stopped three times as many non-whites
or Hispanics as others: Racial profiling hardly seems to be
producing enough arrests to justify the effort _ or the heartache.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the biggest argument against targeting some people
as suspects based on their race, beyond the constitutional argument
of equal treatment before the law. With crime rates tumbling in
virtually every big city in the land, racial profiling may have
outlived its usefulness. Perhaps if I were a young New York City
cab driver today I would not be as wary of young black men as I
once was. With the streets safer, it could be time for the public
and the police to shed the kind of attitude I held nearly three
decades ago _ the attitude that followed me into middle-aged
respectability on a Washington street.

THE STRESSES OF YOUTH, THE STRAINS OF ITS MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   The killing spree by two young fans of computerized gladiator
matches and gut-wrenching industrial rock last week in Littleton,
Colo., was a calamity measured in lives lost and damaged. But the
tragedy at Columbine High School also marked yet another battle
over the meanings and effects of youth culture.
</P>
<P>
   News analysts have dwelled on the ominous details of the leisure
pursuits of the youths, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18. The
boys had obsessively played cartoonishly bloody video games like
Doom and Quake, worn the black clothing long favored by hard-rock
fans and listened to the operatically gruesome music of Marilyn
Manson and the German bands Rammstein and KMFDM. They also appear
to have idolized Adolf Hitler, which is not true of many young
people who share their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports called the youths Goths, but practitioners of that
lifestyle, which favors more romantic music and androgynous
fashions, quickly declared that real Goths are not violent, racist
or fans of Marilyn Manson. The music industry also distanced itself
from the boys. Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry
Association of America, expressed sympathy for the victims but
insisted that music ``does not drive teen-agers to violent
despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM, whose ferocious lyrics Harris had
posted on his Web site, released a statement saying his group
steadfastly denounced ``war, oppression, fascism and violence
against others.'' Marilyn Manson called the killings ``tragic and
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, psychiatrists and social workers offered the familiar
argument that popular images of carnage inevitably affect
susceptible youths, while editorial page writers wondered how two
young men with such floridly grisly tastes could proceed unnoticed
by parents or peers. Yet the limited nature of the continuing
debate about extreme popular culture points to how such an
oversight could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do either the advocates or the enemies of popular culture
approach the subject with clarity and close attention. KMFDM is a
case in point. The group, which recently disbanded, has long been
an industrial-rock pioneer, blending machine-generated dance beats
with pop melodies and random dissonance. Its lyrics are harsh, like
its sound, sometimes expressing destructive urges in blatant terms.
One that Harris might have taken to heart, from the song
``Piggybank,'' reads, ``If I had a shotgun, I'd blow myself to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments, enforced by the music's body-thumping rush,
could be felt by a troubled listener as a prod toward destruction.
But like Harris' other favorites _ Rammstein and Marilyn Manson _
KMFDM links the tumult it generates to a longing for inner peace.
The group also has an absurdist side, obvious in performance, as
the 7-foot-tall cross-dressing vocalist En Esch vies for attention
with Konietzko, who appears as a Mad Max-like antihero. Humor is
just one way these artists tell their fans that they do not mean to
be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   Today's extreme rock music, like most popular culture, sends a
swarm of mixed messages. Its makers can be calculatedly brutish,
and often fail when they try for subtlety. After all, they are
operating in exile from adulthood, expected to be immature. Yet
even the rawest extreme music offers adolescents a symbolic
language with which to express the confusion they already feel.
Communicating the anguish of victims and outcasts in a voice of
vengeance and aggression, it theatricalizes rage.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans simply leave their frenzy at the concert hall door.
But organized adult responses to this difficult music often fail to
grasp the difference between metaphor and reality.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The attempt to regulate popular culture is evident in the
nationwide phenomenon of gang- and cult-awareness seminars that
associate an interest in extreme rock with mental illness, only
confirms the fears, or fantasies, of many fans that they are doing
something terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Steve Rickard of the Denver Police Department, who gave
one such seminar to students at Columbine High School only three
weeks before the shootings there, hopes parents will look harder at
the culture their children consume _ if only to be better equipped
to dissuade them. ``Could you look your mother in the eye and
defend it?'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rickard, who said he had deeply examined the materials he
criticizes, argued against separating one's tastes from one's self.
``I tell the kids they are who their friends are, and that to a
certain extent, you are what you expose your mind and body to,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people do feel essentially tied to artists they
admire. Some need help to navigate their passions. Teachers have
long showed students how to grasp the nuances literature and
history. But instead of actually exploring youth culture in the
company of young people, many adults debate its legality among
themselves. Critics quote lyrics out of context and misinterpret
jokes as threats. Advocates _ often culture industry professionals
_ stress the First Amendment while expressing personal distaste for
adolescent fare. The artists themselves grow sullen and silent.
</P>
<P>
   Popular art aimed at adolescents often trades in alienation.
Adults who try to comprehend it violate the generational boundary
that is part of its appeal. They risk looking foolish and being
ignored. But it is impossible to understand young people apart from
their interpretations _ and misinterpretations _ of the fashions
and fads they love, for they add to the sense of self that leads
them to act.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the failure of anyone to gaze across this gap
apparently aided disaster.

 IN POLITICS, HE WHO JOKES LEAST LAUGHS LAST. A PITY.  (The Week in
Review) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN SOLOMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If the American people wanted Bob Hope as their president,''
Jimmy Carter once remarked, ``they would have elected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's political demise probably had more to do with the
presence of gas lines than a lack of punch lines, but it's still
ironic that he was replaced by an ex-actor who used humor as
successfully as any politician this century. In fact, Ronald Reagan
is one of only a handful of elected officials in the nation's
history who have distinguished themselves with their wit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, alas, the pronouncements of politicians seem more
humorless than ever. That's probably because, in this era of
heightened sensitivities and ubiquitous cameras, an off-the-cuff
quip can bring you a world of grief (though politicians' private
peccadillos often provide laughs enough). So whether you're a
stolid Al Gore or a relentlessly sunny Elizabeth Dole, it's best to
stay on message while minimizing the ad-libs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unscripted humor is an important element in the lives of
Americans. Shouldn't it be more central to American politics? Why
shunt it off to specially demarcated jocularity zones like
``Politically Incorrect'' or the Gridiron Club? Even those events
lately have been more awkward than amusing. At the White House
Correspondents Dinner next weekend, President Clinton has the
awkward pleasure of honoring a Newsweek reporter for his work
uncovering the Monica Lewinsky matter. That'll be almost as funny
as Paula Jones' appearance at last year's dinner. (``But other than
that, Mrs. Clinton, how was the meal?'')
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the voters of Minnesota were telling the political
establishment something last November when they elected a former
pro wrestler governor. Maybe they were saying that American
politics is as funny as a full Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The political hilarity dearth cannot be denied. It was amply
illustrated recently by the publication of ``Great Political Wit''
(Nan A. Talese/Doubleday) by former Sen. Bob Dole, who has a
well-deserved reputation for being a funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet _ and this is telling _ the book doesn't include any
examples of humor from his 1996 presidential campaign. Why? Because
there weren't any. His advisers felt it was too perilous to let
Dole be Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dole was gun-shy after his disastrous yet sharply witty
vice presidential run in 1976. ``I was supposed to go for the
jugular and I did,'' he observed afterward. ``My own.''
</P>
<P>
   At such a divisively partisan time, a lighter tone could help.
Reagan knew how to deploy humor when the chips were down. Who else
could laugh off an assassin's attack with lines like, ``Honey, I
forgot to duck,'' and, in a quip directed at his surgery team, ``I
hope you're all Republicans''?
</P>
<P>
   Dole wasn't the only Senate bigwig to use laughter to grease the
legislative wheels. Everett Dirksen, the former Senate minority
leader, came up with memorable quips like, ``I am a man of fixed
and unbending principles _ the first of which is to be flexible at
all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, more funny people would run for office. Many who
snickered about the prospect of Congressman Sonny Bono soon
welcomed the sense of humor and perspective that the California
Republican brought to Washington. Rep. Morris ``Mo'' Udall was a
pro basketball player before entering politics, but he could also
have been a professional humorist. ``The public has spoken,'' Udall
declared after withdrawing from the 1976 presidential race. ``The
bastards.''
</P>
<P>
   It would help if more American originals like Jesse Ventura and
Fred Tuttle threw their hats into the ring. Ventura's successful
gubernatorial candidacy in Minnesota is by now legendary. And ol'
Fred, an endearing Vermont dairy farmer who won the Republican
Senate primary, might have done even better last November if he
hadn't gone and endorsed his opponent, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN's coverage of the British House of Commons has provided
Americans with a refreshing view of a deliberative body where
clever repartee is required. Hail C-SPAN, beacon for the humorously
challenged!
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if politicians talked in Washington the way they talk on
``Imus in the Morning.'' If they loosened up. Were candid. Laughed
at themselves. Of course, that can't happen unless the public cuts
politicians some slack if they happen to misspeak.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jimmy Carter seemed to realize the value of humor by the
end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank all the people who supported me,'' he told
the assembled press corps, waiting a beat before turning to his
wife with a grin. ``Thank you, Rosalynn.''

leader, came up with memorable quips like, ``I am a man of fixed
and unbending principles _ the first of which is to be flexible at
all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, more funny people would run for office. Many who
snickered about the prospect of Congressman Sonny Bono soon
welcomed the sense of humor and perspective that the California
Republican brought to Washington. Rep. Morris ``Mo'' Udall was a
pro basketball player before entering politics, but he could also
have been a professional humorist. ``The public has spoken,'' Udall
declared after withdrawing from the 1976 presidential race. ``The
bastards.''
</P>
<P>
   It would help if more American originals like Jesse Ventura and
Fred Tuttle threw their hats into the ring. Ventura's successful
gubernatorial candidacy in Minnesota is by now legendary. And ol'
Fred, an endearing Vermont dairy farmer who won the Republican
Senate primary, might have done even better last November if he
hadn't gone and endorsed his opponent, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN's coverage of the British House of Commons has provided
Americans with a refreshing view of a deliberative body where
clever repartee is required. Hail C-SPAN, beacon for the humorously
challenged!
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if politicians talked in Washington the way they talk on
``Imus in the Morning.'' If they loosened up. Were candid. Laughed
at themselves. Of course, that can't happen unless the public cuts
politicians some slack if they happen to misspeak.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jimmy Carter seemed to realize the value of humor by the
end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank all the people who supported me,'' he told
the assembled press corps, waiting a beat before turning to his
wife with a grin. ``Thank you, Rosalynn.''

 ALL IN FAVOR OF THIS TARGET, SAY YES, SI, OUI, JA  (The Week in
Review)

<P>
   As commander in chief during the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson
insisted on having almost absolute control over what to bomb and
when to bomb it. ``They can't even bomb an outhouse without my
approval,'' he once declared of the American pilots conducting
raids over Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with NATO unleashing its air power against Yugoslavia, an
alliance-full of political leaders is setting its own parameters
for strikes, though not to Johnsonian extremes. And that has bogged
down the military task of choosing targets _ complicated enough
with NATO's multinational command structure _ in a morass of
competing political aims.
</P>
<P>
   France's leadership, including President Jacques Chirac, has
curbed NATO strikes on the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, which
is viewed as less hostile to the West than the government in
Belgrade. Lawyers in Britain review each target its forces hit _
either by air or by cruise missile _ to ensure each is justifiably
a military one.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has vetted the entire list of targets,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said, but has focused on the
most prominent ones, like President Slobodan Milosevic's party
headquarters and a presidential palace in Belgrade, both of which
were struck last week. Although Clinton has signed off on most
targets, his aides say, he has vetoed others, always exhibiting
what his aides describe as a profound aversion to unintended
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate recently, Cohen said, ``Each
president of the NATO countries, at least the major players,'' are
given ``an opportunity to at least express their judgment'' on the
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be in a position of having the commander in
chief or the president of a country have a chance to look the list
over and make at least a recommendation _ without getting into the
politics of it, but deciding whether or not that is a target which,
if hit, would carry such consequences that it would be
counterproductive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an alliance with 19 members, NATO operates by consensus, and
so the objection of any one member can in theory scuttle _ or at
least slow down _ decisions large and small. In reality, though,
those countries with the most forces involved have the greatest
influence.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters near Brussels, Belgium, the process
assures democratic inclusion but is, to some critics, no way to run
a war. ``Running a list of targets through 19 countries cannot be
an effective way of waging war,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began its strikes a month ago with a list of 100 targets,
according to a NATO diplomat. Those targets were selected by
military aides to NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
working in war rooms in Brussels, Germany and Italy. Although the
aides, from various allies, picked targets for their military
value, their choices were limited from the outset by the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's political arm, which is represented day to
day by ambassadors from each member. The council outlined three
phases of attacks, beginning with air defenses and other purely
military targets and escalating to targets at the heart of
Milosevic's power, like those struck last week.
</P>
<P>
   When the attack began, the council approved strikes in only the
first category. Early in the campaign, however, Clark sought and
received authority to move on to the other phases. Having approved
the broad categories of targets, the North Atlantic Council has now
largely removed itself from reviewing specific targets, though
individual governments have not.
</P>
<P>
   Most major targets still have to be cleared through the
political-military chains of command of each ally, leading to
second-guessing that has frustrated some commanders at NATO and the
Pentagon and, inevitably, slowed the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these criss-crossing objectives,'' said Andrew
Krepinevich, executive director at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. ``On the one
hand, NATO's credibility and viability will be best served by a
quick defeat of Milosevic. On the other hand, many NATO members
have reservations about going after certain targets or have
concerns about the risks to pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the United States, the chain of command flows
from Clark, who also serves as commander of all American forces for
Europe and Africa, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon. A
group within the Joint Staff, called the J-2T, works closely with
Clark's planners.
</P>
<P>
   From the Joint Staff, decisions on major targets move up through
Cohen's office and, when considered particularly sensitive, across
the Potomac to the White House. Only then do the targets go back to
Clark's staff with a stamp of approval. A White House aide said
that while Clinton approves targets of supreme sensitivity, he has
yet to display President Johnson's penchant for micro-managing from
afar.
</P>
<P>
   Routine strikes against military targets are no longer reviewed
by political leaders. The major targets are still vetted but
approved more quickly, as evidenced by the attack late Thursday on
Yugoslavia's state-run television, which several allies, led by
France, had previously considered too sensitive to strike because
of the potential threat to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   For all its unwieldiness, NATO's consensus approach serves its
purpose, officials say, assuring that each ally stands behind
whatever plan emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has 18 besides us,'' said Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a
planner at the Joint Staff who has become a leading Pentagon
spokesman on the war. ``They all have a vote on everything. They
can vote on whether we start this or not. They can vote on whether
we continue. They can vote on everything. And that is the strength,
and probably the weakness a little bit, of what we have going on
here. But the beauty of the fact is we are a coalition.''

THE TROUBLE WITH LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF TROUBLE

   SEATTLE _ The boy stalking victims through a video dungeon in
the game Doom, or laughing at the slaughter in Oliver Stone's movie
``Natural Born Killers'' might well be the next person to shoot up
a school in some polished American suburb. But then again, he might
be a quiet scholar with an odd side.
</P>
<P>
   How to tell the difference is one of the more difficult
challenges left by Tuesday's carnage in Colorado, where 15 people
were killed in a long afternoon of gunfire and murder at Columbine
High School in Littleton, south of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the shooting, Americans have been advised to
learn the characteristics of potential killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all do more to recognize and look for the early
warning signals that deeply troubled young people send often before
they explode into violence,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have sought out a checklist of
characteristics of young people prone to school violence, provided
by the National School Safety Center in California, which monitors
lethal action in the schools. Among the things to watch for in a
child:
</P>
<P>
   Mood swings. Loves violent television. Uses drugs or alcohol.
Fond of bad language, name-calling and cursing. Is often depressed.
Likes guns and blowing things up. Anti-social.
</P>
<P>
   The profile could fit most teen-agers on a bad day, and some on
a good day. And sure enough, the day after the killings, news
agencies reported a scattering of arrests of teen-agers around the
country for wearing trench coats, the uniform of a Columbine High
outcast clique of which the killers were said to be a part.
</P>
<P>
   But as educators develop a profile of a child who may murder his
classmates, they are wading into the same territory that airport
security personnel, police departments and federal agents have
already gone _ often with unhappy results.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey announced that
state troopers have improperly stopped and searched blacks on the
New Jersey Turnpike because of profiles developed to catch drug
dealers and other criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the police department's Street Crime Unit has been
accused of indiscriminately frisking black and Hispanic pedestrians
who fit an informal profile of those suspected of carrying guns.
Four members of the unit have been indicted for killing an unarmed,
law-abiding African immigrant street peddler outside his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The police commissioner, Howard Safir, said people were not
stopped because of their race, but because they represented ``the
demographics of known violent crime suspects as reported by crime
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, airport security workers and Secret Service agents
have been trying to develop something similar, with mixed results.
Three years ago, following the Oklahoma City bombing, Clinton
ordered federal agencies to develop a computer tracking system to
flag certain profiles of a ``terrorist type,'' people with
suspicious travel patterns or behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 51,000 of the 71 million people who passed through
United States customs were subject to body searches. Black and
Hispanic travelers were more likely to be searched, even though
they are no more likely to be smugglers or terrorists than other
groups, according to federal surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawsuits around the country, and growing public
pressure, seem likely to curtail widespread profiling based mainly
on race. But profiling for certain criminal tendencies, especially
among students, is gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicting impulses are a product of two very modern
ideas that are often at war with each other. The first is the faith
that social science can protect society by classifying potential
malefactors so they can be detected and isolated before they can do
any damage. The second is the equally powerful conviction that the
act of categorizing is the more serious threat because the innocent
may become entangled in the social scientific net.
</P>
<P>
   There have been six multiple-victim school shootings over the
last 18 months, and the shooters have indeed shared many traits.
Guns and bombs figured prominently. The killers were all unpopular
types, never the jocks or student body leaders. They preferred
black clothing, often trench coats, or military camouflage gear.
They talked about death and acted out death fantasies through video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Doom, for example, the popular game that allows someone to track
and kill people, was a favorite of one of the Colorado shooters,
Dylan Klebold, and also of a 14-year-old boy who murdered three
people in West Paducah, Ky., Michael Carneal. A pop musician who
caters to dark fantasies, Marilyn Manson, always seems to turn up
on the list of child shooter tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the desires of parents for something _ anything _ to
make people feel safer, Mayor Wellington Webb asked promoters to
cancel the Marilyn Manson show scheduled for Friday in Denver,
which they promptly did. He asked the National Rifle Association to
cancel its convention there, too, and school officials announced a
ban on trench coats.
</P>
<P>
   What many schools really seem to want is a metal detector for
personality. But whether sweeping and elemental profiling will
prevent another massacre seems doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what the risk factors are,'' said Dr. Delbert Elliott,
director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at
the University of Colorado. ``But when we get down to explaining
which of those kids will actually do something like this, that's a
tough question.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that often the invisible student is
the one most likely to explode _ not the gang member, bully or
loudmouth. Many students at Columbine High remember the killers as
wallpaper-shy students who played cards in the lunchroom and helped
others with computer problems.

   ``We know what the risk factors are,'' said Dr. Delbert Elliott,
director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at
the University of Colorado. ``But when we get down to explaining
which of those kids will actually do something like this, that's a
tough question.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that often the invisible student is
the one most likely to explode _ not the gang member, bully or
loudmouth. Many students at Columbine High remember the killers as
wallpaper-shy students who played cards in the lunchroom and helped
others with computer problems.

potential shooters is to look for what experts describe as three

   China Stole Design of U.S. Nuclear Warhead
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the furor over China's theft of America's nuclear
secrets began last month, President Clinton said he wasn't so sure
any spying had taken place. But a government report seems to have
stopped the debate. The new analysis concludes that in the 1980s
China stole design information related to America's most advanced
nuclear warhead from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on a select House
panel investigating allegations of illicit transfers of technology
to China met with Clinton Thursday to discuss incidents of Chinese
espionage, including what they described as ``current and ongoing''
problems.

   For ages, the smallpox virus struck humans, taking millions of

   Trade Gap Widens

   The American economy is booming and increasing its imports while
much of the world is drifting in economic doldrums with a
diminishing appetite for American goods. The result has sharply
increased the American trade deficit, which in February reached
$19.4 billion. The deficit renewed debate over just how ``free''
the nation's trade policies should be.

   Fossil hunters in Ethiopia think they have added a new branch to

   Signs of Bygone Days
</P>
<P>
   The age of the American tobacco billboard is over as part of
last year's settlement between tobacco producers and 46 states to
resolve all state claims for health costs related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   These signs gave smoking 50-foot-high credibility and romance,
the theory goes, tempting more people to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pollay, a marketing professor at the University of
British Columbia, says Big Tobacco will simply shift promotion
dollars elsewhere: ``It's like squeezing a balloon. You can shut
down one media, but the problem just moves somewhere else.''
Outsize tobacco signs, around for over a century, were largely
eclipsed by television spots until the early '70s, when smoking ads
were taken off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Something, though, is lost. Tobacco billboards _ whether the
Camel smoke rings in Times Square, the Marlboro Man looming over
Sunset Strip or the old Mail Pouch signs on the sides of barns _
have been a vital piece of this country's landscape, and some
people lament the passing of a genuine art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a time when they will be hanging in craft
museums on the wall next to patchwork quilts,'' the architect
Robert Venturi said of the billboards. Some pre-1970 Mail Pouch
signs, in fact, are now federally protected landmarks. Joe Camel,
at last report, is not.

   You may have heard that the new ``Star Wars'' movie is supposed
to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. How could you not have
heard _ given the torrential promotion surrounding ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phanton Menace,'' coming next month to a multiplex
near you with a milelong line and maybe a couple of kids getting on
your nerves?
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's something curious about all that hype: It's showing
signs of being a little bored with itself.
</P>
<P>
   Last month CBS' ``60 Minutes'' dwelled not on the film itself,
but on the inability of the director George Lucas, a divorced
adoptive father, to find love.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has very high standards,'' the director Francis Ford
Coppola, a Lucas friend, tells Leslie Stahl. ``I mean, he wants
Queen Noor, or Grace Kelly, or someone. She can't be too tall, and
she has to be wonderful with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vanity Fair finds Natalie Portman less than
completely fulfilled after portraying Queen Amidala in the film:
The Long Island, N.Y., teen-ager has decided that acting is
something she can take or leave. ``It's so limiting to say, `This
is it for the rest of my life,''' she says. ``There are so many
things that interest me _ I love math, science, literature,
languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson, who plays a Jedi master, is similarly blase about
his ``Star Wars'' encounter in an interview with Movieline: ``I'm
46 years of age. I'm married with two kids. I love to fly-fish.
That will never change. At the end of the day, you know something?
It's just a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ewan McGregor, who plays the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, told the
BBC he found making the movie ``the epitome of tedium.'' In the
magazine GQ, he as much as says that ``Star Wars'' fans should get
a life: ``Suddenly, all these people are coming to me with posters
to sign. `May the Force be with you.' People have actually said
that to me. `May the Force be with you, Ewan.' I think that's quite
batty.''

some diplomats see the crisis as a defining moment in how the world
thinks about the temporarily and permanently displaced.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has declared as a fundamental war aim that the Kosovo
refugees will get the chance to go back home when the fighting
stops. But that isn't the way most wars have ended in this century.
Look around the world, and the refugees who call themselves
Palestinians, or Cambodians, or Bosnians have by and large not
achieved that dream. In fact, millions of people around the world
have become permanent refugees or, at best, have found new lives in
a new diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   So if NATO can accomplish its war aim, and reverse a campaign of
ethnic cleansing, it would be achieving something quite new.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly will not be easy. Pushing out the Yugoslav
forces who expelled the refugees may well require a NATO invasion.
Even if NATO goes that far, how many Albanians will be eager to
return to a land where their homes have been burned, their husbands
and brothers herded off to unknown fates, their former lives
shattered?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Betts, a political science professor at Columbia
University, warns that in vowing that the refugees will return,
NATO ``may be making a promise we can't keep, or are unprepared to
keep.'' On the other hand, Arthur Helton, who teaches refugee law
at the New York University School of Law, worries that if return
remains the measure of victory or defeat in the conflict, refugees
may be forced or pressured into returning against their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, is it possible that the war will end somewhat
short of the goal, with a deal that implicitly acknowledges that
the refugees will not be able to return safely?
</P>
<P>
   That is already emerging as a fear among refugee advocates and
Albanian-American groups. Some of these people fear that NATO
betrayed a crack in its determination last week when the United
States decided to permit some 20,000 Kosovar refugees being brought
here for safety to be eligible, after a year, to become permanent
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Did this not suggest, some complained, that the refugees might
not be returning to Kosovo once the fighting ends? Would that not
be a victory for ethnic cleansing and its architect, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia began a month ago, the office
of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees estimates that almost
600,000 of Kosovo's 1.6 million ethnic Albanians have left their
homes and crossed into neighboring lands. Ominously, NATO said last
week, Yugoslav forces were herding together another 850,000
Albanians inside Kosovo, possibly preparing to expel them, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The element in this equation that may make this refugee crisis
different from others is that the Albanian Kosovars are more than
mere byproducts of war. They were the declared reason that NATO
went to war. One analyst calls them the ``glue'' of NATO
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   And for NATO's European members, the motives are not simply
altruistic. Even if the refugees don't flood into Western Europe
itself, NATO officials fear that their continued presence may upset
the delicate ethnic balance of Yugoslavia's neighbors, increasing
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond Kosovo, diplomats and relief groups agree that
finding a solution for refugee crises has become one of the world's
greatest challenges. At the century's end, some 22 million people
have been displaced by wars and civil conflicts. Some 2.6 million
Afghan refugees languish in Pakistan, Iran, and camps in other
countries, according to the U.N. Children's Fund. The total number
of African refugees, displaced persons, and still vulnerable
returnees now exceeds 7 million. At least 3.2 million Palestinians
are still classified as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking about these people has evolved over the past
decade,'' said David Malone, the president of the International
Peace Academy, an independent group that studies the United
Nations. ``Before they were considered unfortunate victims of war
whose plight had to be addressed. Over time they have become a
major factor in peace and security. They are increasingly seen as a
source of instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the world is acknowledging that many of these people will
never go home. Still, ``permanent refugees'' pose daunting
challenges not only to relief groups but to the states that might
accommodate them. ``We hate that term; we never use it,'' said
Karen Koning AbuZayd, the refugee commissioner's Washington
representative. ``The term refugee implies a durable solution _
going home, being locally integrated, or being resettled.''
</P>
<P>
   Her agency's insistence on repatriation has sometimes been
criticized when people are encouraged to return to politically and
economically fragile countries. But Ms. AbuZayd says that it is
what most refugees want. In this respect, she said, her agency can
be proud. The numbers of people it cares for had dropped in recent
years from 27 million to 22.5 million, half of them refugees. The
agency has been closing down offices in Central America and Asia.
About 1.7 million Mozambican refugees have gone home.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, in addition to contributing to U.N. relief
efforts, have been extraordinarily generous in taking people in.
Iran, she notes, is the world's biggest refugee host. In the
Balkans, the biggest host has been Yugoslavia, which has had to
accommodate Serbs driven out of Croatia and parts of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But taking in refugees is not what NATO has been talking about.
Getting them home is. And the Bosnian experience may be
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war in 1995 specified
that refugees could return home, but achieving safety for them in
their old neighborhoods was another matter. By mid 1997, Helton
says, about 300,000 refugees and displaced people had returned
home, but very few of these went to areas where they would be in an
ethnic minority. Meanwhile, 900,000 remained internally displaced
and another 900,000 live abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Malone thinks that if Kosovo is cleared of Yugoslav pressure,
the refugees will return. ``So it's important for NATO to decide
soon what kind of Kosovo it wants and can achieve,'' he said. ``An
independent state? An international protectorate? A combination of
the two?''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, diplomats and relief workers have begun to wonder
what precedents are being set in Kosovo. Some think the crisis is
only receiving great attention because these refugees are
Europeans, and few lessons will be learned.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Rubenstein, executive director of Physicians for Human
Rights, a private group, has another fear: ``If intervention to
save peoples' lives fails this time and people are not protected or
permitted to return, the impetus to try again next time may simply
not be there.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ Yet another specter is haunting Europe, and not
just Europe this time: the specter of the permanent refugee.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The NRA's admission of guilt
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you missed it, please note that the National Rifle
Association has confessed: The prevalence and firepower of guns do
have something to do with gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   How else to take the NRA's decision to all but scrap the big
convention it had planned, and had been whooping it up for, in
Denver at the end of this week? The NRA says it is scaling back to
bylaw essentials out of respect for the Columbine High School
community.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. But inasmuch as the NRA has always insisted guns have
nothing to do with gun crime _ indeed, has argued the more guns the
better _ wouldn't greater respect be paid by going on with its
convention as planned _ firearms exhibits, rousing pro-gun speeches
and all? The whole shootin' match, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA was stung recently when Missouri voters rejected a
proposal to let just about anyone carry a concealed gun to malls,
sports events; wherever. The lobby had looked to Denver to ease the
string.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has been pushing in Colorado for legislation that would
cancel Denver's mild gun controls, bar other local governments from
enacting gun laws, forbid lawsuits against firearms manufacturers
and let Coloradans carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The previous, Democratic governor, Roy Romer, had blocked
passage, but with a willing new governor, Republican Bill Owens,
the lawmakers were moving briskly along and the NRA had figured its
Denver session would nail the deal, a nice little convention
finale.
</P>
<P>
   Why back off now? The NRA has two answers to gun violence. One
is more and longer prison terms. But we already have more of our
population in prison than almost every other nation, and typically
for longer sentences, and, anyway, the threat of prison is no
deterrent to the mentally disturbed _ least of all when, as at
Columbine, and awkwardly for the NRA, the shooters willingly give
themselves the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   So the NRA has been pushing its more-guns answer, too _ shooters
shooting shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Gun ownership had appeared to peak in the early '80s, but the
manufacturers came up with more glamorous-seeming, military-style
weapons, greater firepower and faster-firing guns with added
loading capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, if not exactly by coincidence, the NRA persuaded
most state legislatures to drop their traditional laws against
concealed weapons, and the industry is booming anew, huckstering
weapons that can be fired faster, with less frequent reloading and
enhanced killing power. Their easy availability gives new muscle to
the confusions, volatility and imprudence that are the natural
lapses of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   If one answer to gun violence is for everyone to arm themselves,
then the NRA, far from shying from its own convention, should be
going ahead with it with energy and enthusiasm, comforting the
people of Colorado, and especially the wounded and grieving of
Columbine High, with the lobby's vision of the peace that would
come to a population permanently at armed standoff.

PROPAGANDA WARS: PICTURES CAN LIE, AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   For all the words that have been spilled to describe the
strategic, military, and bruisingly human dimensions of the
conflict in Kosovo, it is the images that linger. A crying child. A
hillside of houses, burning in unison. The corpse of an ethnic
Albanian lying in the rubble of an explosion. A grainy
black-and-white video of a railroad bridge in a NATO bomber's
sights, then a train coming out of nowhere, and an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The images carry obvious messages. Which is the problem. What
journalists see of the air war is what the NATO allies want them to
see. What they see of the destruction of Kosovo and the bombardment
of Yugoslavia is what the Yugoslavs want them to see. Only on the
borders of Albania and Macedonia, amid the vast vistas of refugee
misery, do journalists have relatively free access and some ability
to cross-check information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind we are seeing from NATO what
NATO wants us to see,'' said Al Ortiz, executive producer of the
CBS Evening News with Dan Rather. Still, he said, there is a
difference between the images NATO offers and those that emerge
from Yugoslav control. With NATO, ``You're also able to challenge
and question and dig back and check with sources,'' he said.
``You're not able to do that on the Serbian government side.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of verifying images from isolated or carefully
controlled sites has dogged photo agencies since people first
mouthed the untrue truism, ``pictures don't lie.'' Before the
digital era, photographs were manipulated with artful cropping or
darkroom retouching. In 1906, Frederick Cook took a picture of
himself supposedly atop Alaska's Mount McKinley _ but he wasn't
really there. Soviet authorities routinely airbrushed cosmonauts
and commissars out of pictures when they became inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   In a war, when propaganda is a weapon, manipulated images are a
chronic problem. Some are scrapped, but others are passed on to the
public hemmed in with caveats. In effect, the news organizations
seem to be saying, here is an image. You decide what it means.
</P>
<P>
   One of the starkest images from the Kosovo conflict raised the
eyebrows of photo editors when it came onto their computer screens
10 days ago. Nonetheless, it became the leading photograph in Time
and Newsweek last week.
</P>
<P>
   The image, which traveled from the camera of a freelance
photographer to a transmitter in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and then
through the hands of editors in Frankfurt, Germany; Paris, and
Washington, shows the corpse of a middle-aged man. He is lying in a
crater that could have been created by a bomb or artillery strike.
In the background, on a truck, are other bodies, charred and
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   But the body in the foreground is achingly whole, save for an
angry red cavity that covers his calf. The Yugoslav authorities who
took journalists to the site said he was an Albanian refugee
killed, like the others in the image, by a NATO bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mann, Agence France-Presse's director of photography for
North and South America, was at the end of the chain of editors who
passed the photo on. ``I thought, `They picked up that body and
threw it in there,''' she said. ``But I can't substantiate that. At
the same time I thought we had to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other photo and film editors in news organizations around
the world, she is conscious that every image from within Kosovo may
lie. ``We have to question what we're seeing every day,'' Ms. Mann
said. ``You have a sixth sense when you see something _ you know in
your gut something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the corpse was taken by a freelance photographer,
Vuc Brankovic, who, along with other journalists, was escorted to
the site by the Yugoslav authorities. Brankovic was engaged by
European Photopress Agency, for which he had not done much work
before, an editor there said.
</P>
<P>
   Both The Associated Press, which had a television crew at the
site, and Agence France-Presse clearly warned editors of their
concerns. In a caption, AP listed the source as
``APTN/Serb-Controlled Pool.'' Agence France-Press wrote that the
man was ``claimed by Yugoslav authorities to have been killed in a
NATO air raid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operating procedure is to tell everything we can in the
caption,'' said Vincent Alabiso, vice president and executive photo
editor of The Associated Press. ``As far as the editors at the
newspapers and magazines are concerned, they have the photo and the
captions explaining the circumstances. They have to make a judgment
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Agence France-Presse photograph made the pages
of Time and Newsweek last week, much of that context was gone.
Time's tight caption read: ``Whose Fault? NATO admits to a tragic
error, but this photo may have been staged.'' Newsweek's caption
made no reference to these concerns. Its article said that
journalists were taken to a site littered with body parts, ``some
perhaps, repositioned for effect by the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report used a different photo of the scene.
Its caption stated unambiguously, ``Victims of a NATO bomb dropped
on a column of refugees.'' The magazine's editor, Stephen Smith,
said he was concerned that the magazine had been too categorical.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Stephenson, director of photography of Time Magazine,
said of the dead man in the Agence France-Presse photograph:
``Clearly the guy was in this attack on the convoy and was killed.
We don't know if he was killed in the attack and was dragged over
there. We don't know if the crater was made by an earlier bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Mann, a decision not to transmit the image would have
amounted to censorship. ``You need to have people draw their own
conclusions, given as much as you can know about the situation,''
she said. And she added, ``The fact that all the agencies were
there guarantees that the picture is going to be run.''

photographer to a transmitter in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and then
through the hands of editors in Frankfurt, Germany; Paris, and
Washington, shows the corpse of a middle-aged man. He is lying in a
crater that could have been created by a bomb or artillery strike.
In the background, on a truck, are other bodies, charred and
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   But the body in the foreground is achingly whole, save for an
angry red cavity that covers his calf. The Yugoslav authorities who
took journalists to the site said he was an Albanian refugee
killed, like the others in the image, by a NATO bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mann, Agence France-Presse's director of photography for
North and South America, was at the end of the chain of editors who
passed the photo on. ``I thought, `They picked up that body and
threw it in there,''' she said. ``But I can't substantiate that. At
the same time I thought we had to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other photo and film editors in news organizations around
the world, she is conscious that every image from within Kosovo may
lie. ``We have to question what we're seeing every day,'' Ms. Mann
said. ``You have a sixth sense when you see something _ you know in
your gut something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the corpse was taken by a freelance photographer,
Vuc Brankovic, who, along with other journalists, was escorted to
the site by the Yugoslav authorities. Brankovic was engaged by
European Photopress Agency, for which he had not done much work
before, an editor there said.
</P>
<P>
   Both The Associated Press, which had a television crew at the
site, and Agence France-Presse clearly warned editors of their
concerns. In a caption, AP listed the source as
``APTN/Serb-Controlled Pool.'' Agence France-Press wrote that the
man was ``claimed by Yugoslav authorities to have been killed in a
NATO air raid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operating procedure is to tell everything we can in the
caption,'' said Vincent Alabiso, vice president and executive photo
editor of The Associated Press. ``As far as the editors at the
newspapers and magazines are concerned, they have the photo and the
captions explaining the circumstances. They have to make a judgment
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Agence France-Presse photograph made the pages
of Time and Newsweek last week, much of that context was gone.
Time's tight caption read: ``Whose Fault? NATO admits to a tragic
error, but this photo may have been staged.'' Newsweek's caption
made no reference to these concerns. Its article said that
journalists were taken to a site littered with body parts, ``some
perhaps, repositioned for effect by the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report used a different photo of the scene.
Its caption stated unambiguously, ``Victims of a NATO bomb dropped
on a column of refugees.'' The magazine's editor, Stephen Smith,
said he was concerned that the magazine had been too categorical.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Stephenson, director of photography of Time Magazine,
said of the dead man in the Agence France-Presse photograph:
``Clearly the guy was in this attack on the convoy and was killed.
We don't know if he was killed in the attack and was dragged over
there. We don't know if the crater was made by an earlier bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Mann, a decision not to transmit the image would have
amounted to censorship. ``You need to have people draw their own
conclusions, given as much as you can know about the situation,''
she said. And she added, ``The fact that all the agencies were
there guarantees that the picture is going to be run.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Oh, to be late just once!
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, April 28, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a while since I vowed that I was not going to be early
all the time. Everyone else seemingly is late but I have this awful
affliction that causes me to arrive early.
</P>
<P>
   I swore to learn to be on time. If something starts at 7 p.m., I
want to be there at 7 p.m., maybe even as late as 7:02, but not at
6:40. It was my ambition to require others to get up to allow me
into a theater aisle, instead of my having to do so, time after
time, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to be just on time or a few minutes late to weddings,
bar mitzvahs and funerals, instead of arriving preceding the
honorees _ present and passed.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this period of dedication to not being early, I am
sorry to report that I have become even earlier than before. Don't
ask me why, it's just my nature.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other night, I took my grandson to the ball game where
they were giving out souvenir pins to the first 25,000 in
attendance. Not wanting to miss out on getting a pin for my
grandson, we left the house two hours before game time. And got our
pin. Of course, there's weren't 25,000 in the ball park all night,
so I could have come in the fifth inning and still received the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it is for me. Much of the time, I am caused
to be early by worry over traffic. I overestimate how long it will
take me to get somewhere, thinking that some awful accident will
block the route I take and cause me to be late.
</P>
<P>
   So I leave extra early, and of course there is no traffic. I
always arrive for a weekly downtown Tuesday noon luncheon with old
buddies at 11:30 and sit there sipping iced tea until everyone else
arrives _ at 12:15.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I do not learn from my experiences.
</P>
<P>
   I had a great experience last December in discovering how late
you can be and still be on time. I misread my airplane ticket to
London as being for a flight departing at 7 p.m. The ticket read
1700 hours but it's been so long since I was in the military that I
forgot 1700 meant 5 p.m. Arriving at the airport at 4:30 _ which I
thought was my kind of arrival time for a 7 p.m. international
flight _ I was stunned to find out the flight was boarding.
</P>
<P>
   And even more stunned to find out you can get to an
international flight 30 minutes before takeoff _ rather than 2 1/2
hours before _ and still comfortably board.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, I'm still early to everything. Usually when I arrive
too early, I drive around a bit so as not to embarrass myself. This
is particularly true when I am arriving at someone's home. I
learned that lesson when I showed up an hour early to dinner at
someone's house and stunned the hostess, whose hair still was in
rollers.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to be on time, tried harder to be late. But to no
avail. Meanwhile, my wife, who steadfastly resists premature
arrivals, has gotten used to my problem. She's been a fairly good
sport about it, even when we arrive at hockey games seemingly
before the ice is frozen.
</P>
<P>
   My project of not being early is a failure. I will forever be
early. It is an affliction with which I will have to live the rest
of my days. And when my days are over, I would like everyone to get
to my funeral just a few minutes later than early.
</P>
<P>
   Then they could honestly say: ``He would have wanted it that
way.''

BUDGET OF WEEK-IN-REVIEW STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 25, have moved. This final budget adds
RANDOM-VIOLENCE-REVIEW in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   On the section dress page:
</P>
<P>
   WARNING-SIGNS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ The boy stalking victims
through a video dungeon in the game Doom, or laughing at the
slaughter in Oliver Stone's movie ``Natural Born Killers,'' might
well be the next person to shoot up a school in some polished
American suburb. But then again, he might be a quiet scholar with
an odd side. How to tell the difference is one of the more
difficult challenges left by Tuesday's carnage in Colorado. By
Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEE-CRISIS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Yet another specter is
haunting Europe, and not just Europe this time: the specter of the
permanent refugee. With hundreds of thousands of Albanians uprooted
in Kosovo and spilling across the borders of Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro, some diplomats see the crisis as a defining moment in
how the world thinks about the temporarily and permanently
displaced. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-HUMOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today, alas, the
pronouncements of politicians seem more humorless than ever. That's
probably because, in this era of heightened sensitivities and
ubiquitous cameras, an off-the-cuff quip can bring you a world of
grief (though politicians' private peccadillos often provide laughs
enough). So whether you're a stolid Al Gore or a relentlessly sunny
Elizabeth Dole, it's best to stay on message while minimizing the
ad-libs. By John Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   SURGERY-ETHICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Placebo surgery is on the
rise, to the horror of some doctors who say it is immoral and to
the delight of others who say it is time to apply the same rigorous
scientific standards to surgery as to the rest of the medical
profession. And with it comes a host of thorny questions. By Sheryl
Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREME-MUSIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ The killing spree by two young
fans of computerized gladiator matches and gut-wrenching industrial
rock last week in Littleton, Colo., was a calamity measured in
lives lost and damaged. But the tragedy at Columbine High School
also marked yet another battle over the meanings and effects of
youth culture. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   PROFILING-REVIEW (Washington) _ The spring day was bright and
sunny enough for sunglasses, yet cool enough to require a
sweatshirt and baggy sweat pants. As I walked along a busy street
in the predominantly white northwest Washington neighborhood where
I lived, I hardly thought that my clothing or, more important, my
dark skin would attract the attention of the police. But sure
enough, after a few blocks, a brown and white cruiser from the
Capital Police suddenly pulled alongside. A white officer jumped
out and demanded to know what I was doing there. By Steven A.
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOM-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Long before two teen-aged
boys began their shooting rampage last week at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., long before violent video games, the
Internet and nihilistic industrial rock music, America's young were
committing occasional acts of destruction and violence. But finding
a pattern is not easy. By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-REVIEW (New Delhi, India) _ The political turmoil that has
seen five governments come tumbling down here in just six years is
not merely the result of cantankerous rivalries among the country's
political parties or the often venal, self-serving antics of its
politicians. Even more crucial are profound political changes
taking place in hundreds of thousands of villages where most of the
nation's 980 million people live and vote. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-UNITY-REVIEW (London) _ For most of the half-century it is
celebrating in Washington this weekend, NATO's very existence has
been rooted in the idea of a grand design _ to guarantee the safety
of the West against the East, to forge a common defense of
democracy against tyranny, to prepare, in effect, for World War
III. But now, as NATO's forces press their first true combat
mission in a messy conflict in Kosovo, the allies and their
neighbors are discovering that war is not just about the grand
design of thwarting tyranny, but about niggling details and
political line calls. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-BOMBING-REVIEW (Washington) _ As commander in chief during
the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson insisted on having almost absolute
control over what to bomb and when to bomb it. But now, with NATO
unleashing its air power against Yugoslavia, an alliance-full of
political leaders is setting its own parameters for strikes. And
that has bogged down the military task of choosing targets _
complicated enough with NATO's multinational command structure _ in
a morass of competing political aims. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-IMAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ What journalists see of the air
war in Yugoslavia is what the NATO allies want them to see. What
they see of the destruction of Kosovo is what the Yugoslavs want
them to see. Only on the borders of Albania and Macedonia, amid the
vast vistas of refugee misery, do journalists have relatively free
access and some ability to cross-check information. By Felicity
Barringer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Seventeen years have passed since Karen
Jurgensen, the single mom of a 5-year-old daughter, drove a
thousand miles up I-95 to start a job on a newspaper that existed
only in the minds of a few journalistic visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from her husband, she had quit a secure editorial
position on the Miami News and sold her house to ``work for
something that might or might not exist in the future. It was a
leap of faith,'' she recalled. ``I thought then and still think
that USA Today is the most exciting thing going on in journalism in
the country, and I wanted to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami News folded six years after she left. She remarried,
to a lawyer named Bill Leary who works for the U.S. Interior
Department. And on May 1, Karen Jurgensen will replace the retiring
David Mazzarella as editor of USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 50, she will become the first female editor of the
country's largest general-interest newspaper, moving up from her
current post as editor of the editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   Will the 2.3 million readers of USA Today be able to tell that a
woman has taken charge?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said the soft-spoken Jurgensen. ``I'm not out
to make this a woman's newspaper. I hope that everybody will pick
up the paper and think it's relevant to their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As for shattering a glass ceiling for her gender, ``to me it's a
natural progression of what's happened to women in the workplace,''
she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over my professional career, which started in the early '70s
women have sort of infiltrated _ if I can use that word _
newsrooms. And I think it's only natural that women are getting to
the position where they have higher-ranking jobs. We have earned
the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurgensen started as topics editor in the Life section of USA
Today, and has since advanced to special projects editor, editor in
charge of the Life section, cover stories editor, senior editor for
special projects including polling, and since 1991, editor of the
editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, of course, there were sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very beginning I had my daughter in a day-care center that
closed at 6 o'clock and was, at minimum, a 45-minute drive away at
rush hour,'' she said. ``Well, it very soon became obvious that
there was no way this was going to be a workable plan, so I hired
someone to come and be at the house with my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the model that we followed all through her growing up
years. There was somebody at home to take care of her until I got
home. The upside of that is that she has always been proud of what
I do, so she has forgiven me that. We have had a lot of really good
times together. I believe in quality time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Kirsten Thompson, is now a senior at Bryn Mawr
College in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As editorial page editor, she also sacrificed her privacy to
provide a personal perspective to a sensitive women's issue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when journalists were debating whether the media
perpetuates the stigma of rape by not naming victims of the violent
crime, Jurgensen wrote a chilling column describing how she had
been raped 15 years before in North Carolina after leaving work one
evening at the Charlotte News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've helped to hide ourselves away _ and to hide the
prevalence and brutality of rape,'' she wrote. ``And I thought: If
we all spoke up, you would know victims all around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she heard ``from a lot of other people who had been
raped. They want to have someone to talk to and to have a sense
that they are not alone,'' said Jurgensen. ``One woman called and
said she was raped before she was married and had never had the
courage to tell her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was so supportive. It was not like I had to carry
this around by myself any more. It was a wonderful, warm feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting her Danish roots, her first name is pronounced
``CAR-in.'' Growing up in Chapel Hill, N.C., she was called
``Kardi'' by her family because her younger brothers, Mike and
Kris, had trouble with the proper pronunciation. Her father, Kai
Jurgensen, now deceased, was a drama professor at the University of
North Carolina. Her mother, Peggy, died when Karen was in the ninth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Kardi in 1962,'' recalled her 80-year-old stepmother,
Paquita Shafer.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, recently divorced, had left a job at the Raleigh News
and Observer in order to return to her home town, where her family
could help care for her three small children.
</P>
<P>
   She had begun working as a reporter for the local newspaper and
was covering a dance at a teen center called the Catskeller. The
rock 'n' roll music was provided by a local band of high schoolers
led by James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all dancing the watusi. I thought they were all
crazy,'' she said. Spotting a temporarily motionless Jurgensen, ``I
thought she was the only one with any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   So she asked the sensible one to come to the paper the next day
to identify students in photographs of the dance. She found out
that Jurgensen was a reporter for the school newspaper and host of
a local radio program and the daughter of a popular professor who
spoke eight languages fluently.
</P>
<P>
   That professor would soon become Shafer's suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left three dozen roses on my desk and a note that said
'Let's have lunch','' she said. ``I didn't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sensible stepdaughter would go on to major in English and
graduate with honors from UNC. They get together whenever Jurgensen
returns ``to the Southern part of heaven _ which is what we call
Chapel Hill,'' said Shafer.
</P>
<P>
   As chairperson of the board of visitors for the university's
School of Journalism and Mass Communications, Jurgensen returns at
least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is nothing short of splendid,'' said Richard Cole, dean of
the journalism school. ``She is a most astute journalist. I've
known many over the years, and she is right up there with the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``gutsy move'' for Jurgensen to go to USA Today, said
Paul Kaplan, who worked with her at the Miami News and is now
Sunday editor for the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan was metro editor at the News. Jurgensen was features
editor but became Kaplan's assistant _ technically a demotion _ to
gain ``hard news experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very savvy, but in a quiet way. She's definitely not a
screamer,'' he said. ``She treats people well, and they respond to
her management style. She is very direct in her dealings with
people. Very professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Weiss, the current USA Today managing editor for the Life
section, worked with Jurgensen in the ``early, very chaotic days''
of the section. ``She would draw people out, listen, then act,''
said Weiss. ``Her management style is a very collaborative one.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no pigeon-holing of her interests for the section,
Weiss said. ``She liked stories about ordinary people doing
formidable things, entertainment stories with real news, stories
that solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an intelligent, aware human being,'' Weiss said of her
boss-to-be.

<P>
   USA Today has changed since it was dubbed McPaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning it was very much a newspaper that existed in
the heads of a few people, and they had to convey that to the rest
of us. It was very much a vision of those early leaders. Al
Neuharth. John Curley. John Quinn,'' said Jurgensen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of the paper has changed some. We tried in the
beginning to be very different. The assumption was that people had
already gotten the day's news by the time they got to us,'' she
said. ``We don't think that now. We consider that our readers are
news junkies. they have many sources of information. But we think
we have to provide a complete, thorough news report every day, with
our own kind of spark of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the newspaper to have a thorough view of what happened
in the past 24 hours and what will happen in the next 24 hours,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As editorial page editor, she has pressed issues involving
women's rights, such as Title IX gender equity in college sports,
health care and air travel _ ``very important to our readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she bring a woman's perspective to the top post?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to a degree,'' Jurgensen said. ``We have a whole mix
of people here who are male or female and minorities, and I hope we
all bring those points of view to the table when we think about
what to put in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are already challenged in an era where information is
instantly available from the Internet, cable TV and portable
digital phones, and the competition will increase in the future,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Technological change ``is going to get much faster,'' said
Jurgensen. ``The alternatives to newspaper reading will explode.
The challenge is to create a newspaper that appeals to readers in
that environment, that serves them in that environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to help people put into context all this
proliferation of information that is coming at them. There are
many, many voices out there. I hope part of our role will be to
help people sort through that, to know what is believable or not
believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope part of my legacy will be helping discover what is the
journalism of the 21st century.''

 &HT;    Current crop of babies will have plenty of company
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baby Six Billion is already out there in some woman's
womb just waiting to be born, kicking, crying and looking for a
little space to grow up in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months from now, the Earth's population will hit 6
billion, according to U.N. demographers. The big day they project
is Oct. 12. But what happens after that? How much more crowded will
the world become during Baby Six Billion's lifetime?
</P>
<P>
   So much population growth has occurred in the past half-century
that some experts fear that children born in the last year of this
millennium will witness another doubling of the world's population,
leaving them to fight for elbow room amid 12 billion people. But
others say population growth is leveling off dramatically. Indeed,
in many industrial countries, the aging population is failing to
replace itself.
</P>
<P>
   So which will be the bigger problem in the next century: Too
many old people who can't work, or too many young people grasping
for food, water and jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is complicated because every statistic appears true.
Yes, birth rates are rising rapidly in some countries. And yes,
they are falling in many others. Yes, new scourges such as AIDS,
and old curses such as famine, are wiping out tens of millions of
people. And yes, new medical breakthroughs are making it possible
for people to live productively until age 100. Given all of the
contradictions, are any predictions safe?
</P>
<P>
   We do know that the world's population has been growing and, at
least for a while, will continue to grow rapidly. People who were
born before 1950 are members of the first generation to see a
doubling of the world's population. In some countries, the growth
has been spectacular. For instance, this year, India's population
will hit the 1 billion mark. That means two countries, India and
China, will have a combined population of more than 2.2 billion _
about as many people as the entire planet held in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Earth is becoming home to 80 million more people each
year. That's roughly the equivalent of piling another Germany on
top of the planet every Jan. 1. At this rate, land is filling up
fast, especially in urban areas. In 1800, London was the world's
largest city with 1 million people. Today, 326 metro areas have at
least 1 million people, and 16 cities, including Tokyo, Mexico City
and New York, have more than 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Given such growth rates, it would seem safe to predict that the
population will double again in a matter of decades. But
demographers say the factors affecting population are changing.
They note the fertility rate _ that is, the average number of
children born to a woman _ has fallen steadily in most countries
since the 1960s for economic reasons. As people move from farms to
cities, large families become more of an expense than a financial
help.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the big news in population projections is the increase in
early deaths from disease, war and starvation. In some African
countries, for example, as much as one-quarter of the adult
population is infected with the virus that leads to AIDS. Combine
that with the slaughters in Rwanda and starvation in the Sudan, and
the population picture in Africa becomes less than clear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in wealthier European countries, the number of babies
being born has gotten so low that cities soon may start to
depopulate. Demographers say that within a generation in
industrialized countries, one person in four will be over age 65,
up from 1 in 10 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   So what will the new millennium bring: a stressed-out planet
whose resources are being overwhelmed by a burgeoning number of
babies, or an aging world with a declining population? Baby Six
Billion, now entering the second trimester, will have to grow up to
learn the answer.

 &HT;    Commentary: They are our children
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Once again, a shooting spree in a school. We
watch, stunned, as children in Littleton, Colo., flee from the
horror. A camera zooms in on a young man, obviously injured, draped
across an open window.
</P>
<P>
   It does not help to say to ourselves, ``This cannot happen.'' Or
``This cannot happen again.'' It is all too obvious it can, and
does. It numbs us to know we are largely helpless against these
random acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, my stomach wrenches at what it must feel like to
hear the news of a school shooting and then to try desperately to
find out if your child is safe . . . or dead.
</P>
<P>
   One mother raised an even more terrifying thought: ``What if
it's my child who's doing the shooting?''
</P>
<P>
   We shake our heads and say it's impossible. Our children would
never do such a thing. They know better. We taught them to know
right from wrong. But don't we all think that?
</P>
<P>
   Whose children, then, are these who smuggle artillery into
schools and begin shooting everyone in sight? We cannot hide from
this fact: They are our children. They belong to all of us, and
somehow, as a society, we have failed them.
</P>
<P>
   Being human, we immediately seek a scapegoat. It's the media;
it's Hollywood. If they didn't produce such violent shows, if news
coverage didn't fixate on each of these horrible tragedies, if they
didn't glorify violence in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Then we blame the video games in which the only objective is to
kill the opponent, fake blood spurting out after heads have been
ripped off. It's those games. They teach our children to be
violent. They desensitize our children to the consequences of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Or it's the fault of those kids our child hangs out with. Their
parents are never home, or are lazy, or just don't care and so they
leave their children to run wild in the streets doing God knows
what. It's their fault.
</P>
<P>
   We're good at finding people to blame. We're even better at not
blaming ourselves. But I ask again: Whose kids are these? If it
takes a village to raise a child, where is the village when the
child goes dangerously astray?
</P>
<P>
   We come home to our children after yet another tragedy unfolds
and we hold them close. We wrap our arms around them, wanting never
to let them go, believing that if we can just do that, we can keep
them safe. We stroke their hair and touch their cheeks and think of
the young man hanging from a school window in Colorado. We take
deep, gulping breaths and, once again, try to find the words to
help our children understand what they have already seen on
television _ and can never be understood.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 14 years old, I watched on TV as Robert F. Kennedy
was shot down in a California hotel. I saw him lying there, a pool
of blood forming beneath his head, a stunned look upon his face. It
affected me deeply. I had been too young to empathize over his
brother's death five years before, or the subsequent gunning down
of Lee Harvey Oswald. But at 14, you empathize with everything. You
feel the whole world's pain. At 14, I was old enough to despair. I
walked around in shock for days. Finally my mother said to me,
``Vicki, why are you still so upset? It's not like you knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   But, you see, I did know him. I knew him through television.
Good or bad, that's what TV does. It makes events real and close
and ours _ an irrevocable part of our life experience.
</P>
<P>
   And so these deaths in Colorado are real to us. Every one of
them. We do know them. They are our sons and daughters, our
brothers and sisters. Every one of them is an inestimable loss. And
the loss is ours.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Easy labels made to order after killings
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The murderers were militia-types because
of their Army boots and combat fatigues and Confederate battle-flag
patches. It's obvious.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were Goth kids. They listened to Marilyn Manson,
dressed in black coats and once came to school with their faces
painted white.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were white supremacist, Nazi-skinheads types. So
fixated on Nazis they scheduled Hitler's birthday as their killing
day.
</P>
<P>
   No, just the opposite. They were anarchists. Their program was
simple destruction, then exit in a puff of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were apolitical and bought into doom culture _
end-of-the-world predictions, Y2K social breakdown, doomster rock
... .
</P>
<P>
   No, they were alienated, off-in-their-own-little-world
tech-heads. One of them had a Web site, you know. And then all
those bombs. Pretty elaborate. The white supremacist, Goth and
punk-rock stuff were frosting on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were typical of neo-punk,
Euro-death-thrash-rock-listening, ultraviolent, anarcho-Gothic,
Western white-kid Nazi wannabees.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were the Goth-core, white-power, quasi-skinhead,
industrial-punk-heads who listened to bad music from sources that
ranged from industrial oi bands to neo-metal-thrash hate-rock.
Poisonous stuff.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were gamers gone bad, lost in point-and-click gore
fantasies. They played ``Doom'' all the time. They decided to live
out the game.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were simple droogs.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were your garden-variety, angry, white gun-nuts. Those
big, square states in the West are crawling with them. They move
there from normal places. Everyone knows this.
</P>
<P>
   No, they are the harbingers of the coming apocalypse. Just what
you'd expect of a generation growing up in schools without prayer,
connected to an unfiltered Internet and raised by parents who grew
up in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The dead had not been removed from Columbine High School before
easy explanations began rolling in. It used to be enough for
reporters to pronounce: ``the gunman was described as a loner.''
These days, news consumers demand more.
</P>
<P>
   We want to be reassured the murderers were not like our kids.
These were Nazis, black-fingernailed Goth-kids, white punks on
dope, anarchists, doomheads, gun-nuts and alienated losers. Not
like the kids we know.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, we pick a few snippets of what other kids said about
the murderers' short lives, their likes, hates and school
reputations, then find a serviceable label.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, kids are still forming their identity from
fairly crude raw material. This sometimes makes them look alike to
the unpracticed adult eye.
</P>
<P>
   We see bad kids, punks, hippies, preps, jocks, overachievers and
the quiet kid in the back of the room. The kids, however, break
these labels into bewildering subcategories. Where oldsters see A
Quiet Kid in the Back of the Room, kids see A Quiet, Straight-Edge,
Surf-Punk in the Back of the Room.
</P>
<P>
   These nuances are lost on adults. The further we are from high
school, the broader we group the students. When we get far enough
removed from them, we group them so broadly they almost disappear.
They all become Those Kids. And when they all become Those Kids,
people get spooked easily.
</P>
<P>
   Those Kids are killing each other now. So to know that we're
safe, we find ways to make evildoers seem radically different. We'd
like to think they are mutants.
</P>
<P>
   If we blame clothing, music, the Internet or games, if we tell
ourselves mutants did this, we can rest easier. The bad kids will
be easy to spot. And what do you know? They're the same kids who
have been annoying us all along.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect in the days ahead, the troubling truth will emerge
that these were not mutants. They did not turn bad from the
Internet, video games or Marilyn Manson. Evil is not a virus
contracted by casual contact.
</P>
<P>
   When kids try very hard to look strange, they often do it
because they are frightened of how ordinary they really are.
</P>
<P>
   This suspicion scares the rest of us, too. Nazi mutants,
computer-distributed mayhem and bad music are far more reassuring.
It's easier to inveigh against these things than to talk to kids
once in awhile.

 &HT;    Chance at bathroom pay back flushed away
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ How would you like it if someone removed your
bathroom door and then sent 20 kids in to talk to you while you
were trying to concentrate? Friendly, but not conducive to
accomplishing the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby breezes into the boys' restroom and sees his old friend
sitting in the second stall. ``Hi, Buddy, whassappening?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing much right now,'' Buddy answers candidly, wishing his
pal would bug out. Kids love to socialize, but not when their pants
are around their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Exchanges like this could be taking place in schools all over
the country where toilet stalls in the boys' bathrooms have had
their doors offed in a '70s solution to restroom vandalism. It
doesn't work, of course, because kids aren't going to squeal on
each other and no teacher wants to spend his conference period
hanging out in the boys' bathroom to be sure little Johnny isn't
carving things he can't spell into school property.
</P>
<P>
   Girls' restrooms still have doors on the stalls, although I know
from experience, the young ladies are just as capable of
``glyphing'' a few ``hieros'' on the walls as their male
counterparts. And with fewer spelling errors.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' ``convenience'' (as our first-grade teacher so
delicately put it) in the elementary school where I spent six years
and a kindergarten, was straight out of a Bram Stoker novel.
Submerged in the bowels of a dank basement, it was every tyke's
nightmare come true. Trolls lurked around every dim corner, not to
mention the custodian who was known to chop up little kid's who had
to pee, and throw them into the boilers to make heat.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the restroom itself. A work of art _
interiors by A.Hun Design Group. Great lengths of wooden slabs with
holes cut in them every so many feet were suspended over what could
only be described as a trough with water moving sluggishly through
it. I guess it was OK for curious kids who liked to check things
out, but tough on anyone with a low gag factor.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years I put off going until my kidneys screamed for
relief. Once, I even had an accident all over the scrubbed wooden
floor in Mrs. Lenhardt's room. We were reading the play ``Heidi''
aloud. I was Aunt Deirdre (otherwise billed as the kid in the
puddle).
</P>
<P>
   In junior high school there were real toilets that flushed and
doors on the stalls. No locks, but we managed. Friends stood guard
for one another's privacy. That's how I met ``Bad Nancy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of school, I made the mistake of asking her to
watch my door. She agreed. But I had no sooner lifted what had to
be raised, and lowered what had to be dropped, than Bad Nancy
kicked the door in and smashed me in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Once I regained my senses, I began plotting revenge. Bad Nancy
would pay.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, opportunity jumped up and bit me. The art
teacher sent me to the restroom to wash out some paint pots, and
just as I pushed my way through the door, Bad Nancy disappeared
into the No. 1 stall. PAY BACK TIME!
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, I rinsed out the red paint jar and filled it with cold
water.
</P>
<P>
   Then I tiptoed into stall No. 2, stood on the seat, and dumped
the water all over Bad Nancy. If the story had ended there, I'm
sure I would have forgotten all about it by this time, but it
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   About the time I was dumping murky water all over Bad Nancy's
person, the meanest teacher in the whole school caught me midpour.
I made the long march to the principal's office and Bad Nancy had
the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for Bad Nancy is that I have the memory of a
long-tailed elephant. It's been over 50 years now, but every time I
walk into a restroom, I'm reminded of her and that day in the
principal's office. By now she's
</P>
<P>
   probably figured out that I put a curse on her. I have willed
her days and nights to be a succession of toilet stalls with no
doors.

 &HT;    New breed of competitors undercutting big companies
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Compaq Computer Corp. directors search for
ways to get the company back on track, they might get some
inspiration from its division that markets cheap personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Houston-based computer maker badly missed earnings
projections it made earlier this year. True, its stock price is
about half of what it was earlier this year. And true, last
Sunday's ouster of Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer creates
uncertainty among Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But buried under this week's bad news about the world's No. 1
computer maker was the fact that its sales of PCs to consumers grew
at two times the industry rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, because of sub-$1,000 PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pfeiffer's direction, Compaq introduced some of the first
sub-$1,000 PCs about three years ago. Today, low-cost computers
account for nearly one-fourth of all consumer desktop retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Compaq accounted for nearly half those sales,
according to research group PC Data. Its closest competitor,
Packard Bell NEC Inc., had a mere 13 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   But if post-Pfeiffer Compaq is to stay on top, analysts and
others say, the company will have to fend off a new breed of
competitor along with its more familiar rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC business is going through a very drastic change,'' said
Danny Lam, an industry analyst with the Fisher-Holstein Inc.
research group. ``We see it basically fragmenting into a low-end
consumer market and a corporate market.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting competitors is eMachines Inc., which
grew out of a joint venture between two South Korean companies. In
the past year, the company has fought its way up to become one of
the top five makers of sub-$1,000 computers. Emachines, which sells
through retail stores, recently introduced a $399 model.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Compaq, the other three are familiar names: IBM
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Packard Bell NEC Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from that list is Dell Computer Corp., which last month
introduced a $999 PC and lowered the price to $950 this week. It,
however, has avoided the low-end because it says profits, when
factoring in costs such as follow-up technical support for new
users, aren't sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the growing popularity of cheaper PCs, research group
International Data Corp. forecasts 14.3 percent growth in worldwide
PC shipments this year, to 103 million units, but only a 4.8
percent increase in revenues, to $178 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, IDC forecasts that sub-$1,000 computers will account
for 41.4 percent, or 5 million, of consumer desktop PCs purchased
this year at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, has at least three models that sell for less than
$1,000. Chairman Ben Rosen said last week that in January and
February the company's Presario 2286 desktop PC was the top-selling
model among computers costing less than $600.
</P>
<P>
   Schelley Olhava of IDC said the machines get credit for
introducing hundreds of thousands of American households, which
couldn't afford a PC until now, to the Internet. The machines also
are popular as the No. 2 computer for families and for college
students.
</P>
<P>
   IDC estimates that half of all U.S. households have PCs, up from
46 percent last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has been helped by a steady decline in prices of
components such as memory chips, and new, low-cost processors from
Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Intel Corp. and Cyrix Corp. While they
won't power graphics-intensive games, most low-end PCs will run
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a gamer and you really care about the latest and
greatest, you're not going to buy a $399 PC from eMachines,''
Olhava said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, eMachines' success is coming primarily at the expense of
smaller companies, said Stephen Baker of PC Data. And while the top
five companies have remained the same from month to month, their
shares vary widely depending on new models they or their
competitors introduce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very volatile category,'' Baker said.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: After encountering one at each of numerous
family gatherings, I questioned why the common buttermilk pie is
referred to as ``chess'' pie. A family matriarch was assigned the
task of determining the origin, and she hasn't delivered. If you
could help, I'm in for serious family bragging rights. _Terry K.
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``Food Lover's Companion'' from Barron's defines chess
pie as a Southern favorite ``with a simple filling of eggs, butter
and a small amount of flour.'' Some credit the name to the fact
that pies were kept in chests (aka pie safes) to keep the vermin
(flies to hungry children) away. Others _ and this I love _ credit
an unnamed Southern baker who, when asked what kind of pie she was
cooking, answered in her best drawl, ``It's jes' pie, honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can we find the ``Run Hillary Run'' bumper stickers?
_S.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither the Democratic National Committee nor the New York
Democratic Committee has these stickers, but I did find Hillary
pins: ``Run Hillary Run'' and ``Hillary Clinton For Senate.'' Call
Political Americana at (800) 333-4555 to order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once read the names of the women who are queens in a deck
of cards, but months later different names were given. So I was
wondering, what are the correct names of the four queens? Also, can
you identify the kings and the jacks? _Leon Handrick
</P>
<P>
   A: Naming the deck royalty is exclusively a French thing, says
Rhonda Hawes of the 52 Plus Joker (international playing card
collectors). The French began naming cards in the 15th century.
Here are the names (in the following order of suits: hearts,
spades, diamonds, clubs): The kings (rois) are Charles
(Charlemagne), David (as in Goliath), Cesar (Julius) and Alexandre
(the Great). The queens (dames) are Judith (of Bavaria), Pallas
(Greek goddess of war and wisdom), Rachel (Jacob's wife) and Argine
(anagram for Regina, Latin for queen). The jacks (valets) are La
Hire (French for warrior), Hogier (legendary hero), Hector (any one
of many) and Lancelot (as in Sir).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a canvas seat for butterfly chairs. I tried
to reach the Algoma Net Co. but the number no longer works. Can you
put your talents to this? _E.R. Totten
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the king of butterfly chair covers, Algoma, at (800)
800-7083.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter asked me why we call grand dances ``ballroom
parties'' and why places are called ``ballrooms.'' So I told her I
really did not know, but that I would ask you. Can you find out the
origin of this phrase? She thinks people put giant balls in rooms,
hence ``ballroom.'' _L.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ball is derived from the French word ``bal'' _ dance. Not
much of a stretch to ballroom, where dancing is grand.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard somewhere about a way to keep white canvas tennis
shoes cleaner _ think it was hairspray or maybe spray starch. Do
you know for sure what it is before I do it? _Beth Harvey
</P>
<P>
   A: While some folks recommend a fabric protector such as Tana
All Protector on white canvas, Keds, the canvas king, does not. And
not just because they want you to buy more Keds. The fabric cannot
be sealed completely and you risk discoloring the fabric with
hairspray, etc. The good news is Keds are washable _ toss them in
the machine and air or tumble dry. For information on this and
other Keds products call (800) 428-6575. By the way, you could be
slipping on Peds or Veds instead of Keds. Huh? Peds was the name
first selected by U.S. Rubber when consolidating brands of rubber
footwear in 1916. But Peds (Latin for foot) was already taken and,
thank goodness, Veds did not make it. Q: Why do the overpasses on
the big mixmasters have to be so enormously high? Are they a gift
from the concrete growers of America? _Deana Newcomb
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Federal highway regulations require a vertical separation
of 16 feet 6 inches between the surface of one roadway and the
bottom of the upper roadway,'' says Texas Department of
Transportation guru John Hurt. So a four-level interchange may be
as high as 70 feet (pretty doggone high). Direct connection ramps
have replaced the old cloverleaf designs (all the rage in the 1950s
and '60s). In urban areas, it's easier and more cost-effective to
build vertical rather than horizontal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed punch cup rings on my antique, marble-top table.
Nothing I've tried can remove them. Help! The punch had fresh lemon
and pineapple juice. _Dolores D.
</P>
<P>
   A: The acid in the punch probably caused the rings. Christy
Stasswender of Southwest Marble &AMP; Granite Works says a poultice may
remove them. If not, you need a professional repolishing. Here's
Stasswender's poultice prescription: Dampen the area first. Mix
powdered chalk or talc with a 12 percent hydrogen peroxide solution
(the consistency of peanut butter). After applying it thickly (
1/4- to 1/2-inch thick), cover with plastic and allow to dry (24 to
48 hours). Remove, rinse with distilled water and buff with a
clean, dry cloth. Repeat if necessary. Q: I am trying to locate a
current address for Joe Bob Briggs (aka John Bloom). He is the host
of TNT's MonsterVision. _H.V.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the man who cites ``Hellraiser,'' ``Suspiria,'' and
``Basket Case'' as favorite horror flicks in care of Marianne
Fleschman, TNT, 1050 Techwood Drive NW, Atlanta 30318. Q: I am a
divorced parent of a 12- and 13-year-old. Their father has
``standard visitation.'' When can a child refuse to go for
visitation? My kids do want to see their dad, but they want to have
some say in their schedule. My friends say when a child is 12, he
can refuse. Is this true? _L.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: The court's orders must be followed until the children are 18
and have completed high school. ``There is a common misconception
at the age of 12 years a child may refuse to go on a court-ordered
visitation,'' says family law attorney Sara Saltmarsh. While there
may be good reasons the child does not wish to go, the custodial
parent risks a motion for contempt if the visitation agreement is
not honored. What's a parent to do? Saltmarsh advises direct
communication between the child and both parents _ especially the
noncustodial parent. Or perhaps an intermediary such as a skilled
counselor should be employed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the high, starched, white hat worn by
chefs? Does one have to be a graduate of a culinary school to wear
one? Where can I get information on a charitable organization? How
much of their intake actually goes to charity and how much to
administration? _M.R. Coale
</P>
<P>
   A: In traditional kitchens the tallest toque is worn by the head
chef _ professionally trained or not. Chef Patrick O'Connell of The
Inn at Little Washington, Va., has studied the toque and offers two
origins. Pick the one you like. At one time food preparation was
the responsibility of holy men or tribal priests. With the fall of
the Roman Empire, professional cooks sought refuge in monasteries,
where they donned the habits and high hats of monks. To reduce
confusion, chefs wore white rather than black. Or the toque could
have originated with the kings of ancient Assyria, who allowed
selected chefs to wear a crown-shaped hat as a sign of trust.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Southwest Airlines was going to have flights to
New York soon. Do you know how soon and what airport Southwest will
use? Will there be shuttle service into the city? _C.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since March 14 the company plane has been flying to Long
Island. No shuttle service as yet to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The low fare (as low as $99 one-way) brings you to Long Island's
MacArthur Airport. But then there is the problem of getting into
Manhattan. The Long Island railroad is only a few miles from the
airport. So a short cab ride and $10 or less for a train ticket
will spirit you to the Big Apple's Penn Station. The cab ride to
Manhattan _ $105 _ can cost more than the airfare. Yikes!
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 3-year-old wrote on my comforter with a dry erase marker.
How can I save the comforter? _Celeste Hill
</P>
<P>
   A: Binney &AMP; Smith, maker of Wipeoffs Markers, reports the stain
is water based and should respond to regular laundering _ no
pre-treatment or chlorine bleach necessary. Using a dry cleaner?
Let him know the nature of the stain. More stain removal tips are
available at (800) CRAYOLA.

 &HT;    Web news coverage strong adjunct to TV
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Clicking back and forth among various Web sites
covering the Columbine High School shooting wasn't anybody's idea
of fun last week, but users desperate for information poured onto
the Web nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   With Web access available in most offices and desktop access
available in most mid- and large-size corporations, the news of the
tragedy sent many to their computers for details.
</P>
<P>
   Given the afternoon scramble for news from the Internet, by the
time the average American got home Tuesday evening and tuned into
the local or national newscast at 6 or 6:30 p.m., the Colorado news
on television seemed impossibly old, inadequate and dated.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may have even gone home, flipped on the TV, then
logged on the computer in a search for the latest, most-complete
information.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, when CNN Interactive launched its first Web site,
the company talked about the depth of information it could provide
using the Web that it wasn't able to showcase, even as a
24-hour-a-day news network.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin was assassinated only months
after the CNN.com site was launched. It was a Saturday, and most of
the CNN.com staffers were in HTML training class. (That's the
coding language used to post stories and graphics on the Web.)
However, even in what was then a brand-new medium, CNN was able to
take audio feeds from the network, even some video that had been on
the air as well as some that hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   When ABCNews.com was launched in 1997, the network said its
correspondents around the world were excited by the Web presence
because it would allow them another venue to report on the places
and people they were covering. In the years since, ABCNews.com has
become one of the Web's most popular news sites and has developed a
reputation for providing background and explanations, glossaries,
maps and lists of key players in each breaking and ongoing news
story.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC.com, the online companion to the cable network jointly
owned by Microsoft and NBC, is virtually neck-and-neck with CNN as
the most popular source of news and information on the Web, with
its breaking-news ticker, daily news chat and stories that go on as
long as they need to. (Remember, on the Internet, you never have to
turn the page, just scroll down as little or as much as you want.)
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analysts like to chatter on and on about
the hours between noon and 4 p.m., which they call ``The New Prime
Time.'' These are the hours they say more Web users are online
checking news, sports and stock information from high-speed lines
in their offices. Even users who don't necessarily have computers
at home are able to keep up with everything from their favorite
baseball teams to a shooting massacre in a Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   News of the tragedy became widespread by midafternoon Tuesday.
By Wednesday, ABCNews.com reported a 90 percent increase in online
traffic since Monday. Other major news sites probably can offer
equal statistics, with most of their traffic coming during the
daytime. A friend who was sick at home says she heard the news
first on television, then went straight to the Web to get the
latest updates.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, CNN and the other news sites were providing
``at a glance'' update boxes, where readers could see the latest
information and then read more in-depth pieces if they chose.
Unlike television, where viewers often tune into an ongoing story
in the middle and have to stick around a while to catch up, the Web
sites can pick up the story wherever you might have left off. They
also offer the ability to target the specific parts of a story that
interest a particular reader most.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to note that the Web is a worldwide medium.
Along with national reports of the shooting massacre, there are
also a variety of local resources for users to visit to provide
even more depth and analysis. Late Tuesday afternoon, the Web site
for Colorado TV station KUSA was jammed with users from around the
country, and perhaps around the world, who had seen the station's
feed on CNN. Other Colorado stations and the Web site for Columbine
High School were also available for Web users, as was the British
Broadcasting Company's Web site for users who might have been
interested in an international perspective.

   TV will always be a major player in how people receive their
news. Katie Couric and Charles Gibson's solemn and often
heartbreaking interviews with the students and their parents cannot
be duplicated on the Web, at this point. However, when news breaks
and people are eager to know immediately what happened, where it
happened and why it happened, the Web is an excellent reference
tool. It's like having the best newspapers in the world, a few
encyclopedias and the best on-the-spot TV reporting all loaded onto
the computer screen right in front of you.

 &HT;    Kids around the country deal with Colorado tragedy
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kids around the country are struggling to understand
last Tuesday's attack in a Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   You may wonder why two young men, ages 18 and 17, would kill 12
of their classmates, one of their teachers and then shoot
themselves. You also may wonder how safe your school is and what
you can do to prevent violence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids who did the shooting were hurting,'' explains
Stephen Thomas, associate professor of community health at Emory
University.
</P>
<P>
   Anger is normal and natural, he says, but kids should express it
in nonviolent ways. Thomas says there are many ways to work out
anger, sadness or feelings that you don't fit in. He says talking
is a great method for relieving anger. If you can't find the words
or find someone to listen, then you can turn to music, the arts or
even reading. You can paint a picture of your feelings, write a
song or play a game of hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Being scared now
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says it's OK for you to feel scared, sad, angry or unsafe
despite being far away from the Colorado school. You may have been
taught that bad things happen when you're in the wrong place, but
school, after all, is supposed to be a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says you may feel that ``my teacher, my mom and dad
cannot protect me.'' He recommends telling anyone _ even your pet
turtle _ about these feelings. Thomas, who works with a local
program where kids who have survived violence counsel others, says
he's seen firsthand that talking helps.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling safe at school
</P>
<P>
   Although you may feel a little uneasy at school, the state and
counties are doing a lot to make sure you're safe. In fact, the
number of guns found in schools has declined for the past three
years, says Gary Reese, Georgia Department of Education spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Reese explains it's up to the local school systems to decide
what safety measures are needed. For example, some schools in
DeKalb County have unannounced visits from gunpowder-sniffing dogs.
High schools in Gwinnett County have police officers on campus and
Cherokee County schools are adding them in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do
</P>
<P>
   Besides talking through your feelings and helping others at your
school express themselves, there's more you can do to prevent
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you may know the most about what your classmates are
feeling or doing. You should be observant and not be afraid to let
a parent, teacher or principal know what you've seen or heard.
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid to tell, you can call a state-run hotline where
you don't have to leave your name. The number is 1-877-SAY-STOP
(1-877-729-7867).
</P>
<P>
   You also can contact the Kids Alive and Loved program at Emory
University. The community-based violence prevention group can help
you form a support group at your school. You can reach them at
404-727-4437.
</P>
<P>
   You can join the Student Pledge Against Gun Violence. Last year,
more than 1 million students signed the pledge. You can learn more
at www.pledge.org.
</P>
<P>
   EXPRESS YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   We want to hear and see your feelings about the killings in
Colorado. We want you to write, draw, paint or create anything that
we can print to tell the world what you think. We will publish some
of your responses in the next few issues of News for Kids. Please
include your name, age, school and phone number. Send copies of
your original work to Express Myself, P.O. Box 4689, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, GA 30302. The deadline is May 5.

 &HT;    Leaders work toward peace
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Russian officials are trying to mediate peace between
Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. A
former Russian premier met with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for nine hours last week in person, and continued to
negotiate by phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian peace plan calls for the withdrawal of NATO forces
massed at Yugoslav borders, a U.N.-led peace-keeping force in
Kosovo, a reduction in the number of Yugoslavian soldiers and
police officers in Kosovo and the return of refugees. NATO has
insisted it must lead any armed group in Kosovo to enforce a peace
agreement and says that Milosevic isn't willing to compromise
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discussions, NATO planes continued to bomb the
Yugoslavian capital and even Milosevic's house.

   Watch TV to lose weight
</P>
<P>
   Couch potatoes beware! If you want to watch TV, you may have to
work for it. Scientists trying to find ways to help kids slim down
experimented with a bicycle-powered TV. Kids had to pedal to create
the electricity to run the set.
</P>
<P>
   Ten overweight TV fans between the ages of 8 and 12 were
studied. Four were given stationary bikes not connected to the TV
and the other six had TVcycles. Those who pedaled to view burned
off more fat. They finished the study with 2 percentage points less
total body fat and 3 percentage points less fat on their legs than
the other kids. More than 13 percent of American kids ages 6 to 17
are overweight, and 55 percent of adults are too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Catch 'N Sync, Spears performing live
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to wait for your favorite music stars to come to
your hometown to see them. 'N Sync, Britney Spears and TLC will
perform live at 8 p.m. Saturday at Nickelodeon's 12th Annual Kids'
Choice Awards. Since March 13, more than 4.5 million votes have
been cast by kids online for their favorite movies, TV shows, music
and sports stars. You'll find out who your peers selected as their
favorites on the night of the awards.
</P>
<P>
   Other stars you will see include: Mase, Ben Savage, Jonathan
Taylor Thomas, Kel Mitchell, Keyshawn Johnson, Tara Lipinski and
``Macho Man'' Randy Savage.

 &HT;    A little planning makes home-based LAN feasible
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My wife thinks I've lost it.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, I suppose, she's right.
</P>
<P>
   You see, my plan is to wire my house with Ethernet cable and
create my own mini-LAN.
</P>
<P>
   A Yandel-LAN, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, every time I try to explain to her the method
behind my madness _ and there is method behind my madness _ the
same thing happens. Her eyes glaze over as soon as I say
``network,'' and she gets that far-away look you see on the faces
of students who sit by the window in Algebra.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when I heard the two best words a Web surfer can
ever hear: cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   You see, we are in the process of having a new house built, and
before the builders could flatten the lot, I called up MediaOne to
see if they serviced my future neighborhood. A very patient sales
rep answered all of my questions _ no matter how many times I asked
them.
</P>
<P>
   First, she gave me the good news. Cable modem service will be
available with blazingly fast connection speeds for $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then she told me the bad news. Additional cable modems for other
computers cost $40 a month each.
</P>
<P>
   That's what set me wandering into the Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know my household is atypical when it comes to computers
(and in many other ways, too). We will have three PCs in the new
house: The P166 with a fresh hard drive for my wife to use, an old
486 I am in the process of upgrading for my 5-year-old daughter,
and a blazing new AMD450 I am outfitting with RAM, my old hard
drives and other gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a letdown to find out it was going to cost $120 per
month for cable modem access to these machines. Add in the cost for
cable TV service (it isn't included, even though it travels on the
same coaxial cable as the Net connection), and MediaOne was gonna
be raking in the same monthly amount I pay for Montessori school.
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I decided to wire the house. I could use only one cable
modem and share it across a network with the other computers in the
house. Although I am having mine installed as the house is built,
anyone can easily accomplish the same things without having to go
inside the walls of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother, you might ask.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious benefit _ saving $80 a month in cable modem
fees _ other compelling reasons are sharing programs located on
different machines, sharing one printer and monitoring what the
kids are doing on the Net by checking out their screens from a
remote location.
</P>
<P>
   Less-compelling reasons include networked family gaming or
running your own Web (or other) servers using the cable modem's
24-hour Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as PC prices continue to drop, in-house networks will
probably become as common as bathtubs in newly built homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up your LAN is easy. Each computer to be networked needs
to have an Ethernet card in one of its PCI slots _ like the one you
free up by removing your old telephone modem. My network sources at
the office assure me that 10BaseT cards _ available for less than
$20 at CompUSA _ are plenty for a small network. (MediaOne offers
to provide them for $50 each.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need an Ethernet hub, which allows four or five
computers to run off the same connection. Again, unless you plan on
running the next Amazon.com out of your den, a 10BaseT hub ($50 and
up) is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll need enough RJ-45 Ethernet cable to connect it
all.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, I plan to install the hub in the garage and have a
cable jack installed there as well. Then I'll run Ethernet cable
that terminates in wall outlets into the rooms I might one day put
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, spokesman Tom Buttermore (who enjoys talking about
Ethernets way more than my wife does) says MediaOne is more than
happy to help subscribers customize their cable modem setups. They
are also developing commercial services for people who might
generate enough traffic to warrant a 100BaseT Ethernetwork.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say, however, if they would help you beat your kids
at a networked game of ``Quake II.''

 &HT;    World market in focus
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Auctioning on the Internet is one of the
fastest-growing forms of electronic commerce, on a pace to reach
$40 billion a year, according to some experts.
</P>
<P>
   Singularly successful eBay, already a legend on Wall Street, is
raising some $1.11 billion in part to spur its international
expansion in the business of selling a huge range of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Its site on the Internet is a favorite for the sale, through a
bidding process, of items as varied as antiques, coins,
collectibles, computers, stamps and toys of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer standpoint, auction activity on the Internet
has been particularly successful in moving used goods,'' said David
Lucking-Reiley, a specialist in auction activity at Vanderbilt
University.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of auctioning _ part commerce, part entertainment
_ has attracted other players on the Internet, including some who
have built their names in other spheres. For instance, Amazon.com,
well known for its success in moving books and records, is
assembling partners and the assets needed to get into the auction
business.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Yahoo.com, one of the most successful portals that greet
Internet visitors of all kinds, contemplates expanded activity in
auctioning, according to specialists in the industry. Meanwhile,
even as consumers are drawn to auctioning, other firms are tackling
potentially even more lucrative selling, including
business-to-business auctioning of industrial equipment and
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Onsale Inc., which has had success in commercial and consumers
sales, is teaming up with VerticalNet, a major player in industrial
sales, with some 20 separate sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even as some auctions on the Web tout their global reach and
international potential, AuctionAtlanta, a newcomer, plans to
exploit its local connections and flavor. Holding out the prospect
that potential buyers will be able to inspect goods before bidding,
AuctionAtlanta launched an effort last week to sell such big-ticket
items as cars, boats and computer equipment by using the bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
   For the small consumer, the magic of the auctioning process,
experts say, is the ability to find items they would not ordinarily
be able to locate without years of hit-or-miss searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the auctioning is like a new form of classified
advertising,'' said Lucking-Reiley. ``But the reach and scope of
the auctioning helps to make markets in a variety of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the process makes possible the pricing of rare
goods and, from the consumer's point of view, helps establish some
sense of what is affordable or not. Thus, the person holding a
garage sale now can attract better prices than the single offers
for prized chairs or tables, and likewise people who would
ordinarily consign items to a single small shop now can sample a
broadly-based appetite for goods.
</P>
<P>
   While most new items can probably be expected to move faster
through the warehouse selling now popular in electronics and other
goods, the discreet used-products market probably will find a home
in the Web sites, many of which will likely specialize.
</P>
<P>
   Lucking-Reily and his Vanderbilt colleagues operate a Web site
that helps educate surfers in the economics of electronic commerce,
including auctioning. It's at www.market.econ.vanderbilt.edu
</P>
<P>
   Among the variety of Web sites: eBay.com, Haggle Online, Auction
Central, One.Web Place, City Auction _ all mostly dedicated to used
consumer items of various kinds.

 &HT;    Lucas says gadgetry can't sell a bad tale

   In the May issue of Wired magazine, filmmaker George Lucas talks
about his craft and the state of digital filmmaking. The mastermind
behind the ``Star Wars'' trilogy discusses how he used largely
digital editing in his latest addition to the series. He says 95
percent of ``The Phantom Menace'' was created on computer, for
example. But Lucas added that all the digital gadgetry in the world
wouldn't necessarily make his film a success. Only good
storytelling can do that. ``Astounding you is not my job,'' said
Lucas. ``My job is to tell a story.'' On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular computer games of all time is
``Civilization,'' which lets you start and guide your own group of
people. Now Microprose is releasing the latest improvement on the
game called ``Civilization: A Call to Power.'' The game continues
the same idea but adds new graphics and tools. You also can lead
your civilization for 7,000 years rather than 3,000, as in the
original game. This latest version of ``Civilization'' is available
only for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In a different vein, Microprose has released another new game,
this one a golf simulation. It's called ``Golden Bear Challenge''
and represents the sixth title in a series bearing Jack Nicklaus'
nickname. In this latest title, players can play as Nicklaus
himself. The game features some famous golf courses, including the
Cochise Course at Desert Mountain, Shoal Creek Golf Club, Sherwood
Country Club and Sherry Montecastillo. ``Golden Bear Challenge'' is
available only for Windows PCs.

 &HT;    Online textbook seller also carries required-reading lists
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble are finding that the
Web, while not yet a medium for profit, is a solid place to sell
books.
</P>
<P>
   Now, textbook sellers are getting in on the act.
www.efollett.com not only sells the books, it posts required
reading lists for courses at more than 600 colleges. Not every
school is available.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can buy books, you have to pick a school. That's
where www.petersons.com comes in. Peterson's is ranked by print and
online magazines as the Web's best college guide. Peterson's offers
online applications, financial aid information and grad school test
preparation aids that can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   www.finaid.com is the top-rated site for financial aid
information. The site has a link to www.fastweb.com, a free
scholarship database.
</P>
<P>
   What's the best way?
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! Internet Life's standing feature, ``Old Way/Net Way,''
takes a look at which is the best way to do everyday tasks,
Internet or traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   This month considers designing and ordering note cards, finding
rare wine and registering your car.
</P>
<P>
   For note card ordering, the Web won. Yahoo! used www.iprint.com
and paid $74.99 for 200 cards, plus $9 to get them delivered in two
days. It took 15 minutes to pick and order, and two days to get
them. The traditional, card store way cost more ($105.50 for 200
cards delivered in two days) and took longer (one hour in the
store.)
</P>
<P>
   The wine hunt was a draw. It was shorter to search online than
in stores, but both proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Car registration was easier online. It took less than one minute
to download and print the form vs. 28 minutes in line at the
registration office.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, and nothing but
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered who played the vaguely familiar crew-cut guy who
testifies in the courtroom scene in ``A Few Good Men,'' but you
don't want to drop the four bucks to rent it?
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's help online.
</P>
<P>
   www.imdb.com is like having direct access to someone who does
nothing but eat and sleep movies. The site lists about 2.3 million
film entries, including information about actors, directors,
writers, composers, cinematographers, editors, production
designers, costumers and production designers.
</P>
<P>
   You can also search for information about one actor. The Noah
Wyle freaks out there might already know that the ``ER'' star
played Cpl. Jeffrey Barnes in ``A Few Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Internet Movie Database, you can find out on which
popular TV series Wyle made a guest appearance, and in which movie
he also worked as associate producer.

 &HT;    How strange! Software that's easy and smooth
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something, clearly, has gone awry. I have loaded onto
my computer an item for review that appears to work flawlessly,
does something that I can actually use and is so simple to use that
its large manual has gone largely unopened.
</P>
<P>
   This has not happened in so long that whenever I take up
something new, be it software or hardware, I expect trouble. It has
ranged from a program that pigheadedly insisted the serial number
on the box was the wrong one to a piece of hardware that would not
work no matter what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, granted, things got a little hinky while I was installing
this peerless program, which, incidentally, is called OneStep
Connect. When it asked for the serial number, I started looking in
all the bizarre places I've been finding them lately, including on
the CD-ROM. The installation program got confused when I ejected
the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   The serial number was printed plainly on a card inside the
manual. What a novel idea.
</P>
<P>
   OneStep Connect is a personal organizer published by a firm
called OneStep. It is a very simple program; it doesn't try to do
so much that it gets confusing, and what it does, it does
gracefully and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   OneStep gives you an address book/phone list, a calendar and a
to-do list, and handles letters, memos, faxes and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   When I clicked on the e-mail button, OneStep brought up the
Microsoft dialog box to dial my service provider, then summoned my
standard e-mail program, Eudora Pro. I like that.
</P>
<P>
   When I clicked on Letter, it summoned Microsoft Word and brought
it up with a fancy memo heading. I went into options and switched
to OneStep's own, much simpler editor, just because it loads
quicker and it will do those grisly personalized mass mailings,
postal or electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The address book is easy to set up and use. When you wish to add
a person, it brings up a reasonable form for the name, address, and
telephone numbers and e-mail addresses _ not one of those full-page
forms for listing the individual's favorite color, his ex-wives and
the results of his latest blood test. To be sure, there is a place
to put notes and another to put stuff like spouse's name and
birthdays, but it's a separate page you need never even see if you
don't want to mess with it.
</P>
<P>
   It will dial a number using a calling card, and you can set up
special, separate address books using the data in the main list.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar and its to-do functions are also straightforward.
You've got an appointment; you click on the day. You get close-up
view of that day; select the starting time and the time span. Tell
it what details you wish and whether you want an alarm. It marks
that day on the monthly calendar, and you're in business.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a little feature that shows the current time in
all the world's time zones. I mean, really, there's got to be
something at least a little exotic, and the time zone feature
doesn't get in the way at all.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering why I'm so excited. Well, at the
newspaper we've all just gone through four hours of training to use
our new e-mail, calendar and appointment program _ the name of
which will go unsaid _ which is so muscle-bound and over-engineered
I can actually hear molars grinding all around me. It does a lot
less than OneStep and is clumsy besides.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for OneStep, which works right out of the box. If
you can't find it in a store, you can order it from
www.onestepinc.com, from which site you can also download a demo.

 &HT;    Linux inventor's bluster no match for Microsoft's battalions
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this while on vacation. I don't tell you
this to rub it in _ although it is a perfect spring day, and I do
own an excellent hammock.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I want you to know about my vacation is that I see
better when I back away from something and look from a distance.
That works with redwood trees, people and the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   For years, before my wits deserted me and I became a full-time
editor and a part-time reporter and columnist, I traveled annually
to Comdex, the big computer show. For at least seven years, I stood
in line with the other propeller heads waiting to hear the Gospel
according to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, has been the keynote
speaker for Comdex back since the days before computers were trendy
appliances and available in a wide selection of colors. This year,
according to the news reports, Gates _ as usual _ outed the newest
version of Windows that's under development.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't business as usual at Comdex. Gates is no longer
the youthful developer, arrogantly challenging the audience. In
fact, Gates spent a lot of time talking about a nifty new mouse
Microsoft has developed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the role of innovator and boy genius was usurped by a
fellow with a first name that would be right at home in a comic
strip and an operating system that was once considered a joke by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Linus Torvalds, the developer of an operating system called
Linux, was also at Comdex. And his operating system _ long a
favorite of computer wizards but not taken seriously as competition
for Windows _ was on center stage. Torvalds, who spoke on the same
day as Gates, was taking no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds didn't tell the Comdex crowd that now, based on
alliances with IBM and some other computer giants, Linux should be
taken seriously as competition to Windows in the high-level
business and Internet market. He didn't shuffle his feet and thank
the computer world for beginning to rally behind the dark horse of
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said of Microsoft: ``We will crush them.''
</P>
<P>
   All the world, including the part of it populated by people who
stay up late at night eating cold pizza and writing computer
programs, loves a David and Goliath story. So the audience went
wild. No matter which side of the fence you sit on, no matter how
wedded you are to Microsoft products, there's little warm and
cuddly about the giant software company. So the enthusiasm for such
a challenge is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   And Linux really is a terrific product that's catching on.
International Data Corp., which tracks stuff like this, predicts
the sales of Linux will grow at 25 percent for the next few years.
So Torvalds has a reason to be a little exuberant. But, sitting
here, eyeing my hammock, far away from the maddening Comdex crowds,
I keep hearing a small voice _ either an especially talented
mockingbird or the voice of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the voice is saying:
</P>
<P>
   In a battle, God is on the side of the army with the biggest
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not here to debate the comparative merits of Linux and
Windows. I'm not smart enough to do that. And you either are smart
enough _ and have formed an intelligent opinion _ or you're like a
lot of folks and care more about the pollen count than comparing
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   What I am here to tell you is that other, more powerful
companies have made the same boast of crushing Microsoft ... and
have done it with at least as much logic. Think of Apple and its
really terrific computer and operating system. Think of IBM, which
sold OS/2, an operating system that was more stable and more
powerful than Windows. It's the same _ only more so _ with Linux.
It's a wonderful operating system, and Torvalds is a smart guy. But
Gates has a killer advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If you are sitting near a PC, just turn it on and you'll see the
advantage. Microsoft may not own the hearts and minds of the
computer world, but it doesn't need to. Its outsized battalions are
sitting there on the battlefield of your computer screen.

 &HT;    Net brings campaigns, activism to masses
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If an e-mail titled ``Gas Out'' hasn't arrived
in your inbox yet, there's a good chance you'll receive a copy of
it in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail, which asks that all drivers avoid buying gas for one
day (April 30) in order to cripple ``the so-called oil cartel'' and
reduce gas prices, sounds like it will be about as effective as
changing the channel during a Nike commercial in an effort to
eliminate sweatshop working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more interesting than the message is the medium. The
anonymous originators of ``Gas Out'' have created a phenomenon by
using e-mail for this grass-roots protest. Some, however, would
call it an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Political action is a logical progression for the Internet,
which has brought us instant messaging, electronic commerce and
CD-quality music for the downloading. Social activism has always
strived for getting a message to the masses and what better, more
efficient way is there than e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   Grass-roots campaigns on the Internet have been around since
before the Web grew to prominence. Like-minded folks would meet in
newsgroups and start mail-in campaigns against companies or
organizations. In some cases, fan groups organized e-mail campaigns
to save their favorite TV shows. When Comedy Central canceled
``Mystery Science Theater 3000,'' for instance, a group of fans
organized their protest efforts on alt.fan.mst3k and used e-mail to
spread the call.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, online groups have gained attention by protesting a
new user identification feature in Intel Corp.'s Pentium III
processor (Intel has since decided to add an option for disabling
the feature), fighting unsolicited commercial e-mail (the Forum for
Responsible and Ethical E-mail has worked with legislators here on
anti-spam legislation), and most importantly, fighting to save
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.'' Though that campaign failed, CBS is
bringing the good doctor back in a series of TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Expect a flurry of activity on the Web next year as
the 2000 campaigns get into full swing.
</P>
<P>
   As the next election cycle spins faster, the Internet will play
a much larger role than it did as an embryonic public medium in
1996. Aristotle Publishing Inc., a San Francisco-based political
software company, said it estimates presidential and congressional
candidates will spend at least $20 million in Internet banner
advertisements next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jay McAniff, a spokesman for Aristotle, said the company is
reaching the very people on the Internet they hope will vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a segment of the population that's
typically more educated, more affluent and more likely to vote,''
he said. ``This political cycle, we expect online activity will
mimic the overwhelming response to people for electronic commerce
last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it is such a great match for political campaigns is
because the Internet itself lends itself to public discourse,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be able to find information given by candidates on
official Web sites, but will just as likely be able to find things
some politicians may not want you to see _ their voting records,
finances and any messages anyone on their staff has ever posted to
a newsgroup, courtesy of Deja News, which catalogs newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Be it through e-mail protest or an online political pep rally,
Internet activism and campaigning is turning the Web into a global
town-hall meeting _ one with nearly unlimited boundaries and
unlimited opportunity to make the public's voice heard.

 &HT;    New breed of competitors undercutting big companies
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Compaq Computer Corp. directors search for
ways to get the company back on track, they might get some
inspiration from its division that markets cheap personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Houston-based computer maker badly missed earnings
projections it made earlier this year. True, its stock price is
about half of what it was earlier this year. And true, last
Sunday's ouster of Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer creates
uncertainty among Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But buried under this week's bad news about the world's No. 1
computer maker was the fact that its sales of PCs to consumers grew
at two times the industry rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, because of sub-$1,000 PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pfeiffer's direction, Compaq introduced some of the first
sub-$1,000 PCs about three years ago. Today, low-cost computers
account for nearly one-fourth of all consumer desktop retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Compaq accounted for nearly half those sales,
according to research group PC Data. Its closest competitor,
Packard Bell NEC Inc., had a mere 13 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   But if post-Pfeiffer Compaq is to stay on top, analysts and
others say, the company will have to fend off a new breed of
competitor along with its more familiar rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC business is going through a very drastic change,'' said
Danny Lam, an industry analyst with the Fisher-Holstein Inc.
research group. ``We see it basically fragmenting into a low-end
consumer market and a corporate market.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting competitors is eMachines Inc., which
grew out of a joint venture between two South Korean companies. In
the past year, the company has fought its way up to become one of
the top five makers of sub-$1,000 computers. Emachines, which sells
through retail stores, recently introduced a $399 model.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Compaq, the other three are familiar names: IBM
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Packard Bell NEC Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from that list is Dell Computer Corp., which last month
introduced a $999 PC and lowered the price to $950 this week. It,
however, has avoided the low-end because it says profits, when
factoring in costs such as follow-up technical support for new
users, aren't sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the growing popularity of cheaper PCs, research group
International Data Corp. forecasts 14.3 percent growth in worldwide
PC shipments this year, to 103 million units, but only a 4.8
percent increase in revenues, to $178 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, IDC forecasts that sub-$1,000 computers will account
for 41.4 percent, or 5 million, of consumer desktop PCs purchased
this year at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, has at least three models that sell for less than
$1,000. Chairman Ben Rosen said last week that in January and
February the company's Presario 2286 desktop PC was the top-selling
model among computers costing less than $600.
</P>
<P>
   Schelley Olhava of IDC said the machines get credit for
introducing hundreds of thousands of American households, which
couldn't afford a PC until now, to the Internet. The machines also
are popular as the No. 2 computer for families and for college
students.
</P>
<P>
   IDC estimates that half of all U.S. households have PCs, up from
46 percent last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has been helped by a steady decline in prices of
components such as memory chips, and new, low-cost processors from
Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Intel Corp. and Cyrix Corp. While they
won't power graphics-intensive games, most low-end PCs will run
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a gamer and you really care about the latest and
greatest, you're not going to buy a $399 PC from eMachines,''
Olhava said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, eMachines' success is coming primarily at the expense of
smaller companies, said Stephen Baker of PC Data. And while the top
five companies have remained the same from month to month, their
shares vary widely depending on new models they or their
competitors introduce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very volatile category,'' Baker said.

 &HT;    Web news coverage strong adjunct to TV
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Clicking back and forth among various Web sites
covering the Columbine High School shooting wasn't anybody's idea
of fun last week, but users desperate for information poured onto
the Web nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   With Web access available in most offices and desktop access
available in most mid- and large-size corporations, the news of the
tragedy sent many to their computers for details.
</P>
<P>
   Given the afternoon scramble for news from the Internet, by the
time the average American got home Tuesday evening and tuned into
the local or national newscast at 6 or 6:30 p.m., the Colorado news
on television seemed impossibly old, inadequate and dated.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may have even gone home, flipped on the TV, then
logged on the computer in a search for the latest, most-complete
information.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1995, when CNN Interactive launched its first Web site,
the company talked about the depth of information it could provide
using the Web that it wasn't able to showcase, even as a
24-hour-a-day news network.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin was assassinated only months
after the CNN.com site was launched. It was a Saturday, and most of
the CNN.com staffers were in HTML training class. (That's the
coding language used to post stories and graphics on the Web.)
However, even in what was then a brand-new medium, CNN was able to
take audio feeds from the network, even some video that had been on
the air as well as some that hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   When ABCNews.com was launched in 1997, the network said its
correspondents around the world were excited by the Web presence
because it would allow them another venue to report on the places
and people they were covering. In the years since, ABCNews.com has
become one of the Web's most popular news sites and has developed a
reputation for providing background and explanations, glossaries,
maps and lists of key players in each breaking and ongoing news
story.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC.com, the online companion to the cable network jointly
owned by Microsoft and NBC, is virtually neck-and-neck with CNN as
the most popular source of news and information on the Web, with
its breaking-news ticker, daily news chat and stories that go on as
long as they need to. (Remember, on the Internet, you never have to
turn the page, just scroll down as little or as much as you want.)
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analysts like to chatter on and on about
the hours between noon and 4 p.m., which they call ``The New Prime
Time.'' These are the hours they say more Web users are online
checking news, sports and stock information from high-speed lines
in their offices. Even users who don't necessarily have computers
at home are able to keep up with everything from their favorite
baseball teams to a shooting massacre in a Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   News of the tragedy became widespread by midafternoon Tuesday.
By Wednesday, ABCNews.com reported a 90 percent increase in online
traffic since Monday. Other major news sites probably can offer
equal statistics, with most of their traffic coming during the
daytime. A friend who was sick at home says she heard the news
first on television, then went straight to the Web to get the
latest updates.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, CNN and the other news sites were providing
``at a glance'' update boxes, where readers could see the latest
information and then read more in-depth pieces if they chose.
Unlike television, where viewers often tune into an ongoing story
in the middle and have to stick around a while to catch up, the Web
sites can pick up the story wherever you might have left off. They
also offer the ability to target the specific parts of a story that
interest a particular reader most.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to note that the Web is a worldwide medium.
Along with national reports of the shooting massacre, there are
also a variety of local resources for users to visit to provide
even more depth and analysis. Late Tuesday afternoon, the Web site
for Colorado TV station KUSA was jammed with users from around the
country, and perhaps around the world, who had seen the station's
feed on CNN. Other Colorado stations and the Web site for Columbine
High School were also available for Web users, as was the British
Broadcasting Company's Web site for users who might have been
interested in an international perspective.
</P>
<P>
   TV will always be a major player in how people receive their
news. Katie Couric and Charles Gibson's solemn and often
heartbreaking interviews with the students and their parents cannot
be duplicated on the Web, at this point. However, when news breaks
and people are eager to know immediately what happened, where it
happened and why it happened, the Web is an excellent reference
tool. It's like having the best newspapers in the world, a few
encyclopedias and the best on-the-spot TV reporting all loaded onto
the computer screen right in front of you.

 &HT;    A little planning makes home-based LAN feasible
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My wife thinks I've lost it.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, I suppose, she's right.
</P>
<P>
   You see, my plan is to wire my house with Ethernet cable and
create my own mini-LAN.
</P>
<P>
   A Yandel-LAN, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, every time I try to explain to her the method
behind my madness _ and there is method behind my madness _ the
same thing happens. Her eyes glaze over as soon as I say
``network,'' and she gets that far-away look you see on the faces
of students who sit by the window in Algebra.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when I heard the two best words a Web surfer can
ever hear: cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   You see, we are in the process of having a new house built, and
before the builders could flatten the lot, I called up MediaOne to
see if they serviced my future neighborhood. A very patient sales
rep answered all of my questions _ no matter how many times I asked
them.
</P>
<P>
   First, she gave me the good news. Cable modem service will be
available with blazingly fast connection speeds for $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then she told me the bad news. Additional cable modems for other
computers cost $40 a month each.
</P>
<P>
   That's what set me wandering into the Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know my household is atypical when it comes to computers
(and in many other ways, too). We will have three PCs in the new
house: The P166 with a fresh hard drive for my wife to use, an old
486 I am in the process of upgrading for my 5-year-old daughter,
and a blazing new AMD450 I am outfitting with RAM, my old hard
drives and other gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a letdown to find out it was going to cost $120 per
month for cable modem access to these machines. Add in the cost for
cable TV service (it isn't included, even though it travels on the
same coaxial cable as the Net connection), and MediaOne was gonna
be raking in the same monthly amount I pay for Montessori school.
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I decided to wire the house. I could use only one cable
modem and share it across a network with the other computers in the
house. Although I am having mine installed as the house is built,
anyone can easily accomplish the same things without having to go
inside the walls of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother, you might ask.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious benefit _ saving $80 a month in cable modem
fees _ other compelling reasons are sharing programs located on
different machines, sharing one printer and monitoring what the
kids are doing on the Net by checking out their screens from a
remote location.
</P>
<P>
   Less-compelling reasons include networked family gaming or
running your own Web (or other) servers using the cable modem's
24-hour Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as PC prices continue to drop, in-house networks will
probably become as common as bathtubs in newly built homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up your LAN is easy. Each computer to be networked needs
to have an Ethernet card in one of its PCI slots _ like the one you
free up by removing your old telephone modem. My network sources at
the office assure me that 10BaseT cards _ available for less than
$20 at CompUSA _ are plenty for a small network. (MediaOne offers
to provide them for $50 each.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need an Ethernet hub, which allows four or five
computers to run off the same connection. Again, unless you plan on
running the next Amazon.com out of your den, a 10BaseT hub ($50 and
up) is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll need enough RJ-45 Ethernet cable to connect it
all.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, I plan to install the hub in the garage and have a
cable jack installed there as well. Then I'll run Ethernet cable
that terminates in wall outlets into the rooms I might one day put
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, spokesman Tom Buttermore (who enjoys talking about
Ethernets way more than my wife does) says MediaOne is more than
happy to help subscribers customize their cable modem setups. They
are also developing commercial services for people who might
generate enough traffic to warrant a 100BaseT Ethernetwork.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say, however, if they would help you beat your kids
at a networked game of ``Quake II.''

 &HT;    World market in focus
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Auctioning on the Internet is one of the
fastest-growing forms of electronic commerce, on a pace to reach
$40 billion a year, according to some experts.
</P>
<P>
   Singularly successful eBay, already a legend on Wall Street, is
raising some $1.11 billion in part to spur its international
expansion in the business of selling a huge range of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Its site on the Internet is a favorite for the sale, through a
bidding process, of items as varied as antiques, coins,
collectibles, computers, stamps and toys of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer standpoint, auction activity on the Internet
has been particularly successful in moving used goods,'' said David
Lucking-Reiley, a specialist in auction activity at Vanderbilt
University.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of auctioning _ part commerce, part entertainment
_ has attracted other players on the Internet, including some who
have built their names in other spheres. For instance, Amazon.com,
well known for its success in moving books and records, is
assembling partners and the assets needed to get into the auction
business.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Yahoo.com, one of the most successful portals that greet
Internet visitors of all kinds, contemplates expanded activity in
auctioning, according to specialists in the industry. Meanwhile,
even as consumers are drawn to auctioning, other firms are tackling
potentially even more lucrative selling, including
business-to-business auctioning of industrial equipment and
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Onsale Inc., which has had success in commercial and consumers
sales, is teaming up with VerticalNet, a major player in industrial
sales, with some 20 separate sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even as some auctions on the Web tout their global reach and
international potential, AuctionAtlanta, a newcomer, plans to
exploit its local connections and flavor. Holding out the prospect
that potential buyers will be able to inspect goods before bidding,
AuctionAtlanta launched an effort last week to sell such big-ticket
items as cars, boats and computer equipment by using the bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
   For the small consumer, the magic of the auctioning process,
experts say, is the ability to find items they would not ordinarily
be able to locate without years of hit-or-miss searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the auctioning is like a new form of classified
advertising,'' said Lucking-Reiley. ``But the reach and scope of
the auctioning helps to make markets in a variety of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the process makes possible the pricing of rare
goods and, from the consumer's point of view, helps establish some
sense of what is affordable or not. Thus, the person holding a
garage sale now can attract better prices than the single offers
for prized chairs or tables, and likewise people who would
ordinarily consign items to a single small shop now can sample a
broadly-based appetite for goods.
</P>
<P>
   While most new items can probably be expected to move faster
through the warehouse selling now popular in electronics and other
goods, the discreet used-products market probably will find a home
in the Web sites, many of which will likely specialize.
</P>
<P>
   Lucking-Reily and his Vanderbilt colleagues operate a Web site
that helps educate surfers in the economics of electronic commerce,
including auctioning. It's at www.market.econ.vanderbilt.edu
</P>
<P>
   Among the variety of Web sites: eBay.com, Haggle Online, Auction
Central, One.Web Place, City Auction _ all mostly dedicated to used
consumer items of various kinds.

   In the May issue of Wired magazine, filmmaker George Lucas talks
about his craft and the state of digital filmmaking. The mastermind
behind the ``Star Wars'' trilogy discusses how he used largely
digital editing in his latest addition to the series. He says 95
percent of ``The Phantom Menace'' was created on computer, for
example. But Lucas added that all the digital gadgetry in the world
wouldn't necessarily make his film a success. Only good
storytelling can do that. ``Astounding you is not my job,'' said
Lucas. ``My job is to tell a story.'' On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular computer games of all time is
``Civilization,'' which lets you start and guide your own group of
people. Now Microprose is releasing the latest improvement on the
game called ``Civilization: A Call to Power.'' The game continues
the same idea but adds new graphics and tools. You also can lead
your civilization for 7,000 years rather than 3,000, as in the
original game. This latest version of ``Civilization'' is available
only for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In a different vein, Microprose has released another new game,
this one a golf simulation. It's called ``Golden Bear Challenge''
and represents the sixth title in a series bearing Jack Nicklaus'
nickname. In this latest title, players can play as Nicklaus
himself. The game features some famous golf courses, including the
Cochise Course at Desert Mountain, Shoal Creek Golf Club, Sherwood
Country Club and Sherry Montecastillo. ``Golden Bear Challenge'' is
available only for Windows PCs.

 &HT;    Linux inventor's bluster no match for Microsoft's battalions
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this while on vacation. I don't tell you
this to rub it in _ although it is a perfect spring day, and I do
own an excellent hammock.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I want you to know about my vacation is that I see
better when I back away from something and look from a distance.
That works with redwood trees, people and the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   For years, before my wits deserted me and I became a full-time
editor and a part-time reporter and columnist, I traveled annually
to Comdex, the big computer show. For at least seven years, I stood
in line with the other propeller heads waiting to hear the Gospel
according to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, has been the keynote
speaker for Comdex back since the days before computers were trendy
appliances and available in a wide selection of colors. This year,
according to the news reports, Gates _ as usual _ outed the newest
version of Windows that's under development.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't business as usual at Comdex. Gates is no longer
the youthful developer, arrogantly challenging the audience. In
fact, Gates spent a lot of time talking about a nifty new mouse
Microsoft has developed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the role of innovator and boy genius was usurped by a
fellow with a first name that would be right at home in a comic
strip and an operating system that was once considered a joke by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Linus Torvalds, the developer of an operating system called
Linux, was also at Comdex. And his operating system _ long a
favorite of computer wizards but not taken seriously as competition
for Windows _ was on center stage. Torvalds, who spoke on the same
day as Gates, was taking no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds didn't tell the Comdex crowd that now, based on
alliances with IBM and some other computer giants, Linux should be
taken seriously as competition to Windows in the high-level
business and Internet market. He didn't shuffle his feet and thank
the computer world for beginning to rally behind the dark horse of
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said of Microsoft: ``We will crush them.''
</P>
<P>
   All the world, including the part of it populated by people who
stay up late at night eating cold pizza and writing computer
programs, loves a David and Goliath story. So the audience went
wild. No matter which side of the fence you sit on, no matter how
wedded you are to Microsoft products, there's little warm and
cuddly about the giant software company. So the enthusiasm for such
a challenge is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   And Linux really is a terrific product that's catching on.
International Data Corp., which tracks stuff like this, predicts
the sales of Linux will grow at 25 percent for the next few years.
So Torvalds has a reason to be a little exuberant. But, sitting
here, eyeing my hammock, far away from the maddening Comdex crowds,
I keep hearing a small voice _ either an especially talented
mockingbird or the voice of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the voice is saying:
</P>
<P>
   In a battle, God is on the side of the army with the biggest
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not here to debate the comparative merits of Linux and
Windows. I'm not smart enough to do that. And you either are smart
enough _ and have formed an intelligent opinion _ or you're like a
lot of folks and care more about the pollen count than comparing
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   What I am here to tell you is that other, more powerful
companies have made the same boast of crushing Microsoft ... and
have done it with at least as much logic. Think of Apple and its
really terrific computer and operating system. Think of IBM, which
sold OS/2, an operating system that was more stable and more
powerful than Windows. It's the same _ only more so _ with Linux.
It's a wonderful operating system, and Torvalds is a smart guy. But
Gates has a killer advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If you are sitting near a PC, just turn it on and you'll see the
advantage. Microsoft may not own the hearts and minds of the
computer world, but it doesn't need to. Its outsized battalions are
sitting there on the battlefield of your computer screen.

 &HT;    Online textbook seller also carries required-reading lists
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble are finding that the
Web, while not yet a medium for profit, is a solid place to sell
books.
</P>
<P>
   Now, textbook sellers are getting in on the act.
www.efollett.com not only sells the books, it posts required
reading lists for courses at more than 600 colleges. Not every
school is available.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can buy books, you have to pick a school. That's
where www.petersons.com comes in. Peterson's is ranked by print and
online magazines as the Web's best college guide. Peterson's offers
online applications, financial aid information and grad school test
preparation aids that can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   www.finaid.com is the top-rated site for financial aid
information. The site has a link to www.fastweb.com, a free
scholarship database.
</P>
<P>
   What's the best way?
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! Internet Life's standing feature, ``Old Way/Net Way,''
takes a look at which is the best way to do everyday tasks,
Internet or traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   This month considers designing and ordering note cards, finding
rare wine and registering your car.
</P>
<P>
   For note card ordering, the Web won. Yahoo! used www.iprint.com
and paid $74.99 for 200 cards, plus $9 to get them delivered in two
days. It took 15 minutes to pick and order, and two days to get
them. The traditional, card store way cost more ($105.50 for 200
cards delivered in two days) and took longer (one hour in the
store.)
</P>
<P>
   The wine hunt was a draw. It was shorter to search online than
in stores, but both proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Car registration was easier online. It took less than one minute
to download and print the form vs. 28 minutes in line at the
registration office.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, and nothing but
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered who played the vaguely familiar crew-cut guy who
testifies in the courtroom scene in ``A Few Good Men,'' but you
don't want to drop the four bucks to rent it?
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's help online.
</P>
<P>
   www.imdb.com is like having direct access to someone who does
nothing but eat and sleep movies. The site lists about 2.3 million
film entries, including information about actors, directors,
writers, composers, cinematographers, editors, production
designers, costumers and production designers.
</P>
<P>
   You can also search for information about one actor. The Noah
Wyle freaks out there might already know that the ``ER'' star
played Cpl. Jeffrey Barnes in ``A Few Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Internet Movie Database, you can find out on which
popular TV series Wyle made a guest appearance, and in which movie
he also worked as associate producer.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held DVD player on way
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic is coming out with a hand-held version of the DVD
player.
</P>
<P>
   For now, digital video discs mostly are used to store movies.
Panasonic's new hand-held model is called the DVD-L50 PalmTheater.
</P>
<P>
   It retails for $1,099 and is expected to be on the market by
May.
</P>
<P>
   The palm-sized model weighs about 2.5 pounds, including the
battery. It is 5.51 inches by 5.96 inches and is less than 2 inches
thick. The 5-inch LCD monitor comes with 280,000-pixel resolution.

 &HT;    How strange! Software that's easy and smooth
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something, clearly, has gone awry. I have loaded onto
my computer an item for review that appears to work flawlessly,
does something that I can actually use and is so simple to use that
its large manual has gone largely unopened.
</P>
<P>
   This has not happened in so long that whenever I take up
something new, be it software or hardware, I expect trouble. It has
ranged from a program that pigheadedly insisted the serial number
on the box was the wrong one to a piece of hardware that would not
work no matter what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, granted, things got a little hinky while I was installing
this peerless program, which, incidentally, is called OneStep
Connect. When it asked for the serial number, I started looking in
all the bizarre places I've been finding them lately, including on
the CD-ROM. The installation program got confused when I ejected
the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   The serial number was printed plainly on a card inside the
manual. What a novel idea.
</P>
<P>
   OneStep Connect is a personal organizer published by a firm
called OneStep. It is a very simple program; it doesn't try to do
so much that it gets confusing, and what it does, it does
gracefully and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   OneStep gives you an address book/phone list, a calendar and a
to-do list, and handles letters, memos, faxes and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   When I clicked on the e-mail button, OneStep brought up the
Microsoft dialog box to dial my service provider, then summoned my
standard e-mail program, Eudora Pro. I like that.
</P>
<P>
   When I clicked on Letter, it summoned Microsoft Word and brought
it up with a fancy memo heading. I went into options and switched
to OneStep's own, much simpler editor, just because it loads
quicker and it will do those grisly personalized mass mailings,
postal or electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The address book is easy to set up and use. When you wish to add
a person, it brings up a reasonable form for the name, address, and
telephone numbers and e-mail addresses _ not one of those full-page
forms for listing the individual's favorite color, his ex-wives and
the results of his latest blood test. To be sure, there is a place
to put notes and another to put stuff like spouse's name and
birthdays, but it's a separate page you need never even see if you
don't want to mess with it.
</P>
<P>
   It will dial a number using a calling card, and you can set up
special, separate address books using the data in the main list.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar and its to-do functions are also straightforward.
You've got an appointment; you click on the day. You get close-up
view of that day; select the starting time and the time span. Tell
it what details you wish and whether you want an alarm. It marks
that day on the monthly calendar, and you're in business.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a little feature that shows the current time in
all the world's time zones. I mean, really, there's got to be
something at least a little exotic, and the time zone feature
doesn't get in the way at all.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering why I'm so excited. Well, at the
newspaper we've all just gone through four hours of training to use
our new e-mail, calendar and appointment program _ the name of
which will go unsaid _ which is so muscle-bound and over-engineered
I can actually hear molars grinding all around me. It does a lot
less than OneStep and is clumsy besides.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for OneStep, which works right out of the box. If
you can't find it in a store, you can order it from
www.onestepinc.com, from which site you can also download a demo.

 &HT;    Net brings campaigns, activism to masses
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If an e-mail titled ``Gas Out'' hasn't arrived
in your inbox yet, there's a good chance you'll receive a copy of
it in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail, which asks that all drivers avoid buying gas for one
day (April 30) in order to cripple ``the so-called oil cartel'' and
reduce gas prices, sounds like it will be about as effective as
changing the channel during a Nike commercial in an effort to
eliminate sweatshop working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more interesting than the message is the medium. The
anonymous originators of ``Gas Out'' have created a phenomenon by
using e-mail for this grass-roots protest. Some, however, would
call it an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Political action is a logical progression for the Internet,
which has brought us instant messaging, electronic commerce and
CD-quality music for the downloading. Social activism has always
strived for getting a message to the masses and what better, more
efficient way is there than e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   Grass-roots campaigns on the Internet have been around since
before the Web grew to prominence. Like-minded folks would meet in
newsgroups and start mail-in campaigns against companies or
organizations. In some cases, fan groups organized e-mail campaigns
to save their favorite TV shows. When Comedy Central canceled
``Mystery Science Theater 3000,'' for instance, a group of fans
organized their protest efforts on alt.fan.mst3k and used e-mail to
spread the call.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, online groups have gained attention by protesting a
new user identification feature in Intel Corp.'s Pentium III
processor (Intel has since decided to add an option for disabling
the feature), fighting unsolicited commercial e-mail (the Forum for
Responsible and Ethical E-mail has worked with legislators here on
anti-spam legislation), and most importantly, fighting to save
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.'' Though that campaign failed, CBS is
bringing the good doctor back in a series of TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Expect a flurry of activity on the Web next year as
the 2000 campaigns get into full swing.
</P>
<P>
   As the next election cycle spins faster, the Internet will play
a much larger role than it did as an embryonic public medium in
1996. Aristotle Publishing Inc., a San Francisco-based political
software company, said it estimates presidential and congressional
candidates will spend at least $20 million in Internet banner
advertisements next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jay McAniff, a spokesman for Aristotle, said the company is
reaching the very people on the Internet they hope will vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a segment of the population that's
typically more educated, more affluent and more likely to vote,''
he said. ``This political cycle, we expect online activity will
mimic the overwhelming response to people for electronic commerce
last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it is such a great match for political campaigns is
because the Internet itself lends itself to public discourse,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be able to find information given by candidates on
official Web sites, but will just as likely be able to find things
some politicians may not want you to see _ their voting records,
finances and any messages anyone on their staff has ever posted to
a newsgroup, courtesy of Deja News, which catalogs newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Be it through e-mail protest or an online political pep rally,
Internet activism and campaigning is turning the Web into a global
town-hall meeting _ one with nearly unlimited boundaries and
unlimited opportunity to make the public's voice heard.

   xxx on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore Jr. has been whacked on that account, for not stopping
his tobacco cultivation soon enough after his sister's death from
lung cancer in 1984. At the 1996 Democratic convention, he
delivered a wrenching speech about Nancy and her death. But the
speech stirred criticism that Gore would exploit anyone or any
circumstance for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   `` ... Gore had violated the privacy of his loved ones for
purposes of exploiting the rest of us,'' Bob Zelnick writes in
``Gore: A Political Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike Wallace, who professes high regard for Gore, says: ``I
wonder, though, at the 1996 convention speech about his sister's
death. It might have been a bit much, considering the Gore family's
continued tobacco cultivation and Gore's continued support of
tobacco subsidies. But I don't doubt that Al Gore has been deeply
moved by events in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is big in Carthage _ burley tobacco, used as cigarette
filler _ but there are no (ital) big (end ital) tobacco farmers.
The government parcels out tobacco allotments to farmers based on
projected sales data supplied by tobacco companies. A farmer can
use his allotment, lease it to another farmer, or give it back to
the government, a rarity because allotments increase land value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco pays for the new Chevy, helps pay the taxes. Three or
four acres is average in central Tennessee. Ten acres is big,''
says Billy Driver, who once worked in the Carthage post office and
now farms burley leaf on seven of his 53 acres in nearby Macon
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco ties people together here like automobiles in Detroit
or corn in Nebraska,'' says Driver. ``Around here, two farmers will
stop their trucks on a country road, one heading west, the other
east. They'll roll down their windows and talk for half an hour.
Talk tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore once grew tobacco. His father had grown it for decades.
Billy Driver knows more than most how much tobacco the Gores grew
on their farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought The Senator's tobacco sticks back in 1991 _ 6,000 of
them,'' says Driver. ``Sticks are the long poles you tie the leaf
to, to cure it in the barn. You need maybe 1,500 sticks per acre of
leaf, so maybe The Senator, Al's father, planted four or five acres
when he last grew tobacco. An acre might bring $2,000, $3,000 per
year. The Gores were comfortable. Young Al ain't rich. I don't see
him driving the hills, you know, don't see him much. But I'll tell
you this: He didn't grow much leaf, and he don't grow any tobacco
no more, because I got the sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gores, father and son, were devastated by the loss of Nancy.
But they didn't stop growing leaf right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see every connection between events overnight,''
Gore explained as he talked softly aboard Air Force Two. ``On my
farm, we stopped growing tobacco some time after Nancy died. We no
longer have an allotment. But my father had grown tobacco for 50
(ital) years. (end ital) This was his life. Then _ it was a few
years later _ one of his grandchildren asked, `Grandpa, do we still
grow tobacco?' He thought for a minute. `Not any more,' he said.
And that was the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore Jr. traces much in his political life to deeply moving
experiences in his personal life: ``My family, my father, his
death, my sister, her death. Growing older. My son's accident. I'm
becoming a grandparent soon. These are events that change you,'' he
says. ``Some of the changes you see right away, some take time,
some change comes over you slowly and you don't fully see or even
understand until sometime later, when you look inward. My father,
though, influenced me in so, so many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's farm sits on a hillside across the Caney Fork River from
his dad's farm, where Pauline Gore still lives. He bought the farm
and 2,100-square-foot house from his father in 1973 for $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's house is long, low, faced in reddish-brown
brick. A white rail fence surrounds the property. A gate at the end
of the long drive is closed and locked. Similar-sized farms in
Smith County are listed by real estate agents for between $200,000
and $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Up the road a few hundred yards is a general store operated by a
fellow named Walter Brown Jr. The Gores and their four children do
not shop at his store, says Brown. Farther up the road is a little
honky-tonk road house. You needn't look for the Gores there,
either. You'd have better luck at New Salem Missionary Baptist
Church, which the family attends when they come to town.
</P>
<P>
   A zinc mine operated by Savage Zinc squats near the banks of the
Caney Fork about a quarter-mile behind the vice president's home.
Zinc tunnels snake right under homes, farms and Main Street, where
retailers like Billy Markham lease mineral rights to Savage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years after his election defeat, even after his death,
people in Carthage debate The Senator's politics, but nobody
debates his character. He is not remembered as a dynasty-building,
political hard-muscle man, like Joe Kennedy Sr. There are no
stories about any behavior other than upright.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much how they talk about his son. They like him.
Often they'll preface an answer about, say, Gore's farm with
something like: ``He's never winked at another woman, you know.''
Or: ``He's a (ital) good (end ital) man, a (ital) family (end ital)
man.'' They defend him against questions not even asked.
</P>
<P>
   There's something else they make clear: They don't send anyone
but their own to Washington. ``He's one of us'' is often heard in
these parts of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore was a son of politics, a child of Washington,'' the
Weekly Standard pointed out to readers in its March 29 issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Gore is a city kid, father a senator. He grew up in
Washington,'' reported Bruce Morton on CNN's Inside Politics on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sir, in Smith County we don't elect outsiders to
Congress, and outsiders are pretty much anybody who don't live in
Smith County,'' allowed Billy Markham, owner of Markham's General
Store, Main Street, Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Son of Washington or son of Tennessee? Al Gore finds himself
defending his past because some in the media hold his truth to be
relative. All it takes is a snappy comment _ ``No farmer plows a
steep hillside'' or ``child of Washington'' _ and the (ital)
implication (end ital) is clear: Al Gore is a liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think because Al spent school years in Washington
with his family, he's not authentic,'' says Jerry Futrell,
president of Smith County Hospital and Gore family friend for 35
years. ``Al transcended Carthage. That doesn't mean he isn't
Carthage. Of course, he lived in Washington part of the year. His
father worked there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al won his congressional seat in 1976, he promised to
hold town meetings. He did, every weekend, in garages, stores,
diners. Hundreds of meetings. He told tobacco farmers changes were
coming. He helped put warning labels on cigarette packs. They
re-elected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he won re-election to the Senate in 1990, he carried all
95 counties in Tennessee. Either Tennesseans can't tell when a
candidate is local, or you reporters need to have your eyes
checked.''
</P>
<P>
   Followed to its logical conclusion, the knock on Gore's
geographic roots must arrive at only one place. Bob Zelnick
articulates that conclusion: ``He has had no life to speak of
outside of government save for a few years on a Nashville newspaper
_ where he covered government.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, it would seem to some, by being both a son of
Washington (ital) and (end ital) Tennessee can make no credible
claim to being the son of any place.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of his Tennessee roots, it would be only fair to
let Gore have the last word: ``When I went home on holidays from
Harvard, I went to Carthage. When I came back from Vietnam, I could
have gone to Washington, to Cambridge, California, anywhere. But I
didn't. I went home. To Carthage.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick on Gore's 1970 enlistment in the Army: ``Al Gore Jr.
would not endanger his father's political future or his own. He
would volunteer for military service and take his chances in
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for a national newspaper: ``Divinity school was a
good way to get out of Vietnam.'' Told that Gore was a divinity
student after serving in Vietnam, the reporter said, ``I don't
think so. Why would someone do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Harvard roommate Bob Somerby on Gore's military service:
``I can't tell you all the reasons Al enlisted, but I can tell you
one reason that wasn't. His political future. Hell, none of us knew
in 1969 if we'd have a future.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Al Gore joined the Army in 1970. In May of that year, he and
Tipper married. In December, Spec. 5 Gore went to Vietnam, where he
served seven months as a newsletter writer in an engineering
battalion. He didn't see combat, and didn't serve the usual 12
months in Vietnam because his enlistment was up by early autumn
1971. While overseas, he sent a story about a Viet Cong ambush to
the Tennessean, Nashville's morning daily, where editor John
Seigenthaler liked what he saw. Gore's friends say he was a good
writer; his detractors say he was not.
</P>
<P>
   He smoked a little marijuana. He drank a little beer _ not a
lot, say friends. During his Army stint, he and Tipper lived in a
trailer outside an Alabama Army base. They drove an old VW bus into
the Rockies, where they camped and hiked. They listened to rock 'n'
roll. They didn't buy into the tuned-out culture, nor did they
become revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore's Army enlistment was up, he and Tipper returned to
Nashville, where he began working for the Tennessean and Tipper
studied photography. She soon began free-lancing her photos to the
Tennessean.

<P>
   Zelnick's speculation on the motives for Al Gore's Army
enlistment presupposes that he had a political future in mind when
he joined.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Somerby, but most of Gore's friends from Harvard,
Carthage and Nashville cannot recall a single discussion with Gore
during the years 1965 to 1975 _ about Vietnam or anything else _ in
which Gore alluded to a political future for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disgusted with politics, hurt by his father's loss,''
says Frank Sutherland, long-time Gore friend and fellow reporter at
the Tennessean. ``The last thing I thought Al Gore would do is run
for office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd stay in journalism and end up at The New York
Times or Washington Post,'' says Seigenthaler, editor and publisher
of the Tennessean during the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envied Al's love for his parents,'' says his Harvard
roommate, Bob Somerby. ``How many kids moved back next door to
their parents after college? Al's friends were people like me and
Tommy Lee Jones. Totally unconnected people. Harvard was full of
(ital) really (end ital) connected people, but Al's friends were
just regular guys. He made decisions because his father brought him
up to (ital) honor (end ital) certain values, (ital) do things
right, (end ital) for right's sake. Not because his father was a
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore told many of his friends that if he didn't
enlist, some other Smith County boy would _ and maybe die.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland, who is now the editor of the Tennessean, says:
``Whatever political hopes Al's father had for Al came to fruition
not because (ital) he (end ital) harbored those hopes, but because
(ital) Al (end ital) chose _ in his own time and at his own pace _
to pursue a political career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he thought he'd make journalism a career. He had tried
law school at Vanderbilt in the early '70s but says he didn't like
the way he saw justice dispensed. He had tried divinity school at
Vanderbilt for a semester but didn't hear a loud enough call.
</P>
<P>
   Politics _ not preaching, not law, not journalism _ finally
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved journalism. But then, February 1976, John Seigenthaler
called me at home,'' says Gore. ``He said, `Al, I thought you'd
like to know Joe Evins isn't running for re-election.' I listened.
I think I said thanks. If you had asked me two days before would I
run, I'd have said no. I hung up the phone and turned to Tipper.
`Joe Evins isn't running,' I said. Then, (ital) right then, (end
ital) I knew. `I'm gonna run for Congress,' I told Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   He beat eight Democrats in the primary, won the general election
and served four terms. In 1984, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
By then, Gore had gained a reputation among colleagues as a whiz on
arms control. He garnered national publicity when he pushed
legislation through the House that required higher standards in the
manufacturing of infant formula. He took submarine trips to the
North Pole to further publicize his views on global warming. And he
came to Carthage almost every weekend for those town meetings.

</P>
<P>
   Terms used by some former House and Senate colleagues and
journalists to describe Gore: ``Not a team player,'' ``a Rosie Ruiz
type,'' ``self-promoter,'' ``loner,'' ``Prince Albert,''
``preppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional associates, journalists and friends suggest:
``Prepared,'' ``disciplined,'' ``regular guy,'' ``honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   So who is the real Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's got an opinion, friend and foe. But only Gore can
(ital) show (end ital) who he is.
</P>
<P>
   To win the hearts and minds of voters, he has to connect through
media that are disconnected, abstract. Whether Gore wins may depend
on whether he takes the risk and specifies the particulars of what
he calls his vision.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics will be test-marketed, polled, analyzed. On this
Air Force Two flight, it's not time yet for Gore to download his
theory of new technologies, their social implications, the policies
needed to manage them, the markets needed to promulgate them. He is
still thinking about how to articulate his vision.
</P>
<P>
   He may even be thinking about (ital) if (end ital) he wants to
articulate it.
</P>
<P>
   Visionaries walk a fine line. If Gore's ultimate message is too
cerebral, he'll reinforce the dreaded egghead suspiion. If it's
overly simplified, he'll be called on to show the emperor's
wardrobe. He may choose safety over risk and leave the message
unsent.
</P>
<P>
   But if he takes that route, he risks leaving unsaid the very
ideas that so engage him. And without a new Al Gore behind the
podium, he likely will come across as the old wooden one.
</P>
<P>
   Clues to Gore's vision can be found in speeches delivered at the
Chernobyl Museum in Kiev, at conferences such as those in Seattle
and Oakland and, especially, in his book, ``Earth in the Balance,''
a 385-page warning on global warming, pollution, how we made the
mess and how we can fix it. There is even a chapter on (ital) why,
(end ital) from a psychological standpoint, we made the mess, a
chapter some readers find confusing, a tad spiritualistic and
perhaps downright odd.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick calls ``Earth in the Balance'' ``more of a nostalgic
anti-modernism than a reasonable analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in the preface, says he wrote the book for many reasons,
including the emotional change he underwent while his son, Albert
Gore III, spent months in the hospital after being hit by a car as
the family left a Baltimore Orioles game in April 1989. Gore _ who
saw his son's body fly through the air and fall to the pavement _
knelt and performed CPR, and for months, alternating with Tipper,
slept nights on hospital rollaways to be by young Albert's side.
Albert is now healthy, but his father was reminded of the
vicissitudes of life, life beyond politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is introspective in that sense. He knows he is moved by
personal experience as well as reason. ``Earth in the Balance'' has
been criticized for not reading like a scientific treatise, but
it's not meant to be one. It's a personal statement backed up by
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore likes to make personal statements _ well reasoned but,
at a fundamental level, personal. Not what you'd expect from a man
who is thought of as stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to write,'' he says. ``I began as an English
major at Harvard, then switched to government. But writing is a
source of so much pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is said by some that Gore was bred for the presidency. This
is not intended as a compliment. Yet nobody knocks Carl Ripken Jr.
for his baseball skills. Nobody is (ital) surprised (end ital)
Ripken plays baseball. The surprise would be if he played cello. Or
if Gore played baseball. Al Gore is his father's son.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says his dad was his mentor, a voice he heard and listened
to, the man who inculcated in him a sense of decorum, respect for
learning, for justice and for God.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Gore went home to bury his father. In his eulogy,
he said of The Senator: ``The night he lost in 1970, he made me
prouder still. He said defeat may serve as well as victory to shake
the soul and let the glory out. Then he turned the old Southern
segregationist slogan on its head and declared, `The truth shall
rise again.' ``
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore can articulate who (ital) he (end ital) is the same
way he captured his father's essence, style may just give way to
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Upriver from Carthage, where the Cumberland River twists through
steep-sided valleys, Cordell Hull Lake rides high behind Cordell
Hull Dam, a concrete wonder built by the Army Corps of Engineers 60
years ago to tame the Cumberland.
</P>
<P>
   The lake holds a lesson for anyone trying to flesh out Al Gore.
It was conceived by powerful politicians more than a half century
ago, built in Tennessee with the latest technology and managed by
Washington professionals. Surface appearances do not divulge true
dimensions, and closer scrutiny is difficult because access is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a Washington dam or a Tennessee lake? Who cares? A more
important question is, how deep is it?
</P>
<P>
   America is about to find out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, are nestled on a couch in the
forward, private cabin of Air Force Two, eastbound 36,000 feet over
Kansas. The cabin is bare of decoration, except for a wall map of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The world: Almost 6 billion people. The president of the United
States may be the most powerful human being on the planet. The vice
president is not.
</P>
<P>
   A century from now, only professors and trivia experts will know
who was vice president in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Warm spit. A heartbeat away. Al Gore's heard them all. He smiles
as he tells the one about the man who had two brothers, one who
went to sea and one who became vice president, and neither was
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's on a mission to make sure that doesn't happen to him,
that future generations will remember his name and his deeds and
think well of both.
</P>
<P>
   Now is Al Gore's time to tell us who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's the Republicans' time to offer their version.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle kicked off his presidential
campaign by making clear he is running not only against Gore but
against ``Clinton-Gore'' on family values and character. The GOP
will target Gore's fund-raising practices, his environmental views
and federal insinuation into local school issues. There are plenty
of photos for attack ads: Gore with an impeached Clinton, Gore at
the Buddhist temple, Gore in China.
</P>
<P>
   And if the economy sours in the next year, if Y2K problems wreak
techno-havoc, Gore will need a team of mules to dig out from under
everything his opponents dump on him.
</P>
<P>
   How will Gore answer the opposition? Will he discard the
rhetoric of the '80s and deliver a message for the double-ought
decade?
</P>
<P>
   What sort of man is he, beyond the political? What forces forged
him as a child, young man, adult? How does he behave in informal
circumstances? Is he as stiff as the press makes him out to be?
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man,'' said Gore's boss at a recent dinner in
Sewall's Point, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if the words alone may not have fully conveyed his
meaning, Bill Clinton lowered his gaze for the briefest of moments.
He looked up, his stare intense, jaw set, right eye narrowed,
``He's a (ital) good (end ital) man.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pause. ``He has redefined the office of the vice
president. He is the most effective and active vice president in
history. A great deal of good has come out of this administration
during the last six years, and he is responsible for much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   For the next 18 months, Al Gore will tell us how he redefined
the office of vice president and what it means to us.
</P>
<P>
   He will tell us why he wants to be president. He says he has a
compelling vision of where we want to go as a nation, how we can
get there and how we can live better lives when we arrive.
</P>
<P>
   We will ask about his past. He will tell us about the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the future plays out as he hopes, he and Tipper will be
sitting in the forward cabin of another plane in less than 21
months.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   They don't see much of each other these days. He's off to
California, Palm Beach, New York raising money, lots of money.
He'll be testing his campaign message soon from Atlanta to Iowa,
Chicago to Texas. Tipper, too, is on the road, flying to or from
Bosnia, Hawaii, San Francisco, speaking about children's health
care. Once in a while, they hook up, as they did in San Francisco
on a day in early March.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice about them is the affection. He
drapes an arm over her shoulder. They touch fingers, smile. It's
spontaneous, warm.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the most natural woman I've met, down to earth,'' said
David Gergen of Tipper Gore during a recent visit to Palm Beach.
Gergen has met lots of first ladies as an adviser to George Bush
and Bill Clinton and as a journalist who covered eight White
Houses. ``She is well anchored,'' he says, ``and they are a lucky
couple. What you see is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Observes Bob Somerby, Al Gore's Harvard roommate and longtime
friend: ``I'm amazed at how normal they are. The life they lead _
the motorcades, everyone wants a piece of them, their status _
could swell their heads. But they're like they were 30 years ago.
Normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, an image of abiding love could be the contrivance of
political pros. But then, some things cannot be feigned, especially
for 33 years. Watch them speak to each other, touch, look. Everyone
knows at least one couple like this, the pair who really do like
each other.
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about life in the Gore home.
</P>
<P>
   Dinners?
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh a lot at the table,'' says Tipper. ``You have to be
able to laugh. When the children were younger, we'd talk about
music, art, politics, but not a great deal of politics. You want to
engage the children. It's a time when a family can be a family
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Music?
</P>
<P>
   ``We like a wide range,'' she says, but she flinches ever so
slightly, just a little tightening in the jaw. Her gaze asks _
demands _ are you coming at me with this '80s censorship thing?
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Tipper Gore was excoriated by Hollywood when she
lobbied for content labels on records and tapes. Frank Zappa called
her ``the wife of Big Brother'' at the time, prompting then-Senator
Gore to declare that as a younger man, he had been a big Zappa fan.
No matter how often Tipper said she did not want to censor any
musician, she was accused of trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should be able to buy a record and have a reasonable
idea of what's on it. That's all it was about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's back to her musical tastes. ``I like Herbie Hancock,
k.d. lang, Alison Krauss. She has such a sweet, beautiful voice ...
''
</P>
<P>
   ``And plays a stunning fiddle,'' says Gore. ``There's Garth
Brooks and Ricky Skaggs. Lucinda Williams ... ''
</P>
<P>
   They trade names for a few minutes more. Dvorak, Thelonious Monk
...
</P>
<P>
   The vice president strums an air guitar when he mentions Doc
Watson, the blind North Carolina bluegrass musician. ``We used to
see Doc when he played up north in the '60s,'' says Gore. ``When I
was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his memory wanders back to that spring night in 1966 when
he spied a young girl at a Washington party. He was 17, a senior
academic and athletic standout at St. Albans(cq), a Washington prep
school for the sons of the rich and influential. She was 16, a
junior at St. Agnes Episcopal School in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be able to close my eyes and relive that
moment,'' says Gore, doing just that. ``I can see her across the
room. Blond hair, very pretty smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl was Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson. An only child, her
parents, Margaret and Jack Aitcheson, divorced in 1952. She was
Tipper to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (ital) him (end ital) across the room,'' she says. ``I
met him and liked him. Smart. Funny. He called the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are three daughters _ Karenna, 25; Kristin, 21;
Sarah, 20 _ and a son, Albert Gore III, 16. The two younger
daughters are at Harvard. Karenna is married and attends Columbia
Law School. The Gores mortgaged their 88-acre Tennessee farm to the
rafters to send the young women to Harvard and pay for young
Albert's education at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington.
Financial disclosure forms filed in 1998 by Gore show a net worth
of just under $1 million, much of it derived from royalties on his
1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and Tipper's book of
photography, ``Picture This.'' He makes $171,500 a year as vice
president. There are no blind trusts, no large stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   They will become grandparents in June when Karenna gives birth
to her first child. Gore, who at 51 is five months older than his
wife, was asking everyone on Air Force Two who looked over 40 if
they were grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with the years going by, with age. Since about
age 45, I've been OK with my aging,'' he says. ``Becoming a
grandparent is one more wonderful event in a 33-year relationship
with a wonderful woman.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk about sharing those years, talk about family and
faith, his parents, their children. The future. His future.
</P>
<P>
   Why does he want to be president? Why put his wife and his
children and their children on the covers of supermarket tabloids?
Why expose the smallest details of his entire life to often
frenzied and not always accurate scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I want to do the job _ you have to (ital) want (end
ital) it _ because I can (ital) do (end ital) the job, because I
love my country and am grateful for the chance to (ital) lead (end
ital) this country. I know what that may mean for my family. I
thank God for Tipper's love. The love we share will see us through.
We're ready. I'm ready. I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited?
</P>
<P>
   Can this possibly be the same guy who's portrayed as somber,
humorless, wooden, a policy wonk? You know, ``Al Gore's timber all
right, but is it presidential timber?''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not charismatic,'' said CBS newsman Mike Wallace before
addressing members of a private art museum in Palm Beach. ``But
maybe the country has had enough of charisma for the moment. Al
Gore is substantial, a fine and honorable man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more prepared than any vice president I have known for
the duties of president,'' said Gergen. ``He reads all the cable
traffic _ State, CIA. But he does not get lost in details, as
(Jimmy) Carter did. He can delegate. At meetings with the
president, he is a participant, and the president makes clear his
respect for Gore. Al Gore is smart. Persistent. Very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a peculiar thing,'' says Martin Peretz, publisher of The
New Republic, Harvard professor and Gore friend. ``The Al Gore I
have known for more than 30 years is funny, engaging, not the
sometimes somber man you see on TV. He is sincere. He is not facile
_ that's the word I'd use _ like Bill Clinton. He was a good
student. He is intellectually honest. And you know, compared to
Bill Bradley, Al's a showman.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll get another point of view by reading ``Gore: A Political
Life,'' a new _ and not flattering _ biography of Gore by former
ABC newsman Bob Zelnick: ``There is, in short, not a man behind the
robot, but quite possibly a robot behind the man.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by Regnery, a conservative house, quotes an
unnamed ``White House insider'' as saying of Gore: ``He wants to
script every move he makes ... to say what his handlers tell him to
say and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Sit down and talk with Albert Gore Jr. and quickly you realize
he is decidedly not stiff. He wears an easy smile. He listens. He
looks you in the eye. He speaks with precision but drives home
points with humor, analogy, metaphor. His voice is rich yet soft.
It carries a mild Southern inflection. He gestures with his hands
in a measured sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Air Force Two, he displayed with glee a bumper sticker:
``Nixon in 2000 _ He's still not as stiff as Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks with enthusiasm about his reading interests: British
geneticist Richard Dawkins, cosmologist Stephen Hawking, physicist
Richard Feynman, historian William Manchester, books on
thermodynamics, computers, emerging markets, Darwin, chaos theory,
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read at the expense of my sleep time,'' says Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man engaged by the world and the people in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world, the universe and our place in the universe, it is
all so humbling. Some of these modern thinkers are so smart _
Hawking, the smartest man in the world. And his illness forces him
to communicate by voice synthesizer. A century ago he would have
been an outcast.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks at length about the early years of the information
highway but does not take credit for inventing the Internet _ as he
was quoted in March as having done in a moment of hyperbole or
misstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Then he whips a subcompact notebook computer from his pocket and
starts to explicate the technology, memory capacity, cost versus
power, possible future regulatory implications of the unit's
infrared data-sending capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody could intercept my message when I send it from my
unit to yours,'' he says. ``New technologies are just pouring out
of R&AMP;D laboratories. Data processing capacities are growing
exponentially. We are truly living in extraordinary times.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, holds aloft his state-of-the art notepad for effect.
``We have to decide where we want to take technology like this, not
where it wants to take us. Our new knowledge presents an incredible
opportunity and challenge for all of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this a guy who likes technology for technology's sake, or
will he translate his personal vision of the world into a political
vision? The campaign will tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for a national newspaper sitting near Gore on Air
Force Two listens as the vice president wanders the philosophical
landscape. ``Geez,'' he says after the vice president leaves, ``why
can't he talk like that on TV?''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the Al Gore of the podium, the Al Gore of
the nightly news clip. Often, when Gore speaks from behind a podium
he is stiff, as if the sleeves of his dark blue suits are lined
with flagpoles. Even when reading his own words, he often manifests
a bewildering ability to perform oratorical alchemy by turning
golden concepts into lead.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the vice president call this transition from engaging
private fellow to listless public orator the ``disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is aware of the perception. He jokes about it. ``I like the
low expectations. It's funny,'' he says, ``but my father was known
as the fiddle-playing, outgoing Tennessee senator. Yet he was a
formal man. He taught me how to properly show respect, for my
elders, for the president. So I'm thought of as formal, but I don't
see myself that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers would like him to maximize his public
appearances in places where he can be informal, venues where he can
moderate a round-table discussion or lead a ``town meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast trip he used just-plain-English to tell
Seattle residents their two-hour commutes to and from work were
wrong. He told them the federal government could not and would not
become a zoning board, but would loosen the purse strings to help
cities unclog highways so workers can get home in time to have
dinner with their families. Gore calls it his ``livability
agenda.'' Gore was at ease, used no techno-jargon. He connected.
</P>
<P>
   He told Seattle high-tech executives the explosion in technology
had to reach the meekest among mankind in order to truly serve
mankind. He told them government policy lagged private sector
development. The high-tech crowd found him more prepared than
``prepped'' for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows as much as we do,'' said one. ``He (ital) knows (end
ital) his stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided podiums and scripted speeches. He was loose.
There were no handlers on hand.
</P>
<P>
   On the return trip, Gore spoke of where he may go in his
campaign. ``I believe any candidate for president must show the
American people three things. First, you must have a clear vision
of our shared future, a compelling vision. You must be able to
communicate that vision and identify within it certain goals,
destinations we want to reach as a people, and identify ways of
reaching those goals. Finally, there must be an awareness of our
shared values upon which decisions can be based while the
administration and the country work toward reaching that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``I believe I can do that. I want to do that. I'm
excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when his days in Washington are done _ maybe after next
year, maybe in January 2005, perhaps in 2009 _ where will he go?
</P>

   ``When I was a boy, my father sent me out to work the fields to
learn about work, to learn about life,'' Al Gore says aboard Air
Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me how to clear land with a double-bladed ax. He
taught me how to plow a steep hillside with a team of mules,'' Gore
was quoted in The Des Moines Register, March 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Again, you can find contrary views. ``Lyrical,'' ``tall tales,''
``gauzy,'' ``Norman Rockwell-style account'' are descriptions used
by some of the Washington media to describe Gore's memories of
Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   ``How preposterous. ... Real farmers, even poor ones, have been
hiring bulldozers to clear land since before Al Gore was born,''
wrote William Kristol's conservative Weekly Standard on March 29,
1999. ``No responsible farmer since the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s
has plowed a steep hillside.''

   To get to Carthage, county seat of Smith County, drive about 50
miles east from Nashville on I-40. Upon arrival, certain truisms
can be learned from a cursory look at the countryside. It is hilly
hereabouts. Steep hilly. Farms look like they're about to slide
down the hillsides. Small farms. The farmers are not rich. They do
not plow land with rented bulldozers because renting a bulldozer is
expensive, and they tend to roll over and fall down the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage sits on high land above a bend in the wide and
fast-flowing Cumberland River. It's home to the Friday night
catfish fry at the City Diner just down the block from Main Street,
where the old Walton Hotel is closed for renovation. Here, you
still park your car nose in to the curb, but dry goods stores have
been replaced by kitschy boutiques, antique shops and law offices.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell Hull's house sits just up the road. Hull _ Tennessee
congressman and FDR's secretary of state _ was mentor to Gore's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Old tobacco barns, bleached gray, hug low hillsides and lean
crazily in shaded hollows. The Smith County population has grown by
several hundred in the last few years, to almost 15,000. At dusk,
the interstate discharges commuters from Nashville onto local
roads. At night, the valley is quiet. It all looks as it did 40 or
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was born here on March 31, 1948. His sister, Nancy, was
10. The Gores hadn't expected another child. There would be no more
after Al.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Albert Gore Sr., was the local school
superintendent, congressman and U.S. senator from 1953 to 1971.
While a senator in the mid-1950s, he was the prime mover for the
interstate highway system and an early supporter of Medicare.
Gore's mother, Pauline LaFon, was one of the first women to
graduate from Vanderbilt Law School, though she chose marriage and
a family over legal practice.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his Senate seat in 1970, the senior Gore became
chairman of Island Creek Coal Co., a board member of Occidental
Petroleum and raised beef cattle, chickens and tobacco on his
200-acre hillside farm.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying the farm, located about five miles out of
Carthage, the senator and his wife _ in Carthage he is still called
The Senator, she is called Miss Pauline _ kept house in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to sit on the porch summer evenings,'' says Janet
Jenkins, 64, a lifelong Carthage resident. ``We didn't often see
Nancy or Pauline on Main Street, but The Senator put on his
britches like the rest of us. The Senator was raised on a small
farm at Possum Hollow, and not raised rich. I heard the very first
speech he ever gave. On the courthouse steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr. died last December at age 90. Mrs. Gore has
suffered two stroke and a heart attack since 1993, but, at 86, she
is still known for her political acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage residents say the senior Gore was many things _ as good
a farmer as he was a politician _ but remained at heart a man who
loved the land of Middle Tennessee. By the late 1960s, he seemed to
be ahead of his time in casting Senate votes against the Vietnam
War, against school prayer amendments, against banning forced
school busing. His constituents thought the senator no longer
reflected Tennessee values. He was defeated by Bill Brock, then a
30-year-old candy fortune heir, in a Senate race still talked about
as downright mean.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr. vowed never again to run for office, and did
not. He said he was going home to his farm, and did. He grew some
tobacco. Later, by the mid-'70s, his son was growing tobacco on his
farm.

moving.

<P>
   Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, are nestled on a couch in the
forward, private cabin of Air Force Two, eastbound 36,000 feet over
Kansas. The cabin is bare of decoration, except for a wall map of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice about them is the affection. He
drapes an arm over her shoulder. They touch fingers, smile. It's
spontaneous, warm.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, an image of abiding love could be the contrivance of
political pros. But then, some things cannot be feigned, especially
for 33 years. Watch them speak to each other, touch, look. Everyone
knows at least one couple like this, the pair who really do like
each other.
</P>
<P>
   They don't see much of each other these days. He's off to
California, Palm Beach, New York raising money, lots of money.
He'll be testing his campaign message soon from Ohio to North
Carolina, Colorado to Texas. Tipper, too, is on the road, speaking
about children's health care. Once in a while, they hook up, as
they did in San Francisco on a day in early March.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about family and faith, his parents, their children.
The future. His future.
</P>
<P>
   Now is Al Gore's time to tell us who he is. The vice president
says he has a compelling vision of where we want to go as a nation,
how we can get there and how we can live better lives when we
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's the Republicans' time to offer their version.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle kicked off his presidential
campaign by making clear he is running not only against Gore, but
against ``Clinton-Gore'' on family values and character.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP will target Gore's fund-raising practices, his
environmental views and federal insinuation into local school
issues. There are plenty of photos for attack ads: Gore with an
impeached Clinton, Gore at the Buddhist temple, Gore in China.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 18 months, Gore will tell us why he wants to be
president: ``Because I want to do the job _ you have to want it _
because I can do the job, because I love my country and am grateful
for the chance to lead this country ... I thank God for Tipper's
love. The love we share will see us through. We're ready. I'm
ready. I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited?
</P>
<P>
   Can this possibly be the same guy who's portrayed as somber,
wooden, a policy wonk? You know, ``Al Gore's timber all right, but
is it presidential timber?''
</P>
<P>
   Sit down and talk with Albert Gore Jr. and quickly you realize
he is decidedly not stiff. He wears an easy smile. He listens. He
looks you in the eye. He speaks with precision, but drives home
points with humor, analogy, metaphor. His voice is rich yet soft.
It carries a mild Southern inflection. He gestures with his hands
in a measured sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   He displays with glee a bumper sticker: ``Nixon in 2000 _ He's
still not as stiff as Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about life in the Gore home.
</P>
<P>
   Dinners?
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh a lot at the table,'' says Tipper. ``You have to be
able to laugh. When the children were younger, we'd talk about
music, art, politics, but not a great deal of politics. You want to
engage the children. It's a time when a family can be a family
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Music?
</P>
<P>
   ``We like a wide range,'' she says, but she flinches ever so
slightly, just a little tightening in the jaw. Her gaze asks _
demands _ are you coming at me with this '80s censorship thing?
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Tipper Gore was excoriated by Hollywood when she
lobbied for content labels on records and tapes. Frank Zappa called
her ``the wife of Big Brother'' at the time, prompting then-Senator
Gore to declare that as a younger man, he had been a big Zappa fan.
No matter how often Tipper said she did not want to censor any
musician, she was accused of trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should be able to buy a record and have a reasonable
idea of what's on it. That's all it was about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's back to her musical tastes. ``I like Herbie Hancock,
k.d. lang, Alison Krauss. She has such a sweet, beautiful voice ...
''
</P>
<P>
   ``And plays a stunning fiddle,'' says Gore. ``There's Garth
Brooks and Ricky Skaggs. Lucinda Williams ... ''
</P>
<P>
   They trade names for a few minutes more. Dvorak, Thelonious Monk
...
</P>
<P>
   The vice president strums an air guitar when he mentions Doc
Watson, the blind North Carolina bluegrass musician. ``We used to
see Doc when he played up north in the '60s,'' says Gore. ``When I
was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his memory wanders back to that spring night in 1966 when
he spied a young girl at a Washington party. He was 17, a senior
academic and athletic standout at St. Albans(cq), a Washington prep
school for the sons of the rich and influential. She was 16, a
junior at St. Agnes Episcopal School in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be able to close my eyes and relive that
moment,'' says Gore, doing just that. ``I can see her across the
room. Blond hair, very pretty smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl was Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson. An only child, her
parents, Margaret and Jack Aitcheson, divorced in 1952. She was
Tipper to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him across the room,'' she says. ``I met him and liked
him. Smart. Funny. He called the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are three daughters _ Karenna, 25; Kristin, 21;
Sarah, 20 _ and a son, Albert Gore III, 16. The two younger
daughters are at Harvard. Karenna is married and attends Columbia
Law School. The Gores mortgaged their 88-acre Tennessee farm to the
rafters to send the young women to Harvard and pay for young
Albert's education at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington.
Financial disclosure forms filed in 1998 by Gore show a net worth
of just under $1 million, much of it derived from royalties on his
1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and Tipper's book of
photography, ``Picture This.'' He makes $171,500 a year as vice
president. There are no blind trusts, no large stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   They will become grandparents in June when Karenna gives birth
to her first child. ``I'm comfortable with the years going by, with
age. Since about age 45, I've been OK with my aging,'' says Gore,
who at 51 is five months older than his wife.
</P>
<P>
   And when his days in Washington are done _ maybe after next
year, maybe in January 2005, perhaps in 2009 _ where will he go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Home. To Tennessee. To my farm. I'd like to write. Fiction,
non-fiction. That's what I'll do. That's where I'll go. To
Carthage. Home.''
</P>
<P>

   To get to Carthage, county seat of Smith County, drive about 50
miles east from Nashville on I-40.
</P>

   Al Gore was born here on March 31, 1948. His sister, Nancy, was
10. The Gores hadn't expected another child. There would be no more
after Al.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Albert Gore Sr., was the local school
superintendent, congressman and U.S. senator from 1953 to 1971.
While a senator in the mid-1950s, he was the prime mover for the

Gore's mother, Pauline LaFon, was one of the first women to

to 30-year-old candy heir Bill Brock, the senior Gore became
chairman of Island Creek Coal Co., a board member of Occidental

200-acre hillside farm.
</P>
<P>
   He died last December at age 90. Mrs. Gore has suffered two
strokes and a heart attack since 1993, but, at 86, she is still
known for her political acumen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Tennesseeans apparently thought the senator was out of
step for opposing the Vietnam War, a school prayer amendment, a ban
on school busing. He vowed never again to run for office, and did
not. He said he was going home to his farm, and did. He grew some
tobacco. Later, by the mid-'70s, his son was growing tobacco on his
farm.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore Jr. has been whacked for not stopping his tobacco
cultivation soon enough after his sister's death from lung cancer
in 1984. At the 1996 Democratic convention, he delivered a
wrenching speech about Nancy and her death. But the speech stirred
criticism that Gore would exploit anyone or any circumstance for
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see every connection between events overnight,''
Gore explained as he talked softly aboard Air Force Two. ``On my
farm, we stopped growing tobacco some time after Nancy died. We no
longer have an allotment. But my father had grown tobacco for 50
years. This was his life. Then _ it was a few years later _ one of
his grandchildren asked, `Grandpa, do we still grow tobacco?' He
thought for a minute. `Not any more,' he said. And that was the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's farm sits on a hillside across the Caney
Fork River from his dad's farm, where Pauline Gore still lives. He
bought the farm and 2,100-square-foot house from his father in 1973
for $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   The house is long, low, faced in reddish-brown brick. A white
rail fence surrounds the property. A gate at the end of the long
drive is closed and locked. Similar-sized farms in Smith County are
listed by real estate agents for between $200,000 and $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, home isn't a value-free word, and even Gore's roots
are being questioned: Is he from Washington or Tennessee?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is a city kid, father a senator. He grew up in
Washington,'' reported Bruce Morton on CNN's Inside Politics on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
   Former ABC newsman Bob Zelnick, in his unflattering biography,
Gore: A Political Life, articulates the conclusion: ``He has had no
life to speak of outside of government save for a few years on a
Nashville newspaper _ where he covered government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think because Al spent school years in Washington
with his family, he's not authentic,'' says Jerry Futrell,
president of Smith County Hospital and a Gore family friend for 35
years. ``Al transcended Carthage. That doesn't mean he isn't
Carthage. Of course, he lived in Washington part of the year. His
father worked there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al won his congressional seat in 1976, he promised to
hold town meetings. He did, every weekend, in garages, stores,
diners. Hundreds of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he won re-election to the Senate in 1990, he carried all
95 counties in Tennessee. Either Tennesseans can't tell when a
candidate is local, or you reporters need to have your eyes
checked.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of his Tennessee roots, it would be only fair to
let Gore have the last word: ``When I went home on holidays from
Harvard, I went to Carthage. When I came back from Vietnam, I could
have gone to Washington, to Cambridge, California, anywhere. But I
didn't. I went home. To Carthage.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Gore joined the Army in 1970. In May of that year, he and Tipper
married. In December, Spec. 5 Gore went to Vietnam, where he served
seven months as a newsletter writer in an engineering battalion. He
didn't see combat and didn't serve the usual 12 months in Vietnam
because his enlistment was up by early autumn 1971. While overseas,
he sent a story about a Viet Cong ambush to the Tennessean,
Nashville's morning daily, where editor John Seigenthaler liked
what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Gore smoked a little marijuana. He drank a little beer _ not a
lot, say friends. During his Army stint, he and Tipper lived in a
trailer outside an Alabama Army base. They drove an old VW bus into
the Rockies, where they camped and hiked.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore's enlistment was up, he and Tipper returned to
Nashville, where he began working for the Tennessean and Tipper
studied photography.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he thought he'd make journalism a career. He had tried
law school at Vanderbilt in the early '70s but says he didn't like
the way he saw justice dispensed. He had tried divinity school at
Vanderbilt for a semester but didn't hear a loud enough call.
</P>
<P>
   Politics _ not preaching, not law, not journalism _ finally
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved journalism. But then, February 1976, John Seigenthaler
called me at home,'' says Gore. ``He said, `Al, I thought you'd
like to know Joe Evins isn't running for re-election.' I listened.
I think I said thanks. If you had asked me two days before would I
run, I'd have said no. I hung up the phone and turned to Tipper.
`Joe Evins isn't running,' I said. Then, right then, I knew. `I'm
gonna run for Congress,' I told Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   He beat eight Democrats in the primary, won the general election
and served four terms. In 1984, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
By then, Gore had gained a reputation among colleagues as a whiz on
arms control. He garnered national publicity when he pushed
legislation through the House that required higher standards in the
manufacturing of infant formula. He took submarine trips to the
North Pole to further publicize his views on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody _ friend and foe _ has an opinion about Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Terms used by some former House and Senate colleagues and
journalists to describe Gore: ``Not a team player,'' ``a Rosie Ruiz
type,'' ``self-promoter,'' ``loner,'' ``Prince Albert,''
``preppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional associates, journalists and friends suggest:
``Prepared,'' ``disciplined,'' ``regular guy,'' ``honest.''
</P>
<P>
   But only Gore can show who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Clues to Gore's vision can be found in his book, ``Earth in the
Balance,'' a 385-page warning on global warming, pollution, how we
made the mess and how we can fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in the preface, says he wrote the book for many reasons,
including the emotional change he underwent while his son, Albert
Gore III, spent months in the hospital after being hit by a car as
the family left a Baltimore Orioles game in April 1989. Gore _ who
saw his son's body fly through the air and fall to the pavement _
knelt and performed CPR, and for months, alternating with Tipper,
spent nights by young Albert's side. Albert is now healthy, but his
father was reminded of the vicissitudes of life, life beyond
politics.
</P>
<P>
   It is said by some that Gore was bred for the presidency: He is
his father's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envied Al's love for his parents,'' says Bob Somerby, who,
like actor Tommy Lee Jones, roomed with Gore at Harvard. ``How many
kids moved back next door to their parents after college? He made
decisions because his father brought him up to honor certain
values, do things right, for right's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says his dad was his mentor, a voice he heard and listened
to, the man who inculcated in him a sense of decorum, respect for
learning, for justice and for God.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Gore went home to bury his father. In his eulogy,
he said: ``The night he lost in 1970, he made me prouder still. He
said defeat may serve as well as victory to shake the soul and let
the glory out. Then he turned the old Southern segregationist
slogan on its head and declared, `The truth shall rise again.' ``
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore can articulate who he is the same way he captured his
father's essence, style may just give way to substance.
</P>
<P>
   Upriver from Carthage, where the Cumberland River twists through
steep-sided valleys, Cordell Hull Lake rides high behind Cordell
Hull Dam, a concrete wonder built by the Army Corps of Engineers 60
years ago to tame the Cumberland.
</P>
<P>
   The lake holds a lesson for anyone trying to flesh out Al Gore.
It was conceived by powerful politicians more than a half century
ago, built in Tennessee with the latest technology and managed by
Washington professionals. Surface appearances do not divulge true
dimensions, and closer scrutiny is difficult because access is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a Washington dam or a Tennessee lake? Who cares? A more
important question is, how deep is it?
</P>
<P>
   America is about to find out.

``Gore: A Political Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike Wallace, who professes high regard for Gore, says: ``I
wonder, though, at the 1996 convention speech about his sister's
death. It might have been a bit much, considering the Gore family's
continued tobacco cultivation and Gore's continued support of
tobacco subsidies. But I don't doubt that Al Gore has been deeply

   Tobacco is big in Carthage _ burley tobacco, used as cigarette
filler _ but there are no (ital) big (end ital) tobacco farmers.
The government parcels out tobacco allotments to farmers based on
projected sales data supplied by tobacco companies. A farmer can
use his allotment, lease it to another farmer, or give it back to
the government, a rarity because allotments increase land value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco pays for the new Chevy, helps pay the taxes. Three or
four acres is average in central Tennessee. Ten acres is big,''
says Billy Driver, who once worked in the Carthage post office and
now farms burley leaf on seven of his 53 acres in nearby Macon
County.
</P>

   ``Tobacco ties people together here like automobiles in Detroit
or corn in Nebraska,'' says Driver. ``Around here, two farmers will
stop their trucks on a country road, one heading west, the other
east. They'll roll down their windows and talk for half an hour.
Talk tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore once grew tobacco. His father had grown it for decades.
Billy Driver knows more than most how much tobacco the Gores grew
on their farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought The Senator's tobacco sticks back in 1991 _ 6,000 of
them,'' says Driver. ``Sticks are the long poles you tie the leaf
to, to cure it in the barn. You need maybe 1,500 sticks per acre of
leaf, so maybe The Senator, Al's father, planted four or five acres
when he last grew tobacco. An acre might bring $2,000, $3,000 per
year. The Gores were comfortable. Young Al ain't rich. I don't see
him driving the hills, you know, don't see him much. But I'll tell
you this: He didn't grow much leaf, and he don't grow any tobacco
no more, because I got the sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gores, father and son, were devastated by the loss of Nancy.
But they didn't stop growing leaf right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see every connection between events overnight,''
Gore explained as he talked softly aboard Air Force Two. ``On my
farm, we stopped growing tobacco some time after Nancy died. We no
longer have an allotment. But my father had grown tobacco for 50
(ital) years. (end ital) This was his life. Then _ it was a few
years later _ one of his grandchildren asked, `Grandpa, do we still
grow tobacco?' He thought for a minute. `Not any more,' he said.
And that was the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore Jr. traces much in his political life to deeply moving
experiences in his personal life: ``My family, my father, his
death, my sister, her death. Growing older. My son's accident. I'm
becoming a grandparent soon. These are events that change you,'' he
says. ``Some of the changes you see right away, some take time,
some change comes over you slowly and you don't fully see or even
understand until sometime later, when you look inward. My father,
though, influenced me in so, so many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's farm sits on a hillside across the Caney Fork River from
his dad's farm, where Pauline Gore still lives. He bought the farm
and 2,100-square-foot house from his father in 1973 for $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's house is long, low, faced in reddish-brown
brick. A white rail fence surrounds the property. A gate at the end
of the long drive is closed and locked. Similar-sized farms in
Smith County are listed by real estate agents for between $200,000
and $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Up the road a few hundred yards is a general store operated by a
fellow named Walter Brown Jr. The Gores and their four children do
not shop at his store, says Brown. Farther up the road is a little
honky-tonk road house. You needn't look for the Gores there,
either. You'd have better luck at New Salem Missionary Baptist
Church, which the family attends when they come to town.
</P>
<P>
   A zinc mine operated by Savage Zinc squats near the banks of the
Caney Fork about a quarter-mile behind the vice president's home.
Zinc tunnels snake right under homes, farms and Main Street, where
retailers like Billy Markham lease mineral rights to Savage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years after his election defeat, even after his death,
people in Carthage debate The Senator's politics, but nobody
debates his character. He is not remembered as a dynasty-building,
political hard-muscle man, like Joe Kennedy Sr. There are no
stories about any behavior other than upright.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much how they talk about his son. They like him.
Often they'll preface an answer about, say, Gore's farm with
something like: ``He's never winked at another woman, you know.''
Or: ``He's a (ital) good (end ital) man, a (ital) family (end ital)
man.'' They defend him against questions not even asked.
</P>
<P>
   There's something else they make clear: They don't send anyone
but their own to Washington. ``He's one of us'' is often heard in
these parts of Tennessee.

   ``Gore was a son of politics, a child of Washington,'' the
Weekly Standard pointed out to readers in its March 29 issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Gore is a city kid, father a senator. He grew up in
Washington,'' reported Bruce Morton on CNN's Inside Politics on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sir, in Smith County we don't elect outsiders to
Congress, and outsiders are pretty much anybody who don't live in
Smith County,'' allowed Billy Markham, owner of Markham's General

<P>
   Son of Washington or son of Tennessee? Al Gore finds himself
defending his past because some in the media hold his truth to be
relative. All it takes is a snappy comment _ ``No farmer plows a
steep hillside'' or ``child of Washington'' _ and the (ital)
implication (end ital) is clear: Al Gore is a liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think because Al spent school years in Washington
with his family, he's not authentic,'' says Jerry Futrell,
president of Smith County Hospital and Gore family friend for 35
years. ``Al transcended Carthage. That doesn't mean he isn't
Carthage. Of course, he lived in Washington part of the year. His
father worked there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al won his congressional seat in 1976, he promised to
hold town meetings. He did, every weekend, in garages, stores,
diners. Hundreds of meetings. He told tobacco farmers changes were
coming. He helped put warning labels on cigarette packs. They
re-elected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he won re-election to the Senate in 1990, he carried all
95 counties in Tennessee. Either Tennesseans can't tell when a
candidate is local, or you reporters need to have your eyes
checked.''
</P>
<P>
   Followed to its logical conclusion, the knock on Gore's
geographic roots must arrive at only one place. Bob Zelnick
articulates that conclusion: ``He has had no life to speak of
outside of government save for a few years on a Nashville newspaper
_ where he covered government.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, it would seem to some, by being both a son of
Washington (ital) and (end ital) Tennessee can make no credible
claim to being the son of any place.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of his Tennessee roots, it would be only fair to
let Gore have the last word: ``When I went home on holidays from
Harvard, I went to Carthage. When I came back from Vietnam, I could
have gone to Washington, to Cambridge, California, anywhere. But I
didn't. I went home. To Carthage.''
</P>

   Zelnick on Gore's 1970 enlistment in the Army: ``Al Gore Jr.
would not endanger his father's political future or his own. He
would volunteer for military service and take his chances in
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for a national newspaper: ``Divinity school was a
good way to get out of Vietnam.'' Told that Gore was a divinity
student after serving in Vietnam, the reporter said, ``I don't
think so. Why would someone do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Harvard roommate Bob Somerby on Gore's military service:
``I can't tell you all the reasons Al enlisted, but I can tell you
one reason that wasn't. His political future. Hell, none of us knew
in 1969 if we'd have a future.''
</P>

<P>
   Al Gore joined the Army in 1970. In May of that year, he and
Tipper married. In December, Spec. 5 Gore went to Vietnam, where he
served seven months as a newsletter writer in an engineering
battalion. He didn't see combat, and didn't serve the usual 12
months in Vietnam because his enlistment was up by early autumn
1971. While overseas, he sent a story about a Viet Cong ambush to
the Tennessean, Nashville's morning daily, where editor John
Seigenthaler liked what he saw. Gore's friends say he was a good
writer; his detractors say he was not.
</P>
<P>
   He smoked a little marijuana. He drank a little beer _ not a
lot, say friends. During his Army stint, he and Tipper lived in a
trailer outside an Alabama Army base. They drove an old VW bus into
the Rockies, where they camped and hiked. They listened to rock 'n'
roll. They didn't buy into the tuned-out culture, nor did they
become revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore's Army enlistment was up, he and Tipper returned to
Nashville, where he began working for the Tennessean and Tipper
studied photography. She soon began free-lancing her photos to the
Tennessean.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick's speculation on the motives for Al Gore's Army
enlistment presupposes that he had a political future in mind when
he joined.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Somerby, but most of Gore's friends from Harvard,
Carthage and Nashville cannot recall a single discussion with Gore
during the years 1965 to 1975 _ about Vietnam or anything else _ in
which Gore alluded to a political future for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disgusted with politics, hurt by his father's loss,''
says Frank Sutherland, long-time Gore friend and fellow reporter at
the Tennessean. ``The last thing I thought Al Gore would do is run
for office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd stay in journalism and end up at The New York
Times or Washington Post,'' says Seigenthaler, editor and publisher
of the Tennessean during the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envied Al's love for his parents,'' says his Harvard
roommate, Bob Somerby. ``How many kids moved back next door to
their parents after college? Al's friends were people like me and
Tommy Lee Jones. Totally unconnected people. Harvard was full of
(ital) really (end ital) connected people, but Al's friends were
just regular guys. He made decisions because his father brought him
up to (ital) honor (end ital) certain values, (ital) do things
right, (end ital) for right's sake. Not because his father was a
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore told many of his friends that if he didn't
enlist, some other Smith County boy would _ and maybe die.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland, who is now the editor of the Tennessean, says:
``Whatever political hopes Al's father had for Al came to fruition
not because (ital) he (end ital) harbored those hopes, but because
(ital) Al (end ital) chose _ in his own time and at his own pace _
to pursue a political career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he thought he'd make journalism a career. He had tried
law school at Vanderbilt in the early '70s but says he didn't like
the way he saw justice dispensed. He had tried divinity school at
Vanderbilt for a semester but didn't hear a loud enough call.
</P>
<P>
   Politics _ not preaching, not law, not journalism _ finally
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved journalism. But then, February 1976, John Seigenthaler
called me at home,'' says Gore. ``He said, `Al, I thought you'd
like to know Joe Evins isn't running for re-election.' I listened.
I think I said thanks. If you had asked me two days before would I
run, I'd have said no. I hung up the phone and turned to Tipper.
`Joe Evins isn't running,' I said. Then, (ital) right then, (end
ital) I knew. `I'm gonna run for Congress,' I told Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   He beat eight Democrats in the primary, won the general election
and served four terms. In 1984, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
By then, Gore had gained a reputation among colleagues as a whiz on
arms control. He garnered national publicity when he pushed
legislation through the House that required higher standards in the
manufacturing of infant formula. He took submarine trips to the
North Pole to further publicize his views on global warming. And he
came to Carthage almost every weekend for those town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   Terms used by some former House and Senate colleagues and
journalists to describe Gore: ``Not a team player,'' ``a Rosie Ruiz
type,'' ``self-promoter,'' ``loner,'' ``Prince Albert,''
``preppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional associates, journalists and friends suggest:
``Prepared,'' ``disciplined,'' ``regular guy,'' ``honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   So who is the real Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's got an opinion, friend and foe. But only Gore can
(ital) show (end ital) who he is.
</P>
<P>
   To win the hearts and minds of voters, he has to connect through
media that are disconnected, abstract. Whether Gore wins may depend
on whether he takes the risk and specifies the particulars of what
he calls his vision.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics will be test-marketed, polled, analyzed. On this
Air Force Two flight, it's not time yet for Gore to download his
theory of new technologies, their social implications, the policies
needed to manage them, the markets needed to promulgate them. He is
still thinking about how to articulate his vision.
</P>
<P>
   He may even be thinking about (ital) if (end ital) he wants to
articulate it.
</P>
<P>
   Visionaries walk a fine line. If Gore's ultimate message is too
cerebral, he'll reinforce the dreaded egghead suspicion. If it's
overly simplified, he'll be called on to show the emperor's
wardrobe. He may choose safety over risk and leave the message
unsent.
</P>
<P>
   But if he takes that route, he risks leaving unsaid the very
ideas that so engage him. And without a new Al Gore behind the
podium, he likely will come across as the old wooden one.
</P>
<P>
   Clues to Gore's vision can be found in speeches delivered at the
Chernobyl Museum in Kiev, at conferences such as those in Seattle
and Oakland and, especially, in his book, ``Earth in the Balance,''
a 385-page warning on global warming, pollution, how we made the
mess and how we can fix it. There is even a chapter on (ital) why,
(end ital) from a psychological standpoint, we made the mess, a
chapter some readers find confusing, a tad spiritualistic and
perhaps downright odd.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick calls ``Earth in the Balance'' ``more of a nostalgic
anti-modernism than a reasonable analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in the preface, says he wrote the book for many reasons,
including the emotional change he underwent while his son, Albert
Gore III, spent months in the hospital after being hit by a car as
the family left a Baltimore Orioles game in April 1989. Gore _ who
saw his son's body fly through the air and fall to the pavement _
knelt and performed CPR, and for months, alternating with Tipper,
slept nights on hospital rollaways to be by young Albert's side.
Albert is now healthy, but his father was reminded of the
vicissitudes of life, life beyond politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is introspective in that sense. He knows he is moved by
personal experience as well as reason. ``Earth in the Balance'' has
been criticized for not reading like a scientific treatise, but
it's not meant to be one. It's a personal statement backed up by
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore likes to make personal statements _ well reasoned but,
at a fundamental level, personal. Not what you'd expect from a man
who is thought of as stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to write,'' he says. ``I began as an English
major at Harvard, then switched to government. But writing is a
source of so much pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is said by some that Gore was bred for the presidency. This
is not intended as a compliment. Yet nobody knocks Carl Ripken Jr.
for his baseball skills. Nobody is (ital) surprised (end ital)
Ripken plays baseball. The surprise would be if he played cello. Or
if Gore played baseball. Al Gore is his father's son.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says his dad was his mentor, a voice he heard and listened
to, the man who inculcated in him a sense of decorum, respect for
learning, for justice and for God.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Gore went home to bury his father. In his eulogy,
he said of The Senator: ``The night he lost in 1970, he made me
prouder still. He said defeat may serve as well as victory to shake
the soul and let the glory out. Then he turned the old Southern
segregationist slogan on its head and declared, `The truth shall
rise again.' ``
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore can articulate who (ital) he (end ital) is the same
way he captured his father's essence, style may just give way to
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Upriver from Carthage, where the Cumberland River twists through
steep-sided valleys, Cordell Hull Lake rides high behind Cordell
Hull Dam, a concrete wonder built by the Army Corps of Engineers 60
years ago to tame the Cumberland.
</P>
<P>
   The lake holds a lesson for anyone trying to flesh out Al Gore.
It was conceived by powerful politicians more than a half century
ago, built in Tennessee with the latest technology and managed by
Washington professionals. Surface appearances do not divulge true
dimensions, and closer scrutiny is difficult because access is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a Washington dam or a Tennessee lake? Who cares? A more
important question is, how deep is it?
</P>
<P>
   America is about to find out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, are nestled on a couch in the
forward, private cabin of Air Force Two, eastbound 36,000 feet over
Kansas. The cabin is bare of decoration, except for a wall map of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The world: Almost 6 billion people. The president of the United
States may be the most powerful human being on the planet. The vice
president is not.
</P>
<P>
   A century from now, only professors and trivia experts will know
who was vice president in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Warm spit. A heartbeat away. Al Gore's heard them all. He smiles
as he tells the one about the man who had two brothers, one who
went to sea and one who became vice president, and neither was
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's on a mission to make sure that doesn't happen to him,
that future generations will remember hisname and his deeds and
think well of both.
</P>
<P>
   Now is Al Gore's time to tell us who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's the Republicans' time to offer their version.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle kicked off his presidential
campaign by making clear he is running not only against Gore but
against ``Clinton-Gore'' on family values and character. The GOP
will target Gore's fund-raising practices, his environmental views
and federal insinuation into local school issues. There are plenty
of photos for attack ads: Gore with an impeached Clinton, Gore at
the Buddhist temple, Gore in China.
</P>
<P>
   And if the economy sours in the next year, if Y2K problems wreak
techno-havoc, Gore will need a team of mules to dig out from under
everything his opponents dump on him.
</P>
<P>
   How will Gore answer the opposition? Will he discard the
rhetoric of the '80s and deliver a message for the double-ought
decade?
</P>
<P>
   What sort of man is he, beyond the political? What forces forged
him as a child, young man, adult? How does he behave in informal
circumstances? Is he as stiff as the press makes him out to be?
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man,'' said Gore's boss at a recent dinner in
Sewall's Point, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if the words alone may not have fully conveyed his
meaning, Bill Clinton lowered his gaze for the briefest of moments.
He looked up, his stare intense, jaw set, right eye narrowed,
``He's a (ital) good (end ital) man.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pause. ``He has redefined the office of the vice
president. He is the most effective and active vice president in
history. A great deal of good has come out of this administration
during the last six years, and he is responsible for much of it.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   For the next 18 months, Al Gore will tell us how he redefined
the office of vice president and what it means to us.
</P>
<P>
   He will tell us why he wants to be president. He says he has a
compelling vision of where we want to go as a nation, how we can
get there and how we can live better lives when we arrive.
</P>
<P>
   We will ask about his past. He will tell us about the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the future plays out as he hopes, he and Tipper will be
sitting in the forward cabin of another plane in less than 21
months.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   They don't see much of each other these days. He's off to
California, Palm Beach, New York raising money, lots of money.
He'll be testing his campaign message soon from Atlanta to Iowa,
Chicago to Texas. Tipper, too, is on the road, flying to or from
Bosnia, Hawaii, San Francisco, speaking about children's health
care. Once in a while, they hook up, as they did in San Francisco
on a day in early March.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice about them is the affection. He
drapes an arm over her shoulder. They touch fingers, smile. It's
spontaneous, warm.

   ``She's the most natural woman I've met, down to earth,'' said
David Gergen of Tipper Gore during a recent visit to Palm Beach.
Gergen has met lots of first ladies as an adviser to George Bush
and Bill Clinton and as a journalist who covered eight White
Houses. ``She is well anchored,'' he says, ``and they are a lucky
couple. What you see is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Observes Bob Somerby, Al Gore's Harvard roommate and longtime
friend: ``I'm amazed at how normal they are. The life they lead _
the motorcades, everyone wants a piece of them, their status _
could swell their heads. But they're like they were 30 years ago.
Normal.''

</P>
<P>
   To be sure, an image of abiding love could be the contrivance of
political pros. But then, some things cannot be feigned, especially
for 33 years. Watch them speak to each other, touch, look. Everyone
knows at least one couple like this, the pair who really do like
each other.
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about life in the Gore home.
</P>
<P>
   Dinners?
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh a lot at the table,'' says Tipper. ``You have to be
able to laugh. When the children were younger, we'd talk about
music, art, politics, but not a great deal of politics. You want to
engage the children. It's a time when a family can be a family
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Music?
</P>
<P>
   ``We like a wide range,'' she says, but she flinches ever so
slightly, just a little tightening in the jaw. Her gaze asks _
demands _ are you coming at me with this '80s censorship thing?
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Tipper Gore was excoriated by Hollywood when she
lobbied for content labels on records and tapes. Frank Zappa called
her ``the wife of Big Brother'' at the time, prompting then-Senator
Gore to declare that as a younger man, he had been a big Zappa fan.
No matter how often Tipper said she did not want to censor any
musician, she was accused of trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should be able to buy a record and have a reasonable
idea of what's on it. That's all it was about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's back to her musical tastes. ``I like Herbie Hancock,
k.d. lang, Alison Krauss. She has such a sweet, beautiful voice ...
''
</P>
<P>
   ``And plays a stunning fiddle,'' says Gore. ``There's Garth
Brooks and Ricky Skaggs. Lucinda Williams ... ''
</P>
<P>
   They trade names for a few minutes more. Dvorak, Thelonious Monk
...
</P>
<P>
   The vice president strums an air guitar when he mentions Doc
Watson, the blind North Carolina bluegrass musician. ``We used to
see Doc when he played up north in the '60s,'' says Gore. ``When I
was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his memory wanders back to that spring night in 1966 when
he spied a young girl at a Washington party. He was 17, a senior
academic and athletic standout at St. Albans(cq), a Washington prep
school for the sons of the rich and influential. She was 16, a
junior at St. Agnes Episcopal School in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be able to close my eyes and relive that
moment,'' says Gore, doing just that. ``I can see her across the
room. Blond hair, very pretty smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl was Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson. An only child, her
parents, Margaret and Jack Aitcheson, divorced in 1952. She was
Tipper to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (ital) him (end ital) across the room,'' she says. ``I
met him and liked him. Smart. Funny. He called the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are three daughters _ Karenna, 25; Kristin, 21;
Sarah, 20 _ and a son, Albert Gore III, 16. The two younger
daughters are at Harvard. Karenna is married and attends Columbia
Law School. The Gores mortgaged their 88-acre Tennessee farm to the
rafters to send the young women to Harvard and pay for young
Albert's education at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington.
Financial disclosure forms filed in 1998 by Gore show a net worth
of just under $1 million, much of it derived from royalties on his
1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and Tipper's book of
photography, ``Picture This.'' He makes $171,500 a year as vice
president. There are no blind trusts, no large stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   They will become grandparents in June when Karenna gives birth
to her first child. Gore, who at 51 is five months older than his
wife, was asking everyone on Air Force Two who looked over 40 if
they were grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with the years going by, with age. Since about
age 45, I've been OK with my aging,'' he says. ``Becoming a
grandparent is one more wonderful event in a 33-year relationship
with a wonderful woman.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk about sharing those years, talk about family and
faith, his parents, their children. The future. His future.
</P>
<P>
   Why does he want to be president? Why put his wife and his
children and their children on the covers of supermarket tabloids?
Why expose the smallest details of his entire life to often
frenzied and not always accurate scrutiny?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I want to do the job _ you have to (ital) want (end
ital) it _ because I can (ital) do (end ital) the job, because I
love my country and am grateful for the chance to (ital) lead (end
ital) this country. I know what that may mean for my family. I
thank God for Tipper's love. The love we share will see us through.
We're ready. I'm ready. I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited?
</P>
<P>
   Can this possibly be the same guy who's portrayed as somber,
humorless, wooden, a policy wonk? You know, ``Al Gore's timber all
right, but is it presidential timber?''

<P>
   ``He is not charismatic,'' said CBS newsman Mike Wallace before
addressing members of a private art museum in Palm Beach. ``But
maybe the country has had enough of charisma for the moment. Al
Gore is substantial, a fine and honorable man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more prepared than any vice president I have known for
the duties of president,'' said Gergen. ``He reads all the cable
traffic _ State, CIA. But he does not get lost in details, as
(Jimmy) Carter did. He can delegate. At meetings with the
president, he is a participant, and the president makes clear his
respect for Gore. Al Gore is smart. Persistent. Very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a peculiar thing,'' says Martin Peretz, publisher of The
New Republic, Harvard professor and Gore friend. ``The Al Gore I
have known for more than 30 years is funny, engaging, not the
sometimes somber man you see on TV. He is sincere. He is not facile
_ that's the word I'd use _ like Bill Clinton. He was a good
student. He is intellectually honest. And you know, compared to
Bill Bradley, Al's a showman.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll get another point of view by reading ``Gore: A Political
Life,'' a new _ and not flattering _ biography of Gore by former
ABC newsman Bob Zelnick: ``There is, in short, not a man behind the
robot, but quite possibly a robot behind the man.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by Regnery, a conservative house, quotes an
unnamed ``White House insider'' as saying of Gore: ``He wants to
script every move he makes ... to say what his handlers tell him to
say and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sit down and talk with Albert Gore Jr. and quickly you realize
he is decidedly not stiff. He wears an easy smile. He listens. He
looks you in the eye. He speaks with precision but drives home
points with humor, analogy, metaphor. His voice is rich yet soft.
It carries a mild Southern inflection. He gestures with his hands
in a measured sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Air Force Two, he displayed with glee a bumper sticker:
``Nixon in 2000 _ He's still not as stiff as Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks with enthusiasm about his reading interests: British
geneticist Richard Dawkins, cosmologist Stephen Hawking, physicist
Richard Feynman, historian William Manchester, books on
thermodynamics, computers, emerging markets, Darwin, chaos theory,
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read at the expense of my sleep time,'' says Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man engaged by the world and the people in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world, the universe and our place in the universe, it is
all so humbling. Some of these modern thinkers are so smart _
Hawking, the smartest man in the world. And his illness forces him
to communicate by voice synthesizer. A century ago he would have
been an outcast.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks at length about the early years of the information
highway but does not take credit for inventing the Internet _ as he
was quoted in March as having done in a moment of hyperbole or
misstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Then he whips a subcompact notebook computer from his pocket and
starts to explicate the technology, memory capacity, cost versus
power, possible future regulatory implications of the unit's
infrared data-sending capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody could intercept my message when I send it from my
unit to yours,'' he says. ``New technologies are just pouring out
of R&AMP;D laboratories. Data processing capacities are growing
exponentially. We are truly living in extraordinary times.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, holds aloft his state-of-the art notepad for effect.
``We have to decide where we want to take technology like this, not
where it wants to take us. Our new knowledge presents an incredible
opportunity and challenge for all of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this a guy who likes technology for technology's sake, or
will he translate his personal vision of the world into a political
vision? The campaign will tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for a national newspaper sitting near Gore on Air
Force Two listens as the vice president wanders the philosophical
landscape. ``Geez,'' he says after the vice president leaves, ``why
can't he talk like that on TV?''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the Al Gore of the podium, the Al Gore of
the nightly news clip. Often, when Gore speaks from behind a podium
he is stiff, as if the sleeves of his dark blue suits are lined
with flagpoles. Even when reading his own words, he often manifests
a bewildering ability to perform oratorical alchemy by turning
golden concepts into lead.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the vice president call this transition from engaging
private fellow to listless public orator the ``disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is aware of the perception. He jokes about it. ``I like the
low expectations. It's funny,'' he says, ``but my father was known
as the fiddle-playing, outgoing Tennessee senator. Yet he was a
formal man. He taught me how to properly show respect, for my
elders, for the president. So I'm thought of as formal, but I don't
see myself that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers would like him to maximize his public
appearances in places where he can be informal, venues where he can
moderate a round-table discussion or lead a ``town meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast trip he used just-plain-English to tell
Seattle residents their two-hour commutes to and from work were
wrong. He told them the federal government could not and would not
become a zoning board, but would loosen the purse strings to help
cities unclog highways so workers can get home in time to have
dinner with their families. Gore calls it his ``livability
agenda.'' Gore was at ease, used no techno-jargon. He connected.
</P>
<P>
   He told Seattle high-tech executives the explosion in technology
had to reach the meekest among mankind in order to truly serve
mankind. He told them government policy lagged private sector
development. The high-tech crowd found him more prepared than
``prepped'' for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows as much as we do,'' said one. ``He (ital) knows (end
ital) his stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided podiums and scripted speeches. He was loose.
There were no handlers on hand.
</P>
<P>
   On the return trip, Gore spoke of where he may go in his
campaign. ``I believe any candidate for president must show the
American people three things. First, you must have a clear vision
of our shared future, a compelling vision. You must be able to
communicate that vision and identify within it certain goals,
destinations we want to reach as a people, and identify ways of
reaching those goals. Finally, there must be an awareness of our
shared values upon which decisions can be based while the
administration and the country work toward reaching that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``I believe I can do that. I want to do that. I'm
excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when his days in Washington are done _ maybe after next
year, maybe in January 2005, perhaps in 2009 _ where will he go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Home. To Tennessee. To my farm. I'd like to write. Fiction,
non-fiction. That's what I'll do. That's where I'll go. To
Carthage. Home.''
</P>
<P>
   But in politics, home isn't a value-free word.

<P>
   ``When I was a boy, my father sent me out to work the fields to
learn about work, to learn about life,'' Al Gore says aboard Air
Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me how to clear land with a double-bladed ax. He
taught me how to plow a steep hillside with a team of mules,'' Gore
was quoted in The Des Moines Register, March 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Again, you can find contrary views. ``Lyrical,'' ``tall tales,''
``gauzy,'' ``Norman Rockwell-style account'' are descriptions used
by some of the Washington media to describe Gore's memories of
Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   ``How preposterous. ... Real farmers, even poor ones, have been
hiring bulldozers to clear land since before Al Gore was born,''
wrote William Kristol's conservative Weekly Standard on March 29,
1999. ``No responsible farmer since the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s
has plowed a steep hillside.''
</P>
<P>
   ___

<P>
   (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   To get to Carthage, county seat of Smith County, drive about 50
miles east from Nashville on I-40. Upon arrival, certain truisms
can be learned from a cursory look at the countryside. It is hilly
hereabouts. Steep hilly. Farms look like they're about to slide
down the hillsides. Small farms. The farmers are not rich. They do
not plow land with rented bulldozers because renting a bulldozer is
expensive, and they tend to roll over and fall down the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage sits on high land above a bend in the wide and
fast-flowing Cumberland River. It's home to the Friday night
catfish fry at the City Diner just down the block from Main Street,
where the old Walton Hotel is closed for renovation. Here, you
still park your car nose in to the curb, but dry goods stores have
been replaced by kitschy boutiques, antique shops and law offices.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell Hull's house sits just up the road. Hull _ Tennessee
congressman and FDR's secretary of state _ was mentor to Gore's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Old tobacco barns, bleached gray, hug low hillsides and lean
crazily in shaded hollows. The Smith County population has grown by
several hundred in the last few years, to almost 15,000. At dusk,
the interstate discharges commuters from Nashville onto local
roads. At night, the valley is quiet. It all looks as it did 40 or
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was born here on March 31, 1948. His sister, Nancy, was
10. The Gores hadn't expected another child. There would be no more
after Al.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Albert Gore Sr., was the local school
superintendent, congressman and U.S. senator from 1953 to 1971.
While a senator in the mid-1950s, he was the prime mover for the
interstate highway system and an early supporter of Medicare.
Gore's mother, Pauline LaFon, was one of the first women to
graduate from Vanderbilt Law School, though she chose marriage and
a family over legal practice.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his Senate seat in 1970, the senior Gore became
chairman of Island Creek Coal Co., a board member of Occidental
Petroleum and raised beef cattle, chickens and tobacco on his
200-acre hillside farm.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying the farm, located about five miles out of
Carthage, the senator and his wife _ in Carthage he is still called
The Senator, she is called Miss Pauline _ kept house in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to sit on the porch summer evenings,'' says Janet
Jenkins, 64, a lifelong Carthage resident. ``We didn't often see
Nancy or Pauline on Main Street, but The Senator put on his
britches like the rest of us. The Senator was raised on a small
farm at Possum Hollow, and not raised rich. I heard the very first
speech he ever gave. On the courthouse steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr. died last December at age 90. Mrs. Gore has
suffered two strokes and a heart attack since 1993, but, at 86, she
is still known for her political acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Carthage residents say the senior Gore was many things _ as good
a farmer as he was a politician _ but remained at heart a man who
loved the land of Middle Tennessee. By the late 1960s, he seemed to
be ahead of his time in casting Senate votes against the Vietnam
War, against school prayer amendments, against banning forced
school busing. His constituents thought the senator no longer
reflected Tennessee values. He was defeated by Bill Brock, then a
30-year-old candy fortune heir, in a Senate race still talked about
as downright mean.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore Sr. vowed never again to run for office, and did
not. He said he was going home to his farm, and did. He grew some
tobacco. Later, by the mid-'70s, his son was growing tobacco on his
farm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, are nestled on a couch in the
forward, private cabin of Air Force Two, eastbound 36,000 feet over
Kansas. The cabin is bare of decoration, except for a wall map of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice about them is the affection. He
drapes an arm over her shoulder. They touch fingers, smile. It's
spontaneous, warm.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, an image of abiding love could be the contrivance of
political pros. But then, some things cannot be feigned, especially
for 33 years. Watch them speak to each other, touch, look. Everyone
knows at least one couple like this, the pair who really do like
each other.
</P>
<P>
   They don't see much of each other these days. He's off to
California, Palm Beach, New York raising money, lots of money.
He'll be testing his campaign message soon from Ohio to North
Carolina, Colorado to Texas. Tipper, too, is on the road, speaking
about children's health care. Once in a while, they hook up, as
they did in San Francisco on a day in early March.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about family and faith, his parents, their children.
The future. His future.
</P>
<P>
   Now is Al Gore's time to tell us who he is. The vice president
says he has a compelling vision of where we want to go as a nation,
how we can get there and how we can live better lives when we
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it's the Republicans' time to offer their version.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle kicked off his presidential
campaign by making clear he is running not only against Gore, but
against ``Clinton-Gore'' on family values and character.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP will target Gore's fund-raising practices, his
environmental views and federal insinuation into local school
issues. There are plenty of photos for attack ads: Gore with an
impeached Clinton, Gore at the Buddhist temple, Gore in China.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 18 months, Gore will tell us why he wants to be
president: ``Because I want to do the job _ you have to want it _
because I can do the job, because I love my country and am grateful
for the chance to lead this country ... I thank God for Tipper's
love. The love we share will see us through. We're ready. I'm
ready. I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited?
</P>
<P>
   Can this possibly be the same guy who's portrayed as somber,
wooden, a policy wonk? You know, ``Al Gore's timber all right, but
is it presidential timber?''
</P>
<P>
   Sit down and talk with Albert Gore Jr. and quickly you realize
he is decidedly not stiff. He wears an easy smile. He listens. He
looks you in the eye. He speaks with precision, but drives home
points with humor, analogy, metaphor. His voice is rich yet soft.
It carries a mild Southern inflection. He gestures with his hands
in a measured sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   He displays with glee a bumper sticker: ``Nixon in 2000 _ He's
still not as stiff as Gore.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   They're talking about life in the Gore home.
</P>
<P>
   Dinners?
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh a lot at the table,'' says Tipper. ``You have to be
able to laugh. When the children were younger, we'd talk about
music, art, politics, but not a great deal of politics. You want to
engage the children. It's a time when a family can be a family
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Music?
</P>
<P>
   ``We like a wide range,'' she says, but she flinches ever so
slightly, just a little tightening in the jaw. Her gaze asks _
demands _ are you coming at me with this '80s censorship thing?
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Tipper Gore was excoriated by Hollywood when she
lobbied for content labels on records and tapes. Frank Zappa called
her ``the wife of Big Brother'' at the time, prompting then-Senator
Gore to declare that as a younger man, he had been a big Zappa fan.
No matter how often Tipper said she did not want to censor any
musician, she was accused of trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should be able to buy a record and have a reasonable
idea of what's on it. That's all it was about,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it's back to her musical tastes. ``I like Herbie Hancock,
k.d. lang, Alison Krauss. She has such a sweet, beautiful voice ...
''
</P>
<P>
   ``And plays a stunning fiddle,'' says Gore. ``There's Garth
Brooks and Ricky Skaggs. Lucinda Williams ... ''
</P>
<P>
   They trade names for a few minutes more. Dvorak, Thelonious Monk
...
</P>
<P>
   The vice president strums an air guitar when he mentions Doc
Watson, the blind North Carolina bluegrass musician. ``We used to
see Doc when he played up north in the '60s,'' says Gore. ``When I
was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his memory wanders back to that spring night in 1966 when
he spied a young girl at a Washington party. He was 17, a senior
academic and athletic standout at St. Albans(cq), a Washington prep
school for the sons of the rich and influential. She was 16, a
junior at St. Agnes Episcopal School in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always be able to close my eyes and relive that
moment,'' says Gore, doing just that. ``I can see her across the
room. Blond hair, very pretty smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl was Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson. An only child, her
parents, Margaret and Jack Aitcheson, divorced in 1952. She was
Tipper to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him across the room,'' she says. ``I met him and liked
him. Smart. Funny. He called the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are three daughters _ Karenna, 25; Kristin, 21;
Sarah, 20 _ and a son, Albert Gore III, 16. The two younger
daughters are at Harvard. Karenna is married and attends Columbia
Law School. The Gores mortgaged their 88-acre Tennessee farm to the
rafters to send the young women to Harvard and pay for young
Albert's education at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington.
Financial disclosure forms filed in 1998 by Gore show a net worth
of just under $1 million, much of it derived from royalties on his
1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and Tipper's book of
photography, ``Picture This.'' He makes $171,500 a year as vice
president. There are no blind trusts, no large stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   They will become grandparents in June when Karenna gives birth
to her first child. ``I'm comfortable with the years going by, with
age. Since about age 45, I've been OK with my aging,'' says Gore,
who at 51 is five months older than his wife.
</P>
<P>
   And when his days in Washington are done _ maybe after next
year, maybe in January 2005, perhaps in 2009 _ where will he go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Home. To Tennessee. To my farm. I'd like to write. Fiction,

Carthage. Home.''

   Al Gore was born here on March 31, 1948. His sister, Nancy, was

   His father, Albert Gore Sr., was the local school

to 30-year-old candy heir Bill Brock, the senior Gore became
chairman of Island Creek Coal Co., a board member of Occidental

200-acre hillside farm.
</P>
<P>
   He died last December at age 90. Mrs. Gore has suffered two
strokes and a heart attack since 1993, but, at 86, she is still
known for her political acumen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Tennesseeans apparently thought the senator was out of
step for opposing the Vietnam War, a school prayer amendment, a ban
on school busing. He vowed never again to run for office, and did
not. He said he was going home to his farm, and did. He grew some
tobacco. Later, by the mid-'70s, his son was growing tobacco on his
farm.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore Jr. has been whacked for not stopping his tobacco
cultivation soon enough after his sister's death from lung cancer
in 1984. At the 1996 Democratic convention, he delivered a
wrenching speech about Nancy and her death. But the speech stirred
criticism that Gore would exploit anyone or any circumstance for
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see every connection between events overnight,''
Gore explained as he talked softly aboard Air Force Two. ``On my
farm, we stopped growing tobacco some time after Nancy died. We no
longer have an allotment. But my father had grown tobacco for 50
years. This was his life. Then _ it was a few years later _ one of
his grandchildren asked, `Grandpa, do we still grow tobacco?' He
thought for a minute. `Not any more,' he said. And that was the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's farm sits on a hillside across the Caney
Fork River from his dad's farm, where Pauline Gore still lives. He
bought the farm and 2,100-square-foot house from his father in 1973
for $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   The house is long, low, faced in reddish-brown brick. A white
rail fence surrounds the property. A gate at the end of the long
drive is closed and locked. Similar-sized farms in Smith County are
listed by real estate agents for between $200,000 and $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, home isn't a value-free word, and even Gore's roots
are being questioned: Is he from Washington or Tennessee?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is a city kid, father a senator. He grew up in
Washington,'' reported Bruce Morton on CNN's Inside Politics on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
   Former ABC newsman Bob Zelnick, in his unflattering biography,
Gore: A Political Life, articulates the conclusion: ``He has had no
life to speak of outside of government save for a few years on a
Nashville newspaper _ where he covered government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think because Al spent school years in Washington
with his family, he's not authentic,'' says Jerry Futrell,
president of Smith County Hospital and a Gore family friend for 35
years. ``Al transcended Carthage. That doesn't mean he isn't
Carthage. Of course, he lived in Washington part of the year. His
father worked there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al won his congressional seat in 1976, he promised to
hold town meetings. He did, every weekend, in garages, stores,
diners. Hundreds of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he won re-election to the Senate in 1990, he carried all
95 counties in Tennessee. Either Tennesseans can't tell when a
candidate is local, or you reporters need to have your eyes
checked.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of his Tennessee roots, it would be only fair to
let Gore have the last word: ``When I went home on holidays from
Harvard, I went to Carthage. When I came back from Vietnam, I could
have gone to Washington, to Cambridge, California, anywhere. But I
didn't. I went home. To Carthage.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Gore joined the Army in 1970. In May of that year, he and Tipper
married. In December, Spec. 5 Gore went to Vietnam, where he served
seven months as a newsletter writer in an engineering battalion. He
didn't see combat and didn't serve the usual 12 months in Vietnam
because his enlistment was up by early autumn 1971. While overseas,
he sent a story about a Viet Cong ambush to the Tennessean,
Nashville's morning daily, where editor John Seigenthaler liked
what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Gore smoked a little marijuana. He drank a little beer _ not a
lot, say friends. During his Army stint, he and Tipper lived in a
trailer outside an Alabama Army base. They drove an old VW bus into
the Rockies, where they camped and hiked.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore's enlistment was up, he and Tipper returned to
Nashville, where he began working for the Tennessean and Tipper
studied photography.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he thought he'd make journalism a career. He had tried
law school at Vanderbilt in the early '70s but says he didn't like
the way he saw justice dispensed. He had tried divinity school at
Vanderbilt for a semester but didn't hear a loud enough call.
</P>
<P>
   Politics _ not preaching, not law, not journalism _ finally
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved journalism. But then, February 1976, John Seigenthaler
called me at home,'' says Gore. ``He said, `Al, I thought you'd
like to know Joe Evins isn't running for re-election.' I listened.
I think I said thanks. If you had asked me two days before would I
run, I'd have said no. I hung up the phone and turned to Tipper.
`Joe Evins isn't running,' I said. Then, right then, I knew. `I'm
gonna run for Congress,' I told Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   He beat eight Democrats in the primary, won the general election
and served four terms. In 1984, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
By then, Gore had gained a reputation among colleagues as a whiz on
arms control. He garnered national publicity when he pushed
legislation through the House that required higher standards in the
manufacturing of infant formula. He took submarine trips to the
North Pole to further publicize his views on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody _ friend and foe _ has an opinion about Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Terms used by some former House and Senate colleagues and
journalists to describe Gore: ``Not a team player,'' ``a Rosie Ruiz
type,'' ``self-promoter,'' ``loner,'' ``Prince Albert,''
``preppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional associates, journalists and friends suggest:
``Prepared,'' ``disciplined,'' ``regular guy,'' ``honest.''
</P>
<P>
   But only Gore can show who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Clues to Gore's vision can be found in his book, ``Earth in the
Balance,'' a 385-page warning on global warming, pollution, how we
made the mess and how we can fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in the preface, says he wrote the book for many reasons,
including the emotional change he underwent while his son, Albert
Gore III, spent months in the hospital after being hit by a car as
the family left a Baltimore Orioles game in April 1989. Gore _ who
saw his son's body fly through the air and fall to the pavement _
knelt and performed CPR, and for months, alternating with Tipper,
spent nights by young Albert's side. Albert is now healthy, but his
father was reminded of the vicissitudes of life, life beyond
politics.
</P>
<P>
   It is said by some that Gore was bred for the presidency: He is
his father's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envied Al's love for his parents,'' says Bob Somerby, who,
like actor Tommy Lee Jones, roomed with Gore at Harvard. ``How many
kids moved back next door to their parents after college? He made
decisions because his father brought him up to honor certain
values, do things right, for right's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says his dad was his mentor, a voice he heard and listened
to, the man who inculcated in him a sense of decorum, respect for
learning, for justice and for God.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Gore went home to bury his father. In his eulogy,
he said: ``The night he lost in 1970, he made me prouder still. He
said defeat may serve as well as victory to shake the soul and let
the glory out. Then he turned the old Southern segregationist
slogan on its head and declared, `The truth shall rise again.' ``
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore can articulate who he is the same way he captured his
father's essence, style may just give way to substance.
</P>
<P>
   Upriver from Carthage, where the Cumberland River twists through
steep-sided valleys, Cordell Hull Lake rides high behind Cordell
Hull Dam, a concrete wonder built by the Army Corps of Engineers 60
years ago to tame the Cumberland.
</P>
<P>
   The lake holds a lesson for anyone trying to flesh out Al Gore.
It was conceived by powerful politicians more than a half century
ago, built in Tennessee with the latest technology and managed by
Washington professionals. Surface appearances do not divulge true
dimensions, and closer scrutiny is difficult because access is
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a Washington dam or a Tennessee lake? Who cares? A more
important question is, how deep is it?
</P>
<P>
   America is about to find out.
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Isabelle Huppert is stumped. She just can't figure out why she's
occasionally referred to in the press as ``the little French
mouse.'' But if she'd seen herself sitting in the front row of
January's Yves Saint Laurent couture show, just one seat down from
Catherine Deneuve, she might have some idea.
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve looked like a true Movie Star, with a sweep of
salon-perfect blonde hair riding high above her head, a perfectly
fitted couture suit and a pair of Jackie O-style sunglasses
protecting her from the barrage of flashbulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Huppert, meanwhile, was slouching in a chair, nervously touching
her stringy red hair and shuffling her sneakers as she waited for
the lights to go down, for the photographers' gaze to finally shift
from her to the catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   While the timeless Deneuve may be the First Lady of French
cinema, Huppert is not far behind, just a rung above contemporaries
like Isabelle Adjani and Sophie Marceau. Yet she's much more of an
enigma than France's other leading ladies _ even to her own
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike Garbo, to whom she has occasionally been compared,
Huppert prefers to be alone, sidestepping the spotlight and
avoiding the press as much as she can. Almost nothing is known
about her private life, other than the fact that she's married and
has three children. She's been heard to say that being photographed
without permission is like being raped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered that people compare me to Garbo,'' says Huppert.
``I don't think anyone can reach the point of mysteriousness she
has, but I'm learning.''
</P>
<P>
   She's doing a fine job. Few people have managed to maintain such
a high degree of both exposure and anonymity. In a little over 25
years, Huppert has made more than 50 films, working repeatedly with
such directors as Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol. Her
best-known movies include Diane Kurys' ``Entre Nous,'' and
Chabrol's ``Madame Bovary'' and ``La Ceremonie.'' Her latest film,
``The School of Flesh'' (``L'Ecole de la Chair''), which recently
opened in the United States, was publicized on nearly every bus
stop in Paris with a large poster of Huppert's face.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she enters a Left Bank cafe for an interview,
crossing a crowded room to her table in a dark corner, not one head
turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people _ more in America than here _ go after the
attention,'' she says. ``They pretend to hate it, but when they
don't get it, it kills them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over tea, Huppert projects the aloofness and mild arrogance that
we often expect from serious French actresses. She's curious about
her reputation in the United States, but despite having appeared in
several American films _ most notably in Michael Cimino's critical
disaster ``Heaven's Gate'' _ she's wary of being lumped together
with her American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always surprised by how many American actresses,
particularly on the West Coast, aren't really actresses,'' she
says. ``It's not true for all of them, of course, but I feel like
French actresses are given more opportunities to be introspective.
We work more with intimacy and personal reflection. But cinema
shouldn't be the same all over the world, I guess. American cinema
should have its own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Huppert is not one of those one of those Europeans who's eager
to amass American screen credits. When she does chase after a role
in the United States, it's likely to be in a small independent film
that's as complex as the those she makes in France.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, she wrote an admiring letter to director Hal Hartley
and ended up with the lead in ``Amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   When the letter first arrived, though, Hartley's assistant
didn't know who Huppert was. And while some critics suggest that
Huppert isn't as well-known in the United States as her less
talented French colleagues because ``Heaven's Gate'' was such a
colossal flop, she is quick to refute that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that it neither helped nor hurt me,'' she says.
``Look, maybe it did change my destiny, I don't know. Yes, it was a
pure failure, but it's not an issue for me. I came over to do one
film, not to stay for my entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The School of Flesh,'' Huppert plays Dominique, a chic,
successful fashion executive. When she meets a handsome young
ne'er-do-well who works as both a bartender and a bisexual hustler,
she begins pursuing him intently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about how passion affects this woman,'' says Huppert, who
turned 44 in March.
</P>
<P>
   Huppert spent weeks discussing the character with director
Benoit Jacquot before shooting began. Jacquot, who directed the
actress in 1980s ``Wings of a Dove,'' says he didn't even have a
second choice for the role of Dominique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what she wants to express,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, says Jacquot, takes an intensely thoughtful
approach to both her life and her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She uses her face as a landscape,'' he says. ``She can change
it like it's some kind of psychological climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot, an old friend of Huppert's, also understands the
actress's intense need for privacy _ even on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filming for her is like a night of paradise,'' he says. ``It's
like she's sleeping and she hopes she'll dream right. She's acting
as she's dreaming. Sometimes when I yell `cut,' it's like I'm
waking her up. This is because acting is extremely private for her.
Isabelle has two private lives: the one in front of the camera and
the one in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The School of Flesh,'' Dominique wields all of the social
and financial power. She plays sugarmama to her young boyfriend,
giving him an allowance and choosing his wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reversal of the classic roles,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But Huppert believes the film is a reflection of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older women with younger men are much more accepted now,'' she
says. ``Plus, I think women are looking younger and younger now.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress isn't the least bit concerned that the older she
gets, the fewer roles there will be for her. ``I'm not fighting
aging at all,'' she says. ``Look at Catherine Deneuve. She's always
more and more beautiful. She makes you feel like you want to get
older.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her own public persona, Huppert manages to look on the
bright side. After giving the matter some thought, she flashes her
first smile of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably better to be called a French mouse,'' she says,
``than to be called a French snake, or a French cow.'' &QL;

aging at all,'' she says. ``Look at Catherine Deneuve. She's always
more and more beautiful. She makes you feel like you want to get
older.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her own public persona, Huppert manages to look on the
bright side. After giving the matter some thought, she flashes her
first smile of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably better to be called a French mouse,'' she says,
``than to be called a French snake, or a French cow.'' &QL;

HARD-EDGED AND CUTTING EDGE ARE NERVOUS NO MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 2)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Everyone in this room,'' wrote Mark Leyner in The New York
Times, quoting a composite TV network executive, ``is committed to
developing adventurous,  &UR; edgy &LR;  material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Risque Reading'' was the headline in The Wall Street Journal,
subheaded ``Books for young adults take on  &UR; edgier &LR;  themes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a move toward more  &UR; edgy &LR;  comedy,'' Will Miller, the
therapist-comedian, sadly told New Jersey's Record about a shift in
audience tastes, ``and I was just this yuppie with no  &UR; edge &LR;  at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   A new sense of an old word was born about a decade ago, went
through its nonce phase, has gained vogue status and bids fair to
shove the old sense over the edge of the linguistic cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '80s, when someone said, ``I feel  &UR; edgy &LR; ,'' the
response was a soothing, ``There, there _ nothing to be nervous
about.'' Or if you heard, ``The boss seems a little  &UR; edgy &LR;  today,''
you were not likely to hit him up for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   The adjective meant ``nervous, irritable, apprehensive'' _ three
different but similar states of tension _ derived from the phrase
 &UR; on edge &LR; . The metaphor was that of a cliff, with a person standing
at the very brink, or grimacing in irritation, showing teeth  &UR; on
edge &LR; , or balanced precariously in a narrow space, as on a  &UR; razor's
edge &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   That nail-nibbling sense began as the adverb  &UR; edgily &LR; , in an
1837 letter by Cardinal Henry Manning: ``Newman did not like my
joking letter. He answered rather  &UR; edgily &LR;  and defensively.''
Novelists moved it ahead as World War I began: ``Do you mind if I
come in here for a little?'' Rudyard Kipling had a character plead.
``I'm a bit  &UR; edgy &LR; .'' In 1915, in ``The 39 Steps,'' John Buchan
wrote: ``Then I could see that he began to get  &UR; edgy &LR;  again. He
listened for little noises.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally,  &UR; edgy &LR;  meant ``sharp,'' as in this 1775 use:
``Walking over broken rocks, either ragged, or cleft, or  &UR; edgy &LR; .''
The poet Leigh Hunt wrote in 1820 of a razor, ``How cold, how
 &UR; edgy &LR; , how hard!'' This is the sense that is making a comeback on
the cusp of three vogue phrases.
</P>
<P>
   One is  &UR; hard-edged &LR; , first used ringingly by the novelist J.R R.
Tolkien in 1954: ``Long slopes they climbed, dark,  &UR; hard-edged &LR; 
against the sky.'' In Britain in the early '60s it was used as the
name of a school of abstract art _ crisp, geometric and
unemotional.
</P>
<P>
   Its severe certainty was picked up in 1976 by the New York Times
correspondent John Darnton, who extended the metaphor with ``there
is no  &UR; hard-edged &LR;  sense of impending disaster in Rhodesia.'' That
meaning goes somewhat beyond ``sharp.'' Darnton, who is now The
Times' culture editor, recalled, ``I used it to mean `clear-cut'
but with a sense of violence behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation later, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, searching
vainly for consensus during the Year of Monica, shook his head and
said, ``The partisan differences have become  &UR; hard-edged &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   A more likely source of the current sense of  &UR; edgy &LR;  is  &UR; leading
edge &LR; , which the OED notes since 1877 has meant the forward side of
a moving object, like the blade of a propeller screw or a wing, and
the more recent  &UR; cutting edge &LR; . This has replaced the old  &UR; state of
the art &LR; . Funny how that popular phrase fell into desuetude; it was
once right out there  &UR; on the cusp &LR; , which has also been overtaken
by events.
</P>
<P>
   Not even  &UR; modern &LR;  stays modern, as  &UR; postmodern &LR;  becomes passe.
It's hard to keep up with, much less stay ahead of, words that
define a state of being ahead. You think that  &UR; leading edge &LR;  is all
that  &UR; with-it &LR; ? Jesse Sheidlower of Random House pointed me to this
use of computer jargon in a 1996 Wired magazine article:
``experience that combines  &UR; bleeding-edge &LR;  graphics with old-school
gameplay.'' See what happens when you play around with  &UR; cutting
edges &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   Here we are, then, with the old-new  &UR; edgy &LR; . Its first use is
derived from  &UR; hard-edged &LR; , connoting ``with an attitude.'' Jim Lowe
of Merriam-Webster has a citation from the May 1990 Elle magazine
in which Mark Schapiro writes of the white rappers Peter Nash and
Michael Berrin as ``brazen,  &UR; edgy &LR;  street poets.''
</P>
<P>
   For the sense of the new  &UR; edgy &LR;  that is more upbeat _
``innovative, precedent-shattering'' or ``avant-garde,'' as the
French have been saying for about 150 years (you'd think they'd
find a new expression for this) _ the earliest citation I can find
is this November 1993 use in The Orlando Sentinel in which Andy
Meisler, a reporter, quotes the animator John Kricfalusi about
fuddy-duddies at Nickelodeon: ``The network hated all the  &UR; edgy &LR; 
stuff. That's why it's not on the  &UR; cutting edge &LR;  anymore. Which is
too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as you read this, that sense is endangered in these
high-velocity semantics. The finger-snapping reader will note a
recent citation at the top of this column from The Wall Street
Journal suggesting a meaning of  &UR; risque &LR; , French for ``off-color,
verging on indecent.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mushnik, a columnist for The New York Post and TV Guide,
says: `` &UR; Edgy &LR;  is a euphemism for `profane.' It's a dodge for
`obscene.' We've seen the steady inclusion of words with sexual
connotations or profanity on television and radio. Now this
language is no longer described as `colorful' but as `edgy.' It's a
word in the pop culture that means `vile.' It's a very convenient
little word,  &UR; edgy &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this hottest of vogue words is that it means
(a) confrontational, (b) ultramodern and (c) lewd or profane.
Because the meaning is in flux, I don't use the word; it makes me
feel, as nervous Nellies used to say,  &UR; edgy &LR; .

A RITE OF SPRING RETURNS WITH THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Each year since way back when Strom Thurmond was
barely a decade or two past retirement age, Mr. Tammeus _ for
reasons now thankfully lost in the mists of history _ has written a
model graduation speech for real speakers to crib. Here is this
year's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patriots and traitors, volunteers and draftees: We gather today
under the storm clouds of war but with hope for peace still in our
spleens (or, anyway, one of those internal organs). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we think about those two great imposters, war and peace, I am
reminded of what the mortal Winston Churchill said in a speech in
1949, three years after his Iron Curtain speech (you could look it
up). For those of you under 25, Churchill once was prime minister
of England. And England is a country in Europe sometimes known as
Britain and sometimes as the United Kingdom, even though it's now a
Queendom and not very united. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did we guess,'' Churchill said, ``that what has been
called the Century of the Common Man would witness as its
astounding feature more common men killing each other with greater
facilities than any other five centuries together in the history of
the world.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, your work is cut out for you if your generation
plans to top that. But you can do it. War, it turns out, is a many
unsplendored thing. Peace, by contrast, sometimes is a wolf in
wolf's clothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For proof, look at what one of Churchill's predecessors, Neville
Chamberlain, said in 1938 after returning from negotiating with the
Nazis in Munich: ``We have preserved peace in our time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some peace. At best it was what Cicero called ``Peace with
dishonor,'' and lasted barely an hour. (No, not Cicero, Ill., but
Cicero the great Roman statesman, orator and writer. Lordy, lordy,
didn't you learn anything here?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The semi-famous Irish playwright George Farquhar may have gotten
it right in Act 5 of ``Love and a Bottle'' when he wrote: ``'Tis
safest making peace with sword in hand.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farquhar, whose name is hard to say once in a row quickly, much
less three or eight times, chose the word sword because he lived
mostly in the 17th century, prior to either the Uzi submachine gun
or the Apache helicopter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   War, as we all have heard, is hell. Actually, Gen. William
Tecumseh Sherman, to whom that line is attributed, said war ``is
all hell.'' But editors often are skittish about overusing the word
``all'' in a family newspaper, so the phrase generally is reported
without the all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this time of loosened standards of profanity, it remains to
be seen whether editors printing reports of this stunning speech
will allow the fullness of this next illuminating quote about war
from Gen. George S. Patton to see the light of day: ``The object of
war is not to die for your country. It's to make the other poor
bastard die for his.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the brighter students among you may wish to investigate
how the papers handle that quote. Maybe you could parlay that
research into a graduate degree. Many degrees, after all, have been
awarded on much flimsier research. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, then, what have we learned today about war and peace that
will help you advance in your profession, fatten your 401(k)
accounts and retire early? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the 15th century Christian ascetic Thomas Hemerken, known
as Thomas A(CQ) Kempis, said it best: ``We should have much peace
if we would not busy ourselves with sayings and doings of others.''
Of course, the down side is we would have fewer graduation
speeches. Now THERE'S finally something you can applaud. Thanks.
Now get on over to law school. Selah. &QL;

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tax time was crunch time for the World Wide Web
site of Intuit Inc., the supplier of personal finance software.
Traffic shot up to as much as 20 times its levels the rest of year,
as customers downloaded the latest revisions to Intuit's Turbotax
tax preparation program.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike tax seasons past, this time Intuit had the help of
Sandpiper Networks Inc., a start-up company that has developed a
way to speed the delivery of information on the Web. ``Customers
got it faster than they would have with us,'' said Rick Parkinson,
director of the planning and delivery group at Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper and a rival start-up company, Akamai Technologies
Inc., are pioneering a way to distribute material over the Internet
that avoids much of the congestion that can turn the World Wide Web
into the World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sandpiper is expected to announce that America
Online, the largest provider of Internet access, has made a small
investment in the company and will incorporate Sandpiper's
technology into its network.
</P>
<P>
   The Inktomi Corp., a supplier of Internet software is expected
to invest in the start-up company along with two Sandpiper
customers _ the Times Mirror Corp. and NBC. Sandpiper is raising a
total of $21.5 million in this, its second round of raising venture
capital, with each of the corporate partners believed to be putting
in $2 million to $3 million and the rest coming from venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, meanwhile, recently scored a coup of its own, hiring as
its president and chief executive George H. Conrades, formerly
president of the GTE Corp.'s BBN unit and before that a top
executive at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   As more corporations turn to the Web for marketing and sales,
long waits on the Internet are becoming bad for business. While the
companies can improve service somewhat by buying more powerful
computers for their Web sites, they have less control over the
traffic jams that can develop between their sites and the users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since nobody controls the Internet, how do you insure quality
of service?'' said Scott Yara, vice president for marketing at
Sandpiper, which is based in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The answer proposed by both Sandpiper and Akamai is to
distribute the contents of a Web site to server computers dispersed
throughout the Internet, so that information does not always have
to wend its way through the network from one site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole name of the game here is to push content to the edge
of the Internet, very, very close to the end user,'' said David
Goodtree, vice president for marketing at Akamai, which is based in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One use of such a service would be to help with big Web events
that could bring the Internet to its knees. The Los Angeles Times,
owned by Times Mirror, used Sandpiper to help cope with the online
demand for the Starr Report last year and for the newspaper's
coverage of the Academy Awards in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandpiper and Akamai contend, and some analysts agree, that
distribution of Web content will eventually be a full-time
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar technique, known as caching, is already in
use. If, for example, an Internet service provider in Los Angeles
finds heavy demand among its customers for a Web page based in New
York, it will create a local copy of the page in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual producer of the Web page in New York has no
control over this cache, and thus no way of preventing the
information on it from becoming outdated. Moreover, the producer of
the Web page usually does not know how many visits or ``hits'' the
copy on the cache receives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sandpiper and Akamai sell their service directly to the Web
content providers, automatically distributing the content to
servers, updating the material as necessary and keeping track of
the number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper was founded three years ago by David Farber and Andrew
D. Swart, software experts who had worked for Interactive Systems,
a Unix company. Leo S. Spiegel, whom they recruited to be
president, started a computer company while still in college. That
company, LAN Systems, was sold to the Intel Corp. and R.R. Donnelly
&AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which says its name means ``intelligent, clever and
cool'' in Hawaiian, grew out of a math class at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berners-Lee, the MIT researcher known as the father of the
Web, suggested to Tom Leighton, a professor of applied mathematics,
that ``load balancing'' on the Internet would be a good problem for
his class to tackle. The classwork led to algorithms that are used
by Akamai, which was founded by Leighton and a graduate student,
Danny Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which is only now beginning commercial service, says
that customers for its trial service included five of the 10 most
popular Web sites. But Goodtree would not identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai seems to have a more sophisticated approach, but
Sandpiper has the advantage of being first, said Peter Christy,
principal at Collaborative Research, a market research firm in Los
Altos, Calif. Akamai also has deployed 400 servers, compared with
only 32 for Sandpiper. ``We could handle the load today of 15
Yahoos and the top 20 Web sites combined,'' Goodtree said.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal with America Online and Inktomi could help change
that. Inktomi already provides more than 300 cache servers to
America Online, and Sandpiper will now be able to use those, as
well as Inktomi servers in other networks. ``It really expands our
footprint,'' Spiegel said of Sandpiper (which calls its service
Footprint).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the companies, though, might not be
each other but new entrants expected in the market. Julian of
Forrester said these could include big computer service providers
like IBM and Electronic Data Systems as well as companies like
Exodus Communications that provide computer sites used to host Web
pages. Even Intel announced last week that it would enter the
business of providing servers to host Web pages. But some of these
companies might decide to ally themselves with Sandpiper or Akamai
rather than compete with them.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge could be persuading companies to entrust
distribution of Web pages to an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson of Intuit, for instance, said it made sense to use
Sandpiper to save Intuit from having to invest in enough capacity
to handle the rare peak demand. But at times of normal demand,
Intuit prefers to run its Web site by itself, to guard its
competitive information. ``You give up a little bit of control
every time you give something to someone else,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Lemont Southworth, technology manager for latimes.com, said
another problem was that Sandpiper's system cannot handle the
customized advertisements that many Web sites offer.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible threat is that if technologies like high-speed
cable modems and optical fiber can sufficiently reduce congestion,
there would be less need to store Web pages close to users.
</P>
<P>
   But both companies insist that cable modems, by increasing the
flow of information between users' computers and Internet sites,
will only increase the strain on Web site providers, much as
widening freeway on-ramps can worsen congestion on the freeway
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's the next evolution of the Internet,''
Spiegel said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: School shooting should remind us of our compassion
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The least of these ...''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase has hardly left my mind since learning of the tragic
shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The two young men who police believe caused their own deaths and
the deaths of 12 of their classmates and a teacher have been
described as outcasts and weirdos, kids at the bottom of their high
school's food chain, least among their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation was stunned by the brutal and calculated act
and many searched frantically for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this happen, we asked. Why in Colorado, Oregon,
Kentucky, Mississippi, Arkansas? Answers about the young men who
perpetrated the terror in each of these incidents may be found on a
case by case basis, but such violence in the nation's schools is no
longer an aberration. It is
</P>
<P>
   excruciatingly common and there exists no easy fix.
</P>
<P>
   Again, we shed tears and again we grieve. But after the grief,
what then?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, we live in a country that would rather move away from its
problems, than stand and fight them.
</P>
<P>
   We close our eyes to much of life's darker side because as long
as it's affecting ``those people'' we don't have to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   We have done it with drugs. When it was only an inner city
problem, we moved to the suburbs or to the country. We've done it
with teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   When it had not yet touched the middle class, we ignored it. We
did it with AIDS. When it was labeled a homosexual disease, we
refused to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that such things don't recognize geographical
location, race or income level. When we turn our backs on them, we
simply delay the day those problems arrive at our doorstep. More
importantly, when we turn our backs on them because they only
affect those we regard as the least among us, we are dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We hear young people talk about their schoolmates who isolate
themselves, the kids no one will talk to and who won't talk to
anyone. They are out of the mainstream, not in the cool crowd or
the popular group.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame our teens for not trying very hard to reach out to
those they see as misfits. We certainly have not given them that
example to follow. We, too, ignore the least among us.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we in the ranks of today's parents know how hard it is to
break through the walls our children build around themselves at
certain stages in their young lives, but we don't stop trying. We
know that eventually they will feel comfortable with their
independence and will again look to us as sources of strength and
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   If our kids are worth the effort, aren't all the rest?
</P>
<P>
   In these days following this latest and bloodiest school
shooting, many of us turn to God. Whether we address the Creator as
Lord, Mohammed or Yahweh, we ask for comfort and for answers.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps those of us in this country's so-called Christian
majority need only to act on the words spoken by the founder of the
faith to which we lay claim:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatsoever you do to the least of these, my people, that you
do unto me.''

   She was the epitome of glamour, escorting Princess Diana to the
Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996.
But beneath the velvet and satin, Liz Tilberis was fighting the
battle of her life. On Wednesday, April 21, at Mount Sinai Hospital
in Manhattan, Tilberis, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, lost
her six-year struggle with ovarian cancer. She was 51 years old.

   ``I don't know anyone who's displayed the kind of courage that
she has in the last six years,'' Calvin Klein said. ``To have
editorial meetings while she's having bone marrow transplants, and
be a wife and mother and run a fashion magazine while she's dealing
with this terrible illness is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tribute, friends, designers and co-workers remember this
very extraordinary woman.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   She was the epitome of glamour escorting Princess Diana to the
Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996,
but beneath the velvet and satin, Liz Tilberis was fighting the
battle of her life.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, April 21, at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan,
Tilberis, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, lost her six-year
struggle with ovarian cancer. She was 51 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry expressed shock and sadness at Tilberis'
death. She had been able to face down the disease several times
before and many assumed she would continue to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very special woman,'' said Calvin Klein. ``I don't
know anyone who's displayed the kind of courage that she has in the
last six years. To have editorial meetings while she's having bone
marrow transplants, and be a wife and mother and run a fashion
magazine while she's dealing with this terrible illness is
incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout all this time, there's her extraordinary will to
live and to enjoy life,'' Klein added. ``She had such a sense of
humor and still had such a passion for clothes and for photography.
And she always wanted to gossip. She'd call and say, `OK, let's
have it.' I don't gossip with very many people, but we talked about
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan recalled meeting Tilberis in London at British Vogue
in the '80s. ``I remember her sitting there with that gorgeous
white hair of hers and I immediately felt a kinship with her and
her womanliness,'' Karan said. ``I knew at that point she was not
going to be just someone I met through business. It was going to be
far deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liz was so big in my eyes, larger than life,'' Karan added.
``It was always her smile. It was the way she talked. She was
always concerned about the next person and never herself. We had so
much fun together. I felt a real connection. She allowed people to
be that close to her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not unusual, what she was going through,'' said
Jeanette Chang, Bazaar's publisher, of Tilberis' cancer fight. ``It
has been a miracle for six years. She was always going to pull
through and be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis used her high-profile position to bring attention to
the cause of ovarian cancer. As president of the Ovarian Cancer
Research Fund, she convinced retailers to host events in their
stores and manufacturers to donate proceeds of special products to
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tilberis published a memoir, ``No Time to Die: Living
With Ovarian Cancer.'' In it, she wrote: ``I never wanted to be a
cancer spokesperson. But cancer has become an immutable part of my
persona. I don't run from it. I study, anticipate and confront
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tilberis never let the illness get in the way of her job.
Colleagues at Bazaar said she remained involved with the
publication until the last days of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last conversation I had with her about five or six days
ago,'' said creative director Fabien Baron, ``she said, `Wait for
me at the magazine.' She loved her husband, kids and the magazine.
She loved the job. She was asking me all about the June issue and I
was telling her how great it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Liz could have had meetings on the June issue as late as
last Thursday,'' said Cathleen Black, president of Hearst
Magazines. ``She's directing traffic and pushing and cajoling. She
loved this magazine so much that throughout all this amazing battle
she made light of it most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said Tilberis' love of fashion, art, architecture and
literature, celebrities, artists and musicians was reflected in
Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the kinds of things she tried to infuse the
magazine with to make it more than just a fashion magazine,'' Black
said. ``It took people places. It was a statement; it was
aspirational, yet it was approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bazaar's future issues, Chang said: ``Thankfully, Liz has
a lot of senior captains: Karen Johnston, managing editor, Tonne
Goodman, fashion director, and Annemarie Iverson, beauty and
fashion news director. Photographer Patrick Demarchelier has been
here for years. All the stories have been going on while she's been
ill. It's not as though anything is coming to a halt by any means.
The next four issues were planned with her blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis seems to have been one of those rare, unusually focused
people who identify their life's calling at an early age. Fashion
has always been her passion.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis was born in Shirehampton, England in 1947. She won a
fashion essay writing contest _ one of her topics was on costume
historian James Laver, of whom she wrote, ``It was from him that I
learned that hemlines are tied to the wider world.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize: a summer internship at British Vogue in 1969. At the
same time, she edited a weekly fashion page in a local newspaper,
the Bath &AMP; Wiltshire Evening Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Leicester Polytechnic in 1970, Tilberis
joined the British Vogue staff as a fashion assistant. She was
promoted to fashion editor four years later, and in 1984 became
executive fashion editor, rising to editor of the entire magazine
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis' big coup at British Vogue came in 1990, when she
snagged the Princess of Wales for the December 1991 cover. Two
years later, she was on her way to New York to become editor of
Harper's Bazaar, which at the time was celebrating its 125th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis was known to joke about the change in her life when she
moved to New York from London. In her homeland she was a chic
matron, favoring size 14 suits and a simple bob for her straight
gray hair. After a short time in New York, she began to adopt
sophisticated, minimalist looks from the likes of Calvin Klein and
Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even have my own publicist now,'' she once said
self-deprecatingly in a speech in London, adding she would never
have dreamed of such self-promotion when she was editor of British
Vogue. But longtime colleagues stressed that Tilberis never lost
sight of what was most important in her life _ her family.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tilberis arrived, Harper's Bazaar was in need of a
makeover. She and Baron conceived of a magazine that was elegant
yet playful, with floating, overlapping graphics the likes of which
had not been seen in a contemporary fashion publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very nervous, but we knew Bazaar was a beautiful
magazine,'' Baron said. ``We called it `Sleeping Beauty.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis said she had always wanted to produce a cutting-edge
magazine. ``I suppose creativity is pushing the envelope forward in
a very constructive way,'' she said last year. ``All my life, I've
loved creativity in people. I like the idea that a magazine offers
creativity to readers, particularly in the styles. When we launched
with Fabien's graphics, it kept Harper's Bazaar on the cutting
edge,'' she said. `
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis had an affinity for American fashion. She said,
``American designers invented sportswear. They introduced pants and
sweaters for women.'' Klein said when he saw Tilberis' first issue
of Harper's Bazaar, he thought, ``How great. It takes a Brit to
make a great American fashion magazine. She understood what was
American more than most American editors.''
</P>
<P>
   While the publication has not always been universally well
received, it did shake up the industry when it launched and set the
stage for a legendary _ at least as it was played up by the press _
rivalry between Tilberis and her British Vogue mentor, Anna
Wintour. In 1987, Wintour was named editor of HG, formerly House
and Garden, and Tilberis became her successor at British Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Liz was a very formidable competitor,'' Wintour said
on Wednesday. ``I think she had an incredibly strong fashion
esthetic and put out a very elegant magazine. When we were working
together at British Vogue, she always struck me as being an
amazingly strong person with an incredible love of fashion. A
fashion editor par excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was passionate about her sittings and her work,'' Wintour
continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis' talent was evident to many others. Both Ralph Lauren
and Klein said they tried to hire Tilberis away from British Vogue
when she was a fashion editor. ``When she was at British Vogue,
about two or three years before she came to America, I had hired
her and she was all packed,'' Lauren said. ``She was going to work
with me as an assistant in design. It was all set. But British
Vogue didn't want her to leave, and gave her a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually even tried to bring her into my organization,''
Klein said. ``She was clearly a great talent and we all knew it.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Many industry veterans were too distraught to discuss Tilberis
over the phone. Karl Lagerfeld, in a fax, wrote, ``I am so sad
about the death of dear Liz Tilberis that I can hardly talk. She
was such a marvelous friend _ so optimistic, so like sunshine and
so courageous. She was so special and human in our tough fashion
world. Nice with everybody, but strong. That's a very rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a very courageous woman,'' said Giorgio Armani.
``She lived and worked up until the end, as if she were never
affected by the terrible pain. I saw her last in January. We talked
about work, but most of all, we talked about life. She never
betrayed any signs of pain on her beautiful face or in her
intelligent words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost more than a great editor,'' said Valentino. ``We lost
a special friend. She was a real woman. Real as fashion rarely is.
She was courageous and very sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her bravery was unbelievable,'' said Oscar de la Renta. ``She
was always so gracious and at the same time created great awareness
for the terrible thing that cancer is. She was able to raise a
tremendous amount of money using her own suffering. She never first
thought about herself.''

   Tilberis in 1994 received a special award from the Council of
Fashion Designers of America, which was presented by the Princess
of Wales. The CFDA said it will present Tilberis, posthumously,
with its humanitarian award at its June 2 gala. Tilberis was
notified of the award March 24, and Fern Mallis, CFDA executive
director, said ``We're really so happy that she knew about it. She
was moved to tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis is survived by her husband, Andrew; two sons,
Christopher and Robert; her mother, Jane Kelly; a sister, Lois
Stuart-Black and a brother, Dr. Grant Kelly. A spokeswoman for
Hearst said funeral services will be private. A memorial service is

<P>
   She was the epitome of glamour escorting Princess Diana to the
Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996,
but beneath the velvet and satin, Liz Tilberis was fighting the
battle of her life.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, April 21, at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan,
Tilberis, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, lost her six-year
struggle with ovarian cancer. She was 51 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry expressed shock and sadness at Tilberis'
death. She had been able to face down the disease several times
before and many assumed she would continue to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very special woman,'' said Calvin Klein. ``I don't
know anyone who's displayed the kind of courage that she has in the
last six years. To have editorial meetings while she's having bone
marrow transplants, and be a wife and mother and run a fashion
magazine while she's dealing with this terrible illness is
incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout all this time, there's her extraordinary will to
live and to enjoy life,'' Klein added. ``She had such a sense of
humor and still had such a passion for clothes and for photography.
And she always wanted to gossip. She'd call and say, `OK, let's
have it.' I don't gossip with very many people, but we talked about
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan recalled meeting Tilberis in London at British Vogue
in the '80s. ``I remember her sitting there with that gorgeous
white hair of hers and I immediately felt a kinship with her and
her womanliness,'' Karan said. ``I knew at that point she was not
going to be just someone I met through business. It was going to be
far deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liz was so big in my eyes, larger than life,'' Karan added.
``It was always her smile. It was the way she talked. She was
always concerned about the next person and never herself. We had so
much fun together. I felt a real connection. She allowed people to
be that close to her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not unusual, what she was going through,'' said
Jeanette Chang, Bazaar's publisher, of Tilberis' cancer fight. ``It
has been a miracle for six years. She was always going to pull
through and be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis used her high-profile position to bring attention to
the cause of ovarian cancer. As president of the Ovarian Cancer
Research Fund, she convinced retailers to host events in their
stores and manufacturers to donate proceeds of special products to
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tilberis published a memoir, ``No Time to Die: Living
With Ovarian Cancer.'' In it, she wrote: ``I never wanted to be a
cancer spokesperson. But cancer has become an immutable part of my
persona. I don't run from it. I study, anticipate and confront
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tilberis never let the illness get in the way of her job.
Colleagues at Bazaar said she remained involved with the
publication until the last days of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last conversation I had with her about five or six days
ago,'' said creative director Fabien Baron, ``she said, `Wait for
me at the magazine.' She loved her husband, kids and the magazine.
She loved the job. She was asking me all about the June issue and I
was telling her how great it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Liz could have had meetings on the June issue as late as
last Thursday,'' said Cathleen Black, president of Hearst
Magazines. ``She's directing traffic and pushing and cajoling. She
loved this magazine so much that throughout all this amazing battle
she made light of it most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said Tilberis' love of fashion, art, architecture and
literature, celebrities, artists and musicians was reflected in
Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the kinds of things she tried to infuse the
magazine with to make it more than just a fashion magazine,'' Black
said. ``It took people places. It was a statement; it was
aspirational, yet it was approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bazaar's future issues, Chang said: ``Thankfully, Liz has
a lot of senior captains: Karen Johnston, managing editor, Tonne
Goodman, fashion director, and Annemarie Iverson, beauty and
fashion news director. Photographer Patrick Demarchelier has been
here for years. All the stories have been going on while she's been
ill. It's not as though anything is coming to a halt by any means.
The next four issues were planned with her blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis seems to have been one of those rare, unusually focused
people who identify their life's calling at an early age. Fashion
has always been her passion.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis was born in Shirehampton, England in 1947. She won a
fashion essay writing contest _ one of her topics was on costume
historian James Laver, of whom she wrote, ``It was from him that I
learned that hemlines are tied to the wider world.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize: a summer internship at British Vogue in 1969. At the
same time, she edited a weekly fashion page in a local newspaper,
the Bath &AMP; Wiltshire Evening Chronicle.
</P>

stage for a legendary _ at least as it was played up by the press _
rivalry between Tilberis and her British Vogue mentor, Anna
Wintour. In 1987, Wintour was named editor of HG, formerly House
and Garden, and Tilberis became her successor at British Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Liz was a very formidable competitor,'' Wintour said
on Wednesday. ``I think she had an incredibly strong fashion
esthetic and put out a very elegant magazine. When we were working
together at British Vogue, she always struck me as being an
amazingly strong person with an incredible love of fashion. A
fashion editor par excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was passionate about her sittings and her work,'' Wintour
continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis' talent was evident to many others. Both Ralph Lauren
and Klein said they tried to hire Tilberis away from British Vogue
when she was a fashion editor. ``When she was at British Vogue,
about two or three years before she came to America, I had hired
her and she was all packed,'' Lauren said. ``She was going to work
with me as an assistant in design. It was all set. But British
Vogue didn't want her to leave, and gave her a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually even tried to bring her into my organization,''
Klein said. ``She was clearly a great talent and we all knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   -------------OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE------------------
</P>
<P>
   Many industry veterans were too distraught to discuss Tilberis
over the phone. Karl Lagerfeld, in a fax, wrote, ``I am so sad
about the death of dear Liz Tilberis that I can hardly talk. She
was such a marvelous friend _ so optimistic, so like sunshine and
so courageous. She was so special and human in our tough fashion
world. Nice with everybody, but strong. That's a very rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a very courageous woman,'' said Giorgio Armani.
``She lived and worked up until the end, as if she were never
affected by the terrible pain. I saw her last in January. We talked
about work, but most of all, we talked about life. She never
betrayed any signs of pain on her beautiful face or in her
intelligent words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost more than a great editor,'' said Valentino. ``We lost
a special friend. She was a real woman. Real as fashion rarely is.
She was courageous and very sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her bravery was unbelievable,'' said Oscar de la Renta. ``She
was always so gracious and at the same time created great awareness
for the terrible thing that cancer is. She was able to raise a
tremendous amount of money using her own suffering. She never first
thought about herself.''
</P>
<P>
   -------------OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE------------------
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis in 1994 received a special award from the Council of
Fashion Designers of America, which was presented by the Princess
of Wales. The CFDA said it will present Tilberis, posthumously,
with its humanitarian award at its June 2 gala. Tilberis was
notified of the award March 24, and Fern Mallis, CFDA executive
director, said ``We're really so happy that she knew about it. She
was moved to tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis is survived by her husband, Andrew; two sons,
Christopher and Robert; her mother, Jane Kelly; a sister, Lois
Stuart-Black and a brother, Dr. Grant Kelly. A spokeswoman for
Hearst said funeral services will be private. A memorial service is
planned. &QL;

  Includes color photo of a field of tulips
 Includes a 180-word sidebar
 By SUSAN McCLURE 
 World rights (except Chicago) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Behind a disguise of vibrant-colored petals, the tulip has a
checkered past that is all but forgotten today. Other bulbs such as
daffodils have been immortalized in legends while roses have
reigned over the Victorian language of flowers. But tulips have
made men into millionaries and then broken them to paupers just as
quickly.
 &HT;    The fascinating tale of the tulip is told in Anna Pavord's ''The
Tulip, the Story of a Flower That Has Made Men Mad'' (1999, $35,
Bloomsbury Publishing, New York). Pavord chronicles tulips, past
and present, in over 400 pages of intriguing text illustrated with
beautiful botanical prints and paintings.
 &HT;    Pavord was drawn to the tulip innocently enough when her husband
gave her a beautiful cream-colored tulip, a peace offering after
returning from a boys-only trip. Intrigued by its stunning beauty,
she shopped around for other bulbs and then began digging into
tulip history. Soon she was hooked.
 &HT;    For seven years she took every opportunity to travel around the
world, peeking into libraries and museums to find tulip history and
gleanings.
 &HT;    ''I wanted to know how the story of the tulip ended up. It was
full of extraordinary adventures that kept me going,'' Pavord said.
''I gathered all kinds of material in notebooks and boxes for my
own enjoyment. I ended up having such a fantastic time, I thought
others would like it too, and that's how the book came about.''
 &HT;    Pavord begins ''The Tulip'' with a tale of hunting for wild
tulips in Crete. In a neighborhood bar, she coaxed locals with
brandy to help her find the haunts of the mauve-purple Cretan
tulip. The drinks led to a ride to a country church and chance
meeting that served her goal.
 &HT;    ''...the small boy, left outside sitting on a rock, had hijacked
a passer-by and showed him the picture of the flower that I was
looking for. 'Omalos,' he said triumphantly as we emerged.
'Omalos', he said again, pointing at the picture and then somewhere
to the west, way over the horizon,'' Pavord writes.
 &HT;    Omalos was a mountain town on a sheep-nibbled plain where Tulipa
bakeri flowered on olive terraces fenced to keep woolly grazers
out.
 &HT;    ''They  Cretan tulips  were growing in thick, poor grassland,
their shiny leaves poking out from sheaves of anemones, with
orchids thrown in for good measure...This was the first time I had
seen tulips growing in the wild. I knew how Galahad must have felt
when he finally caught up with the Grail,'' Pavord wrote.
 &HT;    In the early 1600s, wild species from Turkey were imported into
Europe and, like any new flower, enjoyed for their novelty. But
when ordinary red tulips began changing _ taking on sharply-edged
yellow and cream flames or feathers, tulip growing took a more
serious turn.
 &HT;    While we now know these markings were caused by a virus disease,
in past centuries they seemed miraculous. Conoisseurs would pay
extraordinary prices for flame-flowered bulbs, which due to the
disease, multiplied slowly, limited the supply, and generated much
demand.
 &HT;    ''For hundreds of years, growers were puzzled by this remarkable
trick. Alchemists tried to transform base metals into gold, but
tulips made seemingly spontaneous transformations instantly,''
Pavord said.
 &HT;    Growers even went to such lengths as to lay powdered paint in
varying colors on the tulip bed in hopes the bulbs would pick them
up. Those most successful in generating color breaks often grew
their bulbs near peach orchards, where unknowingly, they submitted
them to attack by the peach potato aphid, the primary virus
carrier.
 &HT;    ''The virus was like a joker in the tulip bed; no one could
control its workings,'' Pavord said.
 &HT;    The thrill, and capital gain, that came from each exotic new
bicolor tulip created a frenzy in France and, 20 years later, made
an even bigger stir in Holland. In 1623 and 1633, certain fabled
bulbs were selling for seven to 100 times the average annual wage.
 &HT;    Wealthy barons, tulip growers, and some common folk invested
lavishly in tulips, hoping for a color break that would make them
richer.
 &HT;    The number of tulip growers naturally expanded, which marked the
beginning of the end of this tulip frenzy. By the mid-1600s there
were more sellers than buyers in the tulip game. Bulbs were
liquidated at fractions of their earlier prices and fortunes, once
counted in bins of bulbs, evaporated.
 &HT;    ''It was inevitable that tulipomania would be followed by an
equally intense hatred of the flower. The professor of botany at
Leiden grew so to loathe them that he attacked them savagely
wherever they stood, thwacking them with his cane,'' Pavord writes.
 &HT;    In 1880, a bulb breeder developed the Darwin hybrids,
long-stemmed tulips in plain colors used as wallpaper flowers for
massing in beds. People bought them by the thousands, making tulips
a common favorite among ordinary people.
 &HT;    Dutch breeders, who have monopolized the industry since then,
have systematically eliminated the virus from modern stocks by
developing resistant varieties. Now bicolor and fringed tulips have
been made to resemble early flamed types, but are very coarse
replications, Pavord said.
 &HT;    When it comes to tulips, it's intriguing to learn, they are much
more than just another pretty face.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Sidebar: Meet Anna Pavord
 &HT;    Anna Pavord's books, including ''The Tulip,'' ''The Border
Book,'' ''The New Kitchen Garden'' and ''Foliage,''
characteristically blend history, vivid descriptive writing, and
intriguing ideas. They go realms beyond ordinary how-to writing.
 &HT;    Pavord was the product of passionate gardening parents, as are
many residents of the British Isles. Once she had her own patch of
ground, childhood gardening experiences shaped her adult life.
 &HT;    ''You can achieve such wonderful things by setting a plant in
the garden,'' Pavord said. ''Gardening is extraordinary in that it
never leaves you at a loss for something to do.''
 &HT;    After first working as newspaper feature writer and a film
maker, Pavord began writing a garden column for the British
Independent newspaper 12 years ago.
 &HT;    ''The paper was brand new and I was expected to write a column
that would draw everyone in. It had to be a good read,'' Pavord
said.
 &HT;    Presently Pavord contributes to Country Life, Country Living,
Elle Decoration, and she is associate editor of the British
magazine Gardens Illustrated.

  Includes color photo of home appliances
 By BOB NORBERG 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the clock on the wall rolls past midnight to the year 2000,
don't expect fireworks. The clock will be just fine, as will
virtually every other appliance found in most homes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appliances relying more and more on computer chips to
brew the coffee before you get up, water the lawns and plants, tape
TV shows and regulate home heating, few will have problems
associated with the Year 2000 computer bug, and any problems that
do crop up are expected to be annoyances at worst.
</P>
<P>
   The computer chips in appliances simply don't care what year it
is, according to technicians, repair workers, manufacturers and
consumer appliance associations.
</P>
<P>
   ''People will still be able to watch TV, still be able to play
back their VCR, still be able to use the cell phone,'' said Jeff
Joseph of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Association in
Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are chips in every appliance with digital displays, but
these don't have any date codes, so they won't be affected,'' said
Pat Montague, service manager of TeeVax in Santa Rosa, Calif.,
where appliances are sold and repaired.
</P>
<P>
   And where problems do crop up, such as in older VCRs or
camcorders, users will just get a wrong date, requiring a simple
reset. The device itself will continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would only stop you from doing a pre-programmed recording
when you are not at home,'' said Darin Scott, a technician at Alpha
Electronics in Santa Rosa. ''You would just have to reset your
clock. Some VCRs are date-sensitive, some aren't. You would have to
take it on a model-by-model basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem _ also known as the Millennium Bug _ is
the inability of some computers and computer programs to recognize
the year 2000 because of the past practice of programmers using
two-digit year codes - ''99'' instead of ''1999'' _ to save
precious memory space.
</P>
<P>
   Some older computers, for instance, will think it is Jan. 1,
1900, not Jan. 1, 2000, because of the way the date is stored in
separate areas of the computer, while software programs that use
dates to perform computations, such as amortization programs, will
produce incorrect results unless they use four digits to denote
years.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumer appliances and electronics have been manufactured
with the year 2000 in mind since 1988, Joseph said. And in any
case, the chips that commonly are integrated into appliances are
programmed for cycles, whether the cycle is 24 hours, seven days, a
month or even decades.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessors are in use in virtually every powered home
product, including refrigerators, ovens, coffee makers, microwaves,
washers and dryers, VCRs, TVs, camcorders, watches and even
automobiles. The more bells and whistles the unit has, the more
likely it has microprocessors controlling its functions.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer chip function doesn't necessarily have a year
programmed in, making it unlikely that the chip will just stop
functioning at the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thermostats that regulate the temperature, lowering it at night,
usually have a weeklong cycle, unless it is an industrial
application, where holidays have to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   They are not date-sensitive _ the day of the week may matter,
but not the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, alarm clocks and digital displays on ovens and
microwaves care what the hour is, but not the day, while
controllers for outdoor watering systems care about the hour and
day, but not the month or year.
</P>
<P>
   ''By luck, all of our products are Y2K-compliant,'' said Richard
Macy of Rainbird Sprinklers in Glendora, Calif. ''They only count
the days, from seven to 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital watches are programmed with dates covering 40 years,
even though the liquid crystal displays usually solidify long
before then, and calculators are programmed to reach the year 2099.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all use a long date format,'' said Ted Grier, a technician
with Casio in Little Ferry, N.J. ''From 1975 on, you won't have a
problem until the year 2019 or beyond. But the liquid crystal
display only lasts 12 to 14 years before the gelatinous crystal
won't hold an electrical charge. LCDs don't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles now commonly use microprocessors in black boxes that
control the air-fuel mixture; monitor sensors for the oil, water
and fuel pressure; and set the clock, but have no functions that
depend on the date.
</P>
<P>
   It's an engine management system that allows some cars to go
100,000 miles before a tune-up and drive as well at sea level as at
6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a non-issue,'' said Dave Whitgob of San Francisco,
project manager of the California State Automobile Association's
Car Care Plus repair center in Santa Clara. ''They don't know if
it's 1999 or 1899 and they don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario, Whitgob said, is that some luxury cars
will have a clock with an incorrect date.
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers have information posted on their company Web
sites, addressing any potential issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some Nokia 9000 cellular phones, for instance, will have a
time-stamp problem after Dec. 31, and the Model 9000 Communicator
will not recognize Feb. 29, so it should be kept plugged in on that
day to keep it from going into a sleep mode, according to the
information on the Nokia Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''But from a consumer standpoint, overall, they don't have to
worry,'' said Ann Saybolt of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing
Association.

   White didn't see the pickup as she turned left into traffic. The

anymore and, well, little things are going wrong with my body,''
she said. ``It was time for me to stop driving.'' &QL;

TIME FOR A SHAKEDOWN OF SOCIETY

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The awesome impact of the murderous rampage at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., is measured not only in
the devastation visited on parents who suffered the loss of their
children, and the family bereft of a father, but also upon the rest
of us.
</P>
<P>
   Students of all ages are once again confronted by the insight
that their school, the place that ought to be as secure for them as
their own homes, in an instant can mutate into a pit of terror.
</P>
<P>
   As the wrenching poignancy of dying young is once more
memorialized at the burials of the dead children and their teacher,
the nation searches for ways to prevent the recurrence of another
Littleton. That is just what happened after earlier deadly violence
in schools.
</P>
<P>
   About the only sure thing that can be concluded in the
once-again desperate search for answers to the incomprehensible and
the solutions that would prevent it ever happening again, is that
these kinds of killings are a creature of our own times.
</P>
<P>
   They did not happen until relatively recently. And recently they
have taken place with an episodic regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to comprehend what it is about ourselves that abets these
periodic outbursts of irrational violence is as natural as it is
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of cliques within schools, which often lead to a
hierarchy of winners and losers, resulting in the alienation of
those ostracized, is nothing peculiar to our day. Yet this was one
ingredient cited to explain the causes of the Littleton massacre.
But in the distant past, when the same kind of harassment took
place, it did not engender the violent response of Littleton, if
that is what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Another causal factor is deemed to be the relative ease with
which children lay their hands on guns. Although the gun culture
has been a strong theme throughout American history, what is
different today is the vigor with which guns are being marketed by
an industry intensely interested in is own growth.
</P>
<P>
   When ease of acquisition is added to the drug wars fought by
rival gangs in our cities, the consequence in our own time was a
magnitude of everyday violence that was portrayed with regularity
by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Violence came to be a much larger part of the national
background.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of violence in the media, apart from the
news. Violence in films has existed as long as films themselves.
What is the product of our own times is the technology that permits
violence to be rendered in a bloody verisimilitude previously not
possible. Audiences flock to violent productions, many of which are
targeted to teen-age taste.
</P>
<P>
   The vexing question is how much these entertainments respond to
a basic taste versus how much they help to cultivate it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, television has provided the means for a much greater
distribution of programs marked by violence, and you don't have to
leave your home or pay an admission's price to partake of it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Internet has extended the ubiquity of violence
with its cultivation of games devoted to it. At least one of the
perpetrators of the Littleton rampage appeared to have been a
devotee of these gothic and virulent pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   But, as has been pointed out, Japanese children are no less
addicted to these fiendish games, yet that country's murder and
mayhem rate is much less than our own.
</P>
<P>
   What this comparison suggests is that American culture itself
compounds media violence in all its forms that in other countries
and their societies registers a lesser malignant impact.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet has gone a step further than merely providing a
new venue catering to already developed taste. It is also the
source of devilish instructions that provide the know-how for the
construction of the kinds of bombs that were taken into Columbine
High School.
</P>
<P>
   That is a function of the new media, which is a revolutionary
new way permitting individuals to communicate without having to
rely on the traditional venues of newspapers, radio or television.
At the same time, the governors that are more or less in place in
the traditional media, that would forswear the dissemination of
such information, are not a factor on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the discussion it comes down to this: There is no
one cause or one remedy for this plague of violence. Yet that
should not keep us from trying to cope, even if we know from the
outset that the solution will be only partial and possibly
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, schools should be protected with devices to screen
for guns.
</P>
<P>
   Stricter gun controls obviously are necessary, and public
support appears to be building for their imposition.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the new media need to develop standards of
restraint that have evolved in the other news media.
</P>
<P>
   Children should be encouraged to share with teachers and parents
impressions about their peers that they have naturally enough kept
to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The great and proper concern is that anyone who manifests any
differences from the established norm will be unfairly fingered.
But some modality should be devised in the schools to sort out
run-of-the-mill alienation from the violent kind.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tricky undertaking, which needs much study. It is
merited only because to leave matters as they are is intolerable.
Too many children have died at the hands of their peers.
</P>

CLINTON SEEKS TO PROTECT ELDERLY FROM BUSINESS SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID STEINBERG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton recently appealed to Congress
for legislation to stop telemarketers from victimizing the elderly
with fraudulent business deals that he said pose ``the greatest
threat that many older Americans face.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans lose an estimated $40 billion per year to telephone
scam artists, the president said, adding that more than half the
victims are over 50.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to propose federal legislation that would impose
criminal charges on those who victimize the elderly with
``retirement plan rip-offs'' and would toughen penalties against
individuals convicted of stealing pension and retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   These forms of elder abuse and victimization have been reported
frequently in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Aging, the magazine formerly published by the federal
Administration on Aging, reported crimes against the elderly
committed by family members who steal Social Security checks from
their parents and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation, Clinton said, would also impose
criminal charges against nursing home operators suspected of
neglecting or abusing their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's long overdue,'' said Patricia L. McGinniss, executive
director of the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform in San
Francisco. ``Owners and operators of these facilities should be
responsible for providing what they promise. They're often most
concerned with the bottom line. Elderly people may spend all they
have in the belief they will get proper care.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope the president's proposed legislation to protect the
elderly against fraud also targets operators of lotteries whose
mailings promise million-dollar winnings with ``no purchase
necessary.'' Gullible elders clutter their homes with trinkets,
fake jewelry, magazines and unread books they buy to get ``express
handling'' of their entries in ``no purchase necessary'' contests.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss recounted the story of an elderly man who went to her
office to say he was going to take his wife out of a nursing home
and move into a new house he could buy with the money he had won in
lottery. He had the letter that informed him he had won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to tell him to be careful,'' she said, ``and to read
the small print on the letter that announced he had won.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the American Association of Retired
Persons, nearly one in five Americans reported being victims of a
major consumer fraud or swindle, and three in four reported a
``bad-buying'' experience during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted in November and December, found that 17
percent of Americans queried ``identified themselves as victims
when asked if they had been the subject of fraud or a major
consumer swindle. More than one in six linked their problems to
automobile purchases or repairs, and nearly one in 10 cited gross
over-charging or misleading advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Most complained about defective products.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Harvey, director of AARP's program development, said,
``Clearly, there's no level playing field for consumers.'' Most of
those surveyed express skepticism about the practices of specific
industries, including used-car dealers, telemarketers, telephone
companies and home contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Smith Sloan, another AARP official, said businesses should
avoid using fine print and use plain language.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, taking aim at telemarketers, said the legislation he
favors would give the Justice Department authority to terminate
telephone service for companies if federal agents find evidence of
an illegal telemarketing scheme or learn of plans to start one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will send a message to telemarketers: If you prey on
older Americans, we will cut off your phone lines and shut you
down,'' the president said in a recent radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what can be done to protect the elderly from mail fraud?

FLACCID AMERICA NEEDS VIAGRA FOR THE PSYCHE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dear Pfizer: This is a tall order, but the need
is great.
</P>
<P>
   Could your biotech engineers start working on Viagra for the
psyche? You've pumped pizzazz back into thousands of men with
erectile dysfunction, how about giving millions of us something to
cure impotence of the soul?
</P>
<P>
   Desperate times call for desperate measures. And these are
desperate times.
</P>
<P>
   We came of age in the late '60s. Protested racism, sexism, the
Vietnam war and the Cambodian incursion. We talked about peace and
brotherhood and could keep it up all night against the military
industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have mortgages that will take until 2025 to pay off _ if
our companies don't downsize and lay us off first. If we don't
suffer a cataclysmic illness that our thrice-merged HMOs refuse to
cover.
</P>
<P>
   It's widespread, Pfizer. Millions of us suffer from some degree
of soul dysfunction. We look around at one horror after another _
at home and abroad _ and our blood and passion rise. We want to
act, to cry out, to make something happen. But we do nothing with
our desire.
</P>
<P>
   We're limp, flaccid, impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Impotent against the truly insane bombing of Yugoslavia. We had
to destroy the village in order to save it. Against the
draft-dodging boomer-in-chief who is driving our runaway truck of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Nixon, not LBJ. I have seen the enemy, and he is us.
This is our 52-year-old contemporary, dropping bombs to ``Don't
Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So many cruise missiles, so little time. Four massive attacks on
four countries in 18 months. One, two, three, four, we don't want
your __ing war.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, as refugee camps swell by thousands of ethnic
Albanians (and countless others disappear back into Kosovo), the
rhetoric grows increasingly grotesque. Rhetoric from the once-noble
William Cohen. From the first-ever woman secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Even liberal Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., fumes like a
schoolyard bully from the Senate that if ``Mr. Milosevic'' knows
what's good for him, he'll get back to the peace table. Or else.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't anyone noticed? ``Or else'' is costing a bloody fortune _
in lives and dollars. Not American lives, of course, which is all
that seems to matter these days. That wasn't the way it was before
we were impotent. All the world over it's so easy to see: people
everywhere just want to be free.
</P>
<P>
   What is the rate of exchange now, anyway? About 100 ethnic
Albanians to one (non-immigrant) U.S. citizen? Or is it 1,000 to
one? The boomer-in-chief has made it clear that, if we're weighing
Rwandans, East Timorese or anybody else who doesn't look like us,
the scales are especially tilted: About a million of them equal one
of us.
</P>
<P>
   We watch, our passion flames, our frustration surges. Still we
lie limp.
</P>
<P>
   In a middle-class Denver suburb, on a day when NATO conducts
some of its heaviest bombing, two fantastically screwed-up young
U.S. citizens turn their high school into a teen-age killing field.
I know we've come a long way; we're changing day to day.
</P>
<P>
   But, tell me, where do the children play?
</P>
<P>
   Again. An entire nation keens: It's the guns. It's the media.
It's the video games. It's the music. It's the liberals. It's the
conservatives. How did this happen? What shall we do? Who can we
blame?
</P>
<P>
   Moses, the head of the National Rifle Association, says the
massacre is a good advertisement for armed guards in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   With a straight face, the boomer-in-chief says: ``We must do
more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their
anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this from Washington, where _ due to the pesky holocaust
in Yugoslavia _ NATO has scaled back its 50th anniversary blow.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitively, Moses says the annual convention of the NRA _ in
Denver of all places _ will also be shorter and less festive. But
the show goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Please, Pfizer, get cracking. We atrophy by the minute. If
you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nuclear disasters. Biblical floods. Stake
burnings. A sexually charged head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Death? Destruction? Armageddon?
</P>
<P>
   Nah, it's just May.
</P>
<P>
   Which means ``sweeps,'' critical for advertisers and the
networks who roll out their big movies and series finales before we
ditch the summer rerun season in favor of cable.
</P>
<P>
   And this sweeps season (the period when ratings are taken for
local stations), which actually starts Thursday and runs through
May 26, is especially noteworthy because several longtime shows
will be leaving the air for the great syndication run in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   First, the movie specials, many of them four-hour, two-part
blowouts:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Biblical flood: ``Noah's Ark.'' Film actors Jon Voight,
Mary Steenburgen and James Coburn come to television in this
four-hour drama on ABC May 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ The nuclear disaster: ``Atomic Train.'' Rob Lowe returns in
another two-part NBC movie, this one about an out-of-control train
loaded with nuclear weapons and waste making a beeline toward
Denver. May 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ The stake burning: ``Joan of Arc.'' The story of the religious
French peasant girl who fought England airs in this four-hour drama
on CBS. May 16 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sexually charged head of state: It's not about President
Clinton, it's ``Cleopatra.'' Leonor Varela, Billy Zane and Timothy
Dalton star in yet another two-part drama about the Egyptian queen
and her paramours. On ABC, May 23-24.
</P>
<P>
   In a more up-to-date historical saga, NBC will air ``The Hunt
for the Unicorn Killer'' May 9-10. Kevin Anderson and Tom Skerritt
star in the story of former hippie Ira Einhorn, who was convicted
in absentia and is still fighting extradition in France. On NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Two divas of yesterday and today, Diana Ross and Brandy, team up
in ``Double Platinum'' May 16 on ABC. It is the story of a singer
who gave up her daughter but reunites with her years later after
she, too, enters show business.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we have a quickie NBC bio flick, ``The Jesse Ventura
Story,'' scheduled for May 23. Nils Allen Stewart stars as the pro
wrestler who is now governor of Minnesota. Along with these
one-shots are longtime shows leaving for good:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Home Improvement.'' After eight seasons, Tim Allen hangs up
his tool belt with a 90-minute episode on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Melrose Place.'' After seven years, the steamy nighttime
soap concludes on Fox on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mad About You.'' They had a kid. That's killed other shows
before, but this one was on its last legs anyway. The Helen Hunt
and Paul Reiser sitcom ends its seven-season NBC run with a
one-hour episode on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Nanny.'' Six seasons of Fran Drescher is enough, trust
us. The one-hour finale airs May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is an old show making a cameo return. In ``Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman: The Movie,'' Jane Seymour and Joe Lando return to
the network that canceled the show last year, CBS, on May 22.

FUR IS FINDING FRIENDS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seattle Fur Exchange, the largest wholesale
marketer of mink in North America, has found an unlikely market for
its luxurious metaphor for decadent capitalism: the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   That the Fur Exchange is capitalizing on China's astonishing
economic transformation is no surprise for a little-known
institution that is almost as old as Seattle itself. After more
than a century in the cyclic fashion business that began with the
Klondike gold rush, the Exchange has learned to jump on new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange has come a long way since 1898, when Alaskan
prospectors traded pelts for supplies with grocery merchants who
decided that the best way to make money from the furs was to start
their own auction house. From its first home on Seattle's bustling
waterfront, the early incarnation of the Exchange auctioned off
wild fur like lynx, wolf, beaver, badger, marten, mink, otter and
fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange headquarters, along with tens of millions of
dollars in mink pelts dangling on metal racks in a huge
cold-storage warehouse, is tucked away in suburban Renton's
industrial flats. The building is kept purposefully nondescript to
make it difficult for anti-fur protesters to find. Even the phone
number is unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   People like J.P. Goodwin, executive director of the Coalition to
Abolish the Fur Trade and a vegetarian, professes that using
animals for fur is morally repugnant. Whenever the Fur Exchange
holds an auction, demonstrators are likely to be present.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Brennan, president of the American Legend Cooperative of
farmers, which owns the Exchange, said: ``We are very, very
careful. We have never had a demonstration that has stopped our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledges that animal rights activism hurt sales
beginning in the late 1980s, major fashion designers around the
world have been returning to fur.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a year _ in February, May and September _ buyers
from around the globe converge on Seattle to bid on the pelts sold
on consignment for the 280 fur farmer owners of the American Legend
Cooperative. Brennan said buyers from as many as 15 countries will
be here at the end of next month to bid on the approximately 1.2
million in pelts.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers, who frequently bring their families to watch the
auctions, are nervous and excited, Brennan said. ``Their whole
year's work comes down to one payday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mink breed in early March and give birth to kits in late April
and early May. The animals are killed, skinned and dried at the
farm in December. December, January and February is the busiest
time of year, as millions of pelts come in for grading, sizing and
storage. The full-time work force of 45 swells by 125 seasonal
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership equity by the cooperative members is based on
percentage of total sales attributed to each fur farmer. While the
largest owner has about a 5 percent share, the average mink farmer
has a smaller operation with about 10,000 animals.
</P>
<P>
   Pelt prices are very volatile. At $27 per pelt on average, the
prices so far this year have been a little below the cost of
production, said Kurt Essman, a third-generation employee of the
Exchange who has worked there since 1979. ``It has been tough for a
lot of the farmers to make it over the years,'' Essman said. ``But
they've had good times, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Times were especially good in 1996, with sales of $125 million
and pelt prices about midway between $50 and $60. Prices dropped to
about $35 last season before reaching the current $27 mark. This
year, Brennan anticipates sales of between $90 million and $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis is largely responsible for the drop in
prices, Brennan said. When the South Korean economy tanked in
November 1997, North American mink ranchers lost their biggest
buyer. ``One day Korea takes 70 percent of our goods, the next day
they are gone,'' said Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange adjusted its grading and sizing to appeal to a
wider range of customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian economic crash last fall reverberated in Renton.
Russia was the world's biggest buyer of furs last year. Some
estimates suggest it consumed up to 40 percent of global ranch mink
and fox production. The Exchange predicts that even if the Russian
economy stabilizes, the fur market there will not recover and pelt
prices will be depressed.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to spur sales, the Exchange maintains 11 offices
overseas in cities such as Tokyo, Seoul, London, Milan, Helsinki,
Stockholm and Moscow. The Exchange, the third largest fur
wholesaler in the world following auction houses in Copenhagen and
Helsinki, is competing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been beating the backwoods in China and Russia,''
Brennan said. It's the nature of the business that ``one minute
we're hanging out at Versace eating caviar, and the next were in
Siberia eating dog meat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brennan see lots of lo mein in his future. ``We had a record
Chinese buyer turnout in February,'' he said. He sees signs that
China, which used to import pelts for re-export as coats, is
beginning to develop a significant domestic retail market.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly telling was that many of the Chinese buyers were
domestic wholesalers and not manufacturing for export. While
Brennan does not have access to Chinese retail sales figures, he
said buyers ``are selling to local consumers in their region.'' And
the co-op, for a few years now, has been doing everything it can to
encourage the trend.
</P>
<P>
   And while it might seem incongruous in the land of Mao and the
Cultural Revolution, the fur farmers' co-op has been sponsoring
swanky fashion shows in China at places like the posh Portman
Shangri-La Hotel in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were telling us we were nuts to be there when we did
the first show,'' Brennan said. But that first event in the 1996-97
season was attended by 2,400 guests and received coverage on
Chinese television.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, there were department store fashion shows in five
Chinese cities over a three-week period. An American Legend
newsletter notes that ``each show drew a large attendance of
government officials and Chinese celebrities, as well as local
shoppers who came to witness the latest designs.'' The garments
were made of American Legend mink by Korean, Hong Kong and local
manufacturers. Each department store followed the shows with a
10-day sales program, Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone can appreciate that the potential of the
Chinese market is mind-boggling,'' Brennan said. ``We're in a niche
market, and all we need is the upper echelon of consumers. I even
had a taxi driver in Beijing who had a leather bomber jacket with
mink trim. He said he paid about $600 U.S.''

CHAIN UNVEILS NEW HOTEL CONCEPT FOR BUSINESS TRAVELER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The city's newest major hotel, the W San
Francisco, opens next month in the burgeoning culture and commerce
zone adjacent to the convention center and art museum.
</P>
<P>
   Sheathed in gray marble, with a three-story, glass-walled
octagonal lobby, sleek bar, cafe and restaurant, and guest rooms
created by designers from Banana Republic and Pottery Barn, the W
San Francisco is not the typical big-city hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Operated by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. of New
York, the world's largest hotel group, the 30-story hotel is
nothing if not ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Starwood, which also owns the Sheraton and Westin brands
and operates 650 hotels in 70 countries, says it aims to reinvent
the business hotel with the W brand, which it is rolling out
nationally this year.
</P>
<P>
   To serve wired business travelers, W San Francisco executives
say the hotel will provide ``Internet and e-mail access at speeds
up to 100 times faster than through conventional modems. Each room
will have two phones, and for laptop hook-ups, a high-speed, direct
Ethernet modem connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is also designed to have the comfort of an upscale
home, with big, comfortable beds with goose-down comforters,
upholstered benches, dark wood desks and rich natural fabrics in
the guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first W Hotel opened in New York in December, the second
in Atlanta in February. They were both renovations. San Francisco
is third, and the first to be built from the ground up,'' said
Elias Assaly, the general manager of W San Francisco. W hotels are
also planned for Chicago, Boston, Washington and other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood is headed by Wall Street investor Barry Sternlicht, a
Harvard Business School graduate. Sternlicht, 38, has developed a
Donald Trump-like reputation as an artful dealmaker, but has not
yet operated a large number of hotels over a sustained period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Sternlicht is expanding, rolling out the W brand for
a niche market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as going for the creative side of the
business market: high-tech entrepreneurs, entertainment industry
executives, journalists and those people looking for personalized
service,'' Assaly said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel faces competition in San Francisco, which has 31,000
hotel rooms. The W is across from the Moscone Convention Center and
next door to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The Marriott,
Sheraton Palace, a future Four Seasons and the Argent will all be
doing business in close proximity.
</P>
<P>
   Location, location, location is key, according to John Marks,
president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau,
whose office is directly across the street from W.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the product and location, there's no reason to think W
will experience anything but success,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco has not been in the mode of adding hotel rooms
in the last few years,'' he said. ``This represents the first hotel
of this magnitude to come in recently.''
</P>
<P>
   The W will have 423 rooms and cost $225-$250 per night, Assaly
said.

POPULAR ECHINACEA MAY MAKE YOU SICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A study done at one of the nation's leading research
and teaching institutions for naturopathic medicine has shown that
taking the popular herbal supplement echinacea as a preventive
measure might make you sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturer wanted to show that taking it could prevent
symptoms of respiratory illness,'' said Dr. Carlo Calabrese,
co-director of research at Bastyr University, which trains
naturopathic physicians and practitioners of alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the people who took it got sick more often,''
Calabrese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a six-month period, people who took echinacea had more
symptoms of respiratory infection than people who took a placebo.''
</P>
<P>
   Calabrese will present his findings on the popular herbal
supplement at the International Conference on Integrative Medicine,
which begins Friday in Seattle. The three-day conference has
attracted more than 100 speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea is perhaps the world's top-selling herbal supplement.
Many people ingest the herb to fight symptoms of colds or flu, and
countless others take it as a preventive measure to ward off
respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have hinted at the herb's lack of preventive
value, but no studies had yet shown anything to indicate it might
actually increase the risk of illness.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that echinacea isn't effective for treating
symptoms once you're already sick, Calabrese emphasized. But it
does appear to be worse than useless as a preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were somewhat surprising,'' he said. ``The
take-home message is you should be very clear about what you're
doing with a botanical and not just take these things
willy-nilly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Integrative Medicine conference, featuring some of the
biggest names in the field of alternative or complementary
medicine, aims to do more than present a promotional smorgasbord of
anything and everything marketed as ``natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers want to chart a path for integrating different
therapeutic disciplines with traditional medicine based on solid
evidence of effectiveness and a common dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the term `alternative' medicine,'' said Bruce Takata,
conference director.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed, he said, ``is more and better information'' that
provides consumers with all legitimate options in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Calabrese, who is scheduled to speak Friday, is a pretty
hard-nosed guy for someone who dabbles in herbs. He demands
evidence before he'll endorse a therapy, which is why a major
European manufacturer of echinacea asked him to conduct a clinical
study at Bastyr on the herb's effectiveness for preventing
respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results certainly surprised the heck out of the sponsor,''
Calabrese said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's been in negotiations with the manufacturer, which
he declined to identify, over publication of his findings. The
company didn't want the results published, but Bastyr's research
policies assure publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are founded on the concept of science and evidence-based
natural medicine,'' said Dr. Joe Pizzorno, a naturopathic physician
and Bastyr's president. ``We have to publish our findings.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Pizzorno said, no manufacturer would be happy with
such results. He said the institution has lost other sponsors and
donors in the past because of studies that failed to support a
product's health claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to sell as much of their products as possible, of
course,'' Pizzorno said. Negative results can make companies less
willing to support research, he said, which is also true for the
pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Bastyr's credibility and mission of promoting scientific
evaluation of alternative therapies is more important than any one
funding source, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bastyr, based in the Seattle suburb of Kenmore, is the only
non-traditional institution in the United States to receive a
research grant from the National Institutes of Health's National
Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Pizzorno said the value of this week's Integrative Medicine
conference is in recognizing that there's a need for the
traditional and alternative medical camps to help consumers
separate the wheat from the chaff and incorporate the best aspects
of both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to take more charge of their own health,''
said Dr. John Potter, head of cancer prevention at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. ``I don't believe in the
standard dichotomy of traditional medicine vs. alternative
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Look carefully enough at the history of medicine and the
development of pharmaceuticals, Potter said, and you'll often find
at its root the ancient use of herbs or a healing practice based on
folk wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Most people now accept that diet and health are linked, he said,
which is what he will be talking about at the Integrative Medicine
conference. But such acceptance hasn't translated into more people
living healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-third of all cancer deaths today are caused by
inappropriate diets,'' Potter said. ``Smoking likely causes another
30 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply knowing that doesn't prevent cancer, he said. It's clear
that most people would rather take a pill than make the dietary and
lifestyle changes needed to prevent disease, Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect magic bullets to solve their problems,'' he
said, and much of our focus in biomedical science today is on
developing pills to treat illness rather than on encouraging
healthy lifestyle changes.
</P>
<P>
   Pizzorno agreed, noting that this mind-set extends into the
alternative medical community as well. Vitamins, herbal capsules
and food supplements, he said, are just more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of what's being pushed today is simply substituting
green drugs for synthetic drugs,'' Pizzorno said.
</P>
<P>
   Pizzorno and Potter said they hope the Integrative Medicine
conference helps foster a dialogue that promotes a new way of
thinking about health.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have today in health care is an end-stage treatment
system,'' Pizzorno said. ``We're still not dealing with the
underlying problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter agreed, but said there are too many untested remedies and
theories out there promoting themselves as the best way to cure or
prevent disease. Every claim needs to be tested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to agree on the rules of science,'' Potter said.

EX-GANG MEMBER NOW HELPS TROUBLED YOUNGSTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ For as long as he can remember, a blue scarf
has always symbolized freedom for Chandy May.
</P>
<P>
   Blue represents hope and empowerment for thousands of Cambodian
refugees _ those like May who made it to the United States and
those who vanished in the Mekong Delta before escaping the Khmer
Rouge, represented by red.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday, May arrives at a modest office at the East Bay
Asian Youth Center, a nonprofit organization in Oakland that
provides after-school and adult education programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, he has placed a scarf with a blue checker design
over a colorful painting of Angkor Wat, the ancient temple capital
of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   After years behind bars because of gang-related crimes, May now
helps neighborhood youngsters succeed in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me so long to figure out what to do in life,'' said
May, 30, a bilingual counselor at the youth center, who came to the
United States in 1983. ``I don't want these young kids to follow in
my footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   May, fellow Cambodian San Sun and 27 volunteer tutors from the
University of California at Berkeley help 20 teen-age boys improve
academically in an after-school tutoring program.
</P>
<P>
   As program counselors, May and Sun pick students up at their
schools in the afternoon. For more than 4 years, May and Sun have
sat side by side with students from regional high schools in a
simple classroom with steel chairs and conference tables.
</P>
<P>
   Besides help with homework, students get plenty of lessons in
life to keep them from street crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``May forced me to try harder,'' said Kevin Chea, a 10th-grader
at Oakland High School. For two years, Chea has spent almost two
hours a day at the center doing homework. He said his 1.0 grade
average has climbed to 2.3, and he is working hard to raise it to
3.0. Chea wants to study Asian history at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Staying out of trouble is not easy. Some in the program are
still active street gang members; seven are on probation for past
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   May and Sun said they sometimes have to find students who are
cutting class, smoking marijuana or gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The students involved in the program say they can trust May
because of his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   May's path to his current job was a rocky one. At age 14, he
arrived in Oakland with his mother and other relatives. Seeing the
lights of San Francisco from the airplane window, May thought his
future would be as bright as the glittering scene below.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be as bad as watching his father shot to death by
the Khmer Rouge, the communist rebels who seized control of
Cambodia in 1975 and ruled it ruthlessly four nearly 4 years.
Nothing could be as bad as creeping around the land-mined woods
through tangled branches and trees, for endless miles, to reach
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But life in America wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old had to enroll in elementary school because he
had no formal education in Cambodia. His black friends at Oakland's
Horace Mann School taught him to speak English. He also found a
mentor at the nearby Mormon temple.
</P>
<P>
   In Boy Scout Troop 316, led by his mentor, May befriended many
Cambodians, including Sun, seven years younger, who became his
``little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the mentor left after two years, returning to Salt Lake
City, things began to change. He fought with Khmer, Hispanic and
black gang members. Eventually, May and some of his friends became
the Oakland Town Crips, a Cambodian gang.
</P>
<P>
   May recalls styling his hair slick and driving around in gaudy
cars with pretty girls. The cars were affordable through his
drug-dealing profits. He marched through neighborhoods in
loose-fitting pants and blue shirts.
</P>
<P>
   May became addicted to making money from gang activities, and
lost his incentive to stay at school. Committing crimes for petty
cash became a way of life. He dropped out of school in seventh
grade. Sun, an eighth-grade honor student, never made it to high
school.
</P>
<P>
   What ensued were lots of fights, lots of friends killed, lots of
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was looking for ways not to have to go back
in (to jail) again,'' said David Kakishiba, executive director of
the East Bay Asian Youth Center, who first met May in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard his reputation as a leader on the streets. A leader on
the streets could also be a leader at the youth center,'' Kakishiba
said.
</P>
<P>
   For May, the center was, at first, just a way out. But for
Kakishiba, it was a way to help hundreds of neighborhood teen-agers
get back on track. Kakishiba recruited May to be a peer counselor
in charge of youth outreach and retention. It became May's first
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a teen-ager, nobody, not in my family, not in
school, helped me to do my homework,'' May said. ``I talked to
nobody but gangsters. My role model was a gangster. But David
talked to me, and I thought, `That man really cares.'''
</P>
<P>
   After learning that his girlfriend was pregnant, May said he was
struck by a sudden revelation: ``I thought, `What if I got locked
up in jail again and get killed from gang bang?' My kid will have
to grow up without his father, like me. I didn't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kakishiba said May, now married and a father, had gone through
an incredible transition. But he has to face pressure from old
gangster friends criticizing him for being soft and weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job that is much more difficult than people even think
it is,'' Kakishiba said. ``Just coming from the streets does not
mean you can do this job.''

IN QUEST TO EXPLAIN SCHOOL MASSACRE, EVIL STANDS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Evil. The word seems archaic, a remnant of a
time when unsophisticated society was focused on such matters as
new frontiers and omnipotent deities.
</P>
<P>
   Whether evil is rooted in the human fiber or whether
environmental influence accounts for its malignant surges is a
debate as old as humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, amid the carnage at a Colorado high school, the
issue arose again.
</P>
<P>
   Was evil there on April 20, homicidally stalking the hallways of
Columbine High School in suburban Denver, spraying terror from the
hands of two teen-age misfits in black trench coats? Or was the
carnage instead the lethal distillation of a troubled subculture
unraveled by teen-age paranoia and societal breakdowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so mind-blowing you want to find an explanation for
it,'' said Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute think
tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   To some analysts, the murderous rampage of Eric Harris, 18, and
Dylan Klebold, 17 _ who killed 13 people, wounded a score of others
and planted a minefield of booby traps before turning their weapons
on themselves _ was an act less of youthful disaffection than of
baldfaced evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an evil intent,'' Bandow said. ``They were old enough
to have some responsibility for it. In the end they had control.
We've seen that face of evil before, we've seen it in Hitler and
Stalin, in Milosevic, in petty dictators. What makes this so
shocking is it is the face of kids. You don't expect to see evil on
the face of the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, casting a wide blanket of condemnation, blame a culture
grown increasingly numb to extraordinary violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've depersonalized violence; we accept it into our homes
easily,'' said Michael Kelleher, who studied school killings in his
book ``When Good Kids Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence seems more acceptable,'' Kelleher said. ``I think
that is evil. Any time we dehumanize these acts, any time we
diminish the impact of violence, we participate in evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Society is tantalized by the possibilities of wickedness,
whether portrayed on the pages of a novel or in movie images or in
the jolting lyrics of profane shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the sinister cacophony facing society today is an
increase in digital spatter.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold represent the first generation to grow up
exposed not only to graphic violence on the cinema and television
screens, but to a daily diet of on-line gore. In one highly popular
genre of games, the aim of simulated combat scenes is to kill _
continuously and as violently as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris was known to be a passionate player of these games,
to the point of apparently designing his own blueprints for a game
that features a trail of marauding creatures, some human, some
alien.
</P>
<P>
   Some counselors believe that chronic exposure to such
head-blasting interactivity desensitizes players to the reality of
actual death.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games are teaching kids about a stance to take in the
world,'' said Carl Goldberg, a New York psychoanalyst and author of
``Speaking With the Devil: Exploring Senseless Acts of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like gunslingers in the Old West, these games involve waiting
for someone to draw on. Kids are prepped to attack, and anyone can
be drawn into the deadly psychodrama.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The night of the Columbine massacre, Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder
and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, was
scheduled to give a lecture on the durable nature of evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil has great resiliency, if you leave a little crack in the
door, it will always come in,'' Hier said. ``Nobody who predicted
the end of evil has ever been correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Wiesenthal Center, searching six months ago
through Web sites posted by hate groups, came upon Harris' America
Online site. While they did not report the site to the police
because it did not trigger particular alarms, Wiesenthal officials
believe the teen-age gunmen were influenced by hate-mongering on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Taunted and ostracized by their peers, the two young men had
apparently forged a twisted kinship with Nazism, and may have
chosen the timing of their campus blitzkrieg to commemorate
Hitler's 110th birthday on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who sometimes walked the corridors of school clad in
German insignia and steel-toed combat boots, was fond of
techno-Nazi music and conversed in German with Klebold, his
``Trench Coat Mafia'' cohort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that in the warped minds of those two young men
spraying bullets and bombs they were getting rid of evil,'' Hier
said. ``Humans have a capacity to justify evil, to say people are
mean to us therefore we have the right to slaughter them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we live on planet Earth, evil will be a component
of life. It is part of being a human being.''

tackling organized crime of a different sort. This working-class

Cicero _ and punish them if they return, even to visit their

 &HT;    ShortTakes: Saved by Joe Bob Crowley
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was little that was new as a portrait emerged of life at
Columbine High in Littleton, Colo. There were good kids, doing what
good kids always do, working hard, enjoying life, dreaming of the
future. Then there were the others.
</P>
<P>
   What has dominated the news is life among the others in the
substrata beneath, a complex world of uncertainty, anger and cruel
social distinctions. Only weapons of mass destruction are new.
</P>
<P>
   At James S. Hogg Junior High in Houston, I was one of the
others. I wanted to be a hero. I settled for invisibility. As a
badge of my relentless otherness, I had become a hall monitor,
among the most despised of Hogg's underclasses. I flaunted the
infinitesimal power that came with the job. I picked a fight with a
kid who had no hall pass. Then Joe Bob Crowley wandered by, a
visitor from the upper world.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bob Crowley was what we now call a student leader. There is
a Yiddish word for Joe Bob Crowley. Joe Bob Crowley was a mensch;
it means what every person ought to be -- just, measured, decent.
He may not have known this, people like that frequently don't. He
settled the fight in a minute and walked on. I would like to be
like that, I thought for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe Bob Crowley was given the American Legion Award, the
highest to a student, I cheered. Cheering for someone felt good.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Joe Bob Crowley.

COMPANY SHOOTS FOR `MIDDLE OFFICE' EFFICIENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN BERGER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A business takes orders through its front office
_ a sales force, a Web site, a storefront. It delivers the order
through its back office _ a warehouse, a delivery truck, an
invoice.
</P>
<P>
   CSE Systems Corp. of San Francisco is targeting what it calls
the middle office with a new software product, the Cibon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap between taking an order and processing an order,
between a service request and the administration of a service,
between a bid's specifications and the selection of a supplier, is
truly an automation gap that has not been filled until now,'' said
Shirish Hardikar, president and chief executive of CSE Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle office would be order fulfillment, which means getting
the product together for delivery,'' Hardikar said.
</P>
<P>
   The middle office can encompass a number of different functions,
depending on the type of business: scheduling deliveries or
installations, keeping inventory in stock, ordering parts and raw
materials, handling customer complaints, regulatory and standards
compliance, or bid management.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses handle these tasks using computer programs and
technology tools that have been especially designed for that
business. Others use off-the-shelf database and spreadsheet systems
like Microsoft Office or Lotus Notes. But proprietary systems can
be expensive and complicated, and off-the-shelf ones aren't always
flexible enough to handle special demands.
</P>
<P>
   So CSE, a division of the Austrian company CSE Systems GmbH,
developed the Cibon product, which consists of server and client
software, a graphics-driven tool for organizing information, and
Cibon Developer, a Java-based setup allowing businesses to
customize the suite to meet its special needs.
</P>
<P>
   With proprietary systems, it can be tricky to make changes. With
Cibon, the ability to make changes is part of the package, Hardikar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Such tools aren't cheap. The Cibon Suite starts at $15,000 for a
basic 25-user system (packages include service and training). But
the cost savings, he said, come from the fact that the system is
designed for easy customization and a range of capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage is built-in capabilities to enable changes to be
implemented on a continuous basis, without disrupting the system,''
Hardikar said.
</P>
<P>
   Cibon runs on a variety of platforms and interacts with many
off- the-shelf systems, such as Oracle, Microsoft Outlook and Lotus
Notes. It's designed to fit into a company's existing system for
handling front and back office operations.
</P>
<P>
   The package has been on the market for a few months. The
privately held company doesn't disclose sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   CSE is targeting industries with complex order fulfillment
processes, like telecommunications and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a company like Amazon.com, taking an order by Web or phone
for a book, it immediately goes to the back office for invoicing
and shipping,'' Hardikar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're AT&AMP;T and someone places an order for all the
telecommunications lines and equipment for a new office building,
you don't immediately ship it and start the billing. Phone lines
have to be laid, service technicians have to install the lines,
some equipment has to be built-to-order, phones have to be
delivered, traffic has to be monitored, regulatory approvals might
be needed before you can dig trenches to lay the line. All those
activities are performed by many departments and divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such coordination between departments is especially important in
areas like banking, large retail operations or agricultural
businesses. But Hardikar said the biggest area for growth was
telecommunications, where deregulation has led to the creation of
hundreds of new companies.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ In a rare sign of dissent within
Yugoslavia's leadership Monday, Yugoslav Deputy Premier Vuk
Draskovic, appearing on local television Sunday, called on state
leaders to stop lying to the people of Serbia. He said the people
should be told that world opinion is against them _ an apparent
reference to state propaganda boosting anti-NATO feelings.
Draskovic, considered a moderate and once the main opposition
leader, said Yugoslavia should accept a U.N. force in Kosovo and
allow the return of ethnic Albanian refugees. His comments, along
with the three U.U. POW's being seen by the Red Cross and alleged
visit the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other clerics, may provide a new
opening for a diplomatic way to end the bombing _ now in its 34th
day. Developments. (Deans, Cox News Service). 30.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ KUKES, Albania _ Ethnic Albanian refugees

shields by Serbian soldiers at an ammunition depot in Kosovo.

FUN SITES TO VISIT ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Let's begin this week with a few interesting, helpful
and fun Web sites to check out:
</P>
<P>
   - The respected ``National Geographic'' magazine now has a daily
news site. You can find it at www.ngnews.com. In addition to news,
the site offers several cool features, including a ``Map Machine''
that allows users to tap into the magazine's archive of famous
maps. The service is great, especially for kids working on school
projects.
</P>
<P>
   - Can't get enough of television shows like ``This Old House''?
Now you can experience similar content on the Web. American
Homestyle and Garden is sponsoring Dream Home 2000, a home-building
project in Santa Monica, Calif. Visitors to the related Web site
can follow the construction, view plans and take a chance at
winning prizes. The site is at www.dreamhome2000.com/index2.htm.
</P>
<P>
   - Are you bored? Check out Bill's Games, a Web site that
features a ton of online games for the whole family. The site
offers poker, tic-tac-toe, brain teasers, word scrambles, mazes and
a bunch more. And all the games work whether you connect with a
standard personal computer or WebTV. Find it all at
www.billsgames.com.
</P>
<P>
   - Still hung up on the area code changes? You're not alone. Many
computer users are getting frustrated trying to change all their
online access numbers to reflect the new codes. One site that might
be of help is at www.pamlico.net/changing.htm. The site features
step-by-step instructions for changing dial-up settings in Windows
95 and 98.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't check this one out if you're having trouble falling
asleep at night: ``Nova,'' the popular PBS television series has a
special report online dubbed Bombing of America. It's all about
bombers terrorizing the country and how science is helping law
enforcement officials fight back. Find it at
www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/bombing.
</P>
<P>
   - I'm mad at myself for mentioning this one: Animated Virtual
Beanie Babies. Yep. If you haven't had enough of the real thing,
check out this Web site. Find it at www.virtualbeaniebabies.com.
</P>
<P>
   - Here's a silly one: Some folks have put up a Web site asking
visitors to send them $1. Just for the heck of it. It's an
experiment to see how much money they will make. I'm not suggesting
you send them money, but they're supposed to post results at
mailadollar.com. Might be interesting to see what happens. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Psst, wanna grape iMac? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apple loyalists will be pleased to note that iMacs and the
latest Power Macintosh G3 systems continue to sell well.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be a bit of controversy over color when it
comes to the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, Apple's first iMacs were a shade of translucent
blue. Since then, the company has expanded the number of available
colors to five: strawberry, blueberry, grape, tangerine and lime.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seem to love the color selection, but some retailers
are miffed that they can't get Apple to sell them more of one color
than another. Apple's policy is to distribute all colors of iMacs
in equal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ZDNet reported that Best Buy Inc. has stopped selling
iMacs until it can sort things out with Apple. Apparently, Best
Buy's customers favor certain colors, leaving the retailer's
shelves full of iMacs with less popular tones.
</P>
<P>
   Just what colors are hot? That seems to vary from city to city.
Generally, grape and blueberry are the most popular and strawberry
and tangerine are the least popular. &QL; 
Streaming video? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer has released QuickTime 4.0 for both the Macintosh
and Windows platforms. You can find it at
www.apple.com/quicktime/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice, and works a bit better than version 3.0. The
interface has been jazzed up, adding features such as balance
control for volume.
</P>
<P>
   I downloaded and installed version 4.0 last week. It works fine.
But I don't see much difference (other than the interface) between
this new QuickTime and my copy of RealPlayer Plus G2, the latest
from Seattle-based Real-Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm not sure why makers of these video players keep
trying so hard. None of us will ever enjoy using these products
until somebody does something to improve the Internet bandwidth
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Have you tried watching streaming video lately? They've been
attempting this feat for years now, and it still looks like the
video equivalent of shortwave radio from Kosovo _ scratchy, jumpy
images disconnected from the audio. &QL; 
Faster, faster, faster! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Go on, admit it. You're tired of your 56 kilobit-per-second
modem. You think it's too slow. You've heard whispers that faster
access is available, and you want to know more.
</P>
<P>
   You're in luck. ``PC'' magazine's online site
(www.zdnet.com/pcmag/) has an article reviewing three of the latest
high-speed access technologies: cable modems, ADSL and satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the reviewers concluded that cable modems provide
the fastest, most cost-efficient way of surfing the Web. ADSL comes
in second, providing somewhat slower service. Satellite hookups
fell to third, with reviewers pointing out that satellite
connections still require the use of a telephone line and standard
modem.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's in the water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We've still got eight months of 1999 remaining, but my e-mail
box is already beginning to collect humorous lists of the top
reasons why we're supposedly tired of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the funnier reasons:
</P>
<P>
   - You recently tried to enter a password on your microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   - You haven't played Solitaire with a real deck of cards in
years.
</P>
<P>
   - You chat several times a day with a stranger in South Africa,
but you haven't spoken to your next-door-neighbor yet this year.
</P>
<P>
   - You have a list of 15 telephone numbers to reach your family
of three.
</P>
<P>
   - You get excited when Saturday arrives because it's the one day
your are allowed to wear sweat pants to work.
</P>
<P>
   - You need a PowerPoint presentation to explain what you do for
a living.
</P>
<P>
   - You consider second-day air delivery as painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   - You have trouble staying in touch with some relatives because
they don't have e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   - You didn't give your spouse a Valentine's Day card this year,
but you found the time to post one for your buddies on your Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   - Your daily ``to do'' list includes bathroom breaks _ but you
never seem to get them crossed off. &QL;

I'D WRITE THIS COLUMN FOR A SONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Used to be the best unrealistic goal most newspaper
columnists could hope for was winning the Pulitzer Prize or seeing
a compilation top the ``New York Times'' bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Schmich has changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   Now a columnist can futilely yearn to write a pop hit as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schmich is a columnist for the ``Chicago Tribune.'' Her name may
not be familiar, but the novelty hit ``Everybody's Free (to Wear
Sunscreen)'' probably is. Schmich wrote the ``lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of. She actually wrote a column, in June 1997, in which she
offered graduates life advice in an imaginary commencement address.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful column, full of the offbeat, simple wisdom
that's so hard to come by, things such as, ``Do not read beauty
magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.'' And, ``Don't mess
too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look
85.''
</P>
<P>
   (The column wound up as one of the first Internet urban legends;
it showed up online credited erroneously to Kurt Vonnegut as a
commencement address he delivered at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.)
</P>
<P>
   Australian movie director Baz Luhrmann read the column and
contacted Schmich and the ``Tribune'' about licensing her words for
an album he was making. Australian voice actor Lee Perry read the
column over a dance track, and ``Everybody's Free (to Wear
Sunscreen)'' was born. &QL; 
Pass the M&AMP;M's
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why should Schmich have all the fun? Why couldn't another
columnist _ let's say, for the sake of argument, me _ hitch a ride
on this gravy train?
</P>
<P>
   What's Schmich's secret?
</P>
<P>
   I asked her these questions by e-mail and received a prompt
response:
</P>
<P>
   ``My only secret is: lots of coffee, lots of M&AMP;M's and a
deadline. That combination was the muse that gave birth to this odd
little hit. I hope you understand that I am drowning in sunscreen
stuff and can barely get my own column written three times a week,
so I'll have to leave it to you to answer the rest of your
questions. A bag of M&AMP;M's will help. Honest.''
</P>
<P>
   (After I e-mailed thanks, she sent another quick reply at no
extra charge: ``By the way, I went to high school in Phoenix, as
did all my seven brothers and sisters. I went to the defunct
Gerard, the others went variously to East, Arcadia and Brophy. I
mention this only because it's the kind of local-angle detail I
would want if I were writing a column.'')
</P>
<P>
   The deadlines I've got. But the M&AMP;M's haven't worked so far, and
I've never had a cup of coffee in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing I write will ever be confused with Kurt Vonnegut except
for maybe grocery lists (and his probably include coffee), so a
wacky Internet misunderstanding is out.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not discouraged. Instead, I've set my sights on marrying
other writers with well-known tunes. I may not have written a jot
or tittle, but a steady stream of royalties would offer some
comfort. &QL; 
Odd couplings
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting George Will to a Rage Against the Machine song might
work _ not only would it make his points more forcefully, but it
would make reading them feel less like reading a thesaurus. Maureen
Dowd over a Nine Inch Nails track perhaps? It would put the
bitterness into context.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Barry set to ``Stairway to Heaven''? Molly Ivins and ``All
My Exes Live in Texas''? Tony Kornheiser and, naturally, Korn?
</P>
<P>
   Nah. The best fit I've found so far couples the tune from Bob
Dylan's ``Subterranean Homesick Blues'' with these words, written
long ago by Robert Benchley (please sing along):
</P>
<P>
   ``A great many people have come up to me and asked me how I
manage to get so much work done and still keep looking so
dissipated. My answer is, `Don't you wish you knew?' And a pretty
good answer it is, too, when you consider that nine times out of 10
I didn't hear the original question.''
</P>
<P>
   Needs work, granted. But remember, when Benchley was writing
there wasn't any sunscreen. &QL;

   PODGORICA _ Montenegro is a country of breathtaking vistas.
Massive black mountains, streaked with snow, falling into endless
blue chasms, fade into the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been a swashbuckling, Byronesque sort of place,
home to princes, smugglers, poets and, latterly, to a stalwart band
of down-to-earth democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For, amazingly, Montenegro _ poorest, smallest and most feudal
of the six republics that once made up federal Yugoslavia, and now
the only one left in it beside Serbia _ is the last oasis of sanity
in the war-torn Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it too may soon be dragged into the quagmire. Threats of a
bloody coup hang in the air. Air-raid sirens pierce the nocturnal
quiet. Each time, as the NATO bombers pass over, a little more of
President Milo Djukanovic's political life force ebbs away. Which
is exactly what Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic wants.
</P>
<P>
   For Djukanovic's statelet stands for everything Milosevic hates.
It wants him out. It refuses to declare war on countries in NATO.
It opposes Yugoslavia's heralded union with Russia. It upholds a
fragile, pro-western democracy and a free press, offering
devolution and amity to its own ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's fall would almost certainly make blood flow. And it
would end the democracy Montenegrins have nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   But the republic is already bitterly divided. Most of its
southerners still back Djukanovic and dream of independence. The
north is for Milosevic. Any civil war would be fratricidal and
ideological as well as regional.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Neno Lopicic and Nikola Bogdanovic. Playing
frisbee in the rain outside the old royal palace in Cetinje, they
are best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Both are 19, speak passable English, sport American baseball
caps. But Neno is for Milosevic, a Greater Serbia and a Slav union
with Russia. Nikola, named for Montenegro's last king, is for Bill
Clinton and Montenegrin independence.
</P>
<P>
   Neno would like to see the whites of an American soldier's eyes;
Nikola boasts how his father went to prison for seeking
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Both lads say they would never take up arms against each other,
yet both say they would happily die for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Such passion scares most of the country's politicians stiff.
``Independence is not worth the life of a single Montenegrin,''
says Branko Perovic, its foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has other ideas _ but is too chastened, for now, to
put them into practice. ``He cannot afford two fronts,'' says a
hopeful Montenegrin minister. ``But as soon as Kosovo quiets down,
he will turn his guns on us.''
</P>
<P>
   A dissident Montenegro is bad enough for Milosevic; an
independent one, home to Yugoslavia's navy, would be unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   So he has put a tough general in charge of the 10,000 or so
federal troops stationed in the republic, muzzled its voice in the
federal parliament, and tried (so far in vain) to silence its
annoyingly lively press.
</P>
<P>
   If it came to a fight, Djukanovic might well go down with guns
blazing. He controls 8,000 well-trained special police, who have so
far fended off a coup by Milosevic's friends.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar stalemate _ a kind of dual sovereignty _ prevails.
While foreign journalists are safe on Djukanovic's turf, once in
federal army territory they risk being beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian nationalism has already cost Montenegro dearly. Tourism
and legal commerce are dead, the republic's merchant fleet stuck in
port. This year's planned budget of $300 million is but a pipe
dream. No tax is being collected. The war is said to cost an extra
$18 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, 22,000 people lived in Ulcinj, a beach resort. Now
45,000 do. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of destitute Kosovar
Albanians line the promenade. Nearby, scores of refugees bed down
in a tiny whitewashed mosque. The air is fetid. They have just one
open latrine, one tap.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro now hosts 55,000 Kosovo refugees, along with another
25,000 from the wars in Croatia and Bosnia _ some 15 percent of its
current population.
</P>
<P>
   Without outside help, they, or Milosevic, may sink Djukanovic _
and Montenegro. &QL;

A POSTMODERN PRIMER: BUZZ WORD DEFINES OUR TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(ADV: Editor's note: ``Postmodern'' _ the buzzword of the past 20
years. It started in the arts, spread to academe and now shows up
in virtually every form of popular culture. So what does it mean _
really mean? Republic art critic Richard Nilsen hashes it out.  
Postmodernism in art _ Can you know yourself too well? 
Postmodernism at large _ Is your whole life a media event? 
Postmodernism's fate _ Does anything so now have a future?) 
 
 ByRICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The ground has shifted under our feet and the world
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   At least, the way we see it has changed, as the century comes to
a weary close. The shift was first noticed in the art world, and
for the past 30 years, art has illustrated this change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, architect and critic Charles Jencks appropriated the
term ``Postmodernism'' to describe the change. He used it mainly to
describe a new type of architecture freed from the boring
restraints of Modernism's International Style: Those steel and
glass monoliths that hover like tombstones over all of the world's
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Postmodern architecture was freed from its purity and
puritanism. The new architects said, in essence, ``Anything goes,''
and they found ways to make buildings fun again. Architects used
ornament again, and borrowed freely from all the styles of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Even architect Philip Johnson, who had been a high priest of the
International Style, signed on to the Postmodernist shift when he
designed, in 1979, the AT&AMP;T Building in New York, and capped it
with a roofline that borrowed the scalloped cutout that tops a
Chippendale highboy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, architects see no reason not to add Greek columns to Aztec
pyramids, or design a building that looks as if it is falling down.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, you can see a mild version of the new style in the
silly ``crown'' that tops the new City Hall, and the vaguely
soap-bar shape of the former Dial building on Central Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But the word has a wider significance in the art world, and has
become the term of choice for all the new paintings, sculpture and
video and computer art made since the petering out of Pop Art and
Minimalism in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   You are seeing Postmodern art when you see:
</P>
<P>
   _Jenny Holzer's purposefully banal sayings _ ``Abuse of power
comes as no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   _Barbara Kruger's feminist posters, loaded with political anger
_ ``Your body is a battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   _Jeff Koons' stainless steel cartoon bunny rabbit imitating a
silver mylar party balloon.
</P>
<P>
   _Cindy Sherman posing herself in imitation of Hollywood
publicity stills.
</P>
<P>
   _Mark Tansey's mock-heroic comic grisaille paintings of such
cultural happenings as ``The Triumph of the New York School,''
which shows the New York Abstract Expressionists as field generals
in a World War I battle scene.
</P>
<P>
   _Bruce Nauman's ``Clown Torture,'' an irritating videotape of a
clown laughing hysterically while telling a pointless story that
repeats itself endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   It is all just a big jumble, and styles are mere menu items.
</P>
<P>
   When we were first deluged with Postmodern imagery, it was
confusing. We couldn't really tell what the new art was about. It
seemed to go off in so many directions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the trends written about as Postmodern are:
</P>
<P>
   _A breakdown of the wall that once divided high art from popular
art, high culture from low culture.
</P>
<P>
   _The denial of a coherent historical narrative.
</P>
<P>
   _A call for diversity.
</P>
<P>
   _An increase in political and social content.
</P>
<P>
   _An emphasis on non-traditional materials, including video.
</P>
<P>
   _A hefty reliance on ``text,'' whether in the form of actual
words included in the picture, or on the reading of imagery as
though it (begin ital) were (end ital) words. (The latter comes to
us under the Postmodern category of ``deconstruction.'')
</P>
<P>
   _The proliferation of art-historical references in the art.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these trends even seem to contradict each other: There
is both a suspicion of irony and an ironical use of art's past: On
one hand, New Age art (one branch of Postmodernism) is laden with
sincerity and on the other, Jeff Koons makes an in-joke using
Michael Jackson and the Elgin Marbles.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot of very different things all going on at once. No
single artist embodies all these directions, but no serious artist
is immune to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   But, a ``metalogic'' for all these diverse strands of
Postmodernism is beginning to come clear. What they all have in
common is an increased self-awareness, a kind of hyper
self-consciousness that lets nothing happen without being
controlled, understood and interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, all art is now an in-joke and both artists and
audiences have to ``get it.''
</P>
<P>
   New Age Postmodern art brings Jungian archetype to the surface,
making conscious what had formerly functioned as unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Koons makes us aware of the kitsch that surrounds us.
</P>
<P>
   Kruger makes us aware of the hidden sexism in art history.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Estes makes us aware of the intense artificiality of
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The artists all are aware of how each medium of art distorts
reality and creates its own meaning. They are so interested in the
distortion, they leave the reality behind. Many even deny the
existence of a common reality. They are aware of the distortion and
revel in it.
</P>
<P>
   Postmodernism began as a revolt against Modern Art. Modern Art _
now more than a century old _ began with Impressionism and
continued seemlessly up to Minimalism. Modern Art was interested in
the reality of pigment, marble, design, shapes _ all the means of
the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Modern art was a break with the art that came before it.
Postmodern art was seen as a break with the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more, it is seeming like the culmination of
Modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Modernism was concerned with paint or stone, not with love or
poverty. It was art about itself, not art about life. Modern
artists wrote continually of their concern for the interplay of
colors, line, form and shape.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the central metaphor of art had shifted. Where a
canvas was seen before 1870 as a stand-in for a window we looked
through, after then, it became a screen we looked at. Where the
Baroque painter showed us a horse or a tree, the Modern painter
showed us a blue or a circle. The window went opaque. The real
world ceased to have much importance. The medium became the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this explanation simplifies what in reality was much
more complex, but it catches the central thrust of Modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Postmodernism is a removal one step further in the
window-metaphor. Where the modern artist no longer cared if it were
a tree or a football in the painting, but only if it were brush
strokes and paint, the Postmodernist no longer cares if it is brush
strokes and paint: He has pulled back even further into words and
ideas about the art.
</P>
<P>
   The opacity begins now not at the canvas-window, but with a pair
of eyeglasses, sooted over with self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   So that what matters is neither tree, nor canvas, but what is in
the mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biting of the apple in Eden: Before, Eve and Adam were
unself-conscious, doing what they did spontaneously. After the
bite, everything they came to know only interfered with the simple
living they were born to.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Hamlet suddenly became aware of playing a part in a
play.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, artists worked in a style and hardly knew it. Their
style was merely either the common aesthetic language of the age,
or, as Hemingway once put it, the sum total of all an artist's
shortcomings. Style happened.
</P>
<P>
   But Postmodernism has bitten the fruit of the tree of knowledge
of style.
</P>
<P>
   And Hamlet, knowing it is a play, breaks out in a song and
dance.
</P>
<P>
   In Postmodernism, style is the very point. You consciously
``choose a style'' and work in it, make fun of it, show its hidden
meanings.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of all this awareness, though, is a loss of connection
with the experience of life.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the story is for next week. &QL;

<P>
   It is not quite the birthday party they planned. Whether NATO's
leaders issue a lot of grand policy statements at this weekend's
50th-anniversary summit (as the American hosts would like), or only
a few (as some Europeans hope), they are in danger of making fools
of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Such documents will be consigned to history's proverbial scrap
heap unless the allies can convince themselves, their adversaries
and the rest of the world that some dignified conclusion to their
Balkan entanglement is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are not wrong to step back briefly from their large,
and growing, local difficulties and ask themselves what the war
with Serbia means in the light of NATO's 50-year history, its
declared aims and its future, if indeed it has one.
</P>
<P>
   Those last five words are, unfortunately, a necessary
qualification. If it is true that NATO's relative success in Bosnia
boosted its morale and affirmed its usefulness after the Soviet
collapse, then it is necessary at least to ask what a failure now
in Kosovo would mean.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such a failure would have ominous implications for the
alliance. Perhaps it would not mean outright death, given that the
allies would still presumably want to defend each other's soil.
</P>
<P>
   But limping home from Kosovo would certainly oblige NATO to
rethink its post-Cold-War aims of intervention not just for its
members' defense but also for the broader interests of
humanitarianism and international order. NATO might even go into
terminal decline.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, the perverse fragility of the defense pact
that faced down the mighty Soviet empire has already been exposed,
and not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the summer of 1995, when Britain and France, as
leaders of a hard-pressed U.N. mission in Bosnia, demanded _ and
only just got _ an American guarantee that they would not be left
alone to cope with an escalating war.
</P>
<P>
   None of the western diplomats who struggled through that crisis
has any doubt that NATO came within a hair's breadth of total
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   What was at stake then, and is again, was NATO's continuing
ability to live up to the lofty ideals laid out by the alliance's
founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington treaty that gave birth to NATO proclaimed, first,
a community of values in the founders' common heritage, based ``on
the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the signatories established a community of fate, by
pledging to consider ``an armed attack on one...as an attack on
all.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that community of fate which would have failed if America
had deserted its allies in Bosnia _ and will be put to a severe
test if land operations begin in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In different ways, the tragedy in Kosovo has also been a
challenge to the allies' declared common values, which have always
been viewed with a certain skepticism in places beyond Europe and
North America.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO had simply shrugged and done nothing as the Serbs
evicted tens of thousands of people in Kosovo, forcing at least
some of them to seek refuge in neighboring countries, NATO would
have looked cynical, irrelevant to security and stability in
Europe, and possibly for that reason doomed.
</P>
<P>
   And now, having tried _ so far with disastrous results _ to stop
the Serb atrocities by launching an air war, the alliance faces
widespread criticism around the world for failing to get a license
from the United Nations and thus breaking international law.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the countries that would have excoriated NATO for
indifference to the fate of persecuted Muslims are now deploring
the alliance as an international scofflaw and bully.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's hope of surviving the Kosovo crisis with head
held high will depend, among other things, on securing an outcome
which salvages some of the values it is built on.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it needs a settlement that guarantees the right
of as many as possible of the province's prewar residents to go
home and live there safely; and since this is inconceivable under
Slobodan Milosevic or the Kosovo Liberation Army, some sort of
international protectorate will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal results of NATO's bombing campaign have made this
harder to bring about. Even if America were to decide that NATO
must impose such a protectorate unilaterally by mounting a land
invasion of Kosovo, it is far from certain that its European allies
would agree.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, hard diplomatic, as well as military, work will be
needed to prepare the way for a ground presence in the killing
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious, but equally important, is the need for the
Washington summit to persist in explaining to other countries the
principles that guided NATO's decision to intervene in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity is not so much to prove that this was a ``just
cause'' _ countries will form their own conclusions about that _
but to reassure a suspicious world that NATO has not given itself
the right to attack sovereign nations at whim.
</P>
<P>
   However absurd that suspicion may seem to countries within NATO,
it has taken hold in places as far apart as China, India and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, there is nowhere else in Europe (leaving aside
ever-feuding Greece and Turkey) which has the same potential as
Kosovo to draw NATO into war.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other place in the continent which combines that
province's explosive ingredients: a population of at least 1.5
million, which has been ruled without consent by what it regards as
an alien and intolerably cruel authority _ plus an ample supply of
cheap weaponry, in a region whose terrain and weak institutions
make it almost impossible to police the flow of guns.
</P>
<P>
   So if the Kosovo conflict were solved, there would be a decent
chance of it being Europe's last war for a long time. Would it
therefore be NATO's last nondefensive war?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would, if the world can agree on how to take
collective action against despots, genocidal regimes and others who
commit intolerable atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Some kind of military force, maybe under the U.N., will surely
be needed if the sort of events seen in Rwanda five years ago are
in future to be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Better, certainly, that this should not be NATO. But better
perhaps, in some circumstances, even outside NATO's traditional
area, that it should be NATO than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other tasks await. Most of the original plans for the
summit to redirect and reinvigorate NATO _ new members, new
partnerships, new missions, and so on _ will have to be put aside
until the Balkan fires have been doused.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the new jobs that America envisages for the alliance
has suddenly become more urgent than ever: stemming the
proliferation of nonconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As they watch the punishment being meted out to Serbia, many a
tinpot dictator will be wondering whether the secret acquisition of
ballistic missiles, tipped with chemicals, germs or even nuclear
weapons, would not be the best way to avoid a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   It is far too soon for NATO to go out of business. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Masked men in strange uniforms moved methodically through the
school, firing semiautomatic weapons at students and teachers as
they went. They showed no mercy. When a student begged for her
life, one of the gunmen laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Such horrible scenes have been repeated over and over again
recently. But this particular atrocity was occurring not in Kosovo,
but in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-shootings in American schools are becoming a grotesque rite
of spring. Last March four girls and a teacher were shot to death
and ten people wounded when two boys, 11 and 13, opened fire at
their school in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   This week's two teenage murderers easily surpassed that toll.
The final number killed at the high school in Littleton remains to
be seen: 15 died on the spot, including the two murderers who took
their own lives, and many others are injured.
</P>
<P>
   What is most bizarre about America's spate of school shootings _
which have claimed 30 lives and scores of wounded over the past 18
months _ is not that they have occurred, but America's reaction to
them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the response to Littleton has been pretty much what it
was last year to the Jonesboro massacre: plenty of public
hand-wringing about moral decay and media violence.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last year, Bill Clinton has promised to fly in teams
of ``grief counsellors'' and has warned that there are plenty of
other potentially violent kids who are not being ``reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there have been further calls to beef up security at
schools. But these are all side issues, which have nothing to do
with what really distinguishes America from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Young people everywhere, like many of their elders, have violent
fantasies. Teaching teenagers to curb their angry impulses is a
challenge for every parent on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   If America is in moral decline, then so is most of the rest of
the world, which just as avidly consumes violent films and rock
videos. Mentally disturbed people anywhere can sometimes pose a
threat to others. And all schools, not just those in America,
remain vulnerable to someone looking for innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all rich countries, only America makes it possible for
teenage misfits, those nursing a grudge, the insane or anyone else
determined to cause mayhem to get their hands so easily on such a
terrifying array of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After a disgruntled Scoutmaster killed 16 nursery pupils and
their teacher at a school in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996, Britain
banned all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   After one man wielding a semiautomatic rifle murdered 35 people
in Tasmania the month after the Dunblane massacre, Australia
drastically tightened its gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response in America seems inconceivable. Years of bitter
debate about gun control have left America with ludicrously lax gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm violence which dwarfs the rate in other countries, and
repeated mass-shootings, have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious, well-financed lobbying by the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and other pro-gun groups has stymied efforts to
introduce any but the mildest of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to the Littleton shootings, Clinton can almost
be forgiven for not mentioning gun control. Most Americans are
weary of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   And yet America stands little chance of avoiding more
mass-shootings, or reducing its shocking level of lethal violence,
until it finds some way to agree on stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Outright bans may not be on the American agenda, but there
should be some way to restrict the circulation of at least the
automatic and semiautomatic weapons which feature so prominently in
massacres such as Littleton, and the increasingly powerful handguns
coming on to the market.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of hope. Gun-control advocates have switched
their attention from fruitless arguments about the Second Amendment
and personal choice, and are concentrating instead on guns as a
threat to public health.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they have chosen the wrong way to present this
argument _ through lawsuits against gun makers. But deployed in the
public arena and in legislatures, where the gun debate belongs,
such arguments might yet lower the political temperature far enough
to produce reasonable compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, against expectations, the tragedy at Littleton may also
mark a turning-point.
</P>
<P>
   Fortuitously, the NRA is scheduled to hold its annual convention
next week in Denver, a few miles from the school massacre. The
sight of NRA activists facing Littleton's angry and grieving people
to explain their unrelenting opposition to gun control of any kind
should make Americans pause.
</P>
<P>
   Such fundamentalism on guns is unreasonable, and has already
taken too high a toll. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Masked men in strange uniforms moved methodically through the
school, firing semiautomatic weapons at students and teachers as
they went. They showed no mercy. When a student begged for her
life, one of the gunmen laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Such horrible scenes have been repeated over and over again
recently. But this particular atrocity was occurring not in Kosovo,
but in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-shootings in American schools are becoming a grotesque rite
of spring. Last March four girls and a teacher were shot to death
and ten people wounded when two boys, 11 and 13, opened fire at
their school in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   This week's two teenage murderers easily surpassed that toll.
The final number killed at the high school in Littleton remains to
be seen: 15 died on the spot, including the two murderers who took
their own lives, and many others are injured.
</P>
<P>
   What is most bizarre about America's spate of school shootings _
which have claimed 30 lives and scores of wounded over the past 18
months _ is not that they have occurred, but America's reaction to
them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the response to Littleton has been pretty much what it
was last year to the Jonesboro massacre: plenty of public
hand-wringing about moral decay and media violence.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last year, Bill Clinton has promised to fly in teams
of ``grief counsellors'' and has warned that there are plenty of
other potentially violent kids who are not being ``reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there have been further calls to beef up security at
schools. But these are all side issues, which have nothing to do
with what really distinguishes America from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Young people everywhere, like many of their elders, have violent
fantasies. Teaching teenagers to curb their angry impulses is a
challenge for every parent on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   If America is in moral decline, then so is most of the rest of
the world, which just as avidly consumes violent films and rock
videos. Mentally disturbed people anywhere can sometimes pose a
threat to others. And all schools, not just those in America,
remain vulnerable to someone looking for innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all rich countries, only America makes it possible for
teenage misfits, those nursing a grudge, the insane or anyone else
determined to cause mayhem to get their hands so easily on such a
terrifying array of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After a disgruntled Scoutmaster killed 16 nursery pupils and
their teacher at a school in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996, Britain
banned all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   After one man wielding a semiautomatic rifle murdered 35 people
in Tasmania the month after the Dunblane massacre, Australia
drastically tightened its gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response in America seems inconceivable. Years of bitter
debate about gun control have left America with ludicrously lax gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm violence which dwarfs the rate in other countries, and
repeated mass-shootings, have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ferocious, well-financed lobbying by the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and other pro-gun groups has stymied efforts to
introduce any but the mildest of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to the Littleton shootings, Clinton can almost
be forgiven for not mentioning gun control. Most Americans are
weary of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   And yet America stands little chance of avoiding more
mass-shootings, or reducing its shocking level of lethal violence,
until it finds some way to agree on stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Outright bans may not be on the American agenda, but there
should be some way to restrict the circulation of at least the
automatic and semiautomatic weapons which feature so prominently in
massacres such as Littleton, and the increasingly powerful handguns

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ For sure, the (ex-communist) Serbian Socialist Party
is still overwhelmingly the main political force that bolsters
Slobodan Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   He has run the party, whose headquarters was in flaming ruins
after a NATO raid on April 21, for 11 years. But the Socialists do
not rule alone.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, with his wife Mira Markovic and her small orthodox
communist party (known as the Yugoslav Left) beside him, sits at
the peak of a complex pyramid of power, amid an array of personal
interests, business groups, security organs and other political
parties, all vying for bigger slices of the cake but united, for
the moment, in the face of a common threat.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, however, the grip of Milosevic and his Socialists
could weaken if the two main parties currently with them in
coalitions (one in the federal Yugoslav parliament, the other in
Serbia's) were to backslide.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian parliament, the more powerful of the two
chambers, the Socialists have linked up with the
extreme-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, led by Vojislav Seselj.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal parliament, the Socialists have also managed to
team up at the other end of the spectrum with the Serbian Renewal
Movement, a monarchist party headed by Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj was a paramilitary leader during the wars in Bosnia and
Croatia. Now a deputy prime minister in Serbia's government, he
declared, shortly before NATO's campaign began, that if Serbia were
bombed not a single ethnic Albanian would be left in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   No foreign peacekeeping troops, not even Russian ones, he says,
should be let into Kosovo. His party wants a Greater Serbia,
embracing Montenegro, Macedonia and swathes of Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia's last presidential election, in 1997, Seselj very
nearly beat Milosevic's placeman. (Milosevic is himself president
only of federal Yugoslavia, which includes little Montenegro as
well as Serbia, a job with little constitutional clout: his real
power is sustained by other, less formal, means.)
</P>
<P>
   Seselj and Draskovic were once close friends who jointly founded
a (now defunct) political party; each was best man at the other's
wedding. Now they are at loggerheads.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj wants Yugoslavia to make parliamentary and military pacts
with Russia and Belarus, while Draskovic says Serbia must still
seek amity with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign peacekeepers, says Draskovic, should be allowed
into Kosovo, but none from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   He also claims credit for countermanding an order from Serbia's
information minister, who belongs to Seselj's Radicals, expelling
all foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, the Radicals have won more influence
than Draskovic's lot over the press and the security services.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Milosevic plays the two parties off against
each other. For the moment, unity is all. But Milosevic is probably
keeping his options open.
</P>
<P>
   If he felt he had to negotiate with NATO, he might use
Draskovic; if the war goes on, Seselj would be his man.
</P>
<P>
   But party politics is not what determines power in today's
Serbia. Milosevic depends for his grip on an inner circle of a
score or so of cronies. Some have top jobs in government, others
are businessmen or run economic agencies; some combine both roles.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Marjanovic, for instance, is both Serbia's prime minister
and head of the state gas industry, which gives him a hot line to
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's ex-prime minister who long headed the
Russian gas behemoth, Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Tomic, speaker of the Serbian parliament, also runs the
state oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many such rich politicos are in the same quandary as Milosevic.
They must be worried about NATO's destruction of Serbia's
infrastructure, but they want a deal that will keep their hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   Important, but less controllable or predictable, are the shadowy
paramilitary forces which emerge in times of strife and which did
much dirty work for the Yugoslav army during the war in Croatia and
Bosnia in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Zeljko Raznatovic, whose better-known nom de guerre is Arkan, is
back in the limelight, warning NATO that his ``Tigers'' will be out
in force against any invading ground force.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has always been adept at co-opting potential
troublemakers _ hence his induction of Draskovic and Seselj into
government. Those who rebuff him run risks.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Panic, a former prime minister and head of a big
Californian pharmaceuticals company, had his plant in Belgrade
nationalized.
</P>
<P>
   Slavko Curuvija, an independent-minded newspaper owner, was shot
dead earlier this month by unknown gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's fragmented and powerless opposition has gone nervously
quiet. The Alliance for Change, a liberal group, recently refused
to discuss a suggestion that the government should resign.
</P>
<P>
   The West has been hoping that, as the NATO pounding goes on, the
diverse strands within Serbia's establishment will snarl up and
pull against each other.
</P>
<P>
   So far, if anything, the opposite has happened. &QL;

Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988, it has been one shindig after
another in his desert tents.
</P>
<P>
   With the United Nations' ban on travel to Libya and other
sanctions suspended, visitor after visitor has come to pay homage
to the ``Philosopher of the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Some look for contracts, others for handouts and all to guess
what he's up to: munificence or mischief? It felt like the good old
days, when the flamboyant Colonel Qaddafi was a major figure in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   First in Tripoli to welcome Libya back into the international
fold was the Italian foreign minister, Lamberto Dini. Before last
year's fall in the oil price, Italy imported about $4.5
billion-worth of oil from Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Agip, Italy's big oil company, is licking its lips at lucrative
deals. A stream of businessmen followed, mainly from the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has only 5.3 million people but earned some $5 billion
last year from oil. Libya's reserves (30 billion barrels) match
those of Britain and Norway combined. Its oil is high-quality
stuff, near European markets and cheap to extract (costing as
little as $1 a barrel in some places).
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva this week, Libyan officials met bankers, oil and gas
executives and other foreign businessmen to see how Libya's economy
might be opened up.
</P>
<P>
   If they were worried that the United States was maintaining its
own sanctions against Libya, they did not show it, though the
American threat to penalize any company investing over $40 million
in Libya's oil industry may make some European companies pause
before plunging in.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, however, are falling over each other to compete for
the Tripoli route. Air Malta boasted it was first in; Royal Air
Maroc claims the first scheduled flight for April 26; Alitalia,
Lufthansa and British Airways expect regular flights to begin
shortly. Contractors are scrambling to revamp Libya's airports and
its own airline.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's political resurrection is even more dramatic. Colonel
Qaddafi may have given up the Lockerbie suspects and told his
secret service not to plant more bombs on American or European
aircraft, but his revolutionary rhetoric is as bold as ever and
still driven by a passion for poking the Americans in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches he has attacked the United States for
``thuggery'' and ``racism,'' and he has called for American
companies to be ejected from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants the abolition of nation-states, which he claims
are an instrument by which the rich world, led by the United
States, divides and rules the poor world.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arab leaders, though they have heaped praise on their
pan-Arab brother, have stayed away. Only Yasser Arafat and Jordan's
King Abdullah have turned up in person.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Qaddafi still burns with resentment at the halfhearted
support given him by Arab states in the Lockerbie affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of African Unity (OAU), on the other hand,
decided last year not to observe the U.N.'s air embargo, and
several African leaders have flown defiantly to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   Though he came by land, Nelson Mandela gave Colonel Qaddafi a
big fillip in 1997 by dropping in to thank him for help given to
the anti-apartheid struggle. Best of all, it upset the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So Africa is to be the colonel's new playground. He has changed
the name of the national radio station from Voice of the Greater
Arab Homeland to the Voice of Africa and declared pan-Arabism ``a
mirage.'' He has given up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wants to unite Africa, beginning by rewriting the
charter of the OAU and eliminating references to colonial
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   He has already asked the secretariat to arrange a special summit
later this year in Tripoli to coincide with the 30th anniversary of
his coming to power.
</P>
<P>
   Africans are queuing up. Nine presidents and a stream of
officials from other African countries have visited Tripoli since
April 5. The chief lure is the Libyan president's wallet. Those who
do not benefit from it fear their enemies might, so they are
prepared to do obeisance in the Qaddafi tent.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's attempts in the mid-1980s to seize a slice of land known
as the Aozou strip from its neighbor, Chad, are forgotten. Now the
colonel appears to be trying to play the international statesman,
calling himself a peace-broker.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he got Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Laurent Kabila of
Congo to sign a peace accord and offered to send troops to monitor
it. As past beneficiaries of his largesse, they no doubt felt they
had to sign, though the deal is unlikely to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan leader also sent an envoy to the peace talks on
Sierra Leone in Togo. Sudan's civil war has not been neglected,
either. Having met government and opposition representatives, he
declared that he would bring them together in Tripoli and make
peace.
</P>
<P>
   This hardly fits with what the colonel has actually been doing:
quietly channelling funds to rebels in West Africa, such as Charles
Taylor, now president of Liberia, Foday Sankoh, the leader of the
Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone and anti-government
groups in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   The rulers of the Gambia and Burkina Faso have also received
gifts from Colonel Qaddafi and are now allies _ at least in words _
in his radical cause.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan diplomatic representation has increased dramatically in
West Africa (while falling in the Arab world), as has financial
support for radical newspapers and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   But the money is not endless. The colonel has expensive hobbies:
he is building a river through the Sahara, and wants to start work
on a railway connecting the country's coastal towns.
</P>
<P>
   America claims he maintains a costly chemical-weapons program,
as well as helping to pay for Palestinian terrorist groups. And his
inefficient, socialist state and corrupt bureaucracy eat up much of
his oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, his diplomatic troubles are not over. America,
Britain, France and Germany all have outstanding complaints about
Libyan terrorism. America's sanctions remain.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, ordinary Libyans harbor impossibly high
hopes for the post-sanctions era. For years they have heard the
government blame sanctions for all that is wrong in Libya.
</P>
<P>
   If Colonel Qaddafi does not want to disappoint them, he will
need to concentrate a little more on domestic affairs. &QL;

 By DAVID AARONOVITCH  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this moment, as I write this, some idiot will be penning a
letter, article or speech about how the NATO bombing of Serbia is
in some way related to Tuesday's Colorado school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, they will argue, begets violence. Others will blame
guns. Had Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold been armed with machetes or
knives, they could never have killed and wounded so many of their
fellow students. So they probably wouldn't have tried.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, but Eric and Dylan also had homemade pipe bombs. Where
did those come from? Almost certainly from the pages of the
Internet, where Randy from Idaho, or the Urban Terrorist's
homepage, will give any teenager all the information he needs to
blow up his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And this marketplace for the anonymous exchange and barter of
murderous information also sells fantasies of death and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this noticeboard that the boys posted their warning:
``Preparing for the big April 20th!! You'll all be sorry that
day!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were rendered immune to the reality of what they
were planning to do as a consequence of long, crepuscular hours
spent at the keyboard, blasting punks and decapitating jerks to
earn record scores.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, real flesh may become confused with pixellated
gore and guts in the adolescent mind. And in computer games, of
course, when you're killed, you always come back.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of the parents arriving, chalk-white and staring,
at Columbine High, also caught the great white limousines, and the
imagination supplied where they had been driven from: the large
houses, with lawns running down to the wide avenues.
</P>
<P>
   School massacres are a suburban phenomenon; a white phenomenon;
an illness of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High (``a liberalish school with conservative
parents,'' says a friend of mine) is very competitive. Its motto is
``Stretch for Excellence,'' and its students, as it boasts, get
higher-than-Colorado-average grades in SATs and college entrance
exams.
</P>
<P>
   There are 35 clubs for students, five separate musical bands,
and the school won the state baseball championships in `87 and `91,
the soccer championship in `86 and `93, and were the 1997
basketball champs.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the school's social failures: the geeks, dweebs, weirdos
and nerds, who don't measure up or fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, classless America abounds with classless hierarchies.
Teachers may prefer the brainy kids, but socially it is still the
pretty ones and the athletic ones who are the most envied.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the bulk of the students, who get by. Then there are
the outcasts. They do not get voted ``Most Likely To Succeed,''
they will not become prom queens, they are not elected to, or
selected for, anything.
</P>
<P>
   And, when they graduate, they can anticipate this rejection
being repeated every time there is a class reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Here, with there being no material hardship, no money to fight
over, the emphasis is placed on difference. There isn't, therefore,
the solidarity that one might find among the students in an
inner-city school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of glaring defiantly at the institutions that fail to
represent them or that repress them, the suburban school rebel's
target for hatred is the fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   And how might you best express this hatred? In the film
``Heathers,'' a decidedly Gothic Winona Ryder and her black-coated
sidekick Christian Slater do indeed take on the other kids.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they kill the preppy girls who have oppressed the
loners and the dweebs, and then they force two of the school jocks
to strip naked under a tree, and execute them, making it look like
a gay suicide pact. What a revenge that is!
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to is this. Many of these kids have ceased to
have respect for others as human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In a sentimentalized culture, empathy actually means self-pity,
and to talk about the ``problems'' of others is, in reality, to
construct a box _ like the one on the bottom of ``The Jerry
Springer Show,'' into which to drop other people.
</P>
<P>
   Our difficulties are genuine and we demand help; those of
others, however, are simply risible, zoological, weird.
</P>
<P>
   And it must all start in relatively rich homes.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the desperation of my children for my time
represents the most terrible deficit in my life. I also learned a
long time ago that mental cruelty and neglect are not related to
the size of someone's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   The most wretched children that I have ever encountered were the
loveless kids of wealthy and competitive parents who were
disappointed in them.
</P>
<P>
   In America, it's worse. Many middle-class families never eat
together. A kid has a suite of rooms and every gadget, but
communicates with his mum by intercom. Many of the parents have no
idea what the kids want or who they are.
</P>
<P>
   You go to work, you earn the money, you come home late, and your
kid kills people. Or gets killed.
</P>
<P>
   Guns don't help, and Americans should do something about it, but
won't. Filmmakers who allow violence to seem cool and attractive
should examine their consciences. And we should criticize them much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like CNN, who offered ``uninterrupted live
coverage'' of events at Columbine High School, should consider
whether that isn't exactly what avenging dweebs want. They, too,
should be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers need to keep an eye on who is having a bad time, and be
ready to offer help.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, parents who have enough should ask how much more
they really need. Kids are kids once. That's it. They take their
values from us and what we do, not from what we preach.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet we cannot prevent them from having
knowledge that we do not like, but we can help them to understand
what should be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   At a guess, I'd say understanding and discussion was what Eric
and Dylan didn't get enough of. &QL;

did those come from? Almost certainly from the pages of the
Internet, where Randy from Idaho, or the Urban Terrorist's
homepage, will give any teenager all the information he needs to
blow up his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And this marketplace for the anonymous exchange and barter of
murderous information also sells fantasies of death and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this noticeboard that the boys posted their warning:
``Preparing for the big April 20th!! You'll all be sorry that
day!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were rendered immune to the reality of what they
were planning to do as a consequence of long, crepuscular hours
spent at the keyboard, blasting punks and decapitating jerks to
earn record scores.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, real flesh may become confused with pixellated
gore and guts in the adolescent mind. And in computer games, of
course, when you're killed, you always come back.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of the parents arriving, chalk-white and staring,
at Columbine High, also caught the great white limousines, and the
imagination supplied where they had been driven from: the large
houses, with lawns running down to the wide avenues.
</P>
<P>
   School massacres are a suburban phenomenon; a white phenomenon;
an illness of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High (``a liberalish school with conservative
parents,'' says a friend of mine) is very competitive. Its motto is
``Stretch for Excellence,'' and its students, as it boasts, get
higher-than-Colorado-average grades in SATs and college entrance
exams.
</P>
<P>
   There are 35 clubs for students, five separate musical bands,
and the school won the state baseball championships in `87 and `91,
the soccer championship in `86 and `93, and were the 1997
basketball champs.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the school's social failures: the geeks, dweebs, weirdos
and nerds, who don't measure up or fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, classless America abounds with classless hierarchies.
Teachers may prefer the brainy kids, but socially it is still the
pretty ones and the athletic ones who are the most envied.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the bulk of the students, who get by. Then there are
the outcasts. They do not get voted ``Most Likely To Succeed,''
they will not become prom queens, they are not elected to, or
selected for, anything.
</P>
<P>
   And, when they graduate, they can anticipate this rejection
being repeated every time there is a class reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Here, with there being no material hardship, no money to fight
over, the emphasis is placed on difference. There isn't, therefore,
the solidarity that one might find among the students in an
inner-city school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of glaring defiantly at the institutions that fail to
represent them or that repress them, the suburban school rebel's
target for hatred is the fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   And how might you best express this hatred? In the film
``Heathers,'' a decidedly Gothic Winona Ryder and her black-coated
sidekick Christian Slater do indeed take on the other kids.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they kill the preppy girls who have oppressed the
loners and the dweebs, and then they force two of the school jocks
to strip naked under a tree, and execute them, making it look like
a gay suicide pact. What a revenge that is!
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to is this. Many of these kids have ceased to
have respect for others as human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In a sentimentalized culture, empathy actually means self-pity,
and to talk about the ``problems'' of others is, in reality, to
construct a box _ like the one on the bottom of ``The Jerry
Springer Show,'' into which to drop other people.
</P>
<P>
   Our difficulties are genuine and we demand help; those of
others, however, are simply risible, zoological, weird.
</P>
<P>
   And it must all start in relatively rich homes.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the desperation of my children for my time
represents the most terrible deficit in my life. I also learned a
long time ago that mental cruelty and neglect are not related to
the size of someone's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   The most wretched children that I have ever encountered were the
loveless kids of wealthy and competitive parents who were
disappointed in them.
</P>
<P>
   In America, it's worse. Many middle-class families never eat
together. A kid has a suite of rooms and every gadget, but
communicates with his mum by intercom. Many of the parents have no
idea what the kids want or who they are.
</P>
<P>
   You go to work, you earn the money, you come home late, and your
kid kills people. Or gets killed.
</P>
<P>
   Guns don't help, and Americans should do something about it, but
won't. Filmmakers who allow violence to seem cool and attractive
should examine their consciences. And we should criticize them much
more.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like CNN, who offered ``uninterrupted live
coverage'' of events at Columbine High School, should consider
whether that isn't exactly what avenging dweebs want. They, too,
should be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers need to keep an eye on who is having a bad time, and be
ready to offer help.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, parents who have enough should ask how much more
they really need. Kids are kids once. That's it. They take their
values from us and what we do, not from what we preach.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet we cannot prevent them from having
knowledge that we do not like, but we can help them to understand
what should be done with it.
</P>
<P>
   At a guess, I'd say understanding and discussion was what Eric
and Dylan didn't get enough of. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this ``mission creep?'' The famous phrase from the Vietnam
War has come back to haunt the leaders of the post-Vietnam
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Are we witnessing a gradual, irresistible extension of the war
aims in the Balkans, the kind of ratchet mechanism that drew the
U.S. into a massive land war which no one intended?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it bluff? Is British Prime Minister Tony Blair's
incremental but definite tightening of the terms of engagement in
Kosovo designed to frighten Serb President Slobodan Milosevic into
suing for peace?
</P>
<P>
   Or _ a third possibility _ is a ground war what Tony Blair
intended all along, but could not admit to because the NATO
partners would not wear it?
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that, as Thomas Sutcliffe, our parliamentary
observer, put it this week, the British government is engaged in a
game of Grandmother's footsteps. Every time Grandmother turns
around, the prospect of ground troops being deployed against the
Serbian army seems to have crept closer, and yet nobody will admit
to having moved.
</P>
<P>
   But moved they have. Blair began the war by promising that
``there is no question of NATO ground forces being sent in unless
it is to police an agreed political settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, he said that forces could go in with the
refugees in order to ``lead them back into their homes in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday this week, the wording became more active: ``There
will be an international military force that will go in to secure
the land for the people to whom it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the House of Commons on Wednesday he said: ``The
difficulties of a land force invasion of Kosovo against an
undegraded Serb military machine are formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while NATO troops will not fight their way into Kosovo, they
may yet drive in against a degraded military machine.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for this slow, much-denied shift in
British, American and _ by next week probably _ NATO policy, it is
to be welcomed. The deployment of ground forces should have been
planned and threatened a year ago, but it is nonetheless essential
now.
</P>
<P>
   However, our leaders should be taking Britain and its NATO
allies into this thing without creeping around the point.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity is hardly the right way to mobilize public opinion.
Nor should the peoples of NATO countries be soft-soaped about the
consequences of setting up a protectorate in Kosovo against
Serbia's will.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions from NATO that troops will be able to drive into
Kosovo without opposition from a bombed-out and demoralized Serb
army are wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in his propaganda counterstrike Thursday, said:
``When our soldiers are dying, they know why they are dying. They
are dying for their homeland, for their fatherland. And for what
will your soldiers die, 5,000 miles from home?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they will be dying to put an end to ``ethnic cleansing,''
for a democratic, peaceful Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But to defeat Serbs fighting for their fatherland will require
leadership. Fighting a war by multinational committee, which is
what NATO is, requiring a consensus among 19 nations, demands tact
and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as Blair has insisted that Milosevic does not have a
veto on NATO action, nor should Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks may be NATO's weakest link, sympathetic to the cause
of their traditional ally, orthodox Christian Serbia, but they will
not leave NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Milosevic has so far acted in such a way as to keep
NATO together, while Russia is unwilling to move beyond its stance
of bellicose neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's leaders must give a lead to their peoples this weekend.
Public opinion is less of a constraint on Blair than on any of his
fellow leaders, and he is under more of an obligation to come
clean.
</P>
<P>
   He should prepare us for a ground war not by stealth, but by
saying clearly that British lives will have to be risked at some
time soon. And he should come to Parliament and win a vote for it. &QL;

   BUDAPEST _ Blocked by rubble and its bridges destroyed by NATO
jets, Serbia's stretch of the Blue Danube is no longer the romantic
waterway immortalized by Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   International shipping through Europe's main waterway has
halted, as boats are unable to navigate past the river bed at the
Serbian town of Novi Sad. Piles of debris lie underwater after NATO
air strikes destroyed the city's three Danube bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO strikes against Serbia stop in the near future,
international river traffic on the Danube is unlikely to resume
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year about 10 millions tons of freight travel the
river through Yugoslavia, but nothing is moving now.
</P>
<P>
   The blocked Danube is an economic disaster for Europe's shipping
freight companies, and could cause knock-on effects on the
countries it flows through if the conflict continues. Some are
already preparing to fire workers now that the river is
unnavigable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts estimate that even if the conflict is settled soon,
shipping on the Danube could not be revived this year,'' said Peter
Balas, deputy state secretary at the Hungarian Economics Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   NATO destroyed the first bridge at Novi Sad, 45 miles north of
Belgrade, on April 1, early in its campaign against Serbia. The
last bridge was hit on Wednesday. Earlier NATO hit the bridge at
Smederevo, east of Belgrade. NATO jets have hit a total of six
bridges on the river.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the bridges at Novi Sad has left dozens of
ships and tons of freight trapped on the river, causing a
regional-wide blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, goods have been loaded onto trains instead, but in
Romania 60 ships bound for Austria, Germany and Hungary remain
blocked at ports on the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time there are fears that the NATO bombardment of
petrochemical factories in Serbia could trigger an environmental
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials claimed that the bombing of the Pancevo refinery,
northeast of Belgrade, was causing a cross-border environmental
hazard that could spread along the length of the Danube.
</P>
<P>
   But the blocking of the Danube has more than economic and
environmental implications.
</P>
<P>
   The Danube is a living symbol of the continent, predating and
outlasting the empires, ideologies and ruling armies that have
stomped across its banks, whether Roman, Magyar, Turkish, Nazi or
Communist.
</P>
<P>
   At 1,767 miles long, the Danube is second only to the Volga
among European rivers. Eulogized in countless songs and poems, it
starts in Germany, and then cuts through Austria, Slovakia, Hungary
down to Serbia, and Romania to the Black Sea, binding the continent
together and linking western and central Europe with the Balkans. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In Vienna it is tucked away in a drab suburb, but in the Slovak
capital, Bratislava, it widens out, thundering underneath the ugly
Communist-era bridge commemorating the anti-Nazi Slovak National
Uprising in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps in Budapest, a city built on its banks, that it
reaches its most panoramic sweep, highlighted by the series of
graceful bridges that arch over its rushing waters.
</P>
<P>
   Novi Sad, the northern Serbian city that has now become one of
NATO's main targets, was once an important Hapsburg river post and
is still retains the architectural grandeur of the Hapsburg era.
</P>
<P>
   Capital of the region known as Vojvodina, the multi-ethnic,
cosmopolitan city is home to many ethnic minorities such as
Hungarians, Czechs and Romanians. Its bridges symbolize the city,
as Catholic central Europe's gateway to the Orthodox lands of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges have a special resonance in these lands. The Nobel-prize
winning Yugoslav novelist Ivo Andric's best-known work is entitled
``Bridge on the Drina,'' a hymn to the multi-ethnic tolerance that
once characterized Bosnia, and whose last vestiges live on _ just _
in Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
   In Novi Sad they recite an old poem about the city's former
glory days: ``The glorious town, it lies by hill and valley, The
bridge divides the Danube, boats float down.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be a long time now before the boats float down the
Danube through Novi Sad again. &QL;

   PHOENIX - In the new sitcom, ``It's like, you know . . .,''
Jennifer Grey, a neglected actress with a recent nose job, plays a
neglected actress with a recent nose job named Jennifer Grey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look a lot like the Jennifer Grey (on the series),'' the
actress says on her show's official Web site, ``so we have a lot in
common. We're both actresses. We both were in ``Dirty Dancing.'' We
both had nose jobs. We both don't look anything like we did before.
We share some ex-boyfriends. But aside from that, we're really
quite different _ distinctly different _ people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with everyone else in the ensemble comedy completely
fictional, we cannot confidently tell where to draw the line
between the fictional Grey and the ``real'' one.
</P>
<P>
   This is Postmodernism in action.
</P>
<P>
   Postmodernism, also called ``Pomo,'' in a hipper context, began
as the name for a current direction in architecture, painting and
sculpture, but it actually names a trend in culture at large: a
self-conscious awareness of ourselves as playing parts, and a
blurring of the lines between genres, and between media and life.
</P>
<P>
   On HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' a show about the Mafia in New Jersey,
the gangsters have a habit of quoting dialogue from ``The
Godfather.'' They get a great kick out of it. One mobster even has
a car horn that plays the music from the older film.
</P>
<P>
   This is also Pomo in action: a bunch of actors pretending to be
mobsters who, in one virtual reality, recognize the fictional
virtual reality of another set of actors pretending to be mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   It is the old reflection of a mirror in a mirror routine.
</P>
<P>
   Pomo blurs the distinction between TV and real life, but instead
of adding verisimilitude to the television series, it makes life
unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Who is more real, after all? ``Murphy Brown'' doing ``60
Minutes'' segments, or Connie Chung playing herself on ``Murphy
Brow''n?
</P>
<P>
   In a Pomo world, everything appears in quotation marks.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Coca-Cola is now ``Classic'' Coke.
</P>
<P>
   And we wonder whether there is a ``real'' Jennifer Grey.
</P>
<P>
   Pomo has been around for about 30 years now, beginning in the
fine arts and spreading to culture at large. Distinctions we used
to make no longer seem true: Is there any reason a professional
wrestler should not become governor of Minnesota? Any reason an
actor shouldn't be president?
</P>
<P>
   Or any reason that an assassination attempt on a former actor
(Ronald Reagan) should not be inspired by an old movie (``Taxi
Driver'') and the assassin's obsession with a starlet (Jodie
Foster) and the whole thing captured by local TV video?
</P>
<P>
   It's the perfect Pomo event.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just that we blur the line between TV and life, but
that we are so familiar with the mechanisms of media that we use
them to describe our lives: We see our lives as ``arcs'' of a story
line; we know our own back stories; our children are our sequels.
</P>
<P>
   We are so aware of the processes, we have forgotten how to react
spontaneously to the content.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when Alfred Hitchcock _ a pre-Pomo director _
made ``Psycho,'' he expected to scare us out of our wits. He
manipulated his narrative to make the greatest effect. It was
important that Hitchcock knew how he achieved his results, but it
wasn't important that his audience recognize the tricks. They just
had to jump when Hitch went ``boo.''
</P>
<P>
   We are not that naive.
</P>
<P>
   In a Pomo movie, such as ``Scream,'' the audience is in on every
directorial manipulation. It knows that if you open the door to the
dark basement and go down the stairs, there will be a scream at the
bottom. And the characters in the film even comment on the
inevitability of the fright.
</P>
<P>
   When a character asks, ``Who's there?'' the homicidal maniac
answers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say `Who's there?' Don't you watch scary movies? It's a
death wish. You might as well come out to investigate a strange
noise or something.''
</P>
<P>
   We are all in on the joke and scream on cue. They've seen it all
before.
</P>
<P>
   And when we get the sequel, ``Scream 2,'' it is about making a
fictionalized version of the first film, called ``Stab'' in the
movies. The cleverness is dizzying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they got Tori Spelling to play Syd,'' says one
of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   Another says, ``So, you're saying someone is trying to make a
real-life sequel?''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Stab 2'?'' comes the reply. ``Why would anyone want to do
that? Sequels suck.''
</P>
<P>
   The reflexive cleverness is actually stultifying.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a TV watcher in America who doesn't yet recognize that
the standard sitcom interweaves an ``A story'' with a ``B story''?
</P>
<P>
   We have become so aware of the mechanisms of life and media,
that we can hardly function spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: We don't just call it grieving anymore; we go
through the seven-step grieving process. And we never simply ``get
over it,'' but we achieve ``closure.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV is so self-aware, it has just begun a campaign in which it
invents, from whole cloth, a new set of slang words for the kids to
use.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, slang was born on the streets and worked its way
upward. In a Pomo world, there is no reason slang shouldn't be
synthesized at the top and sent back down to the streets via the
billboards MTV has bought around New York.
</P>
<P>
   In this synthetic slang, ``Round'' means ``cool;'' ``February''
means ``out of style;'' ``fresno'' is ``classic rock;'' and
``bingo'' is ``sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Pomo world, everything is marketing, and consumers not only
recognize the fact, they eagerly participate in it.
</P>
<P>
   We wear billboards on our ball caps and T-shirts. We look for
the swooshes on our jogging shoes. It doesn't strike anyone under
the age of 40 as odd that we should name a stadium after a snack
food or a long-distance telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   And even TV commercials are likely to be about making TV
commercials: a chameleon puts out a contract on a Budweiser frog.
This is not about beer, it is about media.
</P>
<P>
   When we want to know which movies are worth seeing, we don't
consult critics for their opinions as much as we look at the weekly
grosses, reported in the mainstream press, to see which movies are
most popular.
</P>
<P>
   Trade magazines hardly have anything in them anymore that a
mainstream reader might be unfamiliar with.
</P>
<P>
   Even elections are influenced. Pre-Pomo, election coverage was
coverage of issues. In our hyper-aware Pomo days, coverage is of
the horse race. Issues are discussed only when noting the
demographic they are chosen by savvy politicians to play to.
</P>
<P>
   It is a form of cynicism, but not a particularly profound
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   With such awareness of the details, we hardly keep track of the
big picture. It all breaks into fragments, and we can reassemble
the fragments in any shape or form.
</P>
<P>
   So that when we are more aware of typography than content, we
get ``Wired'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And we can cross-over characters from the comic ``Ally McBeal''
on one network into the serious-minded ``The Practice'' on another.
It is as if E.G. Marshall and Robert Reed were defending Jed
Clampett in a lawsuit with Milburn Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is dumped into the blender and osterized.
</P>
<P>
   And everything is a hyperlink with a pop-up menu. &QL;

MODERN ARTISTS RETREATED INTO A COLORFUL UN REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
(ADV: Editor's note: ``Postmodern'' _ the buzzword of the past 20
years. It started in the arts, spread to academe and now shows up
in virtually every form of popular culture. So what does it mean _
really mean? Republic art critic Richard Nilsen hashes it out.  
Postmodernism in art _ Can you know yourself too well? 
Postmodernism at large _ Is your whole life a media event? 
Postmodernism's fate _ Does anything so now have a future?) 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The history of art is filled with new ground broken,
horizons opened up, new directions taken. There were periods of
endless possibility when imaginations were fertile, when things
that had seemed outside the realm of art now became central. Art
became exciting and actually led the direction of culture in
general.
</P>
<P>
   But each of those periods was capped by a retrenchment, a period
when the possibilities closed down and the cultural imagination
seemed exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The Renaissance, for example, was followed by the period we call
Mannerism, when only the manner, or style, of the great artists
remained. The ambition and curiosity of Leonardo and Michelangelo
retreated to the stylistic preciosity of Parmagianino and Pontormo.
</P>
<P>
   The Baroque's restless energy settled into its stilted parody,
the Rococco. And Modern art dead-ended in Postmodernism.
</P>
<P>
   The retrenchments in history seem little and meager compared
with their prodigious predecessors. The one opens the gates
confidently, the other timidly shuts them again.
</P>
<P>
   So, the time we are in now, which we call Postmodern, is really
another era of Mannerism. Style has triumphed over substance.
Indeed, style is seen as substance.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that this should be so, because Postmodernism
actually began as a reaction against style, against Modern art and
Modernism's apparent retreat from reality.
</P>
<P>
   By the '60s and '70s, art seemed to have abdicated its
responsibility to deal with the experience of being alive.
Modernism seemed to be interested only in itself: It played with
shapes and colors and ignored such human questions as suffering,
death, birth and love.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a mantra of the last cadre of Modern artists in
the '60s that ``Art makes nothing happen,'' that art was a world
separate from everyday reality and existed solely by its own laws.
</P>
<P>
   Modernism white-towered itself to death, and the younger artists
of the '60s and '70s attempted to bring the streets back into the
art.
</P>
<P>
   You can see those attempts in the smaller movements called
Neo-Expressionism, with its emphasis on personal emotion, and
Photo-Realism, with its reconnection with the way the world looks.
But those movements, and all the many others that fall under the
umbrella of Postmodernism, soon devolved. Neo-Expressionists
borrowed the ticks and habits of earlier Expressionists, and
instead of being about personal emotion became about the (begin
ital) look (end ital) of personal emotion, one ironic step removed
from the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Photo-Realism became a parody of Kodachrome.
</P>
<P>
   The artists reacted more to the style than to the world around
them. Indeed, they made a fetish of the ``media-inflected'' look of
the world. TV and photographs were said to (begin ital) be (end
ital) the world modern Americans inhabited. Artists would look at a
TV sitcom the way Corot would look at a real tree.
</P>
<P>
   There is some truth to this, and no art that ignored the welter
of media could be said to be truthful. But neither can art be
truthful if it limits itself only to mediated reality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are aware of the pervasiveness of mediated reality _ in
other words, a world in which, for instance, television becomes the
go-between _ we are also aware of how each mediation is also an
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a whole school of philosophy evolved from the thought
that ``perception is reality,'' ``reality is subjective'' _ or as
it is put now, ``truth is a cultural construct.''
</P>
<P>
   One popular group of thinkers began to look at the hidden
cultural and political meanings of art. What did it really mean
when we see a nude? Isn't it really a means for the politically
dominant males to oppress the females? Or, perhaps, wasn't high art
really just a means for the ruling class to perpetuate its tastes
and use them to create ``membership'' in its numbers?
</P>
<P>
   When artists began to think the same way, they thought they were
bringing reality back into their art. In truth, they headed more
toward what we call ``political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   And a whole vast dogma of politics and philosophy began to take
over the art. It was a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the artists believed they were reversing the
shortcomings of Modernism; they believed they were bringing the
world back into the art.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't. They were bringing (begin ital) ideas (end
ital) about the world into art. They had abdicated one more time.
If all of reality is media-inflected, they thought, there is no
reality but the ideas about reality.
</P>
<P>
   They have been seduced by a trendy, but ultimately shallow,
philosophy. And they have grabbed onto it like a junkyard dog,
sinking their teeth into it up to the gums.
</P>
<P>
   Painters would try to express the hegemony of the patriarchy;
sculptors would try to model the Post-Feminist, Neo-Marxist subtext
of racial and ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   And it all became words, words, words. Even the images were
meant to be ``read.'' All images, in the parlance of
Deconstruction, were ``text.''
</P>
<P>
   In Deconstruction's gunsights, everything was subject to
interpretation. We cannot trust an author's intentions. He might be
saying something completely different from what he ``intends'' to
say.
</P>
<P>
   So that, ``Huckleberry Finn'' becomes a story about the
homoerotic fascination the White man has for the Black man, or
``Moby Dick''
</P>
<P>
   becomes a story about Herman Melville's difficulty with
gender-identification.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing an author or artist seems to be saying is valid in the
Postmodern world; only our multifarious interpretations of it
counts for anything.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems hard to take seriously any philosophy that, by its
own rules, is meaningless: Why should we pay attention to the
Deconstructionist's intentions and not Melville's?
</P>
<P>
   Postmodernism also rails against the supposed ``elitism'' of
what has traditionally been called ``high art.'' Art should be
democratic, it says. There is no difference between high art and
popular art. Yet, try to read philosophers Jacques Derrida or
Michel Foucault and you will quickly discover an ``elitism of
jargon.'' Their thinking is not accessible to the common person,
yet they demand that art be.
</P>
<P>
   And the supposed ``diversity'' they champion is rather limited
in its inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In short, you may say that Postmodernism attempts to
decentralize the art on all levels. White males are no longer in
control.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems, however, as political concerns emerge over
creative ones. One is that the political content is almost wholely
leftist. Diversity has its limits and tends to exclude right-wing
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, however, Postmodernism mistakes the difference
between interpretation and experience. Experience occurs first,
before words, before interpretation, before understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Our understandings may be culturally inflected, but our
experiences are primary.
</P>
<P>
   If we want our art to reconnect with the world, we cannot do so
at the level of philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   No, we must reacquaint ourselves with experience, and our art
must not explain us to ourselves, but offer us experiences. Please,
let's end the PC moralizing and instead discover what it feels like
to walk on hot sand, what it feels like to bite into a crisp apple,
what it feels like to dance. What it feels like to give birth, or
raise a child. Or get old, or fear death.
</P>
<P>
   We should be leaving the interpretation to the critics; that is
their thankless job. Art should show us things, make us hear
things, make us touch things and recognize the body we inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the failure of Postmodernism is that it is stuck
inside our heads. It seems to believe that the brain is the only
organ that exists, and that language is coequal with reality.
</P>
<P>
   I am not here talking about retreating to the past. I don't mean
I want our artists to begin painting like Norman Rockwell. I am
asking for something much more radical.
</P>
<P>
   I am asking artists to open their senses and sensibilities up to
the life they lead and create art that engages that life in the
most direct way conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   There are artists who are doing this. Postmodernism doesn't
comprise the whole of the art world, merely the most trendy part of
it.
</P>
<P>
   But artists such as James Turrell, working in the landscape
north of Flagstaff, are striving to give us genuine experiences,
connected once more with the world and universe.
</P>
<P>
   Turrell's Roden Crater Project is meant to show its viewers the
sky, but seen in such a way as they have never seen it before. His
many light installations are about the experience of glowing.
</P>
<P>
   Such art _ and there are many other artists working to reconnect
us with the world _ has to be the sensible and moral reaction to
the narrow constraints of Postmodernism. &QL;

THEATER REVIEW: `CIVIL WAR' LOSES THE BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &LR;   &LR; _ Broadway now has a new bombastic hat trickster in
composer Frank Wildhorn, whose ``The Civil War'' opened last week
at the St. James Theatre. With three shows running at once,
Wildhorn joins the august company of England's Andrew Lloyd Webber.
He does so, however, by lowering the bar well below Lloyd Webber's
standards.
</P>
<P>
   This latest and truly appalling effort from the creator of
``Jekyll and Hyde'' and the recently revised ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' bathes the U.S. Civil War in more than two hours of pop
songs, gospel, folk, country-and-western and adrenaline-soaked
anthems. There's not a complex emotion or idea _ musical or
otherwise _ to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are there characters in any discernible sense. The show's
would-be innovation involves chronicling the war as a kind of
pageant of the common man. Shreds of story lines _ the hackneyed
brothers fighting on opposite sides, a runaway slave reunited with
her husband, a woman pining for a far-off soldier _ are loosely
stitched between the songs by the composer, author Gregory Boyd and
author-lyricist Jack Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Douglass (Keith Burton Kirk) is the only well-known
historical character; he serves as a quasi-narrator. Abraham
Lincoln turns up in occasional voice-over. Nobody mentions Ulysses
S. Grant or Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Able Broadway veteran Jerry Zaks (``Anything Goes,'' ``Six
Degrees of Separation'') agreed to direct a show that essentially
doesn't exist. He tries everything from strobe lights and
slow-motion battle scenes to a set frame of ravaged classical
columns and (set ital)lots(end ital) of projections _ Virginia
farmland, battle maps, body counts. None of it works.
</P>
<P>
   Making an evening stand almost entirely on the strength of its
score would be an audacious choice for a great composer. Frank
Wildhorn is anything but that. Melodies pour out in a forgettable
stream. The rhythms thump. Harmonic structures are bolted in place.
The lyrics remain passionately committed to the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after we learn of the brothers separated by their
uniforms, one dies in the other's arms on the battlefield. ``Tell
my father I didn't run or surrender,'' the soldier pleads in a
moment so craven it's probably just as well that the characters are
nothing more than emblems.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Missing You (My Bill),'' a wife complains to her absent
husband that the roof is leaking. We're not meant to laugh. We are,
with a shiver, whenever a grizzled profiteer (Leo Burmester) slinks
onstage to use women, rotgut whiskey or dead soldiers to turn a
buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War'' uses slavery and the cruelties of war to cash
in its own cheap sensations. Slaves suffer and hope in gospel
choirs. There's a ``Last Waltz for Dixie,'' a soldier's homesick
ode, a teary reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The St. James was crammed with school groups at a press preview
last week, and a lot of the young listeners seemed to be swallowing
``Civil War's'' syrup gratefully. The wildly popular ``Jekyll and
Hyde'' and ``Pimpernel'' _ and the hit recordings that preceded
those shows _ have made Wildhorn the closest thing to an indigenous
pop sensation Broadway has seen in a long time. (``Rent's''
Jonathan Larson might not have made it even if he had lived longer;
his palette had a lot more shades of gray than Wildhorn's brassy
colors.)
</P>
<P>
   It's regrettable to tromp on anything that attracts a younger
audience to Broadway. In this show's weak defense, the music does
have its moments. A tenderly understated meditation, ``I'll Never
Pass This Way Again,'' is followed by a bloodcurdling war song that
summons some of ``Les Miserables''' power.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best way to look at Wildhorn's appeal is that he's
getting people into the theater who might not be there otherwise.
It's a start, anyway. Maybe they'll stick around for better
material.

hard-chargers are red maples, and they are taking over the woods.
If their march continues, it could signal the downfall of the
majestic oaks that have been a mainstay of the deciduous forest for
most of the last 10,000 years. By William K. Stevens. (1750 words)

   SCI-JAPAN-CONTRACEPTION (Tokyo) _ In Japan, after 10 years the
contemporary version of the birth control pill still has not been

say it's part of the male dominated society, but defenders say it's
simply a matter of protecting women. By Sheryl WuDunn. (1530 words)

   SCI-SPY-SATELLITE (Undated) _ If all goes well today, years of

vastly powerful satellite that more than any other will a rival to
military spies in the sky. The satellite is to be hurled from a
California launching pad into an orbit some 420 miles high, where
its camera will be able to record cars, homes, hot tubs, roads,

   SCI-COLO-LYNX (Undated) _ An ambitious effort to re-introduce

earthquakes got some good news last week: their risk of catastrophe
may have been vastly overstated. New measurements taken around New
Madrid, Mo. _ the epicenter of devastating earthquakes in 1811 and
1812 _ show that the ground there is scarcely moving. According to
many scientists, this means that it will take 2,500 to 10,000 years

Nearly seven months after Clint Hallam got a new hand in France,
the Australian's transplant has progressed faster in some ways than
expected, three of the doctors who performed the procedure said in
interviews here. But Hallam is proving to be a far more difficult

   SCI-WOMEN-ATHLETES (Undated) _ If not for a history of medical
myths and a lack of athletic opportunity, It is at least possible,

   SCI-VACCINE (Undated) _ An overload of conflicting and often

WHERE WERE THE ADULTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once in the fourth grade I got caught in a lie. It wasn't an
especially egregious lie; it endangered no one's safety or
property. I had simply avoided a school activity by falsely
claiming that I had my parents' permission not to take part.
Somehow I was found out.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how seriously my school took that small lie.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant principal came to my classroom, interrupting the
lesson that was in progress. He wrote a biblical quotation on the
blackboard: ``From words of falsehood keep thyself distant.'' He
asked what the words meant, and made a point of calling on me. When
he finished this impromptu exercise on the gravity of lying, he
summoned me to his office. Only then did I find out that my
deception had been exposed. He took a book from the office safe,
turned to a clean page, and wrote down my lie. I had to sign the
page and date it; the book went back into the safe.
</P>
<P>
   I was mortified. And I have never forgotten the lessons I
learned that day: that my lies could disgrace me, that words are
not easily erased, and that the adults in my life noticed when I
did something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of school I attended.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of school Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the
Colorado mass-murderers, attended:
</P>
<P>
   They glorified Nazis, wore swastikas, and shouted ``Heil
Hitler!'' when they were pleased. And no teacher, principal, or
administrator, it seems, did anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   They talked endlessly about explosives and guns, and filled a
Web page with details on how to make a bomb. ``Shrapnel is very
important,'' it said, ``if you want to kill and injure a lot of
people.'' And no teacher, principal, or administrator, it seems,
did anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   For a class last fall, they made a video showing themselves
walking down the hallways of Columbine High School, weapons in
hand, shooting ``jocks'' dead. It was literally a rehearsal for a
massacre _ but no teacher, principal, or administrator, it seems,
did anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   The adults of Columbine High School were not alone in ignoring
students' nastiness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   When Harris and Klebold were convicted of breaking into a van
and trying to steal its contents, they were sentenced not to prison
but to counseling. When a Columbine parent twice went to the
sheriff last year to report that Harris had threatened his son _
and supplied 15 pages of Harris's frightful Internet writings to
substantiate his accusation _ nobody acted. ``You all better hide
in your houses,'' Harris had written, ``because I'm coming for
everyone and I will shoot to kill and I will kill everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone allowed as how he
has ``a real concern with people who identify with Adolf Hitler as
a hero.'' It is easy to be concerned now. It would have been more
helpful to be concerned last year, when the evidence of Harris's
repugnant character was first laid before him.
</P>
<P>
   And where, pray, were the parents of Littleton when kids were
showing up in school tricked out in ghoulish makeup? Or hanging out
with an antisocial ``trenchcoat mafia?'' Or filling Web pages with
bloody fantasies and idolizing ``death rock'' bands like KMFDM
(sample lyric: ``If I had a shotgun, I'd blow myself to hell'')?
Parents have always had their hands full with teen-agers. But in
generations past, they managed to make even rebellious or spleeny
adolescents understand that vicious or violent behavior would
trigger a crackdown. Holden Caulfield was alienated, but he never
bombed his school.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter in Colorado has unloosed the usual gush of
therapy-talk. The solution to student rampages is better mental
health services, earlier detection of depression, more counselors,
you name it. One expert told The New York Times that kindergarten
teachers must be trained to screen for aggressive behavior. A
15-year-old Columbine girl said that Klebold ``wasn't so bad'' and
she regretted not being able to ``give him a hug and tell him that
I care.'' Bill Clinton, the nation's therapist-in-chief, solemnly
intoned that ``we must do more to reach out to our children and
teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts
with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   More of the same, in other words. More handholding. More
narcissism. More nonjudgmentalism. More worship of self-esteem.
More refusal to enforce standards of right and wrong. More of the
flight from discipline and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teach them to express their anger?'' ``Give him a hug?'' What
the killers of Littleton needed was not more reassurance. Their
problem wasn't a failure to express themselves. It was a failure to
control themselves. No wonder: Their lives were filled with adults
who never set limits, never imposed rules, never made it clear that
certain kinds of behavior would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   In parochial schools like the one I attended children are taught
that they may not say and do anything they please. They learn that
their deeds have consequences, and that their demands are less
important than their obligations. They are not indulged when they
behave badly. They are not surrounded by grown-ups who shrug at
Hitler salutes or web pages full of bloodthirsty fantasies. They
are instructed from Day 1 in the difference between right and
wrong, and in the values they are expected to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why none of these atrocities has happened in a
parochial school _ and why every public school in America has to
fear that it may be next.

IN WAR, ORWELL STILL APPLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In war, the first casualty is truth, an
observation made by the British essayist Samuel Johnson in 1758 and
Hiram Johnson, the California senator, in 1918. In modern war,
language becomes part of the collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   One of George Orwell's six rules of writing is: ``Never use a
long word where a short one will do.'' In the US armed forces, a
job is not a job, but an MOS, a ``military occupational
specialty.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell died in 1950, after the world learned about Nazi
concentration camps. He would not be surprised to hear Slobodan
Milosevic diminish that horror by discussing ``demographic
genocide,'' meaning non-Serbs having more babies than Serbs. A
henchman of the Yugoslav president also uses the phrase carelessly.
``This genocidal, flying circus of the NATO alliance has caused
huge destruction,'' said Goran Matic, a government minister. ``But
citizens of Yugoslavia will not give in.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Christine Ammer wrote ``Fighting Words,'' a sprightly
summing up of military terms from ``Achilles heel'' to ``zero
hour.'' In a new book, ``Never Enough Words,'' Jeffrey McQuain
writes that ``War is probably the strongest catalyst for the
formation of euphemisms as examples of indirect wording.''
``Incident'' is an all-purpose dodge. A plan ``to neutralize the
enemy's capability'' means death and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest description of war's effect on language is Orwell's
essay, ``Politics and the English Language.'' Written in 1946, it
could have been written Thursday, based on briefings in Brussels or
bombast from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our time, political speech and writing are largely the
defense of the indefensible,'' Orwell wrote. ``Defenseless villages
are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the
countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with
incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of
peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the
roads with no more than they carry: this is called transfer of
population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for
years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck, or sent to
die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of
unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to
name things without calling up mental pictures of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his time, Orwell criticized both Nazi sympathizers and
Marxists, not only because they were totalitarian but because their
jargon was rooted in sloppy thinking and bad writing:
</P>
<P>
   ``An effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause
and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on
indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself to
be a faliure, and then fail all the more completely because he
drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the
English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our
thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it
easier for us to have foolish thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell had seen war and aggression. He was wounded during the
Spanish Civil War and his studies of totalitarianism inspired
``Animal Farm'' and ``1984.'' A half-century after his death, the
adjective ``Orwellian'' is apt today. He opposed sham, brutality,
and words used to cover up sham and brutality:
</P>
<P>
   ``The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of
Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the
outlines and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear
language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and
declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and
exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age
there is no such thing as `keeping out of politics.' All issues are
political issues, and politics is itself a mass of lies, evasions,
folly, hatred, and schizophrenia.''

THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE REMAINS CA DANGEROUS PLACE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the nation and the world focus on the tragic deaths of
teenagers at the hands of other teenagers in Littleton, Colo.,
there is another, less public tragedy occurring across America on
an almost daily basis _ death and serious injury in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   This Wednesday marks the 11th observance of Workers Memorial
Day, a day to remember workers who have been killed or seriously
injured on the job because of lack of safety or unhealthy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a day when organized labor, health and safety
organizations, and many workers will renew their commitment to
fight for safer jobs and stronger regulation and enforcement of
laws by agencies such as OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. While many employers are trying to take more teeth
out of OSHA enforcement, organized labor and health and safety
groups across the country are trying to put more teeth into the
federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle between the two sides escalates, so does the high
number of workplace deaths and serious injuries that federal
agencies such as OSHA was created to help prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 6,218 deaths occurred in 1997 in the workplace
because of traumatic injuries, a slight increase from the previous
year, according to the latest reports from the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Alaska ranked the highest in workplace deaths with a
rate of 17.5 per 100,000 workers (51 total deaths), while
Connecticut was lowest, with a rate of 2.0 per 100,000 workers in
the state (32 total deaths).
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts ranked third lowest with a rate of 2.2 per 100,000
workers (66 deaths). Overall that year, all New England states
ranked among the 15 states with the lowest rates of deaths per
100,000 workers _ Rhode Island came in third, Vermont was seventh,
Maine eighth, and New Hampshire 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even these rankings reflect the reality that there are
still far too many deaths and serious injuries in the workplace.
And these tragedies are occurring even though increased safety
measures and stronger enforcement and regulations have resulted in
a decrease of deaths and serious injuries in many workplaces across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, ``41 Massachusetts workers died on the
job, more than 1,000 died from occupational diseases, 1,200 workers
were diagnosed with cancer caused by their jobs; and over 50,000
workers were seriously injured,'' according to the annual report of
the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health, or
MassCOSH.
</P>
<P>
   Although these fatalities were fewer than the 66 deaths in 1997,
the ``largest declines were in the areas of on-the-job homicides
and fishermen lost at sea.'' With that distinction, MassCOSH uses
another measurement.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing 1997 and 1998 figures in terms of workers killed on
the job because of employers' failure to comply with required OSHA
regulations, the number of fatalities between the two years are
similar _ 24 in 1997; 21 in 1998. If the number of on-the-job
fatalities that have occurred so far in the first three months of
1999 (17) were annualized, it adds, ``Massachusetts would see 68
fatal job-related injuries occurring this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, OSHA, the one federal agency that was created to prevent
deaths and injuries in the workplace, continues to be under heavy
assault, with major employers and their friends in Congress
attempting to further weaken, if not seriously cripple, the
agency's effectiveness. Legislation has been filed in the US Senate
that would eliminate the workers' right to on-site OSHA
inspections, allow OSHA to issue warnings instead of citations for
violations, and allow overrides of OSHA standards by permitting
employers to use any alternative methods that they deem effective
to protect workers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also legislation pending that would ``immunize''
employers from OSHA penalties so long as they set up a ``health and
safety program and are certified as `in compliance' by an
employer-selected and paid consultant,'' MassCOSH reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the need is for a stronger, not weaker, OSHA. While many
employers complain that current OSHA standards are too high and too
costly to companies, there is little consideration of how increased
safety and health standards lead to a decrease in workplace
fatalities and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger OSHA adds up to more lives saved, MassCOSH and labor
organizations such as the AFL-CIO argue. They report that 200,000
lives have been saved because of OSHA's regulation and enforcement
laws, while stronger laws could sharply reduce the more than 6,200
deaths and 6 million injuries that occur each year in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to employer arguments before Congress, OSHA clearly
needs more funding and more inspections. Currently, for example, it
would take OSHA 118 years to inspect each workplace under its
jurisdiction in Massachusetts _ and that is only one inspection for
each workplace, MassCOSH reported.
</P>
<P>
   To show how much Massachusetts needs more, not less,
inspections, it would take 80 years _ 38 years fewer _ for OSHA to
have one inspection in every workplace across the country. That's
largely because other states have more OSHA inspectors. In Oregon,
for example, it would take only 20 years to inspect all the
workplaces in that state. Florida, the worst state in this
category, would need 291 years to inspect all its workplaces under
OSHA jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason why OSHA needs more funding and stronger
enforcement laws is that many employers simply do not take it
seriously enough. The fines for OSHA violations, for example, are
often too low to have any real effect on an employer who scorns
OSHA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay State, the average fine paid by an employer whose
OSHA violations resulted in the death of a worker was $19,316.66,
MassCOSH reported. While this is an increase of about $6,000 from
last year, six of the nine employers penalized in 1998 paid less
than $10,000 and four paid less than $5,000 for OSHA violations.
</P>
<P>
   With these low fines, some employers do the math and find it is
less costly to violate OSHA regulations than to comply with them.
MassCOSH and its sister agency, Western MassCOSH in Springfield,
note with concern another growing trend in the industry. Some
employers have been rewarding workers for not reporting any
injuries in the workplace, as well as threatening, if not
disciplining, workers who do report injuries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, MassCOSH adds, some firms will hide the true number
of injuries and work-related illnesses that are required under OSHA
laws to appear on injury logs. The organization further argues that
``safety incentive'' and ``injury discipline'' programs and
policies should be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   With more than half of the serious workplace injuries in
Massachusetts reported as ``ergonomic'' injuries involving
repetitive motions and/or overexertion, MassCOSH praises OSHA's
efforts to go forward, against strong employer opposition, with an
ergonomic standard that would require all employers, not just ones
in manufacturing, to provide information about signs and symptoms
of ergonomic injuries, and to correct potential ergonomic hazards
before injuries occur.
</P>
<P>
   As this and other reports document, every worker in America
needs a stronger OSHA. Workers know that a strong OSHA increases
their chances of going to a safer workplace every day and returning
home every night not only alive but with their health and all their
limbs attached.
</P>
<P>
   And all employers should be willing to pay the cost of keeping
their workers alive, healthy, and productive.

TIME MAY BE AT HAND TO FIX YOUR EYES SURGICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laser eye surgery has become so effective and widely accepted
for correcting vision problems that more than 1 million Americans
are expected to have the procedure done this year and next. But
it's no surprise that many people still get squeamish hearing the
words ``eye,'' ``laser'' and ``cut'' in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration approved
what may be an attractive new option for some mildly nearsighted
people leery of having part of their eye burned off: tiny plastic
rings that are inserted on the edges of the cornea to flatten it
and sharpen up the patient's view of distant things.
</P>
<P>
   European and Canadian doctors have been implanting the Intacs
rings for up to three years already. The main selling point is
that, unlike laser surgery, the procedure can be undone if patients
are unhappy with their new vision.
</P>
<P>
   However, many national eye specialists are skeptical the
implants will ever become more than a narrowly used alternative to
laser surgery. They cite several reasons: The rings cost as much or
more (roughly $2,000 per eye), installation hurts more, and for the
foreseeable future they will fix only a small range of mild
nearsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are few, and I bet in Boston it's going to be
something that really doesn't take off,'' said Carmen A. Puliafito,
director of the New England Eye Center in Boston and chairman of
the Tufts Medical School ophthalmology department, who performed
Massachusetts' first laser eye surgery in December 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dimitri T. Azar, a top surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary who has been to Paris to learn the procedure, said,
``Our plan is to start very carefully and not jump into it, because
there could be some hidden surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   At least for the first several months, Azar said, the infirmary
will require patients choosing rings to go to an operating room
with an anesthesiologist assisting, because of the pain of one
motion where the eye is simultaneously pulled and turned. The laser
eye surgeries can be done in a room set up like a dentist's office
with a reclining chair.
</P>
<P>
   The potential market for any of the operations is immense.
According to American Academy of Ophthalmology estimates, a quarter
of all Americans are nearsighted and another 22 percent are
farsighted. Nearly 150 million people, the academy says, wear some
kind of eyewear, including non-prescription reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, an estimated 500,000 Americans have paid for laser
surgery _ which virtually no health plan covers _ to reduce or
eliminate the need for contact lenses or eyeglasses. Currently, the
two most frequently performed visual correction surgeries are
called Lasik, which stands for laser-assisted in-situ
keratomileusis, and PRK, for photorefractive keratectomy.
</P>
<P>
   People have trouble seeing either near or far because their eyes
have less than the optimal curvature to focus images on the retina,
the membrane at the back of the eye that receives visual images.
Both Lasik and PRK slightly reshape the surface of the eye, making
it either flatter to improve distance vision or more steeply
pitched to improve near vision.
</P>
<P>
   In PRK procedures, lasers guided by computer calculations shear
off very thin layers of tissue _ a fraction of the thickness of a
piece of paper usually _ from parts of the cornea surface to
produce a shape that yields clearer vision.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik has been dubbed ``flap and zap'' because it involves a
surgeon using an automated cutting device like a carpenter's plane
to slice an ultrathin flap from the surface of the eye, which is
peeled back to allow a laser to vaporize tissue underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The flap is then replaced and patients heal much faster than
with PRK, in perhaps two days instead of a week. Also, immediately
after leaving the operating chair patients see better instead of
having to wait up to 20 days to know how their vision has been
improved, which is the case with PRK.
</P>
<P>
   Neither technique is foolproof, however. Flap complications
occur in about 1 to 2 percent of Lasik cases, but usually can be
surgically fixed. A comparably small percentage of people
undergoing both types of operations complain about blurry vision,
halos, glare, problems seeing at night or are simply disappointed
the procedure didn't yield the improvement they hoped for,
according to several US studies.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik is considered best suited to people with high to severe
nearsightedness or farsightedness. It has boomed to more than 80
percent of all eye surgeries since it was introduced in 1996,
according to Irving J. Arons, managing director of Spectrum
Consulting in Peabody, Mass., a leading authority on the
eye-surgery market.
</P>
<P>
   KeraVision, the Fremont, Calif., company that produces the new
Intacs implants, apparently sees a market among people who dislike
the idea of making a permanent, irreversible change in their eyes
or fear complications, which are rare.
</P>
<P>
   The rings, made of a polymer used for decades in cataract
surgery, are inserted about 1/3 of an inch from the center of the
eye through two small incisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best selling point seems to be the fact that they are
removable, there's a second chance and all your marbles aren't in
one basket,'' said Dr. Richard L. Abbott, codirector of corneal and
refractive surgery at the University of California at San Francisco
Medical Center, who was a principal investigator in Intacs trials
at 11 teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abbott said that he sees the rings as only ``a niche
product. The idea is that this technology would be expanded'' for
use on more myopics as well as people with hyperopia
(farsightedness) and astigmatism. However, studies are only
beginning overseas on adapting the rings to these uses and it could
be years before they can be more broadly used in the US, Abbott
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting technology, but its use right now is limited,''
said Dr. Ernest Kornmehl, medical director of the Center for Laser
Vision Correction in Brookline, Mass., who is on the faculties of
the Harvard, Tufts and University of Massachusetts medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   In people with especially large pupils that dilate widely at
night, the rings may obstruct vision on the periphery. About 1 in
10 people in early trials complained about seeing halos or glare
after getting the corneal rings, but that figure should drop as
surgeons master the procedure.

THE PICTUREPHONE MAY NOT BE THAT FAR AWAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since AT&AMP;T rolled out the Picturephone at the 1964 World's
Fair in New York, video telephony for consumers has remained an
idea ahead of its time, largely because of its enormous expense and
need for special phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For business, videoconferencing has won some acceptance as a
less pricey alternative to travelling across the country. At home,
Americans have overwhelmingly shown no appetite for spending
several hundred dollars or more to see as well as hear friends and
family calling.
</P>
<P>
   But a Massachusetts inventor recently patented a device that
could clear the way for affordable video calls from home phones as
well as cellular units. Edward T. Bullister won patent 5,886,735
last month for a device that would work over regular telephone
lines without requiring expensive ISDN or cable-television-based
hookups.
</P>
<P>
   Bullister's system includes a headset with an arm that sticks
out about 4 to 8 inches in front of the wearer's face. The arm
carries a screen about the size of a large postage stamp that shows
the person or people you are calling, plus either a small camera
trained on your face or a convex mirror with a camera on the
headset trained on it.
</P>
<P>
   Key parts of Bullister's patent cover the software by which
images of people's faces are corrected and digitally compressed to
15 to 30 images per second in a way that conserves ``bandwidth'' on
phone lines and makes it possible to transmit a decent image of the
caller's face over basic copper phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Because the image stays trained on the wearer's face from
forehead to chin, the display software needs to change far fewer
pixels each fraction of a second to show caller's expressions than
other systems that use desktop cameras. The patent also contends it
can effectively simulate eye-to-eye conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to amazing advances in miniature surveillance cameras,
some of which are now down to 1/3 of an ounce, the whole thing
could weigh little more than a normal phone headset like operators
or airline reservation clerks wear. Bullister believes the cost
could be only a few hundred dollars, and has also developed a
version that would go on a cellular phone unit and a feature that
can simulate an office-like backdrop if you are calling someone
from the beach or vacation resort.
</P>
<P>
   Bullister, a 41-year-old father of two who won a doctorate from
MIT 11 years ago, works full time for a medical device company. He
has been meeting with several videoconferencing companies about
developing and marketing the system, which in a best-case scenario
might be in stores within two years.
</P>
<P>
   This is his fifth patent, others covering a device for securing
human tissue during surgery, a device to connect computer
peripherals and two versions of computer trackballs.

DO BIRDS SLEEP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do birds sleep at night? Do they close their eyes, sit on a
perch, put their heads under a wing, or what?
</P>
<P>
   B.L., Phoenix &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Finding a scientist who has studied bird sleep is harder than
finding a sleeping bird.
</P>
<P>
   Many species hide when they sleep, to protect themselves. And
they're not asleep for long, in some cases for just a few seconds
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Niels Rattenborg, behavioral neurophysiologist at Indiana State
University, has studied bird sleep. Small perching birds, like
songbirds, only spend several seconds asleep at a time. They sleep,
and wake up, and sleep again, all night. They don't sleep during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   They have two strategies for protecting themselves at night.
Often they'll find a sheltered spot, hidden from predators like
owls, raccoons or cats. Usually it's up off the ground, but
whippoorwills, woodcocks, oven birds and others sleep on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Perching birds of the same species will sometimes roost together
overnight in groups that can number in the hundreds or thousands,
more so in the winter, probably for both heat retention and
protection from predators.
</P>
<P>
   How does Rattenborg know when a bird is asleep?
</P>
<P>
   ``They close their eyes. That's pretty obvious. They're standing
up, but their heads droop. Pigeons and doves kind of hunker their
heads down into their shoulder feathers. Other species tuck their
head into their back feathers. While they're doing all this we see
changes in their brain wave patterns indicative of sleep,''
Rattenborg reports. ``First the large wide waves of slow brain
activity, the kind of sleep that is the deeper physiological
resting period in mammals, and then the short tight waves of what
in humans we call REM sleep, the kind when we dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to ask birds if they dream, of course,''
Rattenborg says with a smile. ``But they seem to lose muscle
control during REM sleep, like humans do. Their heads droop or
swirl around, like they're drunk. I've seen ducks (that sometimes
sleep standing on the ground) almost topple over in this kind of
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How come we never see baby pigeons?
</P>
<P>
   C.M. Maynard, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. By the time you see them on the wing, on the lawn, or on the
sidewalk, pigeons aren't babies anymore. Fledglings of most bird
species are effectively teenagers by the time they're big enough
and strong enough to fly out of the nest and out to where you can
see them.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: School shooting should remind us of our compassion
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The least of these ...''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase has hardly left my mind since learning of the tragic
shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The two young men who police believe caused their own deaths and
the deaths of 12 of their classmates and a teacher have been
described as outcasts and weirdos, kids at the bottom of their high
school's food chain, least among their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation was stunned by the brutal and calculated act
and many searched frantically for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this happen, we asked. Why in Colorado, Oregon,
Kentucky, Mississippi, Arkansas? Answers about the young men who
perpetrated the terror in each of these incidents may be found on a
case by case basis, but such violence in the nation's schools is no
longer an aberration. It is
</P>
<P>
   excruciatingly common and there exists no easy fix.
</P>
<P>
   Again, we shed tears and again we grieve. But after the grief,
what then?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, we live in a country that would rather move away from its
problems, than stand and fight them.
</P>
<P>
   We close our eyes to much of life's darker side because as long
as it's affecting ``those people'' we don't have to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   We have done it with drugs. When it was only an inner city
problem, we moved to the suburbs or to the country. We've done it
with teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   When it had not yet touched the middle class, we ignored it. We
did it with AIDS. When it was labeled a homosexual disease, we
refused to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that such things don't recognize geographical
location, race or income level. When we turn our backs on them, we
simply delay the day those problems arrive at our doorstep. More
importantly, when we turn our backs on them because they only
affect those we regard as the least among us, we are dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We hear young people talk about their schoolmates who isolate
themselves, the kids no one will talk to and who won't talk to
anyone. They are out of the mainstream, not in the cool crowd or
the popular group.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame our teens for not trying very hard to reach out to
those they see as misfits. We certainly have not given them that
example to follow. We, too, ignore the least among us.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we in the ranks of today's parents know how hard it is to
break through the walls our children build around themselves at
certain stages in their young lives, but we don't stop trying. We
know that eventually they will feel comfortable with their
independence and will again look to us as sources of strength and
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   If our kids are worth the effort, aren't all the rest?
</P>
<P>
   In these days following this latest and bloodiest school
shooting, many of us turn to God. However we address the Creator,
we ask for comfort and for answers.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps those of us in this country's so-called Christian
majority need only to act on the words spoken by the founder of the
faith to which we lay claim:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatsoever you do to the least of these, my people, that you
do unto me.''

TV ANALYSES OF COLORADO KILLINGS BORDER ON EXPLOITATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now we all are familiar with the sight of the bloody
teen-ager dangling from a second-story window, of the teacher/coach
who died while trying to usher students to safety, of the young man
shot at point-blank range because he was unfortunate enough to be a
double bull's-eye: a jock AND African-American.
</P>
<P>
   We know there was bad blood between the suspects in the Colorado
shootings and Columbine High School athletes. And we can only
imagine that some movie producer somewhere is hard at work on a
script under the catchy title ``The Trench Coat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of all this is the usually detailed and often
dazzling coverage from a media that's not at its best when shifting
to the role of journalistic examiner.
</P>
<P>
   With the siege over, the dead counted, the investigation well
under way and the healing moving gingerly into its next stage, this
is the time when television news pulls out a long, thick rope and
hangs itself. That's because the potential to cross the line
between information and exploitation is at its peak, and news
organizations become locked in a fierce battle with one another for
human-interest stories.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the shootings, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' shelved
a taped show in order to piece together a live one featuring an
extended interview with a teen-age survivor and one of the school's
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Adam Foss talked of seeing a teacher being pumped with
bullets, his body flying into a locker. He talked of pushing others
inside a room and barricading themselves inside. He also told the
story (as he did on CNN and MSNBC the day before) of having to walk
over numerous bodies in order to get out of the school.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Winfrey was sobbing, apologizing for her emotional
moment, and asking for a commercial break. Winfrey had, at the
show's outset, promised ``solutions to the violence of children
killing children,'' but all we heard were horrific stories of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Dallas-area resident Ellen Ritter was doing her second
interview in as many days, this one on ``Good Morning, Texas,'' on
which she explained how, as host Todd Whitthorne put it, ``an early
graduation saved her life.'' Seems Ellen graduated from Columbine a
year early and had returned to Colorado to attend what would have
been her senior prom just last week. What a blessing, all agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``GMT'' also scrapped its usually perky infotainment show to
deal with the shootings, calling the hour ``Why Our Children?'' but
coming up with no answers either.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, there have been attempts at answers from an
eager TV media, with mixed results. Sensing either a need to get
information to viewers or the opportunity to rake in the ratings,
The History Channel and MTV rushed programs about such issues on
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel's ``20th Century With Mike Wallace,'' which
premiered Friday, examined several cases of schoolroom shootings _
featuring original interviews with experts who offered
``psychological insight'' into the killings and looking at steps
school officials are taking to prevent future armed assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, MTV's ``Warning Signs'' was set to air Tuesday. Then
the shootings occurred. The music channel pushed up the
documentary's first airing to last week and dispatched reporter
Chris Connelly and producer Betsy Forhan to Colorado to do updates
for Tuesday's show. It was the best of the lot as far as looking at
the psychological factors contributing to young people becoming
violent.
</P>
<P>
   Having heard the profiles of the two Colorado suspects and
recalling the cases of other young shooters, it was eerie to hear a
similar description of Evan Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, too, was an outcast harassed by school peers. The chief
culprit was a jock. Evan walked into his Bethel, Alaska, high
school, strolled over to Josh Palacios and opened fire, killing him
and a teacher who tried to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Serena Altschul also reported segments about a young
couple's suicide pact and a Chicagoan who turned his life around.
But it was the jail-house interview with Evan that represented the
most stirring television since the networks and 24-hour channels
began explaining the whys of the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Altschul what advice he would give a peer wanting to
kill, Evan sat motionless as the camera framed his face. Suddenly
tears started to rain down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   `If you think things are bad when you do it,'' he said of his
own rampage, ``the aftermath is even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of a security videotape at the Colorado high school
surfaces, it's a certainty that the next step is the showing of
that footage. This is where the next battle of media vs. privacy
will be waged. Will we want to see two gunmen killing their peers?
Should we? Is that getting down to the real issue?
</P>
<P>
   What the MTV documentary revealed is that teen-agers aren't
happy with how their generation is portrayed in the media and scoff
at the notion that the movies they watch or the music they hear is
responsible for the Littleton tragedy. If students are determined
to hang onto their anger, there's little anyone can do, they say.
</P>
<P>
   And a media that looks past the real issues to wow its viewers
with only the tales of death and heroism woefully misses the point.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT CASE FILINGS DELAYED
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Justice on
Monday said they delayed for one week their announcements of who
will be the rebuttal witnesses in the ongoing antitrust trial. Each
side was to have named three witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks between the two sides started March 30, but the
delay on the witness lists apparently is related to the possibility
the trial may not resume as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-May was a target for the trial to restart, but no specific
date has been set, according to the office of U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding in the case. Jackson is
also trying a murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Still on schedule in the Microsoft case, however, are the
depositions of Peter Currie, executive vice president of Netscape
Communications, and of Michael Popov, chief operating officer of
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Currie's deposition, scheduled Wednesday morning in Washington,
will be the first in the case to be open to the public. (CQ) Popov
is to be interviewed Friday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said Thursday in a statement that planned depositions
of executives from those two companies and from America Online
``are expected to focus on the question of how AOL's acquisition of
Netscape and strategic alliance with Sun affect the government's
antitrust accusations against Microsoft.''

JAPAN'S TALE OF TWO PILLS: VIAGRA AND BIRTH CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan normally takes many years, even decades, to
approve foreign medications. But last year the middle-aged men who
run the Ministry of Health and Welfare decided to rush the process
for an American drug that they apparently deemed so critical that
Japan could not wait another moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   So Japan, which is the only industrialized country that still
has not approved the use of the modern version of the birth control
pill for women, now is in the throes of a mania for the little blue
pills that treat impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 60 years old, but I think I'm 16,'' said Shigeharu
Kobayashi, an insurance executive who used Viagra for the first
time after it went on sale in March.
</P>
<P>
   At alumni reunions, golf games and even conference gatherings,
the hottest topic of the moment is Viagra. Men these days often
pull out a couple of tablets from their pockets to show their
friends, as if it had become a new rite of passage into middle age.
</P>
<P>
   But if the issue of sex and impotence has surfaced more openly,
so has the starker political issue about the tilted status of men
over women in this country.
</P>
<P>
   It took just six months for Viagra to win approval from the
Ministry of Health and Welfare, which has six women among its 204
bureaucrats. Meanwhile, the low-dose birth control pill, the most
common form of nonsurgical contraception in the United States,
still has not won approval even though its application was filed a
decade ago, and women's groups are furious.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the older, higher-dose pill is available in Japan,
though it was withdrawn from the American market in 1988 because of
the risk of blood clots and other side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gender issue,'' said Hiroko Hara, an anthropologist
and leading member of Japan's Network for Women and Health. ``The
empowerment of women is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Japanese men do not want Japanese women to become
empowered,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare would not comment on the
pill's application. But Japanese news reports suggest that the
uproar over Viagra's speedy approval may force bureaucrats to
hasten the approval of the pill, perhaps by this summer or fall.
</P>
<P>
   One of the government's deep worries is that the birth rate in
Japan has been falling, and on average, Japanese women now have
only 1.39 babies in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   So, some say, Viagra could help promote population expansion,
while the pill would prevent it. But many women are not buying this
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind all this is the basic background that Japan is a
male-dominated society,'' said Tomoko Adachi, a gynecologist at
Tokyo Women's Medical University. ``If you look at the issue in
terms of safety, it's strange that Viagra got approved so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for instance, even before Viagra's approval,
Japanese newspapers reported the death of a Japanese man in his 60s
who was taking medicine for his high blood pressure and diabetes.
Though doctors did not release the exact cause of his death, news
dispatches reported that about two hours after he had taken a
Viagra tablet, his heart stopped and he could not be revived.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, there have been deaths among some men
taking Viagra, though its manufacturer, Pfizer Inc., insists the
deaths are unrelated to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Japan have said unofficially that one
reason they approved Viagra so quickly was to insure proper usage
of the drug, to prevent more deaths. In contrast, those officials
have said that the approval of the pill has been delayed because
they need to minimize the dangers associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also said that if the pill becomes widely
used, couples will quit using the condom, currently the most
popular contraceptive, and this will trigger the proliferation of
sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the incidence of gonorrhea and chlamydia has been rising
sharply over the past couple of years, up 32 percent and 36 percent
respectively last year among young people compared with the
previous year. In contrast, the United States has witnessed
declines in these sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucrats have complained over the years that Japan's youth
need to be educated sufficiently about sexual diseases before the
pill becomes a common contraceptive. The government has done little
to promote such education, and many women are still afraid of using
the pill for fear of widely publicized side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely silly,'' said Midori Ashida, a top executive at
the Professional Women's Coalition for Sexuality and Health. ``In
Japan, most women believe the pill is dangerous. The pill is almost
a synonym for side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiaki Kumamoto, a doctor who is president of the Japan
Foundation of Sexual Health Medicine, has a different
interpretation. He said _ only partly facetiously _ that one reason
Viagra was approved so quickly was because many members of
parliament ``want to have that drug.''
</P>
<P>
   These suspicions were so pervasive that last month two former
chief cabinet secretaries filed a suit against a prominent
publisher for printing a report saying that they were Viagra users.
Both denied that they used Viagra or that they had applied any
pressure to bureaucrats to get the drug approved.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra is not exactly new to Japan. For the past year, people
have been discreetly bringing home bags full of it when they
returned from the United States. But Japan has always hidden its
sexual mores behind a veneer of manners and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the legal sale of Viagra in a country that has the
longest average life span of men in the world, there is a sense of
national enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impotence hasn't been considered an illness until now,'' said
Takaaki Minami, a urologist who has experienced a burst of new
business prescribing Viagra. ``But the men who are impotent have
been psychologically saved by public recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Viagra craze hit last summer, when tablets of Viagra were
being sold illegally at pubs and brothels. Middle-aged men were
eager to obtain a sample or two, and men were giving Viagra as
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Hawaii and San Francisco had a brisk business writing
prescriptions to visiting Japanese men. A single tablet of Viagra
on the black market in Tokyo was selling for $35, and at one point
last summer, it rose to nearly $400, according to Japanese news
reports
</P>
<P>
   Now, the official price is 1,500 yen, including taxes, or about
$12.50, and some clinics have become busier at night because of
Viagra. But not everyone is delighted with Viagra, and there is
growing concern among middle-aged wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Japanese women do not want to have Viagra for their sex
lives, but there is no objective survey or research yet,'' said Dr.
Adachi. ``A considerable number of postmenopausal women who come to
see me complain that they do not like to have sex because it is
uncomfortable and sometimes painful.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why Kobayashi said, ``I'm afraid of becoming a
constant user.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that he worries about feeling his youth again. As he
fidgeted nervously with his eyeglasses, Kobayashi explained that
his wife was not particularly eager about his newfound vigor. If he
becomes a frequent user of Viagra, there will be a mismatch in
sexuality in the Kobayashi household, and more generally, among
Viagra users and their more conservative wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very honest and I love my wife,'' said Kobayashi. ``But
I'm just a man.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that if more middle-aged men became sexually active,
they would think of using Viagra for extramarital affairs, and he
worries that the combination of Viagra and the pill, when it is
approved, may be dangerous for Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Viagra and the pill both become prevalent, the moral values
of society will deteriorate,'' he said. ``This is a hot topic
now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is thus not surprising that these days there is a joke among
elderly men in which the wife quips: ``Why are you getting so
worked up about Viagra? It doesn't interest me one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a joke,'' said Dr. Minami, the urologist. ``Many
women who have gone through menopause say that Viagra will be a
nuisance to them.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kumamoto has an answer to this problem: Japanese women should
undergo hormone replacement therapy, like their counterparts in the
United States. Kumamoto, who is 70, says that one reason he wants
the pill to be approved is so that it can increase awareness about
hormone usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usage of the pill would curb public concern over the usage of
hormones, and this would encourage hormone replacement therapy and
then more women would be sexually active,'' he said. ``If both
couples use something, then both sides will be happy.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: CHRONIC HEARTBURN, AN OMINOUS WARNING 
</HEADLINE>

 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have all had heartburn now and then, if at no other time,
then after consuming a highly acidic or spicy food or when bending
over or exercising vigorously soon after eating a full meal. And in
most cases, if any treatment was needed, an over-the-counter
antacid took care of the temporary discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   But for about 15 million Americans, heartburn is not occasional.
It is a daily occurrence that, if not treated indefinitely on a
daily basis, can develop into something far more serious _ a change
in the cells lining the esophagus that may progress into a very
serious cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds frightening, it is. The incidence of esophageal
cancer precipitated by chronic heartburn is increasing faster than
any other cancer in the nation today, and in nearly 90 percent of
cases it is incurable.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Swedish researchers reported that having frequent,
inadequately treated heartburn increased the risk of esophageal
cancer nearly eightfold. And among study participants who had
particularly severe and longstanding heartburn, the risk of cancer
rose by 43.5 times.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship was so strong that researchers concluded that
chronic heartburn was likely to be the cause of this highly fatal
cancer. Precancerous changes in the esophagus develop in 10 percent
to 15 percent of patients with chronic heartburn, and these
patients face a risk of cancer that is 30 to 40 times as great as
the risk in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn is obviously a disease that demands more respect than
it gets.
</P>
<P>
   The widely publicized findings, which were published in The New
England Journal of Medicine, precipitated countless thousands of
inquiries from concerned patients, most of whom were already being
treated by specialists, according to a survey of doctors by the
American College of Gastroenterology.
</P>
<P>
   But at least half the people who suffer from chronic heartburn
are not getting the kind of medical care that may protect them from
the serious consequences found in the Swedish study.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn results when the acidic contents of the stomach back
up into the esophagus, often because of a weakness in the muscular
valve between the esophagus and the stomach and sometimes because
the contents of the stomach empty too slowly into the intestines.
Patients with a hiatal hernia, in which a part of the stomach
bulges through a weak area of the diaphragm, may also have a
problem with heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   In medical terms, and now in advertisements as well, chronic
heartburn is called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.
Symptoms can include a burning feeling in the chest, a sour taste
in the mouth, regurgitation of a small amount of partly digested
food, unexplained chest pain, asthma (especially at night), chronic
hoarseness, sore throat or cough and erosion of the teeth.
Heartburn is most likely to occur after a large or fatty meal and
when lying down or bending over after a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that many products and treatments are now
available to alleviate chronic heartburn and prevent stomach acid
from damaging the cells of the esophagus, which are not designed to
withstand a frequent bath of acid.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of defense, however, should be adaptations of
diet and habits, which are often all that is needed in mild cases.
Avoid acidic foods like citrus fruits and juices and tomatoes,
spicy and fatty foods, chocolate, peppermint, coffee and tea
(including decaf), cola and alcohol. Try eating five or six small
meals throughout the day instead of two or three big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after meals, avoid exercising, bending over, lying down or
going to sleep. And do not wear clothes that constrict the waist or
abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   People who are overweight should try to lose excess pounds and
smokers should quit. It may also help to raise the head of the bed
by six to eight inches or sleep on your back on extra pillows or
with a wedge under your pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Acid reflux may also be aggravated by drugs you take for other
conditions, so consult your doctor about the effects of both
over-the-counter and prescription medications you take and ask
whether substitutions may be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   More severe cases that do not respond to diet and habit changes
alone require medication. Over-the-counter antacids (Maalox,
Mylanta, Tums, etc.) and histamine blockers like Pepcid AC, Tagamet
HB, Xantac 75 and Axid AR may not be strong enough to control acid
reflux fully.
</P>
<P>
   Histamine blockers are also available in prescription strength,
and may be taken in combination with more potent acid suppressors
called proton-pump inhibitors, like Prevacid and Prilosec.
</P>
<P>
   Other potentially useful drugs include Carafate, which protects
the lining of the esophagus, and drugs that speed stomach emptying,
like Propulsid, Reglan, Duvoid and Urecholine.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is not yet definitive proof that effective drug
treatment can prevent progression to cancer, preliminary evidence
strongly suggests that it will. And if acid reflux cannot be
controlled through diet, habits and drugs, surgery may be required.
One of the newest procedures, done through a laparoscope, involves
wrapping a defective esophageal sphincter to strengthen it against
reflux.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that it is not enough merely to squelch the
symptoms of heartburn. Rather, acid reflux must be prevented and
any cellular damage that has occurred must be healed. Experts also
agree that it is not enough to treat chronic heartburn
sporadically, stopping treatment when symptoms subside.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the esophagus adequately, treatment must be
aggressive, continuous and indefinite.
</P>
<P>
   If you have heartburn two or more times a week, you should see
your doctor and perhaps request a consultation with a
gastroenterologist. If the problem has been longstanding, an
examination and biopsy of the esophagus through an endoscope is the
only good way to assess what, if any, damage has been done to this
organ. If abnormal cell changes, known as Barrett's epithelium or
Barrett's esophagus, have occurred, endoscopic examinations should
be done every year or two to check for possible progression toward
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Should a premalignant condition develop, the esophagus can be
removed and replaced with a piece of intestine or stomach. There
are also experimental treatments that use lasers or other heat to
obliterate the abnormal cells and allow healthy cells to replace
them. Untreated, about 10 percent of patients with Barrett's
esophagus eventually develop cancer.
</P>
<P>

 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The forests of the Eastern United States are turning
increasingly red, and the growing brilliance of color signals a
historic change in the ecological character of a vast region
stretching from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic and from Canada
well into the South.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern deciduous woodlands are famous, of course, for their
bright fall yellows, oranges and russets. Now red is coming to the
fore, and not only in autumn; much of the forest is acquiring a
pervasive rosy blush in the spring as well.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the soft green springtime hues of hardwoods
like oaks and hickories, and the darker greens of northern conifers
like pines, are being replaced by the blazing red buds, flowers and
fruits of another, more adaptable and aggressive species of native
tree: the red maple.
</P>
<P>
   Its fruits, small whirlybirds, rain down profusely in the
spring, producing new little trees whose early start gives them a
competitive advantage over other hardwood species, which do not
drop their seeds until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   These arboreal hard-chargers are taking over the woods. Long
viewed as the maple family's poor relations, they were once
confined almost exclusively to low, wet areas. Now they have burst
out of the swamps and are marching into the uplands in strength.
</P>
<P>
   There they are starting to flaunt a new-found dominance that, if
it continues, could signal the downfall of the majestic oaks that
have been a mainstay of the deciduous forest for most of the last
10,000 years. A wide range of creatures adapted to the oak-hickory
habitat could suffer as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the red maple is part of a larger, continuing
transformation of the Eastern forest. The transformation has many
causes, all related to humans' impact on the forest ecosystem, but
in the case of the maple two stand out.
</P>
<P>
   First, people have suppressed fire. Before European settlement,
forest fires routinely killed the thin-barked red maples while oaks
and hickories were protected by their thicker bark. Fire also
created open spaces ideal for the oaks' light-loving seedlings. Now
those spaces are closing up; it so happens that red maple thrives
in shade, and its seedlings and saplings are proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   Second, red maples spread like weeds onto disturbed ground, and
people have disturbed the forest in many ways, not least by
chopping it up into a patchwork quilt of disconnected woodland
fragments and cleared fields. The maples take enthusiastically to
both the forest fragments and the deforested patches between.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they can grow about anywhere _ in rich soil or poor, on
dry land or wet or in between, in open sunlight or deep shade, in
young forests or older, mature ones. In contrast, the sugar maple
is a prima donna that thrives only in a relatively narrow range of
moderately moist soil conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the red maple not only can colonize fresh
ground easily, but it can also grow in the shadow of an already
established forest. It is a ``super generalist'' among plants, and
its ability to thrive in a wide range of soil conditions,
especially, ``is a real rarity in the plant world,'' said Dr. Marc
Abrams, a forest ecologist and plant physiologist at Pennsylvania
State University in State College.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams has been studying the ecology of the Eastern forest for
the last 15 years and has zeroed in especially on the advance of
the red maple.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated from their swamp ghettos, red maples have become
abundant in the understory _ the carpet of saplings and smaller
plants under the canopy _ of many forested stretches in the Middle
Atlantic States, the Northeast, the Midwest, the Great Lakes region
and in higher Southern elevations like the Appalachians and
Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   When the oaks and other species of older trees die, red maples
will replace them, Abrams said. In some spots, that has already
happened.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the more remarkable, he said, because the red maple,
though versatile, is not especially robust. In the conventional
terms of plant physiology, the faster a plant converts sunlight to
energy and the better it is at sucking up nutrients, adapting to
drought and ``breathing'' efficiently, the better it can compete
with other plants.
</P>
<P>
   The red maple is not particularly good at any of these; it is
``toward the low side of average'' in such measures, Abrams said.
``It's leading me to believe that studies at the physiological
level don't tell us very much about the ecological success'' of a
plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The red maple advertises itself partly by the bright, silvery
color of its smaller branches and its saplings and by the smooth
gray bark of a mature tree's trunk (much like that of a beech). Its
leaf shape is classic maple, with three to five serrated lobes
attached to a long, slender red stalk.
</P>
<P>
   It usually has something red about it in any season. Its leaves
in fall are a brilliant scarlet or crimson. Many of the tree's
twigs are red, especially in late summer and fall, as are its buds
in winter and its flowers in spring.
</P>
<P>
   From the flowers sprout long, drooping red stalks to which the
whirlybird seeds are attached. All of this adds up to a kind of
beauty that, along with the tree's ability to grow almost anywhere,
has made it a favorite shade tree in the suburbs. It can grow to
100 feet tall or more, with a trunk three or four feet thick, and
lives for up to 250 years. Old trees have rougher bark.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the red maple was found throughout most of the
Eastern United States, and was in fact the country's most widely
distributed maple. In any given locality, however, it was a minor
ecological player limited mostly to flood plains, wet, low-lying
woodlands and swamps.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It has not been considered as valuable a timber tree as other
hardwoods, since its wood weighs about the same but is only about
three-quarters as strong. Even so, Abrams said, the red maple's
increasing abundance is forcing the timber industry to adapt.
``Nobody is very happy about it,'' he said, ``but it is replacing
much more valuable hardwood species.''
</P>
<P>
   Its rise comes in the midst of a wide variety of other changes
in the mixed deciduous-evergreen forest of the East, and
particularly in the Northeast, where the forest is resurgent in
terms of tree abundance.
</P>
<P>
   What exists today is a remnant of a continuous deciduous band
that encircled the earth 10 million years ago. Since then the
forest has been disturbed almost constantly, first by the comings
and goings of ice ages and then, within the last 10,000 years, by
the clearings and burnings of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   What greeted the first European arrivals was not unbroken
forest, but rather a mosaic of woodland and oak-studded open
stretches. Europeans in the Northeast proceeded to cut over all but
about 2 percent of the remaining forest to make way for farms in
the 18th and 19th centuries. By the 20th century, farmers were
moving en masse to better lands in the Midwest, and the
Northeastern forest started to regrow.
</P>
<P>
   But as the forest expanded, its composition changed. Disease
reduced the elms and chestnuts to ecological insignificance. Many
exotic species from abroad, like the well-known ailanthus, or tree
of heaven, along with the bittersweet, the Norway maple and the
Japanese honeysuckle, have invaded parts of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Without fire, oaks are failing to regenerate. Diseases cast
shadows over the future of many tree species, including the sugar
maple, dogwood, hemlock, white ash, balsam fir and sycamore.
</P>
<P>
   The red maple has proved resilient to all of this. Not only is
it super-adaptable and aggressive, but it is remarkably resistant
to some stresses to which rival species easily succumb. Gypsy moths
devour oak leaves; the leaves of red maples contain alkaloid
chemicals that repel the moths.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals may further discourage exploding populations of
deer from eating the leaves in summer, when browsing does the most
damage to trees. There is also evidence, Abrams said, that red
maples are more tolerant of acid rain than other species.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of tree rings by Abrams and colleagues have revealed
that red maples were rare in the uplands a century ago. And studies
of individual upland forest plots over the last 30 to 50 years show
increases in red maple numbers of 200 percent to 400 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Red maples are not taking over everywhere; on soil most
favorable to sugar maples, for instance, the sugar maples eclipse
them. Red maples do not do well in the sandy soil of the coastal
plain, and their spread may be slower in the driest areas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, said Abrams, they are coming to rule not
only the deciduous forest of most of the East but also the
Northeastern pine-hemlock forest.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover is accelerated wherever timber operations remove
the canopy that shades red maple saplings. ``When you cut that,''
Abrams said, ``you're converting it to red maple overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement of oaks by red maples is a major ecological
event because so many animals rely on the oaks. Countless insects
live in the interstices of the oak's rough bark, and numerous bird
species depend on these for food. Many small nut-eating animals
also depend on them.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the chestnuts are gone and walnuts are in decline, and
their nut crops with them, the loss of oaks and their acorns could
profoundly change the mixture of species in the forest. The details
of this potential change are unclear and are the subject of further
studies.
</P>
<P>
   If forest managers wanted to alter the trend toward red maple
ascendancy, Abrams wrote in an article in the journal BioScience
last year, the periodic setting of controlled, prescribed fires _
now a standard conservation technique _ might be the best strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But ``given the current ecology and management of Eastern
forests,'' he wrote, ``the increasing dominance of forest
overstories by red maple seems inevitable,'' and the eclipse of
oaks and pines ``will be a primary consequence.''

SLIM CHANCE: CALISTA FLOCKHART SEES OPPORTUNITIES ON THE BIG
SCREEN

 Includes a color slide of Calista Flockhart with Dominic West in a
scene from ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I thought I would end up walking around wearing a big red `A'
for `Adulteress' and `Anorexic,''' Calista Flockhart says with a
sigh.
 &HT;    The star of the quirky-but-popular Fox series ``Ally McBeal''
has paid a price for her sudden fame that includes a barrage of
media intrusions, including speculation that she suffers from an
eating disorder and a recent, widely publicized rumor that she was
having an affair with ``Ally'' creator David E. Kelley, who's
married to Michelle Pfeiffer, Flockhart's co-star in her next film.
 &HT;    ``My feelings were hurt,'' she admits. ``I was frightened. I
thought it would potentially damage my career. Do I have to tell
you none of it was true? I guess a low point was when I read
something like I was starving my dog Webster so he would become
anorexic, too.''
 &HT;    Clad in a long, fitted, black coat and pants with a matching
sweater, Flockhart appears no more than fashionably thin. Nor does
she seem to have a chip on her shoulder about the press.
 &HT;    ``If you really read the tabloid stories, some of them are
clever and very imaginative,'' she says with a smile. ``I really
found some of them rather funny. I started thinking, `Gee, I should
begin to live vicariously through my own rumors, because they're so
much more exciting than my real life.'
 &HT;    ``I'm just trying to keep my sense of humor and not take it
personally,'' she adds. ``I keep reminding myself how many
opportunities `Ally McBeal' has afforded me.''
 &HT;    The biggest of those opportunities will appear on May 7, when
``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream'' opens. ``Ally''
fans may be astounded to see the show's smart, savvy and often
insecure young Boston attorney spout Shakespeare, but actually
Flockhart was a stage veteran long before she hit the small screen.
Her credits include Broadway runs in ``The Glass Menagerie'' and
``The Three Sisters.''
 &HT;    ``There's a certain anonymity to the New York stage,'' she says,
``so I guess it's understandable that you get more noticed for
being in prime time. But I'd love to get past that _ I'm an actress
who has played a lot of different roles.''
 &HT;    In director Michael Hoffman's adaptation of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' which co-stars Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Stanley Tucci and Rupert Everett, Flockhart plays the hopelessly
love-struck Helena, one of four mortals whose lives are changed by
the fairies who rule the forest.
 &HT;    ``What's so amazing,'' she says, ``is that Shakespeare wrote `A
Midsummer Night's Dream' centuries ago, and yet the Helena he
created is not unlike Ally in 1999. They are both young women who
are ambitious, driven and passionate. They want what they want, and
they lead with their hearts.
 &HT;    ``That commonality is, I think, a tribute to both Shakespeare's
and David Kelley's understanding of the feminine condition.''
 &HT;    She will, however, admit that Helena's obsessive attraction to
Demetrius might play differently in the contemporary world.
 &HT;    ``I hear people attaching labels like `co-dependent' to
Helena,'' she says. ``She's so obsessively fixated on Demetrius
that she can't help herself and she loses her pride. She's so
insecure that she's willing to do just about anything to get his
attention.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't say I've ever been that way,'' she adds. ``I
thought about how far I'd be willing to go for love and how much of
my pride and dignity I'd be willing to give up.
 &HT;    ``I do remember having some fixations on guys when I was young,
and it's not a fun place to be,'' she admits. ``But I've never said
anything close to Helena's line, `I'll be your dog.'''
 &HT;    Which is not an invitation to speculate about her love life.
 &HT;    ``I live with my dog Webster in the Hollywood hills,'' she says.
``I'm not preoccupied with getting married and having a family. I'm
certainly not panicked about it. If it happens, I think it will
happen when it's supposed to _ all in good time.''
 &HT;    Flockhart's two biggest challenges in ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' were mastering the bicycle she had to ride in crazy pursuit
of Demetrius and curbing her embarrassment in a scene where she and
the other lovers awake from their enchantment in a tangle of naked
bodies.
 &HT;    ``The bike was a big, heavy, old-fashioned antique that I had to
struggle with,'' she recalls. ``But it helped my performance,
because I could be sort of funny trying to ride around on it.''
 &HT;    As for the nudity, that wasn't so funny.
 &HT;    ``I made sure that the flowers covering strategic parts of my
body were glued on,'' she says, laughing. ``Thank God for long hair
and flower petals.
 &HT;    ``When you're doing something like that,'' Flockhart adds, ``you
just have to rely on your sense of humor to get you through it.''
 &HT;    Shakespeare is hot in Hollywood just now, which doesn't surprise
the actress.
 &HT;    ``If you think about characters like Hamlet and Juliet and Lady
Macbeth,'' she says, ``they seem very real. They're so human that
we can identify with them.''
 &HT;    Viewers often identify with Ally McBeal. On the other hand, if
they don't identify they're likely to hate her _ which is OK with
Flockhart.
 &HT;    ``Acting for me has always been about communicating and touching
people,'' she says. ``If a character I'm playing provokes a
reaction, even a debate, then it's really satisfying for me.''
 &HT;    One reaction the character provokes is a steady stream of fans
who can impose upon even a generally cheerful actress.
 &HT;    ``Most of them are wonderful,'' she says. ``They'll come up and
say things like, `Tell Ally she has a future. Tell her she'll get a
husband.' It's like they seem certain that I can get a message to
her.
 &HT;    ``The one thing I miss about the theater is the instant feedback
you get from an audience,'' she adds. ``When you're onstage you
have an immediate connection _ you know if they're coughing or if
they're laughing.
 &HT;    ``In television your only experience is doing the acting,''
Flockhart says. ``I rarely have a moment when I'm dying to rush
home and watch a completed episode. Whenever I get a response from
a fan, at least I know how they're reacting.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Flockhart says, she welcomed the anonymity she
found in Rome while filming ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
 &HT;    ``For the first two weeks it was very freeing,'' she says.
``Nobody over there had ever heard of `Ally McBeal.' Michelle
Pfeiffer got mobbed, but I could go anywhere I wanted to.''
 &HT;    She smiles ruefully.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately, American tourists arrived and, wouldn't you
know it, a lot of them were `Ally' fans. So my brief moment of not
being recognized was over.''

AFTER OSCAR, THE DELUGE: JAMES COBURN FACES THE FLOOD IN `NOAH'S
ARK' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of James Coburn in a scene from ``Noah's
Ark.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    James Coburn has a new friend named Oscar.
 &HT;    ``He's great!'' Coburn says enthusiastically. ``He's sitting on
my table, and I'm looking at him right now.''
 &HT;    That would be a small golden statuette, of course, the Academy
Award for Best Supporting Actor which the Hollywood veteran won in
March for his performance as Nick Nolte's hard-driving, abusive
father in ``Affliction'' (1998).
 &HT;    The 70-year-old Coburn was overwhelmed when his name was called,
he says. Even worse was the pressure of delivering a thank-you
speech before literally millions of people.
 &HT;    ``You just get up there and start mumbling,'' he says by
telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``The first things that come
out of your mouth are the words you always figured you'd have to
say if you ever got up there.
 &HT;    ``Then the words just keep tumbling out,'' he says. ``For me, it
wasn't like, `Oh boy, am I ... !' There was just a very warm
feeling I got from everyone, and it hasn't stopped.
 &HT;    ``I still get calls from all over the world,'' the actor says,
``and I got so many flowers we started giving them to funeral
homes. Evidently a lot of people wanted me to win.
 &HT;    ``That moved me.''
 &HT;    Coburn's joy was tempered by the fact that Nolte, his
``Affliction'' co-star and close friend, lost the Best Actor
statuette to ``Life Is Beautiful's'' Roberto Benigni.
 &HT;    ``The clown was good,'' Coburn says. ``The film was really a
nice little film _ but Best Actor, for Christ's sake! He didn't
have to act. Put a red nose on him and ... ''
 &HT;    Coburn snorts.
 &HT;    ``Nick carried it with his incredible performance,'' he says.
``There was a subtlety to it, while my role was more of a bravura
kind of thing, with a lot of yelling and screaming.
 &HT;    ``I thought Nick was just dynamite.''
 &HT;    After Oscar, Coburn is remaining as busy as ever. His next gig
is a brief appearance as a chatty peddler in ``Noah's Ark,'' a
four-hour miniseries airing May 2 and 3 on NBC. Jon Voight stars as
the man chosen by God to build an ark, stock it with animals and
sail into the unknown, with Mary Steenburgen as Noah's wife, F.
Murray Abraham as a sinister Lot and Carol Kane as Lot's doomed
mate.
 &HT;    The tongue-in-cheek movie may not seem an obvious follow-up to
an Oscar win, but Coburn doesn't mind.
 &HT;    ``It was a trip to Australia, a chance to work with Jon and
Mary, and an interesting character,'' he says. ``The peddler has
some good lines and talks about things in a way that made me laugh.
The whole movie is not written in a deep, dark, end-of-the-world
way, but with great humor.''
 &HT;    It's not difficult to make an impact in a cameo, Coburn adds. In
fact, in some respects the brevity of the role enhances its impact.
 &HT;    ``It's not too hard if you have an interesting character,'' he
says. ``I tried to give the peddler a playful attitude and a
certain bravura.''
 &HT;    Coburn recently finished another television project,
``Atticus,'' in which he stars as a rancher trying to understand
why his son committed suicide. The telemovie will air early next
year.
 &HT;    Like ``Noah's Ark,'' ``Atticus'' is a role to which the actor
had committed before he won his Oscar. His post-Oscar roles will
have to be chosen carefully, but he says that so far he's simply
been too busy to sort out his next move.
 &HT;    ``We're getting a lot of scripts coming in,'' Coburn says. ``But
I was doing `Atticus,' and I'm suffering from a sinus infection
that has been a bitch to get rid of.
 &HT;    ``I just haven't had time to read anything.''
 &HT;    Coburn has read countless scripts in his day. He's appeared in
scores of films, from classics such as ``The Magnificent Seven''
(1960), ``The Last of Sheila'' (1973) and ``The President's
Analyst'' (1967) to bombs such as ``Convoy'' (1978) and ``Hudson
Hawk'' (1991).
 &HT;    The actor was a favorite of maverick director Sam Peckinpah, for
whom he starred in ``Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid'' (1973) and
``Cross of Iron'' (1977). Perhaps his best-known role, however, was
as a superspy in the James Bond spoofs ``Our Man Flint'' (1966) and
``In Like Flint'' (1967).
 &HT;    Peckinpah was the best director he ever worked with, Coburn
believes.
 &HT;    ``I loved Sam,'' he says. ``Sam would say, `Say that line again.
Say that goddamn line again!' He was like an old-time director in
that sense.
 &HT;    ``Sam wanted everything imperfect, because life was imperfect,''
Coburn adds. ``He hated violence, and therefore he made violence
his trademark.''
 &HT;    On the negative side, Coburn sees the comic caper film ``Hudson
Hawk,'' directed by Michael Lehmann and starring Bruce Willis as a
cat burglar, as probably the worst outing of his career.
 &HT;    ``I said to Michael Lehmann, `Do you know how to do this style?'
and he said, `If I don't, we're really in a lot of trouble,'''
Coburn says. ``As it turned out, we were already in a lot of
trouble, because he didn't know what the f--k to do.
 &HT;    ``Willis wrote the story,'' he says. ``We didn't have a director
_ we had seven directors, because everybody who had an idea was a
director
 &HT;    ``Poor Lehmann,'' the actor says with a sigh. ``He was in over
his head, and the reason he was in over his head was that Willis
and (producer) Joel Silver wanted to direct it themselves. They had
somebody there who'd be the patsy.''
 &HT;    Of all his films, Coburn considers Peckinpah's World War II
drama ``Cross of Iron'' the most underrated. Coburn and Maximilian
Schell starred as German soldiers who disagreed not only about how
to fight the Russians, but also about life in general.
 &HT;    ``Max and I said to Sam, `This scene really sucks. What are you
going to do with it?''' Coburn recalls. ``Sam said, `Well, write a
better one.'
 &HT;    ``I wrote my side and tried to bring some philosophical content
to it,'' he says, ``and Max wrote a tome! He wrote about 20 pages
from a three-page scene. Max was great.''
 &HT;    Lately, Coburn has spent most of his time playing rascals _ some
likable, some not _ in such films as ``Sister Act 2'' (1993),
``Maverick'' (1994), ``The Nutty Professor'' (1996) and ``Payback''
(1999). The roles have been engaging but not especially demanding,
nor particularly challenging for an actor as capable as
``Affliction'' showed him to be.
 &HT;    Doesn't he wish the Oscar _ and the opportunities for meatier
roles it will likely bring him _ had come his way years ago?
 &HT;    Not necessarily, Coburn says.
 &HT;    ``It might have been more valuable 20 years ago,'' he concedes.
``That it came at all is all right with me. Better late than never,
as they always say. It probably would have changed things along the
way, had it happened earlier.
 &HT;    ``I don't know,'' he concludes. ``Let's see if it changes
anything now.''
 &HT;    For the time being, he's simply keeping his eyes on the future.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking for a comedy, and I'm looking for more films that
have some significance,'' he says. ``In a perfect world, I'd love
to do two films a year for the next five or six years and then hang
up my spurs.''

 Includes a color slide of Aidan Quinn with Donal Donnelly in a
scene from ``This Is My Father.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    To begin with, this isn't his father.
 &HT;    But that doesn't mean Aidan Quinn's new movie, ``This Is My
Father,'' is mere Irish blarney.
 &HT;    It's based on a story that his mother, Teresa Quinn, used to
tell her young sons Aidan, Declan, Paul and Robert around the fire
on cold winter nights, a story about two lovers separated by class
and religion in 1930s Ireland. The young man is sent away, never
knowing that his lover subsequently gives birth to their son, and
the truth is not revealed for decades, until the now-middle-aged
son comes across an old photograph and realizes the truth.
 &HT;    And yes, it's a true story. True, and powerful enough to have
drawn Quinn and his two brothers together on a film for the first
time. ``This is My Father,'' opening on May 7, is a real family
affair.
 &HT;    Quinn plays the exiled Irish lover, whose story is told in
flashbacks, with James Caan as his grown son, an Irish-American
schoolteacher who returns to Ireland looking for answers about his
murky past.
 &HT;    It wasn't their family, but the Quinns could all relate to the
story.
 &HT;    ``My grandfather actually carried the coffin of the young suitor
in the movie,'' Quinn says. ``So he was known to our family. And,
like any good Irish story, it got passed down until it became
lore.''
 &HT;    Paul Quinn wrote the screenplay, which was directed by Declan
Quinn, the Oscar-winning cinematographer of ``Leaving Las Vegas''
(1995). Even younger sister Marian has a cameo.
 &HT;    ``The only people in the family we missed were our parents and
our brother Robert,'' Quinn says with a laugh, over coffee at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't like as brothers we had this big dream of working
together,'' he adds. ``Even though we're each in the business, we
never even talked about teaming up. It just kind of happened.''
 &HT;    The trigger was his brother's script.
 &HT;    ``He sent it to me,'' Quinn recalls, ``and I just fell apart
reading it. I was so blown away by it, I said, `I'll do anything I
can to help you get this movie made,'''
 &HT;    That almost wasn't enough.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in town turned it down,'' Quinn says. ``We threw
everything into this project _ it became a quest. We wouldn't take
no for an answer.
 &HT;    ``I guess no one thought it was commercial,'' he adds. ``We kept
hearing, `This is too dark.' It was the usual litany of
cowardliness and gutlessness by the major players.''
 &HT;    Finally Sony Classics picked up the film, which became a hit at
the Toronto Film Festival.
 &HT;    ``We knew audiences would love this movie, and we weren't
disappointed by the response,'' Quinn says. ``Afterward, we had so
many people saying, `Let me tell you about my family.'''
 &HT;    The Quinns could probably make 10 films about their own family,
actually.
 &HT;    ``My parents are both from Ireland,'' Quinn says. ``We moved up
and back from Chicago to Belfast. Initially, the first time, we
moved to Ireland because my father couldn't find work in Chicago.
So he sent my mother back to Ireland with the kids while he looked
for a job.
 &HT;    ``The second time we moved to Ireland was a sabbatical leave,''
he says. ``My father was a junior-college teacher, and he got a
leave to study in Ireland. So we'd do a year here, a year there.''
 &HT;    After high school Quinn settled in Chicago, where he found a job
as a roofer. One subzero winter day, however, he paused in
shingling and glanced at his fellow workers who were chugging down
booze to keep warm. Then and there, he decided to change jobs.
 &HT;    An acting workshop got him started, and local plays soon led to
bigger opportunities, including his movie debut in the biker film
``Reckless'' (1984).
 &HT;    ``It was my first time on screen, and I was supposed to look
cool on a motorcycle,'' Quinn recalls. ``The truth of the matter is
that I had white foam on both sides of my mouth from nerves. It got
so bad that, as I was speaking, there were white strings coming out
of my mouth.
 &HT;    ``We had to repeatedly cut while I asked for water.''
 &HT;    ``Reckless'' was a minor hit, however, and Quinn soon found
himself in Hollywood, co-starring with Madonna in ``Desperately
Seeking Susan'' (1985). But despite his leading-man looks and
dreamy, blue-eyed gaze he was still a ways from movie-star cool.
 &HT;    ``I walked into a little sushi restaurant with Martin
Scorsese,'' he recalls. ``When we walked down an aisle, everyone's
face started turning. I thought, `Wow, L.A. is really weird _ even
the directors are so famous that everyone turns and looks at them.'
 &HT;    ``So we sat down,'' he continues, ``and I opened the menu and
said to this woman sitting next to me, `Look, you've got to help
me, because I've never had sushi before in my life and I just don't
know what to order.'
 &HT;    ``I looked up, and the woman was Barbra Streisand,'' Quinn says.
``So I yelled at the top of my lungs, `Oh my God, you're Barbra
Streisand!' And I was so loud that three tables over people were
hysterically laughing.''
 &HT;    P.S., he got the sushi.
 &HT;    ``She ordered for me, and I've been eating sushi ever since,
thanks to Barbra Streisand,'' Quinn says. ``I felt I had arrived.''
 &HT;    A variety of movies followed, with the most successful including
``Stakeout'' (1987), ``Avalon'' (1990), ``Benny &AMP; Joon'' (1993) and
``Legends of the Fall'' (1994).
 &HT;    Along the way, he also got married, to actress Elizabeth Bracco.
That fact has complicated his career, he admits.
 &HT;    ``I do hate to see him do love stories,'' Bracco says in a
separate interview, ``because I want to send Aidan to the Clark
Gable school of movie kissing to teach him not to use his tongue.''
 &HT;    Told of her comment, Quinn whoops.
 &HT;    ``Did she really say that?'' he says, laughing. ``Oh, she's a
pisser.''
 &HT;    He laughs again.
 &HT;    ``I wish you would tell my wife that everyone in Hollywood uses
their tongue _ you can't get away with those old-movie kisses
anymore,'' he says. ``Besides, kissing onscreen is the only fun you
get to have when you're married.''
 &HT;    He chuckles, clearly not serious.
 &HT;    ``She does hate watching the sex scenes,'' the actor adds after
a moment. ``Some actors get the death grip from their wives. I also
get the elbow to the stomach.''
 &HT;    His brothers are even tougher critics, and ``This Is My Father''
had its share of arguments.
 &HT;    ``Aidan is a very internal actor,'' Paul Quinn says in a
separate interview. ``I would go to him and start to say, `You
know, Aidan, we need to do it this way ... ' And he would cut me
off and say, `I know, I know.'
 &HT;    ``But then he would do it exactly as I wanted.''
 &HT;    Actually, Aidan Quinn says, there were moments when he yearned
for the days of childhood, when the Quinn boys would settle things
with a push and a shove and a roll in the dust.
 &HT;    ``I was always older and stronger, so I always won,'' he says
with a laugh. ``Now we're professionals, so we just talk it out.''

JACK DANDY: SEAN HAYES BRINGS A TOUCH OF ZANINESS TO `WILL &AMP;
GRACE'

 Includes a color slide of Sean Hayes in a scene from ``Will &AMP;
Grace.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not so unusual for a supporting actor to earn bigger laughs
than a sitcom's leading man. In fact, it's something of a
television tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Art Carney and Don Knotts provided more yuks than headliners
Jackie Gleason and Andy Griffith, and it was Andy Kaufman, not Judd
Hirsch, who tickled us on ``Taxi.'' Jerry Seinfeld spent nine
seasons playing straight man to Michael Richards.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to the roster of top second bananas is Sean
Hayes of ``Will &AMP; Grace.'' As the self-absorbed Jack McFarland, the
gay best friend of Will Truman (Eric McCormack), Hayes has earned
across-the-board kudos for his boundless effervescence and saucy
irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hayes claims that he was ``born with the word `sitcom'
stamped on my head,'' perhaps such success was inevitable. Raised
in the affluent Chicago suburb of Glen Ellen, Ill., he grew up as a
television junkie, particularly influenced by ``Saturday Night
Live's'' revolving ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when people thought it was bad, I thought it was great,''
he says. ``I love the whole concept of sketch comedy. I think it
was made for people like me, because it's a little off and a little
bizarre. That was me growing up _ off-kilter and a little wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in regional musical theater, Hayes graduated to
writing music for Chicago's celebrated Steppenwolf Theatre Company.
He spent two years in an acclaimed original work called ``Role
Play,'' and then made the move to Hollywood, where casting
directors were immediately taken with his quirky charm and boyish
good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Steady commercial work followed, culminating with appearances in
two 1998 Super Bowl ads _ as a henpecked husband thirsting for a
Bud Light and as an overeager Doritos fan.
</P>
<P>
   But not every gig was so high-profile. Like every performer,
Hayes has a story or two about the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a funny actor story, right?'' he says, laughing.
``Well, mine is that I was an elf in the `Kenny Rogers Christmas
Show.' Every night we'd play in front of 20,000 people _ and I can
prove to you how little they cared: During our last performance we
were on stage singing our little Christmas songs, running around
like good little elves when, all of a sudden, the other guys
tackled me, sprayed me with adhesive and stuck fake snow all over
me. I looked like a tarred-and-feathered chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what?'' he says, his eyes widening. ``Nobody
noticed. Nobody gave a crap. They just sat there waiting for Kenny
to come out and sing `Coward of the County.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's now evident that the role of Jack fits him like a
pair of spandex bike shorts, when the invitation to try out for
``Will &AMP; Grace'' first arrived, Hayes literally trashed it.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the actor says, he was busy touting his big-screen
debut in ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' at the Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually they wanted me to read for the part of Will,'' he
recalls, ``but all this exciting stuff was going on at Sundance,
and I didn't want to fly home just for an audition. So even though
I thought the script was great, I tossed it into the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when I got back to L.A., they called to say they'd found
their Will, but would I read for Jack? I said I'd love to.''
</P>
<P>
   The perennial problem for even the best second bananas is, of
course, that they tend to remain one-dimensional. That's why, now
that ``Will &AMP; Grace'' has been renewed for a second season, Hayes
is eager to have Jack evolve into more than a font of quips and bon
mots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the audience to see other sides of him,'' he says,
``to see him in more real situations. I love the fact that Jack
drifts from job to job _ but what about the other people in his
life? Who does he relate to, other than Will? I want to explore
stuff like that, and I know it will come with time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an early episode, Will explained to a colleague that he
couldn't tolerate Jack as a roommate because ``he keeps odd hours,
he's got the energy of a ferret and he's messy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Jack bemoaned his lack of ``me time,'' Will shot
back, ``all of your time is me time!''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to an oft-raised question: If Jack and Will are so
incompatible, why are they best friends?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' McCormack says, ``because after the third
episode, my sister asked me, `Are you ever going to be nice to
Jack?' She was really concerned, and I told the writers. So now
there are more little moments when they show their affection for
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really an opposites-attract thing,'' he adds.
``Will is very controlling, very passive-aggressive and, dare I use
the word, anal. He's a lawyer who deals with a lot of conservative
clients, and he doesn't have the opportunity to be flamboyant with
his sexuality the way that Jack can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it seems like Jack is just a setup for Will's
cutting remarks and vice versa,'' McCormack says. ``But I think
Will loves Jack's energy and loves how free he is and how much sex
he has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack and Will fulfill something that the other doesn't have,''
Hayes agrees. ``Will is like a big brother, even though we're
almost the same age. He kind of looks out for me, and I need that.
For my part, I'm the free spirit that Will wishes he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitcom stars always worry about being typecast if their show
succeeds, but Hayes says he isn't worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too late,'' he says, grinning. ``I already am. I swear to God,
every time I go to the grocery store, people yell out, `There's
Jack!'
</P>
<P>
   ``But am I concerned about that? It's something that's been
preying on my brain,'' he admits. ``There's always worry about
being stuck in TV-land, but there are ways around it. Once people
see me in at least one other light, they'll understand that I
didn't become an actor to play just one role.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hayes is perfectly content to appreciate the ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God that I enjoy coming to work every day,'' he says.
``There's no attitude, no star trips. It's a very comfortable
atmosphere, with everybody here to help each other _ it's really
friendly and wonderful. It's well-written, well-performed comedy.
That's all we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, these are characters that America's not used to seeing,
but our sole purpose is to entertain you and make you laugh. If you
like that, then tune in.''

SLIM CHANCE: CALISTA FLOCKHART SEES OPPORTUNITIES ON THE BIG
SCREEN

 Includes a color slide of Calista Flockhart with Dominic West in a
scene from ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I thought I would end up walking around wearing a big red `A'
for `Adulteress' and `Anorexic,''' Calista Flockhart says with a
sigh.
 &HT;    The star of the quirky-but-popular Fox series ``Ally McBeal''
has paid a price for her sudden fame that includes a barrage of
media intrusions, including speculation that she suffers from an
eating disorder and a recent, widely publicized rumor that she was
having an affair with ``Ally'' creator David E. Kelley, who's
married to Michelle Pfeiffer, Flockhart's co-star in her next film.
 &HT;    ``My feelings were hurt,'' she admits. ``I was frightened. I
thought it would potentially damage my career. Do I have to tell
you none of it was true? I guess a low point was when I read
something like I was starving my dog Webster so he would become
anorexic, too.''
 &HT;    Clad in a long, fitted, black coat and pants with a matching
sweater, Flockhart appears no more than fashionably thin. Nor does
she seem to have a chip on her shoulder about the press.
 &HT;    ``If you really read the tabloid stories, some of them are
clever and very imaginative,'' she says with a smile. ``I really
found some of them rather funny. I started thinking, `Gee, I should
begin to live vicariously through my own rumors, because they're so
much more exciting than my real life.'
 &HT;    ``I'm just trying to keep my sense of humor and not take it
personally,'' she adds. ``I keep reminding myself how many
opportunities `Ally McBeal' has afforded me.''
 &HT;    The biggest of those opportunities will appear on May 7, when
``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream'' opens. ``Ally''
fans may be astounded to see the show's smart, savvy and often
insecure young Boston attorney spout Shakespeare, but actually
Flockhart was a stage veteran long before she hit the small screen.
Her credits include Broadway runs in ``The Glass Menagerie'' and
``The Three Sisters.''
 &HT;    ``There's a certain anonymity to the New York stage,'' she says,
``so I guess it's understandable that you get more noticed for
being in prime time. But I'd love to get past that _ I'm an actress
who has played a lot of different roles.''
 &HT;    In director Michael Hoffman's adaptation of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' which co-stars Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Stanley Tucci and Rupert Everett, Flockhart plays the hopelessly
love-struck Helena, one of four mortals whose lives are changed by
the fairies who rule the forest.
 &HT;    ``What's so amazing,'' she says, ``is that Shakespeare wrote `A
Midsummer Night's Dream' centuries ago, and yet the Helena he
created is not unlike Ally in 1999. They are both young women who
are ambitious, driven and passionate. They want what they want, and
they lead with their hearts.
 &HT;    ``That commonality is, I think, a tribute to both Shakespeare's
and David Kelley's understanding of the feminine condition.''
 &HT;    She will, however, admit that Helena's obsessive attraction to
Demetrius might play differently in the contemporary world.
 &HT;    ``I hear people attaching labels like `co-dependent' to
Helena,'' she says. ``She's so obsessively fixated on Demetrius
that she can't help herself and she loses her pride. She's so
insecure that she's willing to do just about anything to get his
attention.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't say I've ever been that way,'' she adds. ``I
thought about how far I'd be willing to go for love and how much of
my pride and dignity I'd be willing to give up.
 &HT;    ``I do remember having some fixations on guys when I was young,
and it's not a fun place to be,'' she admits. ``But I've never said
anything close to Helena's line, `I'll be your dog.'''
 &HT;    Which is not an invitation to speculate about her love life.
 &HT;    ``I live with my dog Webster in the Hollywood hills,'' she says.
``I'm not preoccupied with getting married and having a family. I'm
certainly not panicked about it. If it happens, I think it will
happen when it's supposed to _ all in good time.''
 &HT;    Flockhart's two biggest challenges in ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' were mastering the bicycle she had to ride in crazy pursuit
of Demetrius and curbing her embarrassment in a scene where she and
the other lovers awake from their enchantment in a tangle of naked
bodies.
 &HT;    ``The bike was a big, heavy, old-fashioned antique that I had to
struggle with,'' she recalls. ``But it helped my performance,
because I could be sort of funny trying to ride around on it.''
 &HT;    As for the nudity, that wasn't so funny.
 &HT;    ``I made sure that the flowers covering strategic parts of my
body were glued on,'' she says, laughing. ``Thank God for long hair
and flower petals.
 &HT;    ``When you're doing something like that,'' Flockhart adds, ``you
just have to rely on your sense of humor to get you through it.''
 &HT;    Shakespeare is hot in Hollywood just now, which doesn't surprise
the actress.
 &HT;    ``If you think about characters like Hamlet and Juliet and Lady
Macbeth,'' she says, ``they seem very real. They're so human that
we can identify with them.''
 &HT;    Viewers often identify with Ally McBeal. On the other hand, if
they don't identify they're likely to hate her _ which is OK with
Flockhart.
 &HT;    ``Acting for me has always been about communicating and touching
people,'' she says. ``If a character I'm playing provokes a
reaction, even a debate, then it's really satisfying for me.''
 &HT;    One reaction the character provokes is a steady stream of fans
who can impose upon even a generally cheerful actress.
 &HT;    ``Most of them are wonderful,'' she says. ``They'll come up and
say things like, `Tell Ally she has a future. Tell her she'll get a
husband.' It's like they seem certain that I can get a message to
her.
 &HT;    ``The one thing I miss about the theater is the instant feedback
you get from an audience,'' she adds. ``When you're onstage you
have an immediate connection _ you know if they're coughing or if
they're laughing.
 &HT;    ``In television your only experience is doing the acting,''
Flockhart says. ``I rarely have a moment when I'm dying to rush
home and watch a completed episode. Whenever I get a response from
a fan, at least I know how they're reacting.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Flockhart says, she welcomed the anonymity she
found in Rome while filming ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
 &HT;    ``For the first two weeks it was very freeing,'' she says.
``Nobody over there had ever heard of `Ally McBeal.' Michelle
Pfeiffer got mobbed, but I could go anywhere I wanted to.''
 &HT;    She smiles ruefully.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately, American tourists arrived and, wouldn't you
know it, a lot of them were `Ally' fans. So my brief moment of not
being recognized was over.''

AFTER OSCAR, THE DELUGE: JAMES COBURN FACES THE FLOOD IN `NOAH'S
ARK'

 Includes a color slide of James Coburn in a scene from ``Noah's
Ark.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    James Coburn has a new friend named Oscar.
 &HT;    ``He's great!'' Coburn says enthusiastically. ``He's sitting on
my table, and I'm looking at him right now.''
 &HT;    That would be a small golden statuette, of course, the Academy
Award for Best Supporting Actor which the Hollywood veteran won in
March for his performance as Nick Nolte's hard-driving, abusive
father in ``Affliction'' (1998).
 &HT;    The 70-year-old Coburn was overwhelmed when his name was called,
he says. Even worse was the pressure of delivering a thank-you
speech before literally millions of people.
 &HT;    ``You just get up there and start mumbling,'' he says by
telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``The first things that come
out of your mouth are the words you always figured you'd have to
say if you ever got up there.
 &HT;    ``Then the words just keep tumbling out,'' he says. ``For me, it
wasn't like, `Oh boy, am I ... !' There was just a very warm
feeling I got from everyone, and it hasn't stopped.
 &HT;    ``I still get calls from all over the world,'' the actor says,
``and I got so many flowers we started giving them to funeral
homes. Evidently a lot of people wanted me to win.
 &HT;    ``That moved me.''
 &HT;    Coburn's joy was tempered by the fact that Nolte, his
``Affliction'' co-star and close friend, lost the Best Actor
statuette to ``Life Is Beautiful's'' Roberto Benigni.
 &HT;    ``The clown was good,'' Coburn says. ``The film was really a
nice little film _ but Best Actor, for Christ's sake! He didn't
have to act. Put a red nose on him and ... ''
 &HT;    Coburn snorts.
 &HT;    ``Nick carried it with his incredible performance,'' he says.
``There was a subtlety to it, while my role was more of a bravura
kind of thing, with a lot of yelling and screaming.
 &HT;    ``I thought Nick was just dynamite.''
 &HT;    After Oscar, Coburn is remaining as busy as ever. His next gig
is a brief appearance as a chatty peddler in ``Noah's Ark,'' a
four-hour miniseries airing May 2 and 3 on NBC. Jon Voight stars as
the man chosen by God to build an ark, stock it with animals and
sail into the unknown, with Mary Steenburgen as Noah's wife, F.
Murray Abraham as a sinister Lot and Carol Kane as Lot's doomed
mate.
 &HT;    The tongue-in-cheek movie may not seem an obvious follow-up to
an Oscar win, but Coburn doesn't mind.
 &HT;    ``It was a trip to Australia, a chance to work with Jon and
Mary, and an interesting character,'' he says. ``The peddler has
some good lines and talks about things in a way that made me laugh.
The whole movie is not written in a deep, dark, end-of-the-world
way, but with great humor.''
 &HT;    It's not difficult to make an impact in a cameo, Coburn adds. In
fact, in some respects the brevity of the role enhances its impact.
 &HT;    ``It's not too hard if you have an interesting character,'' he
says. ``I tried to give the peddler a playful attitude and a
certain bravura.''
 &HT;    Coburn recently finished another television project,
``Atticus,'' in which he stars as a rancher trying to understand
why his son committed suicide. The telemovie will air early next
year.
 &HT;    Like ``Noah's Ark,'' ``Atticus'' is a role to which the actor
had committed before he won his Oscar. His post-Oscar roles will
have to be chosen carefully, but he says that so far he's simply
been too busy to sort out his next move.
 &HT;    ``We're getting a lot of scripts coming in,'' Coburn says. ``But
I was doing `Atticus,' and I'm suffering from a sinus infection
that has been a bitch to get rid of.
 &HT;    ``I just haven't had time to read anything.''
 &HT;    Coburn has read countless scripts in his day. He's appeared in
scores of films, from classics such as ``The Magnificent Seven''
(1960), ``The Last of Sheila'' (1973) and ``The President's
Analyst'' (1967) to bombs such as ``Convoy'' (1978) and ``Hudson
Hawk'' (1991).
 &HT;    The actor was a favorite of maverick director Sam Peckinpah, for
whom he starred in ``Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid'' (1973) and
``Cross of Iron'' (1977). Perhaps his best-known role, however, was
as a superspy in the James Bond spoofs ``Our Man Flint'' (1966) and
``In Like Flint'' (1967).
 &HT;    Peckinpah was the best director he ever worked with, Coburn
believes.
 &HT;    ``I loved Sam,'' he says. ``Sam would say, `Say that line again.
Say that goddamn line again!' He was like an old-time director in
that sense.
 &HT;    ``Sam wanted everything imperfect, because life was imperfect,''
Coburn adds. ``He hated violence, and therefore he made violence
his trademark.''
 &HT;    On the negative side, Coburn sees the comic caper film ``Hudson
Hawk,'' directed by Michael Lehmann and starring Bruce Willis as a
cat burglar, as probably the worst outing of his career.
 &HT;    ``I said to Michael Lehmann, `Do you know how to do this style?'
and he said, `If I don't, we're really in a lot of trouble,'''
Coburn says. ``As it turned out, we were already in a lot of
trouble, because he didn't know what the f--k to do.
 &HT;    ``Willis wrote the story,'' he says. ``We didn't have a director
_ we had seven directors, because everybody who had an idea was a
director
 &HT;    ``Poor Lehmann,'' the actor says with a sigh. ``He was in over
his head, and the reason he was in over his head was that Willis
and (producer) Joel Silver wanted to direct it themselves. They had
somebody there who'd be the patsy.''
 &HT;    Of all his films, Coburn considers Peckinpah's World War II
drama ``Cross of Iron'' the most underrated. Coburn and Maximilian
Schell starred as German soldiers who disagreed not only about how
to fight the Russians, but also about life in general.
 &HT;    ``Max and I said to Sam, `This scene really sucks. What are you
going to do with it?''' Coburn recalls. ``Sam said, `Well, write a
better one.'
 &HT;    ``I wrote my side and tried to bring some philosophical content
to it,'' he says, ``and Max wrote a tome! He wrote about 20 pages
from a three-page scene. Max was great.''
 &HT;    Lately, Coburn has spent most of his time playing rascals _ some
likable, some not _ in such films as ``Sister Act 2'' (1993),
``Maverick'' (1994), ``The Nutty Professor'' (1996) and ``Payback''
(1999). The roles have been engaging but not especially demanding,
nor particularly challenging for an actor as capable as
``Affliction'' showed him to be.
 &HT;    Doesn't he wish the Oscar _ and the opportunities for meatier
roles it will likely bring him _ had come his way years ago?
 &HT;    Not necessarily, Coburn says.
 &HT;    ``It might have been more valuable 20 years ago,'' he concedes.
``That it came at all is all right with me. Better late than never,
as they always say. It probably would have changed things along the
way, had it happened earlier.
 &HT;    ``I don't know,'' he concludes. ``Let's see if it changes
anything now.''
 &HT;    For the time being, he's simply keeping his eyes on the future.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking for a comedy, and I'm looking for more films that
have some significance,'' he says. ``In a perfect world, I'd love
to do two films a year for the next five or six years and then hang
up my spurs.''

 Includes a color slide of Aidan Quinn with Donal Donnelly in a
scene from ``This Is My Father.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    To begin with, this isn't his father.
 &HT;    But that doesn't mean Aidan Quinn's new movie, ``This Is My
Father,'' is mere Irish blarney.
 &HT;    It's based on a story that his mother, Teresa Quinn, used to
tell her young sons Aidan, Declan, Paul and Robert around the fire
on cold winter nights, a story about two lovers separated by class
and religion in 1930s Ireland. The young man is sent away, never
knowing that his lover subsequently gives birth to their son, and
the truth is not revealed for decades, until the now-middle-aged
son comes across an old photograph and realizes the truth.
 &HT;    And yes, it's a true story. True, and powerful enough to have
drawn Quinn and his two brothers together on a film for the first
time. ``This is My Father,'' opening on May 7, is a real family
affair.
 &HT;    Quinn plays the exiled Irish lover, whose story is told in
flashbacks, with James Caan as his grown son, an Irish-American
schoolteacher who returns to Ireland looking for answers about his
murky past.
 &HT;    It wasn't their family, but the Quinns could all relate to the
story.
 &HT;    ``My grandfather actually carried the coffin of the young suitor
in the movie,'' Quinn says. ``So he was known to our family. And,
like any good Irish story, it got passed down until it became
lore.''
 &HT;    Paul Quinn wrote the screenplay, which was directed by Declan
Quinn, the Oscar-winning cinematographer of ``Leaving Las Vegas''
(1995). Even younger sister Marian has a cameo.
 &HT;    ``The only people in the family we missed were our parents and
our brother Robert,'' Quinn says with a laugh, over coffee at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't like as brothers we had this big dream of working
together,'' he adds. ``Even though we're each in the business, we
never even talked about teaming up. It just kind of happened.''
 &HT;    The trigger was his brother's script.
 &HT;    ``He sent it to me,'' Quinn recalls, ``and I just fell apart
reading it. I was so blown away by it, I said, `I'll do anything I
can to help you get this movie made,'''
 &HT;    That almost wasn't enough.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in town turned it down,'' Quinn says. ``We threw
everything into this project _ it became a quest. We wouldn't take
no for an answer.
 &HT;    ``I guess no one thought it was commercial,'' he adds. ``We kept
hearing, `This is too dark.' It was the usual litany of
cowardliness and gutlessness by the major players.''
 &HT;    Finally Sony Classics picked up the film, which became a hit at
the Toronto Film Festival.
 &HT;    ``We knew audiences would love this movie, and we weren't
disappointed by the response,'' Quinn says. ``Afterward, we had so
many people saying, `Let me tell you about my family.'''
 &HT;    The Quinns could probably make 10 films about their own family,
actually.
 &HT;    ``My parents are both from Ireland,'' Quinn says. ``We moved up
and back from Chicago to Belfast. Initially, the first time, we
moved to Ireland because my father couldn't find work in Chicago.
So he sent my mother back to Ireland with the kids while he looked
for a job.
 &HT;    ``The second time we moved to Ireland was a sabbatical leave,''
he says. ``My father was a junior-college teacher, and he got a
leave to study in Ireland. So we'd do a year here, a year there.''
 &HT;    After high school Quinn settled in Chicago, where he found a job
as a roofer. One subzero winter day, however, he paused in
shingling and glanced at his fellow workers who were chugging down
booze to keep warm. Then and there, he decided to change jobs.
 &HT;    An acting workshop got him started, and local plays soon led to
bigger opportunities, including his movie debut in the biker film
``Reckless'' (1984).
 &HT;    ``It was my first time on screen, and I was supposed to look
cool on a motorcycle,'' Quinn recalls. ``The truth of the matter is
that I had white foam on both sides of my mouth from nerves. It got
so bad that, as I was speaking, there were white strings coming out
of my mouth.
 &HT;    ``We had to repeatedly cut while I asked for water.''
 &HT;    ``Reckless'' was a minor hit, however, and Quinn soon found
himself in Hollywood, co-starring with Madonna in ``Desperately
Seeking Susan'' (1985). But despite his leading-man looks and
dreamy, blue-eyed gaze he was still a ways from movie-star cool.
 &HT;    ``I walked into a little sushi restaurant with Martin
Scorsese,'' he recalls. ``When we walked down an aisle, everyone's
face started turning. I thought, `Wow, L.A. is really weird _ even
the directors are so famous that everyone turns and looks at them.'
 &HT;    ``So we sat down,'' he continues, ``and I opened the menu and
said to this woman sitting next to me, `Look, you've got to help
me, because I've never had sushi before in my life and I just don't
know what to order.'
 &HT;    ``I looked up, and the woman was Barbra Streisand,'' Quinn says.
``So I yelled at the top of my lungs, `Oh my God, you're Barbra
Streisand!' And I was so loud that three tables over people were
hysterically laughing.''
 &HT;    P.S., he got the sushi.
 &HT;    ``She ordered for me, and I've been eating sushi ever since,
thanks to Barbra Streisand,'' Quinn says. ``I felt I had arrived.''
 &HT;    A variety of movies followed, with the most successful including
``Stakeout'' (1987), ``Avalon'' (1990), ``Benny &AMP; Joon'' (1993) and
``Legends of the Fall'' (1994).
 &HT;    Along the way, he also got married, to actress Elizabeth Bracco.
That fact has complicated his career, he admits.
 &HT;    ``I do hate to see him do love stories,'' Bracco says in a
separate interview, ``because I want to send Aidan to the Clark
Gable school of movie kissing to teach him not to use his tongue.''
 &HT;    Told of her comment, Quinn whoops.
 &HT;    ``Did she really say that?'' he says, laughing. ``Oh, she's a
pisser.''
 &HT;    He laughs again.
 &HT;    ``I wish you would tell my wife that everyone in Hollywood uses
their tongue _ you can't get away with those old-movie kisses
anymore,'' he says. ``Besides, kissing onscreen is the only fun you
get to have when you're married.''
 &HT;    He chuckles, clearly not serious.
 &HT;    ``She does hate watching the sex scenes,'' the actor adds after
a moment. ``Some actors get the death grip from their wives. I also
get the elbow to the stomach.''
 &HT;    His brothers are even tougher critics, and ``This Is My Father''
had its share of arguments.
 &HT;    ``Aidan is a very internal actor,'' Paul Quinn says in a
separate interview. ``I would go to him and start to say, `You
know, Aidan, we need to do it this way ... ' And he would cut me
off and say, `I know, I know.'
 &HT;    ``But then he would do it exactly as I wanted.''
 &HT;    Actually, Aidan Quinn says, there were moments when he yearned
for the days of childhood, when the Quinn boys would settle things
with a push and a shove and a roll in the dust.
 &HT;    ``I was always older and stronger, so I always won,'' he says
with a laugh. ``Now we're professionals, so we just talk it out.''

 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not so unusual for a supporting actor to earn bigger laughs
than a sitcom's leading man. In fact, it's something of a
television tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Art Carney and Don Knotts provided more yuks than headliners
Jackie Gleason and Andy Griffith, and it was Andy Kaufman, not Judd
Hirsch, who tickled us on ``Taxi.'' Jerry Seinfeld spent nine
seasons playing straight man to Michael Richards.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to the roster of top second bananas is Sean
Hayes of ``Will &AMP; Grace.'' As the self-absorbed Jack McFarland, the
gay best friend of Will Truman (Eric McCormack), Hayes has earned
across-the-board kudos for his boundless effervescence and saucy
irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hayes claims that he was ``born with the word `sitcom'
stamped on my head,'' perhaps such success was inevitable. Raised
in the affluent Chicago suburb of Glen Ellen, Ill., he grew up as a
television junkie, particularly influenced by ``Saturday Night
Live's'' revolving ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when people thought it was bad, I thought it was great,''
he says. ``I love the whole concept of sketch comedy. I think it
was made for people like me, because it's a little off and a little
bizarre. That was me growing up _ off-kilter and a little wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in regional musical theater, Hayes graduated to
writing music for Chicago's celebrated Steppenwolf Theatre Company.
He spent two years in an acclaimed original work called ``Role
Play,'' and then made the move to Hollywood, where casting
directors were immediately taken with his quirky charm and boyish
good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Steady commercial work followed, culminating with appearances in
two 1998 Super Bowl ads _ as a henpecked husband thirsting for a
Bud Light and as an overeager Doritos fan.
</P>
<P>
   But not every gig was so high-profile. Like every performer,
Hayes has a story or two about the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a funny actor story, right?'' he says, laughing.
``Well, mine is that I was an elf in the `Kenny Rogers Christmas
Show.' Every night we'd play in front of 20,000 people _ and I can
prove to you how little they cared: During our last performance we
were on stage singing our little Christmas songs, running around
like good little elves when, all of a sudden, the other guys
tackled me, sprayed me with adhesive and stuck fake snow all over
me. I looked like a tarred-and-feathered chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what?'' he says, his eyes widening. ``Nobody
noticed. Nobody gave a crap. They just sat there waiting for Kenny
to come out and sing `Coward of the County.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's now evident that the role of Jack fits him like a
pair of spandex bike shorts, when the invitation to try out for
``Will &AMP; Grace'' first arrived, Hayes literally trashed it.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the actor says, he was busy touting his big-screen
debut in ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' at the Sundance Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually they wanted me to read for the part of Will,'' he
recalls, ``but all this exciting stuff was going on at Sundance,
and I didn't want to fly home just for an audition. So even though
I thought the script was great, I tossed it into the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when I got back to L.A., they called to say they'd found
their Will, but would I read for Jack? I said I'd love to.''
</P>
<P>
   The perennial problem for even the best second bananas is, of
course, that they tend to remain one-dimensional. That's why, now
that ``Will &AMP; Grace'' has been renewed for a second season, Hayes
is eager to have Jack evolve into more than a font of quips and bon
mots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the audience to see other sides of him,'' he says,
``to see him in more real situations. I love the fact that Jack
drifts from job to job _ but what about the other people in his
life? Who does he relate to, other than Will? I want to explore
stuff like that, and I know it will come with time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an early episode, Will explained to a colleague that he
couldn't tolerate Jack as a roommate because ``he keeps odd hours,
he's got the energy of a ferret and he's messy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Jack bemoaned his lack of ``me time,'' Will shot
back, ``all of your time is me time!''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to an oft-raised question: If Jack and Will are so
incompatible, why are they best friends?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' McCormack says, ``because after the third
episode, my sister asked me, `Are you ever going to be nice to
Jack?' She was really concerned, and I told the writers. So now
there are more little moments when they show their affection for
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really an opposites-attract thing,'' he adds.
``Will is very controlling, very passive-aggressive and, dare I use
the word, anal. He's a lawyer who deals with a lot of conservative
clients, and he doesn't have the opportunity to be flamboyant with
his sexuality the way that Jack can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometims it seems like Jack is just a setup for Will's
cutting remarks and vice versa,'' McCormack says. ``But I think
Will loves Jack's energy and loves how free he is and how much sex
he has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack and Will fulfill something that the other doesn't have,''
Hayes agrees. ``Will is like a big brother, even though we're
almost the same age. He kind of looks out for me, and I need that.
For my part, I'm the free spirit that Will wishes he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitcom stars always worry about being typecast if their show
succeeds, but Hayes says he isn't worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too late,'' he says, grinning. ``I already am. I swear to God,
every time I go to the grocery store, people yell out, `There's
Jack!'
</P>
<P>
   ``But am I concerned about that? It's something that's been
preying on my brain,'' he admits. ``There's always worry about
being stuck in TV-land, but there are ways around it. Once people
see me in at least one other light, they'll understand that I
didn't become an actor to play just one role.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hayes is perfectly content to appreciate the ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God that I enjoy coming to work every day,'' he says.
``There's no attitude, no star trips. It's a very comfortable
atmosphere, with everybody here to help each other _ it's really
friendly and wonderful. It's well-written, well-performed comedy.
That's all we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, these are characters that America's not used to seeing,
but our sole purpose is to entertain you and make you laugh. If you
like that, then tune in.''
</P>

MALIA ARGUES THAT RUSSIA IS SLOWER THAN EUROPE, NOT UNIQUE
</HEADLINE>

RUSSIA UNDER WESTERN EYES 
From the Bronze Horseman to the Lenin Mausoleum 
By Martin Malia 
Belknap/Harvard University Press, 514 pp., $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For centuries, observers of Russia have fallen into two grand
camps: those who view the vast country as ``Eastern,'' the land of
Scythians and Tatars, of obscurantism and despotism; and a minority
that views it as part of the outer reaches of Europe, imbued with
aspects of Western culture (though lacking liberal, democratic
institutions), a backwater, to be sure, but not a riddle, mystery
or enigma incomprehensibly alien to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Observers from the first camp subdivide on Russia's Soviet
experiment. Moscow's seven decades of communism are regarded either
as the natural outgrowth of czarist autocracy or as its perversion,
a utopian experiment gone deadly wrong thanks to the legacy of
backwardness left by the czars. Either view of the Soviet Union
configures Russia as irredeemably ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   In an elegant intellectual history that rubs the dust off those
lenses, the historian Martin Malia turns his eye to the European
cultural, political, and social traditions that have produced
assessments of Russia within those two broad molds. ``Russia Under
Western Eyes'' holds up a two-way mirror that sheds light not just
on Russia but on Europe's own cultures and institutions, from the
Enlightenment to fascism.
</P>
<P>
   To Malia, Russia, far from being essentially different from the
West, is part of an West-East cultural gradient, a concept that
posits Europe not as split between East and West but rather as a
single spectrum, with zones from developed to primitive.
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned Russia scholar, Malia considers Peter the Great's
victory over Sweden at Poltava in 1709 as the launch of Russia's
westward trajectory. That triumph, coupled with Peter's founding of
St. Petersburg as a ``window onto the West'' and development of
bureaucracy and policing, marked Russia's birth as a European power
within the Old Regime tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Catherine the Great's accession in 1762, an early
generation of ``philosophes,'' led by Voltaire, fell in love with
Russia and declared the country a model of enlightened monarchy
working to overcome cultural ``backwardness.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Catherine orchestrated two wars with Turkey,
three partitions of Poland, and a proposal to drive the Turks out
of Europe. While the communist-fearing West would later regard
similarly expansionist moves by the Soviet Union as a menace to
civilization, European observers had few problems with Catherine's
forays. Imperialism, whether Russian or European, was regarded as
the civilizing of barbarous lands and the normal course of
statecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Malia thus provides evidence early on that Western responses to
Russia are shaped less by what Russia actually does and more by the
cultural and ideological conditions through which the West views
those actions _ a very different argument from saying that Russia
is inherently expansionist (or inherently anything at all).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Malia writes that ``Russia's imperial career during
these four centuries was in many ways the Eastern front of what may
be called the European conquest of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 19th century, most of Europe had been convulsed by the
French Revolution in 1789 and thrown off the Old Regime. Not
Russia. The West viewed Alexander I as underpinning a bankrupt old
order, a despot ruling a barbarous land of serfs. By 1830, when
Nicholas I repressed a major Polish uprising, Russia was seen as
alien and out of step with the liberalizing times. In his widely
read travelogue, the marquis de Custine ignored the flowering of
Russian literature under Pushkin and Gogol and denigrated Russia as
an Asiatic outpost.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the 19th century, the West donned new
spectacles. Russia's intelligentsia, inspired by German Romanticism
and French radicalism, was seen as working to enact European-style
revolution and change. By the time of the Bolshevik Revolution in
1917, Russia is viewed as embodying Europe's most progressive and
egalitarian ideal, Socialism.
</P>
<P>
   That changes with the birth of the Soviet era and its camps and
annihilation of civil society. For most of the 20th century, the
West has viewed Russia as an aberration and a threat.
</P>
<P>
   In an era where liberal economics and static rational choice
models are often the spectacles through which the world is viewed,
Malia offers a reminder of the power of culture to shape ideas and
outcomes. But he falls short by reverting to an essentialistic
determinism about history in general and Russia in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Under Malia's eyes, post-Soviet Russia will eventually produce a
civil society and liberal culture. After arguing that culture
shapes analytical frameworks which in turn shape policies and
actions _ a process hardly teleological or linear _ his seems an
oddly deterministic conclusion. In fact, as it tracks the ebbs and
flows of Western images of Russia and ponders Moscow's recent
failure with market reforms, Malia's analysis points less to a
country converging with the West and more to one always dancing
around its edges.

AS DEVELOPMENT EDGES OUT RARE BIRDS, AUDUBON PINPOINTS MOST
VULNERABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas is for the birds. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   More bird species nest in, or migrate through, the Lone Star
State than any other state in the Union. Bird watchers have noted
615 species in Texas since records have been kept. The avian
abundance drew naturalist John James Audubon to Galveston in 1837.
</P>
<P>
   But the specialized habitats these birds require are fast
shrinking, primarily due to development, according to
conservationists. To coincide with Earth Day (last Thursday) and
Audubon's birthday Monday, the National Audubon Society has
released 50 state WatchLists calling attention to birds in jeopardy
of becoming endangered or threatened species. (The full reports are
available at www.audubon.org).
</P>
<P>
   National Audubon dubs the effort ``preventative medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't wait until a patient gets cancer to remedy the
situation,'' said Noreen Damude, director of bird conservation with
the Texas Audubon Society. ``You do the HMO thing: You monitor, you
manage, you watch the population and nip things in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Damude, we chose to highlight nine Texas
WatchList species of high or extremely high priority, plus the
Franklin's Gull, a national WatchList bird that migrates through
Texas in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   FRANKLIN'S GULL
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Migrates through central and coastal Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Common gull of the prairies _ not the
kind picking hot dog buns out of the Dumpster in the beach parking
lot, notes Damude. This gull spends winters as far south as Chile
and summers in Canada and the Northern Midwest, but stops over in
Texas on its annual migrations.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Loss of stopover habitat, such as prairie
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SWAINSON'S WARBLER
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Hardwood forests, woodland swamps and canebrake along
the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: ``A skulker, seldom seen,'' notes a
``Field Guide to the Birds of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Brown-headed cowbirds, who lay their eggs in
the warblers' nests. Not recognizing the difference, the warblers
incubate both sets of eggs. Upon hatching, the aggressive cowbird
chicks eat more food and make more noise, causing the warblers to
ignore their own chicks, who eventually die. Also, collisions with
towers and lighthouses. Habitat loss.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HENSLOW'S SPARROW
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Wet shrubby fields of East Texas (a subpopulation near
Houston is possibly extinct).
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Low, jerky flight.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Habitat loss due to suburban development and
farming practices.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AUDUBON'S ORIOLE (formerly called black-headed oriole)
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Tropical bird found in far South Texas brush country.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Nests in a pouch of green grass hung
in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: The bronzed cowbird does the same thing to this
oriole that the brown-headed cowbird does to the Swainson's
warbler. Also, habitat loss.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   LESSER PRAIRIE CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: The high and rolling plains of the Panhandle
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Male has yellow eye combs and a
reddish neck pouch.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Habitat loss.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   CHUCK-WILL'S-WIDOW
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Woodlands of Central and East Texas
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Nocturnal insectivores, the bird flies
at night with its mouth open, ``like a vacuum cleaner in the sky,''
said Damude.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Nesting on the ground makes them vulnerable to
predators. Habitat loss.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   REDDISH EGRET
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Shallow, open salt pans of the Texas Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: ``Dances'' while feeding, with wings
spread in a canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Hunted for their breeding plumage in the early
1900s (they went extinct in Florida), they have never quite
recovered. Increased salinity of the waterways where the bird
fishes has damaged its food supply. Also, destruction of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   PAINTED BUNTING
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Low thickets and woodland borders of the Hill Country
to the eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Splendiferous color of the male.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Captured as cage birds. Habitat loss.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BACHMAN'S SPARROW
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Long-leaf pine forests of East Texas. The birds like
forest floors clear of shrubs and saplings _ in other words,
forests that experience fires on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Its beautiful song, an introductory
note followed by a trill.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Habitat loss due to forest-fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN PLOVER
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Dry uplands of the Davis Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: A fast runner that rarely flies.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Drought. Habitat loss due to ranching
practices.
</P>
<P>

threatened species:  &QL;

kind picking hot dog buns out of the Dumpster in the beach parking
lot, notes Damude. This gull spends winters as far south as Chile
and summers in Canada and the Northern Midwest, but stops over in
Texas on its annual migrations.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Loss of stopover habitat, such as prairie
wetlands.

<P>
   SWAINSON'S WARBLER
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Hardwood forests, woodland swamps and canebrake along
the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: ``A skulker, seldom seen,'' notes a
``Field Guide to the Birds of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Brown-headed cowbirds, who lay their eggs in
the warblers' nests. Not recognizing the difference, the warblers
incubate both sets of eggs. Upon hatching, the aggressive cowbird
chicks eat more food and make more noise, causing the warblers to
ignore their own chicks, who eventually die. Also, collisions with
towers and lighthouses. Habitat loss.

<P>
   HENSLOW'S SPARROW
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Wet shrubby fields of East Texas (a subpopulation near
Houston is possibly extinct).
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Low, jerky flight.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Habitat loss due to suburban development and
farming practices.

<P>
   AUDUBON'S ORIOLE (formerly called black-headed oriole)
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Tropical bird found in far South Texas brush country.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Nests in a pouch of green grass hung
in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: The bronzed cowbird does the same thing to this
oriole that the brown-headed cowbird does to the Swainson's
warbler. Also, habitat loss.

   CHUCK-WILL'S-WIDOW
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Woodlands of Central and East Texas
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Nocturnal insectivores, the bird flies
at night with its mouth open, ``like a vacuum cleaner in the sky,''
said Damude.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Nesting on the ground makes them vulnerable to
predators. Habitat loss.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   REDDISH EGRET
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Shallow, open salt pans of the Texas Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: ``Dances'' while feeding, with wings
spread in a canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Primary threats: Hunted for their breeding plumage in the early
1900s (they went extinct in Florida), they have never quite
recovered. Increased salinity of the waterways where the bird
fishes has damaged its food supply. Also, destruction of wetlands.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BACHMAN'S SPARROW
</P>
<P>
   Habitat: Long-leaf pine forests of East Texas. The birds like
forest floors clear of shrubs and saplings _ in other words,
forests that experience fires on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Defining characteristics: Its beautiful song, an introductory
note followed by a trill.
</P>

100 YEARS AFTER HIS BIRTH, DUKE ELLINGTON'S SWINGING MUSIC STILL
REIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanied by ELLINGTON-CENTENNIAL, ESSENTIAL ELLINGTON,
ELLINGTON-CHRONOLOGY)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Go back.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the '40s, the Golden Days; train travel was tops,
doors were left unlocked and radio was king. Go back to find Duke
Ellington and band onstage somewhere in the night; somewhere
perfume and sweat and saxophone solos float side-by-side in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's out front, impeccably dressed and regal as a prince _
behind him, the orchestra goes from unstoppable swing on
``Happy-Go-Lucky Local'' and ``Daybreak Express'' to a soft, satiny
blues and back again. Dancers spin and sweat and fly, and through
it all Duke smiles, taking care of business, the band's sweet,
jazzy hum purring like a sports car. When it's all over, he'll
climb aboard another train, ride to some other town to dream, to
write, always to write, filling the coffers of American song with
some of the most sophisticated, enduring jazz ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington swung, and the world swung with him _ for more
than 50 years, from high-school dances to Carnegie Hall to
cathedrals to concert halls in London and Paris. And still the
world heeds the call. Still, we want to get out there and shake a
tail feather to ``Take the ``A'' Train'' and ``C Jam Blues'' and
sway with our sweetie to ``Rocks in My Bed.'' Still, the young
musicians learn the charts and pore over the crackly old
recordings, and still the soul is soothed by tunes such as ``Come
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years after his birth in Washington, D.C., and 25
years after his death in New York City, the world is loving Edward
Kennedy ``Duke'' Ellington all over again, loving him with an
intensity not seen since the '40s, when he and his crack band
defined big-band, swinging jazz and left the blueprint hundreds of
other groups would follow.
</P>
<P>
   This only makes sense, as Ellington was always resolutely part
of his time and usually well ahead of it. His bands always included
the finest musicians of the day, from trumpeter Cootie Williams to
saxophonist Johnny Hodges to bassist Jimmy Blanton.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when recordings were defined by three-minute songs
on brittle 78-rpm records, he wrote ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' a
50-minute piece detailing the movement of African-Americans from
the shores of America to the Harlem Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington became a legend and a pivotal figure in jazz before he
was 35 and an ambassador of American music years before he and his
band members could even eat at the same lunch counters or drink out
of the same water fountains as many of the people who bought their
records.
</P>
<P>
   Men admired him, and women loved him: He was a man of the world,
a profile of style, sophistication and success at a time when many
African-Americans were leaving the poverty and oppression of the
Deep South to find new homes, new careers and new freedom in
far-flung cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no ambition to reach some intellectual plateau and look
down on people,'' he said in 1959. ``I only want what any other
American artist wants _ and that is freedom of expression and of
communication with our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   He got it _ and now homage is paid all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellington centennial is being marked by celebrations from
coast to coast, dozens of performances and workshops by Jazz at
Lincoln Center, a PBS special with live performances by the Wynton
Marsalis-led Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, and numerous reissues
of much of his classic music.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way is the Tuesday release of the largest boxed set
in jazz history, a 24-CD monster detailing his RCA Victor
recordings, which stretched from 1927 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Pulitzer Prize committee gave Ellington a
special citation recognizing ``his musical genius in the medium of
jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   And along with all this comes a real sense of again appreciating
all that the man did: There was, first of all, the enormous number
of compositions _ such as ``Mood Indigo,'' ``Sophisticated Lady''
and ``Daybreak Express'' _ that became absolute jazz standards.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the variety. Ellington wrote everything: popular
dance tunes; suites honoring Harlem, the Deep South and
Shakespeare, among others; soundtracks; ballads; religious music;
and more.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there's his amazing longevity as a band leader.
Ellington kept an orchestra together for 50 years, along the way
employing some of the greatest names in jazz _ Cootie Williams, Ben
Webster, Johnny Hodges, Jimmy Blanton, Louie Bellson and Paul
Gonsalves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz is the only American art form _ it originated on American
soil,'' said Rob Gibson, executive producer and director of Jazz at
Lincoln Center. ``If we have a great composer in our art form _ our
Shakespeare, our Goethe _ Ellington is it. He is one of America's
great creative voices. One of our slogans is, `All jazz is modern'
and he's still modern _ he made 20th-century music.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   And it is precisely the variety of what the man wrote that makes
widespread celebrations of his birth so natural. According to jazz
producer and writer Orrin Keepnews, Ellington is so fundamental to
the history of modern music that ``his genius isn't questioned by
anybody, which only happens at the highest level of art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about an Ellington or a Picasso,'' said
Keepnews, coordinating producer of the RCA mega-box. ``And people
in jazz are pleased to have a concrete, universally recognized
opportunity to make a fuss over Ellington. The American public
loves to play numbers games, and here's a perfect opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   That Ellington was such a nice man certainly doesn't hurt. Two
people who worked with him _ gospel singer Queen Esther Marrow and
Dallas composer/band leader Randall Keith Horton _ both recall his
quiet confidence and gentleness as much as his talent.
</P>
<P>
   To Marrow, who performed with him in the '60s, he was ``a very
easy, quiet person _ he didn't say much, but when he did, my
goodness, he said a lot. He had eyes that could look right through
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton first met Ellington in the '60s and was his composing and
conducting assistant for three months in 1973. Even then, near the
very end, he was ``very energetic and businesslike,'' Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the boss and he was in charge, but there was a lot of
humor,'' said Horton, who will lecture on Ellington at Fort Worth
Country Day School on Thursday. ``I'm gonna tell you, it was like I
was 10 years old _ I'd breathe every three days. Once. But he
talked as though he knew me forever. He had so much vigor and
vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is his importance for young people now? Enormous, when
one considers how popular swing music is these days: Ellington, it
should be remembered, made his name as a leader of a band that
played for dancers, and his music was rooted in the rhythms of New
Orleans as much as the stride piano players, such as Fats Waller
and Willie ``The Lion'' Smith, who congregated in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ellington was famous for writing for individual band
members, for doing songs (or rearranging songs he'd already
recorded) to fit the strengths of the players in his band at that
moment. Because he kept band members for so long, he could tailor
his music to their strengths.
</P>
<P>
   And this makes his music invaluable to young musicians, said Tom
Burchill, jazz studies director at Weatherford Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you learn one Ellington tune, you learn all about jazz,''
said Burchill. ``With his music, you think about volume and colors.
Everybody in his band had a unique voice _ everybody sounded
different. Cootie Williams was hired just to play plunger on the
trumpet _ that bluesy wah-waaaaaah sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``His band was a community, and when you learn one of his pieces
you have to copy, in a sense, these individual voices. So it gets
kids thinking about the nuances. His music is never above your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Endlessly accessible and inventive, and evoking a vanished, more
innocent America, his is music that still sounds at home wherever
jazz is played. Duke Ellington created a world unto himself, but
one that we are all still welcome to.

A SIMPLE POIGNANT NOVEL THAT ROAMS WITH ITS CENTRAL CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS 
By David Guterson. Harcourt Brace. 279 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geography is a vast metaphor for some writers and an anchor for
others: Whether sky or river or a rush-hour subway, the physical
palpability of place tells us where, and therefore who, we are. For
David Guterson, place is the point itself: the sine qua non of his
fiction, abundant and overpowering and utterly in charge of
whatever unfolds there. His first novel, ``Snow Falling on
Cedars,'' was admired for its riveting portrait of an entire island
community over two generations, but it was the feel of San Piedro
Island _ its fishing and strawberry industries, its fog-bound
grievances and thwarted hopes _ that made the story so indelibly
haunting.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Guterson's setting of choice, both in
fiction and reality, is Washington state, where the great frontier
odysseys of American history ended abruptly, halted by an ocean
boundary and no doubt by beauty itself. Now myth and mystique live
there hand in hand, along with ornery, elegant stories of the
people who kept going until they simply couldn't go any farther.
That's a fitting thematic landscape for Ben Givens, who is
terminally ill and seems hellbent and determined to walk half of
the state before he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``East of the Mountains'' is an ode to the apple country hemmed
in by the Cascades: tattered by strip malls and trailers but still
awesomely lovely; cultivated and reshaped by orchardists but
nonetheless larger than anyone who ever tried to claim it. We don't
often see this piece of the Great Northwest in fiction; it's too
much a jumble of isolation, human aggression, and mountainous
dominion to lend itself to easy translation. If gold indeed has
resided within those quiet peaks, not all that many writers have
been tempted to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Next to its predecessor, Guterson's second novel is a smaller
story, and its shortcomings will inevitably be compared to the
ambition of ``Snow Falling on Cedars.'' But in focusing upon the
struggles of a man at the end of his days, ``East of the
Mountains'' strips itself clean of some of the overwriting and
suspense-ridden hooks that ``Cedars'' suffered from. This is a
simply derived, mostly poignant novel that roams the remote world
of fruit harvesting in central Washington; because of Ben Givens's
perspective, the land shimmers with a particular vision usually
afforded only those who are having to relinquish it.
</P>
<P>
   A retired heart surgeon in Seattle, Ben is still mourning the
death of his beloved Rachel, to whom he was married for a
half-century, when he is diagnosed with cancer of the colon. He has
a daughter and grandchildren nearby, but he remains stunned by the
implausibility of life without Rachel, and his prognosis _ less
than a year to live, most of it promising terrible pain _ persuades
him to wrest the wheel from death by killing himself. In the
opening pages of the novel, he is organizing this mission with the
careful precision that often anticipates suicide: He plans to take
his two Brittany spaniels and his Winchester rifle into the breaks
on the other side of the mountains, where he'll go bird hunting one
last time, then arrange his shooting death to look like an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   This darkly meticulous plan, which involves freeing his dogs and
saying a veiled goodbye to his family, goes awry almost from the
beginning, as it obviously must in order to provide us with a
novel. His four-wheel-drive packed to the hilt with dogs and
hunting paraphernalia, Ben has an accident on the freeway that
leaves him injured, badly shaken, and without a vehicle. And so
begins his real odyssey, a journey of picaresque mishaps that pave
the way for several wayfaring strangers to appear _ most of whom
will teach Ben something he needs to know about death or the living
that precedes it. His saga unfolds in cross cuts with his memories;
as he makes his way across the orchard lands of his childhood, he's
transported back to the harvest where he fell in love with Rachel,
then the second World War that took them both to the front _ her as
a nurse, him as a rifle infantryman. He has to confront the
equivocal legacy of his family's affection for hunting; his own
skills and limitations as a physician; the reasons he can and
cannot tolerate living one more day. Throughout this hopeless
pilgrimage he carries the humiliations and ironies of his body's
surrender: As a man who devoted a lifetime to the human heart, he
finds his own unequipped to handle the fact of his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   But what ought to be most moving about ``East of the Mountains''
turns out to be its greatest weakness. Ben's ambivalence about
suicide is pain-racked and topsy-turvy; one moment he can't bear
another moment of consciousness, the next he can't imagine leaving
it. While this state of wild uncertainty is not uncommon to
suicidality, here it's delivered with whimsy instead of volatility.
The melodramatic shorthand with which Guterson conveys these mood
swings make Ben seem capricious, rather than tormented, even though
it's plenty evident from his character that he has spent his life
being a deliberate man. A few similar glitches in plot feel
hurried, particularly a predictable denouement that could have been
conceived on ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Such failures seem unnecessary, partly because Guterson is a
writer of some depth: You can feel the thoughtfulness behind this
novel, even when it suffers weaknesses of style and dialogue. He
has a wonderful eye for the arcane fact, as well as the ability to
describe it: The materiel stacked along the roads leading to the
Italian front, for instance, ``resembled a kind of wooden hedge too
high to see over.'' Ben's war memories, in fact, are chillingly
conveyed, as is the terrifying scene when his dogs are attacked by
a coyote-hunting pack of Irish wolfhounds. High-pitched action
scenes are no small victory, and Guterson has a remarkable touch
with them; these moments give us Ben in his aged entirety, and make
him seem all the more heroic in his final battle.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, of course, the way ``East of the Mountains'' begins
and will end _ with a man's last tour of duty, traveling back to
the orchards he cherished as a boy and the memories of the
brown-skinned girl he met there. So east of the mountains, in
Guterson's world of sovereign landscape, really is the other side:
the place that never retreats in the imagination, the place for
which we always yearn. ``And I am become like dust and ashes,'' Ben
reads from Job, having stumbled upon a Gideon's Bible in a bleak
motel. In describing the world of a dying man, Guterson invokes the
ultimate book of suffering _ then, to his great credit, offers it
here as consolation rather than despair.

NEW ORLEANS IS WILD ABOUT DEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ He lived here for less than six months and has
been gone for 126 years, but Edgar Degas will make a triumphant
return this spring at a New Orleans Museum of Art exhibition to
highlight ``Francofete,'' an observance accentuating Louisiana's
French connection.
</P>
<P>
   The only French Impressionist to travel to the United States,
Degas visited relatives in New Orleans during the winter of 1873.
He was 38, and his talent was still several years from being
recognized. Of his 22 works traced to this period, 17 New Orleans
scenes will be on display along with two dozen other of his pieces.
No art show has generated this much anticipation in the region
since Monet's water lillies made a stop here four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Feigenbaum, the museum's curator of painting, says there is
no way to be sure if Degas's art ``would have looked the same if he
had not come here,'' but she is convinced that ``the visual
experience of New Orleans transferred to his aesthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have suggested that the colors of New Orleans had a
lasting impact on Degas, and the city's influence has been found in
works he completed years after he returned to France.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century nears its end, New Orleans is prepared to
embrace Degas again.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are expecting a jam of monstrous proportions when
``Degas and New Orleans: A French Impressionist in America'' opens
May 1. That coincides with the final weekend of the New Orleans
Jazz &AMP; Heritage Festival, an event that annually draws tens of
thousands to the Crescent City. The exhibit will run through Aug.
29, providing an attraction during summer months, when tourism
ebbs.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the exhibit will be Degas's famous canvas ``A
Cotton Office in New Orleans,'' a scene in which his uncle, two
brothers, and various cousins served as models for dark-suited
cotton brokers. It became the first 19th-century Impressionist
painting to be purchased by a French museum, and the work will be
on loan from the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Pau, France.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta a rival
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before landing the cotton office painting, New Orleans had to
compete with Atlanta, which is currently hosting a major exhibit of
French Impressionists. ``We felt we had to get it,'' Feigenbaum
says. ``It was an important work for us to get.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last month, couriers have been bringing other
priceless Degas works from France, Denmark, the Netherlands, the
Bahamas, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts sent three works, and Harvard
University's Fogg Museum sent a companion piece to the cotton
office tableau.
</P>
<P>
   One work that will return to the public eye is ``The Nurse (La
Garde-Malade),'' a gouache that depicts a sickroom vigil. It has
been locked in a private vault and unseen for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, relatives of the artist have contributed other
artifacts. New Orleans was the home of his mother, Celestine Musson
Degas, and a number of descendants of the Musson family still live
here.
</P>
<P>
   Feigenbaum had only a year to assemble the collection after the
Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism asked for
a special event tied to the Louisiana-France celebration.
Generally, four years are needed to develop this kind of project.
``We envisioned maybe only a dozen works, something really
intimate,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But museums and private collectors responded quickly and
generously because New Orleans represented a special place for
Degas. When the artist joined his two brothers here, the city was
still under occupation by Federal troops following the Civil War.
Though Reconstruction and pestilence gnawed at the city's joie de
vivre, Degas experienced exotica in New Orleans that made Paris
seem almost mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of a massive river, the Mississippi, and rich
foliage, Degas was introduced to a world of Southern customs,
racial passions, and pagan revelry. He discovered ``free men of
color'' _ Creoles with African blood _ among his New Orleans
cousins, even as other relatives, future members of the notorious
White League, plotted a violent insurrection against the Yankee
forces.
</P>
<P>
   There were duels under the oaks of City Park, and dysfunction
ruled Degas's American family. His brother Rene married a first
cousin, then abandoned her to elope with another New Orleans siren.
It was the stuff of 19th-century soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A turning point
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his 1997 book, ``Degas in New Orleans,'' Christopher Benfey
wrote: ``The journey to New Orleans marked a key moment in Degas's
career. . . . Distracted and stalled in his profession on his
arrival, he left the city with a new sense of direction and
resolve. He also took with him, in his portfolio and his mind,
several unforgettable images of New Orleans life.''
</P>
<P>
   His uncle's home, where Degas stayed, still stands on Esplanade,
a boulevard that connects the French Quarter and City Park. The
house is within walking distance of the city's venerable
thoroughbred track, the Fairgrounds. Racehorses were a favorite
theme for Degas. ``We can only assume he went to the Fairgrounds,''
Feigenbaum says. ``We have tried, but we can't link his racing
pictures to New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the city was clearly the source for another of the artist's
obsessions. Degas was fascinated by his first cousin, Estelle, the
young widow of a Confederate soldier. ``One cannot look at her
without thinking that in front of that head there are the eyes of a
dying man,'' Degas once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as she grew blind, Estelle became the scorned bride of
Degas's brother. Her sorrowful face is depicted in several works,
including a portrait in the permanent collection of the New Orleans
Museum of Art that local citizens brought home through a public
subscription drive 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Degas sailed back to France following Mardi Gras in 1873 and
never returned. But he retained sketches and memories of New
Orleans. Years later, when his contemporary Paul Gauguin considered
the South Seas as a setting for his art, Degas recommended New
Orleans instead. Of course, the South Sea Islands were strange,
Degas said, but New Orleans stood out as one of the most exotic
places on earth.

THERE COMES A TIME IN LIFE TO SHUN RISK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 60 and will retire in about a year.
Our assets include various IRAs invested as follows: $390,000 in a
money market fund, $90,000 in Loomis Sayles Bond fund, $280,000 in
Vanguard Star fund, $200,000 in Vanguard Intermediate Bond fund,
and $90,000 in US Treasury strips. We also have $450,000 in stock
that we plan to use for our grandchildren's education. Our cash
reserves are $70,000 in a tax-free money market account. I'd like
to restructure the retirement funds so that we can draw upon the
accounts, but also realize growth. We would need about $70,000 a
year. We both will receive Social Security at age 62. We are
conservative. I see the need for balanced, fixed income,
international, and small cap funds to maintain our asset value.
</P>
<P>
   T.E., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems to me that you've taken the opposite tack of most
people _ maintaining your savings in conservative income-oriented
holdings while they accumulated, and now contemplating diversifying
into riskier (but potentially more rewarding) investment vehicles
upon retirement. Fortunately, you've saved enough money so that you
can probably make some of the moves you contemplate without
assuming too much risk.
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin with the idea that your first year of retirement
will be an anomalous, during which you will require a $70,000
income stream from your savings. But in the second and subsequent
years, both of you will have Social Security income, so you will
need to withdraw a good deal less. I'll assume here that your
combined Social Security income will be about $25,000 at age 62;
you can plug in the appropriate figure and make the adjustments. By
this reasoning, you'd need a fixed-income portfolio sufficient to
provide you with $45,000 a year, which is to say, a pool of about
$700,000, presuming you would achieve an average 6.5 percent yield
from this side of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the Vanguard Star account to one side, the remainder of
the IRA accounts, all now in fixed-income investments, come to
$770,000. If you follow my line of thinking, you would confine your
diversification into more risky stock-oriented investments to that
extra $70,000. I suggest you withdraw that amount from the money
market fund, putting it in a broadly diversified mutual fund
portfolio. If you were using Fidelity, for example, you might buy
$20,000 worth of Spartan Market Index fund (a Standard and Poor's
Index 500 fund), $20,000 in Puritan (like Vanguard Star, a balanced
fund), and $10,000 each in Fidelity's OTC, Overseas, and Select
Health Care funds.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, you would have a little more than 25 percent of the
retirement portfolio set aside to produce long-term growth to
protect you from the effects of inflation in the later years of
your retirement, and while some of the all-stock funds represent a
level of risk that hasn't been typical of your savings to date,
these are relatively small positions when you compare them to the
dominant holdings in the two balanced funds _ Vanguard Star and
Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's go back and look at the fixed-income side more
closely. Presuming you followed my suggestion of withdrawing that
$70,000 from the money market fund, at $320,000 it would still
represent the largest single element of your portfolio. I know
you're conservative, but I think you're being over-cautious -- and
you won't get a portfolio average 6.5 percent yield with more than
45 percent of the portfolio in the money markets. I would design
the fixed-income portfolio so that about half of it is in
traditional bond funds such as Loomis Sayles and Vanguard
Intermediate bond funds, putting 25 percent into riskier holdings,
such as Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund, and the final 25
percent in less risky holdings, such as Vanguard Short-Term
Corporate Bond fund. If your fundamental conservatism dictates that
you hold onto some of the money market position, you could
substitute that for the Short-Term Bond fund, but the important
thing is to reduce it to 25 percent of the fixed-income portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow these suggestions, the plan would require that you
reduce your cash reserves by $25,000 during the first year of your
retirement, but after that you could leave that account alone and
it would slowly -- very slowly -- rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 36 years old and am currently enrolled in my employer's
401(k) plan, to which I contribute $280 a month and my employer
matches up to $500 a year. Until recently I had been putting 25
percent in Vanguard Wellington, 25 percent in Vanguard Windsor, and
50 percent in Vanguard Primecap funds. I withdrew all of the money
from the Wellington and Windsor funds and divided it between the
Primecap account and Vanguard's Index 500 funds. The balance is now
$18,300 in Index 500 and $19,600 in Primecap. I am allocating 50
percent of ongoing contributions to each of the funds. Should I
continue on this track or should I be more diversified? Can you
estimate what I would have if I retired at age 60 or 65?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Mansfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the result of your un-diversification is that you have
all of your retirement money in funds which fall in the same class
_ large-cap stock funds with portfolios representing a blend of
value- and growth-oriented stocks. It is, indeed, a category which
has done remarkably well in recent years, but my strong bet would
be that over the long run you would go a great deal better if you
went back to the idea of diversification. I don't know what the
menu of your 401(k) plan is, so I'll draw a general plan presuming
that all of Vanguard's funds were available, and you can see how
close you can come with the specific menu that's offered to you.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I agree that the large cap stocks should dominate
the portfolio, but I'd limit the category to 60 percent of the
total, using either Primecap or Index 500 or both. I would look for
10 percent each in the following funds: Vanguard Mid-Cap Index,
Small-Cap Index or Small-Cap Value Index, International Growth or
International Value, and Select Health Care (which is closed to new
retail investors, but members of 401(k) plans may be able to enter
it). If Health Care is not available, you'll find nothing that
represents a close approximation, so I would put that money either
in Windsor II or Index Value. If Windsor II is not available, I
would not compromise with Windsor, which has been having all kind
of troubles and undergoing major changes recently, but go to Index
Value.
</P>
<P>
   As for the likely accumulation, these calculations can sound
very precise, but they are nothing but rough projections. For a
very long-term program such as yours, I usually estimate average
annual total returns of 10 percent for stock-dominated portfolios.
With that presumption, the computer shows that if you (and your
employer) continue contributions at current levels, you would have
$730,511 after 24 years and $1,125,952 after 29 years. But you
should do much better if you adopt this discipline: Every time you
get a raise, increase your contribution to the 401(k) by the same
percentage. Over the course of the many years that this account
will be building, that move could make a tremendous difference.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Years ago I opened a Uniform Gift To Minors account for each
of my twin grandsons. The money was invested in Putnam Voyager fund
and it has done well _ each account now amounts to about $26,000.
When I opened the accounts, I named my daughter as custodian. Now
the twins are approaching their 18th birthdays, and even though
they are very good boys and excellent students, I don't really want
them to have full possession of this money. They are now juniors in
high school, and soon will be seniors. California law says they
will be entitled to their money when they reach 18. They are going
to college in a little over a year. We have allowed them to make
some withdrawals, such as for the cost of SAT tests. What would be
a good solution?
</P>
<P>
   I.K., Bonita, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. As a matter of law, I don't think there is a solution, but as
a matter of practicality, it seems to me that if they want to go to
college, they should be willing to go along with any program that
you and their parents lay out. You don't specify whether you intend
this to be used for their education, or whether their parents have
established accounts on their own to fund their education. But if
your daughter sees things the same way that you do, you and your
daughter could sit down with them and spell out your financial
plans for college. As gently as possible, you could suggest that if
they don't treat this money the way you desire, they needn't expect
further financial aid from either of you. Since I presume that by
now they realize how important college will be for them, they're
likely to go along with whatever you spell out. And if they don't?
I'm afraid theres not much you can do about it. Gift means gift,
and although the UGMA status tied strings around it, those strings
are about to come loose, whether the donor likes it or not.

FAMILY TO BURY LONG-LOST VIETNAM VETERAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Navy Cmdr. John C. Mape, father of seven, was 40
when he died flying a mission over North Vietnam in the spring of
1966.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the family will bury the remains _ identified late
last year through DNA testing _ of the father who perished so long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Mape's death, his wife, Patricia, and their
children, ages 2 to 14, were eagerly awaiting his homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his death, the family posed for a photograph for a
local newspaper. As one daughter held a framed photo of her father,
the youngest could not contain her joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the cameraman posed the group, the youngest of the children
_ 2-year-old Sally _ suddenly spied her father's face,'' the
article said. ``Daddy, she cried delightedly, kissing the
photograph full on the lips. Daddy ...''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years have passed since the day John Mape's
Skyraider tumbled out of control over North Vietnam, after a
surface-to-air missile exploded beneath the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``No parachute was observed, and no emergency-beeper signals
were detected,'' a Navy report said about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots of the other two aircraft made a visual inspection
of the wreckage and reported their belief that Commander Mape could
not have survived the impact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, the Mape family has celebrated
birthdays, graduations, weddings, the birth of grandchildren, and
the arrival of the first great-grandchild. Family members have
buried John Mape's mother, his twin sister and older brother.
</P>
<P>
   The journey that brought Mape home began in 1991, when a team of
American and Vietnamese investigators interviewed villagers living
near the crash site. They returned again in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team returned in 1994, they learned that the
Vietnamese government had arrested some people for excavating
remains from that site,'' said Larry Greer, a Defense Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, Vietnamese officials returned those remains to the
U.S. government in a solemn repatriation ceremony in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   A military honor guard stood at attention as a special case
bearing the remains was reverently placed into a polished metal
coffin. An American flag was then stretched across the top.
</P>
<P>
   When the coffin arrived at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, it
was welcomed by an honor guard.
</P>
<P>
   The precious bone fragments inside were later identified in the
base's laboratory as belonging to Mape.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, two of Mape's five daughters _ Judy Palhegyi and
Sue Gray of Sonora, Calif. _ accompanied the remains of their
father home from Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really, really happy,'' Palhegyi said upon their return.
``We feel very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Air Force base, they were shown into a room with their
father's coffin. His remains _ 55 tiny bone fragments _ had been
wrapped in a special blanket and placed in the coffin. On top of
the remains was a carefully laid out dress uniform, pinned with the
nine medals Mape had earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent some time in the room alone with my father,'' said
Palhegyi, who was 9 when he died. ``We brought my rosary beads, my
father's missal and a pair of cuff links Mom had gotten for him
years ago as a gift. We placed them in the casket with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Mape Sarris, Mape's only surviving sibling, is relieved the
long search for her brother has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sorry my sister Joan and brother Vance aren't living
to see this,'' said Sarris, 76, who lives in Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, Sarris said, Mape had planned to become a priest,
and enrolled at a seminary boarding school as a teen-ager. He
continued his priesthood studies at St. Patrick's College in Menlo
Park, and graduated in 1948 with a degree in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   While still in college, he changed his mind about becoming a
priest, after a period of intense reflection, Sarris said. But he
remained devoted to his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic chaplain aboard the USS Ticonderoga said Jack
would go to Mass aboard ship every morning,'' Sarris said. ``He
always ended his letters `Love and Prayers, Jack.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sarris said Mape, who became the commanding officer of his
squadron in 1965 in a ceremony aboard the Ticonderoga, was devoted
to his men.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did so much work building morale among the men in his
squadron,'' she said. ``He was someone special to follow. He moved
in a quiet way, but he did so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarris said one of Mape's most fervent wishes came true _ all of
his men returned home safely from the war.
</P>
<P>
   The burial on Friday in San Mateo will be a time of mixed
emotions for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out the DNA test was positive, I realized we were
going to be planning a funeral,'' said another daughter, Teresa
Mape, 47. ``Even though the good part is having closure, it's still
pretty sad.''
</P>
<P>
   There is sadness, but there are also happy memories _ of the dad
who taught her to ride a bike, who brought home a French doll in
19th-century clothing from a Mediterranean cruise, whose postcards
and letters she will always treasure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to daughters Teresa, Judy Palhegyi and Sue Gray, and
sister Mary, Mape is survived by his widow, Patricia Carothers, of
Reno, Nev.; sons Christopher of Olympia, Wash., and Michael of
Tracy, Calif.; daughters Mary of Aurora, Colo., and Sara of San
Francisco; nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

FRAILTY MYTH HAUNTS WOMEN IN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By MARY DUFFY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent article published in The British Journal of Sports
Medicine, a sociologist proposed a theory that could launch a
thousand hours of talk-radio discussion.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a history of medical myths and a lack of athletic
opportunity, it is at least possible, suggested Dr. Ellis Cashmore,
a professor at Staffordshire University in Stoke-on-Trent, England,
that in all sports that demand skill as opposed to pure brawn,
women might have been competing at levels comparable with their
male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   That the genetic advantage men have in strength could, perhaps,
in some sports, be overcome by women's skill or endurance, strikes
many as heresy, reported Cashmore, who first discussed medical
myths and female athletes in ``Making Sense of Sports'' (Routledge,
1996). This in spite of the fact that in head-to-head competition
with men, women have sometimes won ultramarathons, as well as
long-distance cycling and swimming races.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the Berlin Wall has crumbled in the Cold
War against women's sports. But the lingering view of the ``weaker
sex,'' said Cashmore, is a hurdle female athletes still have to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, girls' and women's physical activity at all ages
has been strictly circumscribed by doctors and physical educators,
explained Dr. Patricia Vertinsky, a professor at the University of
British Columbia in Vancouver. She has written extensively on what
she calls the medicalization of the female body.
</P>
<P>
   Cashmore observed, ``While we've come a long way from the days
when physicians warned that running could cause a woman's uterus to
drop, the legacy of that kind of medical discourse is the view we
still hold that women are more susceptible to damage, they are
somehow more precious.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Sabo, a sociologist and author of ``Men's Health and
Illness'' (Sage, 1995), said: ``Society has always used sport as a
vehicle to proclaim men's physical superiority over women. While
boys were exerting their superiority on the playing field, girls
were learning that their bodies weren't made for sports.''
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, doctors said women did not have the
physical stamina to take part in athletics, and any attempt would
endanger their mental and physical health. Attention was usually
focused on the damage athletics could have on their reproductive
organs, while a man's more exposed organs were never an issue.
Until the 1970s, Sabo said, the predominant view was ``Keep women
out of sports to protect them from their own frailty.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sea change in attitude about women and girls in
sports, among doctors today there are still vestiges of the once
pervasive attitude that strenuous exercise is bad for a woman's
health, in particular her reproductive health, said Dr. James
Clapp, an obstetrician in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   He has done research on pregnant athletes for 15 years and says
the exercise guidelines endorsed by most obstetricians are ``very
conservative for an active, fit woman.'' Instead, he said, most
forms of moderate exercise benefit both the woman and fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of this overprotective attitude toward women is
the expectation that men should ignore the pain and persevere.
After all, at the turn of the century, in an increasingly
industrialized age, we institutionalized sports as a way to toughen
up boys, test their masculinity and train them for military service
or business. To this day that stoicism is reflected in the way we
cast a blind eye to risks and injuries that sports pose for young
men.
</P>
<P>
   Vertinsky added: ``When we do focus attention on sports injuries
with boys or men. Most often we measure the impact in terms of
future play or career, not long-term health.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With a boys-will-be-boys-attitude, we expect young men to get
roughed up in sports. It is part of the game. But girls venture
onto the field with the subtle message, be careful, don't get hurt.
When any child is injured playing sports, it is frightening. But
when the athlete carried off the field sports a ponytail, people
are more likely to question why she was there in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Cashmore's argument that progress of
women in sport has been handicapped, not by their own frailty or
bodily deficiencies but by myths about their physical abilities.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the many physiological differences between men and
women, Cashmore said, various studies have shown that both bodies
respond similarly to training and diet. ``Women cannot close the
strength gap entirely,'' Cashmore said, ``but they can get to
within 5 percent of an equivalent body-weight male.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at 35 years of marathon records, Cashmore found that
women's best times had improved by an annual average of 2 minutes
and 47 seconds, as against just 66 seconds for men.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that women were virtually banned from sports until
the last half of this century, Cashmore said, the real question is
not why are women so far behind men in record setting, but how have
they managed to make up so much ground so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there needs to be a middle ground between the
overprotective view of female athletes and the cavalier attitude
toward the risks sports pose for boys. Once that balance has been
struck, the debate can begin about whether women could ever
outshoot, outhit, outkick and outscore men on an even playing
field.

ONE PERSON'S TRASH IS ANOTHER'S VALUED COLLECTIBLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Kovel says she and her husband, Ralph, have seen it all.
Pencil erasers. Barbed wire. Coffin markers. Wire hangers. Plumbing
fixtures. False teeth. Tractors. Foundation garments. Parimutuel
tickets. You name it, no matter how unusual, obscure, or banal the
item may seem, the Kovels know of somebody who collects it.
</P>
<P>
   I told her I was glad to hear somebody else collects parimutuel
tickets. I'm not a collector, but I live with one, and I marvel at
the collector mentality, never more so than when I consider my
husband's cache of parimutuel tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Have the Kovels ever been surprised by an odd collectible? ``The
Smithsonian ran an exhibit about the strange things people collect,
and there was one I'd never heard of,'' Terry Kovel said from their
home near Cleveland. ``Paintings on spider webs.''
</P>
<P>
   The delicate art of spider web painting was popular in Victorian
times, the Kovels learned. ``They're very attractive, as a matter
of fact,'' she said, ``but extremely fragile. '' ''
</P>
<P>
   We are a nation of collectors, and The Kovels are the leading
arbiters of what we collect. They have written more than 70 books
about antiques and collectibles, everything from valuable furniture
and jewelry to not-so-valuable but nevertheless highly coveted
items such as product labels and kitchen utensils. Their latest
book, ``Kovels' Yellow Pages,'' is a directory of resources for
collectors. The Kovels also publish a monthly newsletter, write a
syndicated newspaper column, and maintain a Web site:
http://www.kovel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Leafing through ``Kovels' Yellow Pages'' I was struck by some of
the names of clubs and organizations that have sprung up around
various collectibles. The American Credit Card Collectors Society.
The International Swizzle Stick Collectors Association, publishers
of Swizzle Stick News. The Doodyville Historical Society. The
Buttonhook Society. The Feedsack Club. The Mid-American Reamer
Collectors, publishers of Juicy Journal. Hotwires, the club for
toaster collectors. The Association of Coffee Mill Enthusiasts.
Thimble Collectors International. The Universal Coterie of Pipe
Smokers.
</P>
<P>
   I like that last one especially. There's something very
appealing about joining a universal coterie, even if it is composed
of pipe smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kovels are always on the lookout for new collectibles,
especially items in the $3 to $10 range. White-knob wind-up toys
are hot items, Terry Kovel said. Fast food-related memorabilia is
another growth area. There's a McDonald's Collectors Club, and
Burger King, Wendy's, and Taco Bell also have their enthusiasts.
And potholders are hot, so to speak. A recent issue of the Kovels's
newsletter featured decorative handmade potholders, including
potholder ``erotica'' with hidden anatomic details.
</P>
<P>
   Collectibles may be silly, but collectors are very earnest. I
was reminded of this when, on a recent ``Martha Stewart Living,'' a
viewer called and asked The Queen of All She Purveys if she had any
advice about attending the Brimfield Antiques and Collectible Show.
I've been to the show. I thought it was merely a matter of showing
up and looking around; that's why I'll never be a collector.
</P>
<P>
   Martha told her to go to the gym and work out to build stamina.
Acquire a truck, or at least a station wagon. Bring along a lot of
old newspapers, bubble wrap, tape, twine, and canvas bags for
wrapping things, an umbrella and rubber boots in case it rains, a
hat and sneakers in case it's sunny and dry and dusty. There was
more. A flashlight. A pen. Sunblock. Some other stuff. Soldiers
have gone into battle with less preparation than Martha advises for
Brimfield. But that's Martha. And that's collecting.

IT'S TIME TO LET GO OF ``HOMICIDE''   AND A FEW OTHER HOARY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turn off the fax machines, put away those
the-tube-is-going-down-the-tubes lecture notes, and consider this:
Maybe ``Homicide'' should be offed.
</P>
<P>
   Now that NBC has threatened to cancel the drama, whose already
low ratings have dipped, the true-blue viewers are sure to mount
one of those red-hot campaigns to keep the show on the air. But let
us remember that ``Homicide'' is seven years old now and, like dog
years, TV-show years count for a lot more than human years. Once a
jittery view of social despair and personal struggle, ``Homicide''
is aging into just another gritty cop series about perps, pimps,
and pairs of pretty police people. We should let it go now.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is here, that time of year when the network suits put on
their thinking caps and choose the fates of favorite electronic
friends, like ``Homicide.'' But while they make their decisions
about whether to renew shows _ pondering Nielsen ratings and
programming blocks and the absolute demographic necessity of
reviving ``Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place'' _ they usually
overlook the ever-changing creative lives of series.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER,'' for instance, is the No. 1 drama in the country, and NBC
has announced that it will, of course, bring it back in September.
But creatively, the frenetic medical show has been on a downward
spiral for more than a year, halfheartedly introducing plot turns
and then abandoning them abruptly in between intubations. With
scripts revolving around Mare Winningham's psycho doctor or the
cliched flirtation between Carter and Lucy, the writers are clearly
stretched thin. ``NYPD Blue,'' too, is past its freshness date,
with crime plots that go thud in the night, trumped-up internal
precinct drama, and, alas, the unending, egocentric mumblings of an
annoying fella named Sipowicz. Although they have been renewed,
both shows could use an appointment with an effective doctor named
Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't television be a better place if we could honor the
distinct life span of each sitcom and drama? A movie, of course,
arrives and departs in one condition: great, good, bad, very bad,
or, in the case of a ``Patch Adams,'' very, very bad. But TV is a
fluid medium, and the condition of the shows changes _ sometimes
radically, as in the case of ``Mad About You'' _ during their
first-run existence. TV shows can shift from promising to perfect
to passe in the course of five years, like ``ER,'' or in the course
of two years, like ``South Park.'' ``Friends'' has taken five years
to reach its comedic peak, after weathering the distortions of
media overhype and the tedious back-and-forths of Ross and Rachel.
Finally, it has exceeded its original identity as a ``Seinfeld''
clone to become a witty vehicle for five characters. It's also one
of the few sitcoms that's learned not to bury moral lessons in its
denouements. How long will its high point last?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld's finest moment may have been his decision to ax
``Seinfeld,'' despite the NBC offers that he supposedly couldn't
refuse. Seinfeld knew his show was exhibiting all the symptoms of
sitcom infirmity: characters that are parodies of their former
selves, plots that look strangely similar, jokes that sound
dangerously alike. What Seinfeld realized was that there's no shame
when a show loses its edge; it's natural and inevitable. But
there's plenty of shame in keeping a production going for years
past its maturity _ the shame of ``Murphy Brown,'' for instance,
which bowed out in 1998 after too many seasons of mediocrity.
``Frasier'' needs to guard against the ``Murphy Brown'' syndrome,
as it nears the end of a terribly uneven season marked by forced
episodes about Frasier's unemployment. The show's trademark gags _
Niles's fixation on Daphne, the brothers' competition, their
disastrous parties _ are showing their wear, and we can only hope
the once top-notch show will bow out at the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it has been on the air for only two seasons, ``Ally
McBeal'' may already be low on fuel, as its fresh quirkiness is
starting to seem formulaic. What was whimsical 30 episodes ago _
John Cage's courtroom stunting, for example _ is becoming
predictable and coy. David E. Kelley's show arrived on our doorstep
fully developed, with a wonderfully distinct point of view, and it
may have had only one direction in which to go: downhill. Of
course, Fox will probably keep the series on life support until
long after fans have defected. Look at how it has propped up
``Melrose Place'' for approximately three years after its brain
left the building. (The nighttime soap is finally being euthanized
on May 24.)
</P>
<P>
   Some series have ups and downs based on the Hollywood ``heat''
of their creators. In other words, Kelley is a popular guy. He has
three hours on the air _ ``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal,'' and
``Chicago Hope'' _ and one called ``Snoops'' is in production for
the fall. When he turns his attention away from any one of these
shows, which depend so entirely on his vision, it suffers. Part of
the reason ``Chicago Hope'' has declined is the absence of Kelley,
and CBS knows this: The network agreed to renew the drama for
1999-2000 largely because Kelley has promised to be involved again.
(That could be bad news for ``Ally'' and ``The Practice.'')
Similarly, the dissolution of ``ER'' can be timed to John Wells's
preoccupation with his now-canceled ``Trinity,'' and it's hard not
to wonder if ``Frasier'' has been hurt by its creators' involvement
in the late ``Encore! Encore!'' Once ``South Park'' became a hit,
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone made two movies
(``BASEketball'' and the forthcoming ``South Park: ``Bigger, Longer
&AMP; Uncut'') and may have neglected their TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Ally,'' some freshmen series, such as ``That '70s
Show'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' may need a year or two to find
themselves. ``Seinfeld,'' for instance, spent its first two years
hammering out the characters and sensibility that made its next few
seasons into classic TV. ``That '70s Show'' is a smiley-faced goof
on the decade and its youth sitcoms, and next season it could grow
into a TV-sized ``Dazed and Confused.'' And the wittily written and
snappily acted ``Will &AMP; Grace'' needs to gain enough confidence to
let go of its weekly message moment. But as cable gives us more and
more channels, viewers _ and networks _ may have less patience with
series that need nurturing. It was a surprise when ABC recently
opted to renew ``Sports Night,'' its first-year dramedy, despite
mediocre ratings. Let's hope ABC is also sensible in the case of
the new ``It's like, you know,'' which needs time to move beyond
its ``Seinfeld''-ian rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know where to place ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``The
Practice,'' both two years old, in their life arcs. Both feature
extraordinary ensemble work, and when they are good, they are
great. But both have been uneven lately, with obvious shifts in
quality from week to week. ``Just Shoot Me'' can turn comeuppance
into a high art, but some episodes _ notably the two-parter about
Finch's father _ have rung hollow. ``The Practice'' has delivered
the year's best drama, with dynamite legal twists and turns. But
the law firm's penchant for winning unlikely cases, as well as the
lawyers' self-loathing, is starting to inspire rolling of the eyes.
And what to make of that slugfest between Ellenor and Lindsay?
These shows seemed to get better, and then worse, 10 times in the
past season.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to TV, more is not always better. A longing for
the good old days of ``NYPD Blue'' or ``ER'' is no reason to keep a
failing show in production. It's a reason to turn to cable, where
repeats of these and other series, such as ``The X-Files,'' have
found homes on FX, TNT, and Nick at Nite. Even ``Homicide'' is
repeated on cable. Court TV has become its eternal savior.

 (EDS: Accompanies DUKE ELLINGTON) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duke Ellington wrote his first song, ``Soda Fountain Rag,'' in
1914, and was still composing until just before his death in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In between were more than 2,000 songs _ jazz standards, ballads,
suites, soundtrack pieces _ and literally hundreds of albums.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the top half-dozen or so Ellington releases, then, is a
daunting task; there is almost no end to the music he made. Here,
though, is one critic's highly subjective list of where to begin to
start to appreciate the man and his legacy. Emphasis on the
``begin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Early Ellington (1926-1931)'': A three-CD set released by
Decca, it features most of his best early work for the Brunswick
and Vocalion labels. ``OKeh Ellington,'' a two-CD set that profiles
his work on that label between 1927 and 1930, is also well worth
getting.
</P>
<P>

`A BUG'S LIFE' SQUASHES THE COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``A Bug's Life'' _ There's a strong case to be
made that the best films last year were animated. And this one is
at the top of the heap. The insect characters are much more
sophisticated than many of their human counterparts. Disney has
wisely released it on the DVD format, as well as on VHS, and the
new technology brings the rich colors and art to brilliant life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monument Ave.'' _ This tough-minded drama set in the rough
neighborhoods in Charlestown is a real eye-opener. No artificial
romanticism here as neighborhood loyalties, racial hatred,
organized crime, and ultra-violence plague the lean streets. And
Denis Leary gives a terrific performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' _ This is the Queen Elizabeth movie that should
have won the Oscar. Great performances, especially by Geoffrey Rush
and Cate Blanchett, and political machinations that would make
Marlon Brando's godfather tremble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch'' _ Bring in Randy Newman. This sniveling, stupid
story is based on John Irving's novel ``A Prayer for Owen Meany,''
but they squeezed every bit of art from the book. A bad movie no
matter how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Night at the Roxbury'' _ Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell
created some fairly funny ``Saturday Night Live'' sketches. But
they lasted just a few minutes. This movie seems interminable and
not at all funny. Re-rent a few ``SNL'' episodes instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' _ How many cliches can they cram into a dumb
movie? Dozens in this Denzel Washington-Bruce Willis-Annette Bening
fiasco.

SILLS' LANDMARK AMERICAN OPERA RECORDING REISSUED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Sills wasn't the first Baby Doe, but the title role in
Douglas Moore's opera ``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' became one of the
soprano's most beloved portrayals. Sills had everything it took to
portray the irresistible heroine _ the vocal range, the sweetness
of tone, the all-American sincerity and strength of character.
</P>
<P>
   She first sang the role in the New York premiere in 1958 and
recorded it later that year. It was her very first recording eight
years before the production and recording of Handel's ``Giulio
Cesare'' that vaulted her from the category of valuable company
artist into that of national and international superstar. The
``Baby Doe'' came out on the MGM label, and after MGM records
folded, Deutsche Grammophon acquired the rights and reissued the
performance in the last days of LP. It has not been available on
CD, although representatives for Deutsche Grammophon report that in
this country it has been their most-requested back-catalog title.
</P>
<P>
   Now DG is issuing ``Baby Doe'' on CD in honor of Sills's 70th
birthday, explaining that the long delay was caused by the search
for lost paperwork. It wasn't clear who owned the rights to the
original tapes and where they were.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Sills appeared at a New York press conference to
publicize the rerelease of the recording; conference call and
speaker phone extended the event to media all over the country. The
diva sounded cheerful, radiant, racy, and entirely herself, and
even over the phone, one knew that red head was bobbing.
</P>
<P>
   The young soprano had been a candidate to create Baby Doe for
the world premiere in Central City in 1956, but word got back to
Sills that conductor Emerson Buckley had ruled her out because she
was ``too big.'' Two years later the memory still rankled when she
was asked to audition for the New York City Opera premiere that led
to the recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living in Cleveland at the time, and I was called and
asked to come to New York to sing for the composer Douglas Moore.
It was already after the first of January, and the premiere was in
April. After auditioning 103 sopranos, they still didn't have a
Baby Doe. I asked myself, `Why should I knock myself out for this?'
I was quite sensitive about my size. But my husband and I were
coming into town to see a Broadway show with Lena Horne, so I let
myself get talked into auditioning. I went to Berdorf Goodman and
bought 2-inch high heels and borrowed a white mink hat that was 8
inches high from my mother, and walked out onto that stage. Dr.
Moore, who was such a soft-spoken gentleman, came down to greet me.
I said, `Dr. Moore, this is how big I am before I sing, and I will
be just as big when I finish.'. . . Actually, from the minute those
arias arived in the mail, I understood that role and knew how to
play it. Over the years I probably sang 60 operas, but I felt that
way about only six of them. The minute I looked at it, I just knew
that this was my part. So I am very pleased that the records are
coming out again _ was it really 40 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Baby Doe'' recording was made straight through in the
Manhattan Center. ``There was no money for retakes _ `just keep
singing, honey' _ so we stood there and sang it. I was pregnant
during the performances, but the costumes covered it up; when the
recording began I felt I no longer had to hide this, so I came in
wearing a maternity dress. People asked me, `When did you get
pregnant? Thursday?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sills remembers her City Opera colleagues with particular
affection. ``Working with Walter Cassel, who sang Horace, was a
revelation to me. I had never seen someone who could take on
someone else's skin like that. When he talked to me onstage, which
was a lot, it was as if it were a part of life, and then he died in
my arms. It was all I could do not to give in to tears, and I
didn't dare, because I had another 10 minutes of singing to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills' acting of the final scene, where the faithful Baby Doe
sits by the entrance to Horace's worthless mine for more than 30
years until her own death, immediately became a permanent part of
American oepratic legend. ``We never staged that, because we had
run out of money by then. But they darkened the set and there was a
pinpoint light from above, and as the snow began to fall, the
shadows cast on my face from above made me appear to age. At the
first performance, I panicked and said to the stage director, `What
do I do at the end?' `Don't worry,' he said, `Just look at
Emerson.' So when we got to the `Leadville Liebestod,' and that
last long note, Emerson signaled me to back up. I kept backing up
until my leg hit the chair; he signaled me to sit down, so I did,
then to take the scarf off, and I did, and the snow came down and
the curtain came down. The next day my husband and my three
stepchildren were going back to Cleveland. We had the papers in the
car on the way to the airport, and I was disappointed that there
wasn't anything about `Baby Doe' on the music page of the Herald
Tribune. My husband said, `I think you missed the best part.' They
had put the review on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   The soprano says that the part of Baby Doe was easy for her to
sing. ``This was one role where I just couldn't wait for the arias
to come. The trick to this part is not letting the women in the
audience hate her. Augusta, the wife that Horace leaves for Baby
Doe, is such a sympathetic character that your heart breaks for
her, and when Frances Bible did the part, you could feel waves of
sympathy coming from the audience. As Baby Doe you never have the
luxury of being aggressive or slutty; you have to play her like a
little fluffy kitten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' continues to hold the stage without
ever having won the esteem of the musical establishment. Sills has
scant patience for this attitude. ``It's a piece of Americana, and
as such, it's perfection. The text is wonderful, and there's
nothing obscure about it. John Latouche, the librettist, really
captured the twang of these women. Think of the last line of
Augusta's aria when she looks at her own work-hardened hands, `Not
like these.' That's a theatrically perfect text.''
</P>
<P>
   All through her career as a singer, Sills fought snobbery, and
she's still fighting it. ``There is always a hue and cry in the
press that American operas should be performed, and when they are
performed, at enormous expense, the same people treat it in a
condescending manner. This has just happened with Carlisle Floyd's
`Susannah' at the Met, which deserves to be treated with more
respect _ after all, it's not a new opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills confesses she hasn't listened to the ``Baby Doe'' CDs yet.
``I love opera, but I don't have time to sit and listen to it
unless I've bought tickets and gone to the theater, and then I
always stay to the end because once it got reported in New York
magazine that I had `walked out.' I just don't listen to music at
home _ I read, I do crossword puzzles.'' Sills is pleased to learn
during the press conference that recent corporate mergers have
brought her famous and long-unavailable recordings of Donizetti's
``Three Queens'' _ ``Roberto Devereaux,'' ``Maria Stuarda,'' and
``Anna Bolena'' _ into Deutsche Grammophon's orbit. ``I know there
are some of my recordings I would never listen to again, but there
are a few I am curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills explains that when she stopped singing in 1980, she had
already embarked on a second career running the City Opera; now she
has another big job as chairwoman of Lincoln Center. ``Now to me it
seems as if my singing career had happened to somebody else. Since
I retired, I've sung `Happy Birthday' to Isaac Stern and Lynn
Fontanne, and `Jingle Bells' with President Reagan, and that's it.
The last time I heard myself sing I was 50, and it was OK, but that
was 20 years ago. I'm not curious about what I sound like now. My
children are very proud of whatever it was I accomplished, but they
are not the least bit interested in it because there are always
more and more things to do. And my attitude is that I did that
already.''

STARVATION INTRUDES IN A BID TO REINTRODUCE THE LYNX 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By MARK DERR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ambitious effort to reintroduce the elusive lynx into
southwestern Colorado has encountered widespread criticism from
animal rights advocates and even many of the plan's proponents
since the death by starvation of four of the thirteen cats released
in February and March and the emergency recapture of an emaciated
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned the scientific and organizational
underpinnings of the effort, a $1.4 million project sponsored by
the Colorado Division of Wildlife and originally designed to shift
100 lynxes (Lynx canadensis) from Canada and Alaska to the rugged
San Juan Mountains over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   While defending the project as an experiment to see whether
lynxes, which were trapped and poisoned for decades and became
extinct in Colorado in 1973, could once again roam freely in their
state, biologists expressed shock at the recent deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The project's lead biologist, John Seidel, who is retiring this
month, said the team had expected about half the animals to die,
but mainly from motor-vehicle or hunting accidents, not starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reintroduce the Eurasian lynx in the Swiss Alps and
the Canada lynx in the Adirondacks had largely failed, and under
the best of circumstances, success for the Colorado project was
uncertain, critics and proponents agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lynx is the type of specialist carnivore that is toughest
to reintroduce,'' said Robert Ferris, director of the species
conservation division for Defenders of Wildlife, the lead advocacy
group in a lawsuit that forced the federal government to consider
protecting the cats under species preservation laws.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing 20 to 40 pounds, with hind legs slightly longer than
its forelegs, and with tufted ears, a tawny coat and large feet
that keep it from sinking into deep snow, the Canada lynx mainly
preys on snowshoe hares.
</P>
<P>
   With snowshoe hares and lynxes now at their peak in western
Canada and Alaska, biologists decided the time was right for
reintroduction.
</P>
<P>
   But the area they chose was at the southern end of the lynx's
historic range, where the hare population was uncertain and perhaps
as low as 0.4 per hectare (2.4 acres). By most accounts, lynxes
were never abundant there.
</P>
<P>
   Moved from hare-rich habitats, the newcomers were expected not
only to learn to hunt different prey, like marmots and grouse,
which is problematic for specialist carnivores, but also to compete
with bobcats and coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   A warm winter may have made that more difficult for animals
adapted to deep snow, said Dr. Richard Reading, director of
conservation biology at the Denver Zoological Foundation and
co-chairman of the advisory team for the lynx project. ``We may
need a more typical winter before we can decide whether this thing
can fly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Reading and the advisers have urged a temporary halt to
the project to determine whether there are enough hares to support
the lynxes.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths appear to have confirmed the worst fears of critics,
who had charged for months that the plan was poorly conceived and
executed. And even many proponents have complained of inadequate
scientific analysis by project biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have done intensive modeling of the habitat and
confirmed the results on the ground to reduce the risks of
mortality and suffering,'' said Dr. Reed Noss, chief scientist of
the Conservation Biology Institute in Corvallis, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   After the first few deaths, project managers decided to hold the
lynxes from Canada and Alaska in pens for at least three weeks
after receiving them, rather than releasing them almost
immediately. They hoped to reduce stress on the cats and allow them
to regain weight, while waiting for the annual spring rebounding of
the hare population.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 30 lynxes from Canada and Alaska, including the one rescued
from starvation, are awaiting release soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fattening the lynx up merely means it will take longer for
them to starve,'' said Dr. Marc Bekoff, professor of biology at the
University of Colorado at Boulder and a leading critic of the
project. ``The Division of Wildlife rushed this project without
fundamental study of the social ecology of the lynx and how they
would survive in what is marginal habitat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bekoff said the lynxes now in pens should be returned to their
home territories and the project suspended until it has been
re-evaluated. ``They should start over,'' he said, ``and if that
means cats won't be in Colorado, that's too bad, but it's better
than having animals suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But wildlife officials say they can neither return the lynxes
nor continue to hold them without putting them at risk of injury.
But they have taken steps to strengthen the project's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still something of an experiment to determine whether
lynx can survive here,'' said Rick Kahn, wildlife management
supervisor for the Division of Wildlife. ``We think there is a
reasonable chance of success, but we won't have proof until around
the end of August. After that, we'll decide whether to continue
with more releases next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements do little to mollify critics, but Ferris urges
them to be patient while pressing for changes. ``Expectations have
been raised with the successful wolf re-introductions in
Yellowstone,'' Ferris said, ``and we expect all programs to work as
well. But they won't. We have to support things that are slower to
succeed and recognize failure is part of the process.''

A CRITIC'S GUIDE TO THE LONDON THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The sad joke has been that American theater fares so
much better on this side of the Atlantic than our own. Think of the
National Theatre's jaw-dropping production of ``Carousel'' that
played in Boston a few years ago. Or the same company's staging,
after Vanessa Redgrave's discovery, of Tennessee Williams's early
``Not About Nightingales'' that is currently playing in New York. A
couple of years ago the Royal Shakespeare Company did what was
previously considered to be undoable _ make a convincing case for
Williams's surrealistic ``Camino Real.'' (The Williamstown Theatre
Festival in the Berkshires is having its own go at it this summer.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's reclamation project is another Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical, ``Oklahoma!,'' and if it doesn't inspire the
awe that Nicholas Hytner's ``Carousel'' did, it may be that there
just isn't as much meat on poor Jud's bone to chew on. ``Oklahoma''
is, though, a thoroughly enjoyable, often inspiring night of
musical theater, light-years ahead of the current Andrew Lloyd
Webber monstrosity, ``Whistle Down the Wind.'' (See accompanying
article.) It's also light-years ahead of anything that Broadway is
likely to come up with as an ``Oklahoma!'' revival but,
unfortunately, this one won't be crossing over, because of failed
union negotiations concerning casting.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes ``Oklahoma!'' a top priority for musical theater
fans. Once again the organization responsible is the National
Theatre, which Trevor Nunn now oversees. Nunn, who directed
``Oklahoma!'' and ``Not About Nightingales,'' has done a
magnificent job for the National, perhaps as atonement for bringing
``Cats'' and ``Les Miserables'' into the world. Whatever the
motivation, Nunn has been overseer of an extremely rich period for
the National. ``Oklahoma!'' joins ``Copenhagen'' and ``An Inspector
Calls'' as successful commercial transfers to West End theaters,
while ``Not About Nightingales,'' ``Closer,'' and ``Amy's View''
are Tony contenders in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma!'' goes about as fur as it can go to join that elite
company. The opening overture is a powerful mood- and scene-setter,
with the orchestra shown through a scrim as if suspended in clouds
before the scenes through the scrim dissolve into opening credits,
cornfields, farmhouses.
</P>
<P>
   After Hugh Jackman as Curly enters singing ``Oh, What a
Beautiful Mornin','' Nunn has the audience eating out of his hands,
thanks also to a set design that emphasizes an open horizon. I saw
an understudy as Laurey, but by some accounts the drama in this
production is more between Curly and Jud (Shuler Hensley), the two
Sooners who are fighting over Laurey. They won't displace Gordon
MacRae and Rod Steiger of the 1955 movie in your memory bank, but
they're both compelling actors and singers.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stroman's choreography is more athletic, though not as
strong, as Agnes DeMille's, and along with the production itself
underlines a slightly darker tone to the proceedings. I don't know
if it was just me, but during the rigged trial that freed Curly at
the end of the musical I couldn't help thinking of the all-white
juries that let Klansmen off throughout most of the country's
history. Not that the incident here was comparable, but the
``independent spirit'' that's being celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   This was probably a personal reaction. ``Oklahoma!'' is designed
to be more entertaining than revelatory and does what it sets out
to do. Alas, the same can't quite be said of the
National's``Candide.'' The Leonard Bernstein musical with any
number of lyricists and writers has had a troubled history. Most
productions emphasize the music, which is fabulous and upbeat, and
turn Lillian Hellman's original downbeat McCarthy parable of a book
into a kind of carnival.

   ``Candide,'' codirected by Nunn and John Caird, boldly pushes
the music to the background with a chamber orchestra, and pushes
the story to the front, making use of a cast that has stronger
acting than singing chops. It works to an extent. Bernstein's music
with new and old lyrics by Richard Wilbur and Stephen Sondheim,
along with originals by John LaTouche and Dorothy Parker, can take
care of itself. Simon Russell Beale is a fine Voltaire/Pangloss,
and Hugh Wheeler's adaptation of the book is goosed up with
references that bring to mind contemporary horrors like the
Balkans. The problems remain, though. What do you do with
characters who are such Howdy Doodys (and Doodettes) as Candide and
Cunegonde? Or a story that repeats on itself like indigestion?
Maybe the way to go is to cast singing comedians like Martin Short
or Bernadette Peters in the roles or find a director with a tougher
mind-set than Caird. This ``Candide'' is entertaining enough, but
it still leaves you yearning for more. The best version still
remains the home-video concert recording conducted by Bernstein,
which emphasizes the music and leaves the story's contortions
mainly to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geometry of Miracles,'' which closed Saturday (April 24) at
the National but is bound to resurface, is something of a musical
as well. It's also about dance, architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright,
Georgi Gurdjieff, and Stalin. It's all from the wild and crazy mind
of Robert Lepage, a Canadian director, who previously imported mud
into the National for his staging of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   As the play opens, Wright is visited by a naked Beelzebub (the
terrific actor-dancer Rodrigue Proteau, also Gurdjieff), who dares
him to create a three-dimensional form out of a single line.
``That's easy,'' says Wright, who draws a spiral. This isn't a play
about architecture as much as it is a fanciful, nonrepresentational
exploration into the meeting point of architecture, dance, and
theater. (An arrogant Herbert F. Johnson, of Johnson Wax fame,
tap-dances memos to his secretary.) One doesn't need to know
anything about architecture or geometry, and one probably won't
learn much about either. With my limited knowledge of the subject
matter, I found it more amusing than affecting, although the same
could be said of ``Candide.'' For both, try the previously reviewed
``Copenhagen,'' Michael Frayn's play in which quantum physics and
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle make for one of the most
unsettling and compelling nights of theater you'll have in London,
no matter how little you know about physics. (No wine before the
play, though.)
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
The RSC
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company seems to be making up ground it
has lost to the National in recent years with London critics. ``The
Winter's Tale'' with Antony Sher, Marivaux's ``The Dispute,'' and
the contemporary ``Roberto Zucco'' have all been winning raves. I
can second the verdict in two of the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dispute'' is a coproduction of the RSC and Lyric Theatre
Hammersmith, directed by Neil Bartlett, who also wrote the
spectacularly successful adaptation that mixes contemporary
Anglicisms into Marivaux's 18th-century mix. Whether it's Bartlett
or the amazing young actress Hayley Carmichael who's more
responsible for making this philosophical speculation about the
things we do for love more entertaining than anything you'll see on
``Friends'' and more germane than anything on ``Ally McBeal'' is
academic.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing academic about this production, in which two
young people are isolated until adolescence and then released into
an Eden-like situation where they gurgle incessantly over each
other _ until another pair of lovers are released into their
environment. The humor is riotous, although Marivaux's serious
concerns about love and power emerge without benefit of the easy
catharsis of ``Candide.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Winter's Tale,'' Sher's ferocious, growling King
Leontes is one of those defining performances destined to stay in
the memory as he grabs this Shakespeare problem play by the throat
and drags it into ``Othello'' and ``King Lear'' territory. Not that
it's a single-handed accomplishment. British critics take for
granted the ease with which the RSC speaks and moves, but in a
season that hasn't seen much Shakespearean acting of note in
Boston, it's a pleasure to simply look at and listen to RSC
stalwarts like Ken Bones and Ian Hughes. (The company's coming to
New Haven in ``Troilus and Cressida'' and ``A Month in the
Country'' in June.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever pleasures others have found in ``Roberto Zucco,''
though, eluded me. (``The Winter's Tale'' is on the Barbican
mainstage and ``Zucco'' in the Pit small stage.) Martin Crimp's
adaptation of Bernard-Marie Koltes's play, James Macdonald's
direction, and Zubin Varla's performance strip all affect out of
the story about a psycopathic killer, as if matters of motivation
and morality are middlebrow considerations to be dispensed with.
What's left in its wake is a void more boring than terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Donmar
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's more to British theater, even serious British theater,
than the National and RSC, of course. The Almeida, which produced
``The Iceman Cometh'' with Kevin Spacey, now has Cate Blanchett in
a revival of David Hare's ``Plenty'' (in previews last week).
</P>
<P>
   The Donmar Warehouse has become almost as hot as the National.
Specializing in revivals, the Donmar is responsible for the
productions of ``The Blue Room'' with Nicole Kidman and ``Cabaret''
(about to come to Boston with Teri Hatcher). I've seen some fine
revivals of Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer, and Harold Pinter by the
Donmar, but there also seems to be a tendency to get by with
attitude as much as art, as witnessed by ``The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' CP Taylor's story of a ``good'' German's seduction by
the Nazis, has its champions as a good and even great play. To me
it's a two-dimensional play about a one-dimensional man featuring a
one-dimensional performance by Charles Dance. The terror in such a
play would be in showing us ourselves in the person of a good
German, but Taylor and Dance keep this professor of literature
wrapped in such a cocoon of self-centeredness that the audience
emerges far too satisfied with its collective self.
</P>
<P>
   And lest we think that the Brits have any particular lock on
doing right by American playwrights, there is Tennessee Williams's
``Suddenly Last Summer'' by the Donmar at the Comedy Theatre. This
isn't supposed to be a comedy, but you might have trouble keeping a
straight face at the ludicrous ``Little Shop of Horrors'' set and
the even more ludicrous acting onstage. (Rachel Weisz emerges
better than most.)
</P>
<P>
   Williams's attempt to exorcize the demons of an overbearing
mother, mentally troubled sister, as well as the sneering at his
homosexuality, would have a difficult time in the best of
circumstances. This production is so far from that best of all
possible worlds that the only reason to see it is to remind
yourself that sometimes American actors _ like Katharine Hepburn,
Elizabeth Taylor, and Montgomery Clift in the ``Suddenly Last
Summer'' movie _ really could be the best friends of American
playwrights.

PRIVATE SPY IN SPACE TO RIVAL MILITARY'S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Calif., Va.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all goes well Tuesday, years of planning, delay and debate
will culminate in the launching of the world's most powerful
civilian spacecraft for observing the Earth and its human dramas,
inaugurating the first real rival to military spies in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, built by Lockheed Martin for Space Imaging, a
Colorado company, is to be hurled from a California launching pad
into an orbit some 420 miles high, where its cameras will be able
to record cars, homes, hot tubs, roads, buildings, bridges,
convoys, tanks, jets, missiles and mass graves _ though not
individual people.
</P>
<P>
   And before the year is out, two more American companies plan to
loft reconnaissance craft with similar powers. In all, a dozen or
so are expected to be launched in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Though civilian ``remote sensing'' satellites have been
observing the Earth since 1972, their images are wide-scale and the
details fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The new surveillance technology is likely to be a powerful new
tool for miners, geographers, urban planners and disaster-relief
officials, to name a few potential clients. But the sharp-eyed
cameras to be launched Tuesday raise fears, too, about lost privacy
and the possibility that images from such satellites will be just
as valuable to adversaries like Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on space reconnaissance in and out of the federal
government agree that the national security implications of the new
technology have been inadequately thought out _ a worry thrown into
sharp focus by the crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a powerful new technology is introduced, there's a
battle over the uses to which it's put,'' Christopher Simpson, a
reconnaissance expert at American University in Washington, said in
an interview. ``Here, the potential for beneficial uses is very
high, on balance. But the potential for abuse certainly exists and
we'll no doubt see some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration released this genie in 1994 when it
lifted technical restrictions on private companies, letting them
build a new generation of satellites that could peer down to see
objects on the ground as small as a yard wide _ enough to
distinguish between a car and a truck. Even white lines on the
black asphalt of parking lots are said to be discernible.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the new companies organized to take advantage of the
change have backlogs of orders, including at least $1 billion from
federal intelligence agencies eager to supplement their spy
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, governments _ and military forces _ at home and abroad
are expected to be top customers for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militaries have a well-developed idea of what they want
and have the money to pay for it,'' said Albert D. Wheelon, a
former Central Intelligence Agency official who helped run the
nation's early spy satellites and is now retired. ``On the civilian
side, I think that will take a long time, like computers did.''
</P>
<P>
   The art of photographing the earth from outer space began when
military spy craft were first lofted in 1960. Over the years, their
vision sharpened and military craft, particularly American craft,
are still the undisputed leaders, their cameras said to be strong
enough to see a car's license plate.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, photos from commercial satellites have been much
fuzzier, revealing only large features like fields, lakes, rivers
and mountains. But little by little, their cameras have improved.
</P>
<P>
   Today, France, India and Russia sell the best commercial photos
taken from outer space. The sharpest of all are Russian and show
objects on the ground as small as two meters, or about six feet,
enough detail to allow users to see tanks and other large military
objects.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Earthwatch Inc. of Longmont, Colo., lofted a
satellite meant to see features as small as 10 feet. But the craft
failed in orbit, prompting American rivals to tread with caution.
While many other American craft of the improved class are still in
planning stages, no others have gone into service.
</P>
<P>
   But Space Imaging is now ready to leapfrog ahead with a camera
that sees objects as small as one meter, or about three feet _ the
sharpest ever for civilian craft. Privately held and based in
Denver, Colo., the company says it has about $700 million from a
consortium of backers made up of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon,
Mitsubishi and other international partners.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 285 employees. Its president is Jeffrey K.
Harris, who from 1994 to 1996 ran the National Reconnaissance
Office, the secretive federal group that builds and runs the
government's spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's launching was first planned for December 1997, but was
delayed after the Earthwatch failure.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, a nine-story Athena II rocket made, like the
satellite, by Lockheed Martin, will carry the newest spy satellite
aloft at 2:21 p.m. from Vandenberg Air Force Base, on the
California coast north of Los Angeles. Because of its ability to
send satellites into a north-south orbit that covers most of the
Earth, the base is the launching site for most government spy
satellites that carry cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The new spacecraft is a lightweight at just 0.8 tons. About 15
feet long with its solar panels extended, it runs on just 1,200
watts of power _ a bit more than a toaster.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart is the same kind of telescope that Isaac Newton
invented: a round mirror with a curved surface gathers faint light,
which is then magnified for human viewers. In the spacecraft, a
more complex version of this telescope points down toward Earth
rather than up at the stars, gathering faint reflections from
ground objects. Color and black-and-white television cameras then
turn the resulting images into radio signals beamed to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak, a top federal contractor for optical espionage,
built the telescope system. Its main mirror is 27 inches wide and
so smooth that if it were 100 miles across the biggest bump would
be 0.08 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the telescope is about five feet long. This feat of
miniaturization allows the launching to be relatively low cost and
is the kind of technical advance helping make possible the new
generation of civil spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding around the planet at four miles a second, the
spacecraft is to orbit once every 98 minutes, passing over all
regions except the poles and able to photograph any particular spot
on the ground once every one-to-three days. The craft is known as
Ikonos 1, after the Greek word for image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it will fundamentally change the approach to many
forms of information that we use in business and our private
lives,'' said John R. Copple, the chief executive of Space Imaging.
</P>
<P>
   The first photos will go up for sale two to three months after
the satellite goes into orbit, company officials say. A second
craft, Ikonos 2, is ready for launching, but the date has not been
set. The satellites are identical and are designed to function for
up to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Copple, the company's head, said that photos from Ikonos
(pronounced eye-KOH-nos) would cost $25 to $300 a square mile, and
that the minimum size of the ground area would probably be larger
than a square mile. The company is taking orders and eventually
plans to sell the imagery via its Web site, www.spaceimaging.com.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial rivals also eager to launch this year are Orbimage,
of Dulles, Va., and Earthwatch, which is still hard at work despite
its 1997 setback. Both companies are building satellites with
one-meter resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Copple of Space Imaging said military organizations from the
United States and other countries would make up half his company's
market at first, but that their share would dwindle as civilians
discovered the images. ``The marketplace will surprise us all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry about unhappy surprises, like terrorists
exploiting the imagery to plan attacks, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the administration has thought through the
implications,'' said Henry Sokolski, a Pentagon official in the
Bush administration who now runs the Nonproliferation Policy
Education Center, a private group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In one twist, civilians are already using space photographs to
track military arms. Such uses are expected to skyrocket as more
powerful cameras come into play. Experts say such prying can
promote peace by reducing military secrecy and false governmental
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides an independent check on what the government is
saying, for example about mass graves and other wartime atrocities
in the Balkans,'' said John E. Pike, head of a space-reconnaissance
project at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when Clinton allowed commercial interests to use the
powerful technology, the most contentious issue has been how to
keep foes from getting the new images, especially in wartime. The
Commerce Department, which licenses the craft, demands that
Washington be allowed to exercise what experts call ``shutter
control,'' basically an abrupt cutoff of image sales.
</P>
<P>
   To date, no restrictions have been proposed publicly for the
Balkans, and industry officials say they expect none.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting an air war,'' not one on the ground where the
massing of troops for a surprise assault could be a key factor,
said Copple of Space Imaging. ``From a military standpoint, the
only thing it's good for is damage assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts disagree, saying important details of allied
military planning might be jeopardized by the new images,
``particularly if we're building up for ground troops,'' said Pike
of the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Richard B. Myers of the Air Force, head of the United
States Space Command, which orchestrates the nation's military
space activities, said earlier this month that Washington had yet
to think through what to do in times of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be risk in operations like this when you're
selling what can be used against you,'' he told the annual meeting
of the United States Space Foundation, a private space-policy
group.
</P>
<P>
   Keith R. Hall, the director of the National Reconnaissance
Office, told the same group that Tuesday's scheduled lofting of the
commercial spy satellite would force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just in the beginning stages of developing the policies
on this,'' he said, adding that the launching ``will probably be
the impetus for the government to get its act together.''

THE FORCE IS STILL WITH US 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was post-Watergate, post-Vietnam, post-Bicentennial, and the
country was a tad confused. So on May 25, 1977, when we paid an
average of $2.23 to see a strange new science fiction movie, we
didn't know what to expect from both inside and outside the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 121 minutes, ``Star Wars'' creator and director George
Lucas mixed mythology with Zen, Flash Gordon with Joseph Campbell,
a serial-like pace with multi-
</P>
<P>
   ple climaxes, and, voila, the nation had a new pastime. We were
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's news reports aren't complete without a tally of the
weekend's box office receipts, an original 99-cent Force Yak Face
action figure is worth $1,500, and the marketing of movies has
sometimes become bigger than the movies themselves (see
``Godzilla''). Since ``Star Wars,'' our world has been forever
changed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a movie that quickly and strangely became ingrained in
our culture. Chewbacca won an MTV Movie Award, and a US president
promised that we would be protected from the Evil Empire by a ring
of security satellites dubbed ``Star Wars.'' To this day, when
James Earl Jones intones ``This . . . is CNN,'' couldn't that just
as likely be Lord Darth Vader?
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the release of Lucas's ``Star Wars'' prequel _
``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' _ 24 days away on May 19, it's
time to look back at life before May 25, 1977, and how we've used
the Force _ and how the Force has used us _ over the last 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Henry Jenkins was a college journalism student in
Atlanta when he went to see the film (first day, first show), an
experience he said revitalized his passion for cinema. Now an MIT
professor of literature who has written extensively about fandom
and ``Star Wars,'' he said the movie filled a void and allowed
people to use its template to tell their own stories.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, according to Jenkins, there is a huge underground
scene built around ``Star Wars'' fan fiction, people writing their
own tales of Luke, Han, Chewie, and Princess Leia. These writers
initially photocopied their stories and shared them over talk
sessions that tried to evaluate if Chewbacca was symbolic of a
future minority, or if Luke had a secret crush on Han.
</P>
<P>
   When the Internet allowed instant international communication,
some of the Web's first pages were devoted to this fan fiction,
Jenkins said. Now, even Boba Fett, the obscure bounty hunter, has
his own fan fiction Web page. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Powerful symbols &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Periodically, our culture stumbles on a character who operates
in a story that is so powerful that people want to hold on to it in
any number of ways,'' Jenkins said. ``Our heroes are important to
us, and I think Lucas hit on a series of characters that have all
the archetypes that we look up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came out, people were looking for a kind of
spirituality that wasn't tied to a particular god, and the
mythology of `Star Wars' worked. And we all share them. We all know
who they are. So for you and me, who don't know each other, I can
evoke a story if I can build on what is already there, and that
builds resonance.''
</P>
<P>
   For fans too young to write, action figures allowed for more
storytelling. However, when the movie first came out, there wasn't
an action figure to be found in stores. Kenner, the toy company
with the lucrative ``Star Wars'' contract, was late in producing
them. To compensate, the company offered an Early Bird Certificate
Package that asked fans to send in for four action figures that
would be mailed out between February and June 1978.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. With the delay came an increase in demand. And with
more and more people going to see the movie, that demand grew. The
Early Bird Certificate Package, with tray and box, is now worth
$500, according to the 1999 edition of ``The Galaxy's Greatest
`Star Wars' Collectibles Price Guide,'' by Stuart W. Wells 3d
(Antique Trader Books).
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 million ``Star Wars'' action figures would be sold
over the next eight years, along with countless other products,
from soaps to bedsheets. Their worth, because of demand and various
nuances of production, began to quickly rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before `Star Wars', you didn't market stuff timed to movies in
much the same way,'' said Wells. ``You wanted a TV show to market
things. You had things like `Batman' and stuff from the late-'60s
TV shows, and dolls and such could help your product every week.
Before `Star Wars,' movies just didn't play long enough to offer
any real marketing a chance to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   However, because ``Star Wars'' stayed in theaters in some cases
for well over a year, it ushered in an era in which a movie and its
accessories developed a symbiotic relationship, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the action figures shrank in size. The need for
them to fit inside Tie and X-Wing fighters, increased cost of
plastic as a result of oil shortages, and sheer demand led Kenner
to make them 3 3/4 inches high. That size soon became the rage, so
the next time you sleepily step on a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger,
curse ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, in a way, even killed off the most popular action
figure at the time. In 1977, G.I. Joe went from 12 inches to 8,
according to manufacturer Hasbro's chronology. In 1978, because of
the fuel crisis and ``Star Wars'' appeal, G.I. Joe's domestic
marketing suddenly ended. Four years later, in 1982, Joe returned
at 3 3/4 inches tall _ and with a very ``Star Wars''-like licensing
agreement, with Marvel Comics.
</P>
<P>
   For Patricia King Hanson, a film historian at the American Film
Institute in Los Angeles, ``Star Wars'' was also the last big hit
movie without any real prerelease publicity, except for a two-page
spread in Time on the week the movie opened. The article dubbed
Lucas's creation ``the best picture of the year.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Before back story &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When it first opened, some people knew about it, but I don't
think the general public really knew what it would be,'' said
Hanson. ``Since then, it seems like all the big event movies have a
back story. Before `Titanic' hit the screen, we knew of the
difficulties in filming, the cost, even the actors' temperaments on
the set. But this kind of movie buzz began, it seems, after `Star
Wars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with kids and adults walking out of theaters after paying
regular admission to see a two-minute preview of ``The Phantom
Menace,'' and with Web sites like www.starwars.com (official) and
www.starwars.countingdown.com (nonofficial) detailing every minute
aspect of the film months before it premieres, ``Star Wars'' has
helped turn inside information into a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since that film came out, people have wanted to be part of
this cultural phenomenon from the beginning,'' she said. ``From
then on, it wasn't enough to just know a movie was coming out.
People felt the need to know more information about those movies,
and then share them with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the idea that there were people who would repeatedly and
repeatedly see `Star Wars' when it was in theaters, I can't really
recall that phenomenon happening before, and that certainly
propelled it,'' said Hanson. ``That, to me, literally started with
`Star Wars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   John Williams's ``Star Wars'' soundtrack also took on a life of
its own, and ushered in a new era in movie music. By the end of
1977, it had sold 3 million-plus copies, according to Variety. It
was music that permeated not just this country's but the world's
psyche. Some 20 years later, when France upset Brazil in the 1998
World Cup final, the stadium's speakers blared not ``La
Marseillaise,'' but the theme from ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The score almost seemed like it was central to the film, and
it started a new cycle of how movie scores were written,'' Hanson
said. ``Before, a movie score was just accompanying a film. In
`Star Wars,' it seems like the score almost became like a
character, and people would buy that score not so much for the
pretty music but to more or less relive the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the money being made. With record-setting box
office receipts, what was once something discussed behind closed
studio doors became a touchstone for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since `Star Wars,' people almost have an emotional attachment
to how well something does at the box office,'' Hanson said, adding
that it has created a phenomenon in which some people's Mondays can
be made or ruined depending on how well their favorite movie did at
the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Force, all of this change came from within _ from the
public. The Force returns May 19, and the question now is, how will
it change us this time?

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
!! 1/2 ``eXistenZ'' David Cronenberg, in a more cerebral than
visceral mode, sends Jennifer Jason Leigh's game diva and Jude
Law's corporate nerd on a roller-coaster ride that blurs the line
between virtual and existential reality. Merging biology and
technology, it extends his view of the body's frailty, but in
lightweight fashion. (R) 
 
!!! ``Hideous Kinky'' More sweet than searching, this film is
centered by Kate Winslett's hippie mom dragging her two young
daughters to Morocco to search for her bliss in 1972. The film is
an alluring travelogue that admirably refrains from judgments and
spotlights the generosity they encountered. (R) 
 
! 1/2 ``Lost &AMP; Found'' Lame comedy in which David Spade's
brab-spouting tries to score points with Sophie Marceau's pretty
neighbor by dognapping her terrier, intending to return it, only to
find he's got to conceal it in his apartment after it swallows an
expensive ring. Plays like an ineffectual ``There's Something About
Mary'' wannabe. (PG-13) 
 
!!! ``Metroland'' Well-acted and thoughtful, this film considers
the nagging question of how one reconciles their youthful dreams
with their sadder-but-wiser adult selves. It's a very familiar
theme, but intelligent performances by Christian Bale and Emily
Watson carry the film beyond the cliches of its well-worn story.
(Unrated) (Renee Graham) 
 
!!! ``Prdita Durango'' Rosie Perez is a torrid pistol-packin' mama
in a surrealistic blood-drenched Tex-Mex landscape that she prowls
with Javier Bardem's black leather-clad witch doctor and all-around
outlaw. It means to take a few shots at tacky American pop culture,
and does, but goes soft in the home stretch. (R) 
 
(FU) !! 1/2 ``Pushing Tin'' John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton play
NYC air traffic controllers engaged in a king-of-the-hill macho
struggle when they aren't busy sorting out the blips on their radar
screens. The film veers off course and becomes ordinary when each
guy chases the other's wife, although Angelina Jolie is appealing
and Cate Blanchett is amazing, seguing from Queen Elizabeth to
Queens without missing a beat. (R) 
 
!!! ``Relax . . . It's Just Sex'' An often-funny look at the
pursuit of love and happiness among a racially and sexually diverse
group of friends in present-day Los Angeles. Sure, it runs too
long, and gets a little light-headed at times on top of its
soapbox, but writer-director P.J. Castellaneta has a keen ear for
dialogue which well-serves his deftly drawn characters. (Unrated)
(Renee Graham)

   NEW YORK _ Lyla Belkin of Manhattan got her first hepatitis B
shot last August, when she was 6 days old. A month later, she got a
second shot. Early the next morning, Lorna Belkin found her infant
daughter pale and cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died early in the morning,'' said Lyla's father, Michael
Belkin, ``16 hours after the vaccination.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City medical examiner's office says she died of
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. But her parents believe the vaccine
killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Belkin, an investment adviser, is a newcomer to a growing band
of parents and some doctors clamoring for a choice not to give
children the hepatitis B vaccine. From his home office, Belkin
fields phone calls and e-mail messages from this informal network
and also heads the Committee on Hepatitis B of the National Vaccine
Information Center, which is based in Vienna, Va. ``This is a civil
rights issue,'' Belkin said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 law protects drug companies from liability for vaccine
reactions. Parents whose children suffer adverse reactions or
deaths related to vaccinations can apply for compensation from a
$1.3-billion federal fund set up under the legislation. The fund
disbursed $55.2 million in petitioners' awards and lawyers' fees in
fiscal 1999; total awards have come to $1 billion since 1990.
Awards for death cases are capped at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tell people not to get this vaccine,'' Belkin
said. ``But it should be a choice not a mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the compensation fund can be obtained from the
clerk of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims at (202) 219-9657.

(For use by SLANG partners --) HED: Noahs two by two _ and  more  
SUBHED: Come what May, along with flowers, it's  time (again) for
 TV's sweeps surrender 
 
 
By  Marla Matzer 
Daily News Staff Writer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Each May, TV gets a lot more interesting. It's no
coincidence: It's a ``sweeps'' period, when ratings will determine
how much money individual networks will be able to charge for ads
in upcoming seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the end of the season for TV shows, so there are
guaranteed to be a number of high-profile stunts and curtain calls
_ this year, most notably from the long-running series ``Mad About
You'' and ``Home Improvement.'' Made-for-TV movie events include _
pay close attention _ ``Joan of Arc,'' ``Noah's Ark'' and ``The
Simple Life of Noah Dearborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliffhanger endings seem more popular than ever this year for
shows that want to make sure fans tune back in next season. On
``Walker, Texas Ranger'' (May 22), Walker and Sheree are trapped in
a plane crash. Tune in next fall for the exciting conclusion! ``The
X-Files'' predictably ends the season with a question mark _ with
Mulder and Scully's alien quest continuing _ and ``Felicity'' has
the title character agonizing over whether to go to Europe with
Noel, or to Silicon Valley with Ben (note to Felicity: Vienna waits
for you). Meanwhile, ``Spin City's'' Mike (Michael J. Fox) has to
choose between true love Nikki and supermodel Heidi Klum. We hate
when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a listing of some special events in store during
sweeps, which officially kicks off on Thursday. You may want to
tape a few things _ summer is often a long, dry spell when it comes
to good TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
April 29
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Kneivel: Grand Canyon Jump Live (Fox, 8 p.m.) The show's
executive producer, Jeff Androsky, says this death-defying
motorcycle jump is something Evel's son has ``wanted to do all his
life.'' What a coincidence, so did we _ it's on our list right
after sticking our arm in a shark tank.
</P>
<P>
   WWF Smackdown! (UPN, 8 p.m.) Robbie Kneivel smackdown, more like
it. This bit of counter-programming is being touted as the return
of professional wrestling to network TV. Oh, come on, guys ... it's
just UPN.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
April 30
</P>
<P>
   A Celebration: One Hundred Years of Great Women, With Barbara
Walters (ABC, 9:30 P.M.) Gee, we knew Barbara was getting up there,
but ... La Barbara chats up and recaps ``the most interesting,
influential and intriguing women of the century.'' All in 90
minutes _ half an hour less than she gave that modern-day Great
Woman, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 2
</P>
<P>
   Noah's Ark (NBC, 9 p.m.; second part airs at 9 p.m. May 3) From
``Midnight Cowboy'' to savior of the species is about as far as an
actor can stretch. Jon Voight co-stars with Mary Steenburgen
(funny, you never hear anything about MRS. Noah, do you?) in this
two-parter based loosely _ VERY loosely _ on the Bible story. F.
Murray Abraham, Carol Kane and James Coburn also come along for the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 4
</P>
<P>
   Down Will Come Baby (CBS, 9 p.m.) Meredith Baxter stars in this
TV movie about a family's struggle to stay together after a fatal
accident. The network touts it as ``an unpredictable suspense
thriller''; that should make it a refreshing change from all those
predictable suspense yarns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 5
</P>
<P>
   The 34th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards (CBS, 8 p.m.)
Awards season is almost over, we promise. For country music lovers,
this one features performances by Garth Brooks and the Dixie
Chicks; for lovers of the (slightly deflated) female form, Pamela
Anderson co-hosts, with funnyman Damon Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 8
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche: The White Death (NBC, 8 p.m.) If this show were on
Fox, instead of having been produced for NBC by National
Geographic, it probably would be titled ``When Snow Attacks!''
Instead, Peter Coyote narrates a more highbrow special on deadly
avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 9
</P>
<P>
   The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn (CBS, 9 p.m.) Sidney Poitier
stars as a simple man of dignity: a carpenter who stands up to a
greedy developer. ``They call me Mr. Drill Bits!'' Dianne Wiest,
Mary-Louise Parker co-star.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer (NBC, 9 p.m.; 9 p.m. May 10.)
What would sweeps be without at least one dramatization of a
real-life crime? This one's about Ira Einhorn (played by Kevin
Anderson), who skipped the country after his murder arrest in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 16
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Train (NBC, 9 p.m.; 9 p.m. May 17.) This Rob
Lowe-starring thriller goes head-to-head with France's teen-age
hero (see following) on its first of two nights. A train loaded
with nuclear explosives comes between Lowe and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Joan of Arc (CBS, 9 p.m.; 9 p.m. May 18.) Teen-ager Leelee
Sobieski is an age-appropriate Joan, perhaps history's first riot
grrrrrl. Jacqueline Bisset, Peter O'Toole, Powers Booth are among
the many co-stars; Shirley MacLaine makes a cameo appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Double Platinum (ABC, 9 p.m.) The torch is passed from one diva
to another, as songstresses Diana Ross and Brandy star in ``a
poignant and dramatic story of a mother and daughter's bond amidst
the pressures of superstardom.'' Once again, we learn that nothing
is harder than being young, pretty and talented.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 17
</P>
<P>
   Half a Dozen Babies (ABC, 8 p.m.) Ah, the roar of the greasy
hands, the smell of the diaper pail! If this is your idea of
excitement, live vicariously by watching this dramatization of the
lives of Keith and Becki Dilley, who became the parents of six kids
all in one day. Scott and Melissa Reeves, soap opera stars who are
married in real life, star.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 18
</P>
<P>
   Thumb Wars (UPN, 9:30 p.m.) We're not making this one up: a
``Star Wars'' send-up featuring a cast of dozens _ of dressed-up,
digitally made-up thumbs. Senor Wences goes high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 19
</P>
<P>
   The Nanny (CBS, 8 p.m.) Fran and Maxwell are set to have twins
on this, the hourlong final episode of the sitcom about a nanny
straight outta Brooklyn. To stave off withdrawal from not hearing
Fran Drescher's voice any more on a regular basis, buy a chalkboard
and periodically run your nails down it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 23
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra (ABC, 9 p.m.; 9 p.m. May 24.) Raven-haired beauty
Leonor Varela steps into some pretty big slippers. Following in the
footsteps of Claudette Colbert and Elizabeth Taylor, she plays the
legendary ruler of Egypt and seducer of men. Timothy Dalton
(formerly known as Bond) and Titanic survivor Billy Zane co-star.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesse Ventura Story (NBC, 9 p.m.) The governor formerly
known as the Body gets the TV movie treatment. As Ventura, Nils
Allen Stewart gets fed up with wrestling and decides to go into the
only profession that makes it look like a clean, honest game:
politics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 24
</P>
<P>
   Mad About You (NBC, 9 p.m.) Don't cry for Helen Hunt and Paul
Reiser: they've had a good run during the last seven seasons. In
the meantime, she's won an Academy Award and he has that
high-profile AT&AMP;T gig.
</P>
<P>
   Melrose Place (Fox, 8 p.m.) It's been alternately sublime and
ridiculous _ often in the same episode. The Aaron Spelling evening
soap opera about beautiful people with weird problems comes to an
end after seven seasons. Fans of ultra-short skirts will have to
make do with ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 25
</P>
<P>
   Home Improvement (ABC, 8 p.m.) It's one of those shows that's
been consistently high-rated during the last eight years, even
though you may not know anyone who admits to watching it. The Tool
Time gang gets an hour and a half to say goodbye, including
highlights from shows past. &QL;

FOSSILS OF ARMORED TANKLIKE DINOSAURS FOUND IN UTAH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Ohio)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A site in Utah has yielded a trove of fossils of some of the
biggest armored dinosaurs ever found, paleontologists announced
Monday, and they said the discoveries might compel scientists to
revise the chronology of dinosaur migrations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Kirkland, state paleontologist for Utah, said that
ankylosaur dinosaurs found recently near Price, Utah, were at least
25 million years older than any similar dinosaur type previously
found in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Ankylosaurs, or ``fused lizards,'' were comparable in size to
army tanks, and were sheathed in bony armor plates studded with
horns. They had powerful tails tipped with clubs of solid bone.
Paleontologists speculate that ankylosaurs used the clubs to batter
large attackers like Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ankylosaurs are believed to have originated in Asia,''
Kirkland said. ``It seems that when land masses collided 100
million years ago to create what is now Alaska, these ankylosaurs
were among the first immigrants to North America from Asia. Later,
the Asian dinosaurs coming across the land bridge replaced most of
the North American dinosaurs. We've dated these fossils to 98.4
million years old _ significantly older than previously known North
American ankylosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the fossils, discovered by Sue Anne Bilby and Evan Hall
of the Vernal Field House Museum in Vernal, Utah, was that of an
armored ankylosaur about 30 feet long. Another fossil found at the
site was that of a 30-foot-long nodosaur _ a primitive version of
ankylosaur lacking a tail club. Kirkland said it may be the largest
nodosaur ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists who examined the fossils were surprised to
discover that ankylosaur skull armor appeared to be an outgrowth of
the skull bone itself, not an array of external plates fused to the
skull as had been thought.
</P>
<P>
   Excavation of the Utah site, which began two years ago, is being
conducted by paleontologists from the College of Eastern Utah
Prehistoric Museum, the Denver Museum of Natural History, Utah
State University and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ankylosaur and nodosaur fossils, Kirkland said, the
Price excavation has revealed other dinosaurs, ``all of which
appear at this time to be new to science.''

ISOLATED NATION NOW IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If any country in modern times rivals North Korea
as a strange and isolated place in Western minds and media, it is
Albania, a dirt-poor backwater that has lurched from Stalinism and
Maoism in communist times to crime and chaos since the Cold War
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Albania and Albanians are crucially important to US
military objectives and foreign policy, a profound indication of
just how much more deeply and complexly America and its NATO allies
are entangled in the Balkans than they imagined possible on March
24, when they began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, NATO leaders said they intended to stop Serb-led
persecution of ethnic Albanians. Now, according to a broad range of
scholars and government officials, the alliance owns a host of
other difficult problems in the region, and must stay whether it
wants to or not.
</P>
<P>
   NATO cannot withdraw, they said, without destroying its own
credibility and allowing the conflict to spread to a much broader
area.
</P>
<P>
   So the alliance has little choice but to confront problems that
are of blinding complexity, ranging from if, when, and how ground
troops should be sent to drive the Serbs from Kosovo to what to do
if civil war begins in Montenegro, if Macedonia disintegrates, or
if Bulgaria and Greece come into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This warfare has made things much more difficult'' for the
struggling economies and fledgling democracies of the region, said
John Lampe, a former Foreign Service officer who was stationed in
Belgrade and has specialized in the region as a scholar at the
Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington and at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Albania all are going to go down if
they are not connected to the European economy and assisted,''
Lampe said. ``Greece is threatened, too, in the long run. This is
fateful stuff, and boy are we in the molasses.''
</P>
<P>
   But before those problems can be approached, he and other
specialists said, basic questions about Albania and the ethnic
Albanians elsewhere in the region must be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Will Albania, a country of 11,100-square miles that is a bit
bigger than Vermont, take a place alongside Okinawa, Guam, and
Guantanamo as a platform for projecting American power?
</P>
<P>
   Will the nationalist aspirations of the Albanian people, the
most militant of whom live not in Albania but in disputed Kosovo
province, be the catalyst for a much wider Balkan war?
</P>
<P>
   Most political leaders still hope bombing will force Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to retreat from Kosovo, allowing the
half-million ethnic Albanian refugees to return. Those who doubt
the air war alone will succeed are confident that the use of ground
troops could finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The path we should go down is to use overwhelming force, drive
the Serbs out, and then have a peacekeeping force there,'' said
Senator John McCain, a Vietnam war hero who is a leading advocate
of using ground troops. ``If we can't beat this army, with its
antiquated Russian equipment, we've wasted billions. We will take
casualties, and I will grieve, but I have no doubt that we will
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to beat Mr. Milosevic and beat him good,'' he said,
``and then we won't have to worry about him anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania and Macedonia are important, added the Arizona
Republican, but they should not prove to be problems as long as
Milosevic is under control. After meeting with Albania's president
Thursday, McCain said that nation will ``do anything necessary'' to
assist the NATO effort, and the Macedonians, too, realize it is in
their interest to support the allied campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts about NATO's ability to win a clear victory and then
successfully manage the region are spreading among Balkan
specialists, former officials, and to a lesser degree, government
sources. Some warn that, to NATO's particular peril, it has little
understanding of Albania and the Albanians who will be key to the
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``American policy makers think they can somehow create some sort
of military protectorate leading to an independent Kosovo, and they
are sadly mistaken,'' said Steven Burg, a Brandeis University
professor of politics and an authority on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albanians of all types,'' who live in Kosovo, Albania proper
and northwest Macedonia, ``do not think they are fighting for a
little autonomous state,'' said Burg, author of a recently
published book on ethnic conflict and foreign intervention in the
Balkans. ``They think they are the cutting edge of the effort to
create a greater Albania,'' unifying those three regions.
</P>
<P>
   Burg also warned that NATO appears not to have done a good job
of analyzing Yugoslav defense policy before the conflict started,
and consequently may be in for some nasty surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav military's entire strategic defense philosophy''
since the country broke with the Soviet bloc in 1948 ``is that they
would be invaded by a superpower, the Soviet Union, with massive
air and ground superiority,'' he said. ``I think they have been
completely prepared for everything we have thrown at them and are
just waiting for the real show to start. Just substitute US for
Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO is able to achieve its objectives in Kosovo and the
Serbs withdraw, said MIT political scientist Barry Posen, a
specialist in the history of war, ``if we're not there to beat the
snot out of them, they'll move right back in. We're going to be
sitting with a lot of troops there for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to holding the Serbs at bay, scholars and analysts
said, the alliance will have to prevent the union of the three
Albanian areas: Kosovo, Albania and western Macedonia. Failure to
do so would doom Macedonia as an entity and set off a new struggle
over the remnants of that fledgling republic.
</P>
<P>
   A large majority of Macedonians are Slavs, but most observers
said they are closer, culturally and linguistically, to the Slavs
of Bulgaria rather than those of Serbia. Greece also has
territorial claims there. Macedonia provided an important smuggling
route for the Serbs when they were subjected to international
sanctions, and Serbia might not tolerate either Bulgarian or Greek
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without us sitting on it,'' Posen said, ``it is not going to
be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   The need to restrain Albanian nationalism, to service armed
forces in Kosovo for the indefinite future, and, probably, to
manage several hundred thousand skittish refugees on the borders of
Kosovo until they believe it is safe to go home, all point to the
development of extensive NATO support facilities in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government has been signaling its willingness to
host a US or NATO base for years. That's not surprising in light of
the economic and security benefits this would bring to a country
that is now Europe's poorest, and the least-qualified applicant for
NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, said Joseph Nye, who was assistant secretary of
defense for international security when the offers were first made,
``there was not the kind of flaming crisis we have in Kosovo now,
so we were discouraging. . . . But that was then, and this is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe we are going to have to make a credible threat
about land forces to be able to get the refugees back, and then we
have to have a credible capability to protect them, you are
probably going to need major help from Albania to pull that off,''
said Nye, now dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government. ``Would I have got involved in the first place?
Probably not. From where we are now, it's probably necessary.''

ETHIC VIOLENCE WRACKS INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAMBAS, Indonesia _ While world attention is fixed on Kosovo,
ethnic violence is blazing another horrifying trail, thousands of
miles away, in a country with 20 times the population of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the Indonesian side of the fabled island of Borneo,
``ethnic cleansing'' has taken a particularly grisly twist. In the
last month, mobs have chopped off their enemies' heads and paraded
them on the streets. Some have even eaten victims' hearts and
livers to underscore the message scrawled in blood on some victims'
homes: ``Bakayo'' _ ``Get Out.''
</P>
<P>
   The rural coastal road here in West Kalimantan province
resembles a war zone; thousands of houses belonging to a hated
minority _ migrants from Madura island _ have been reduced to ash
and charred planks. In several villages, grimacing, mutilated heads
of Madurese men and women were displayed on oil drums and wooden
stakes in recent weeks, and flung triumphantly out of cars at the
feet of outnumbered soldiers unable or unwilling to control the
mobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three months, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people
have been killed, and tens of thousands have been driven from their
homes in several parts of the world's fourth most populous nation.
Last week, a mosque bombing, church burnings, and a handful of
killings rocked the Bandas chain in the Moluccan islands, the
island of Sulawesi, and the capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has seen isolated ethnic clashes and attacks on houses
of worship before. But the attacks in the Moluccas and West
Kalimantan have claimed well over 500 lives since mid-January,
putting them among the worst episodes of religious and ethnic
bloodletting in Indonesia's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, such outbreaks could endanger national
elections less than two months away, and a planned transition to
democracy. In the long run, unresolved disputes over resources,
power sharing, and cultural differences could fundamentally
destabilize this country of 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts attribute the violence to old resentments long
suppressed by a dictatorial state. Others blame the worst economic
crisis in decades. But many Indonesians _ from unschooled villagers
to academics to opposition politicians _ accuse agitators linked to
the old regime who they say are intent on undermining democratic
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In West Kalimantan, the conflict began in January, but turned
ugliest last month, when the Malayus _ indigenous ethnic Malay
Muslims as well as Muslims from several other islands _ clashed
with Muslim migrants from the island of Madura. Descendants of
nomadic Dayak tribes, now mostly Christians, allied with the
Malayus. Even the ethnic Chinese minority quietly sided against the
Madurese, giving refreshments to hungry mobs of attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotypes about Madurese reek of prejudices against
immigrants almost anywhere: that they are hard-working and thrifty,
but also aggressive, insensitive to local customs, and criminal.
Some Madurese have prospered visibly in Kalimantan's few large
towns, but most are farmers or laborers who may be slightly better
off than their neighbors, but are hardly rich.
</P>
<P>
   Madura is a tiny, overcrowded, and infertile rock island whose
inhabitants were moved to other islands early this century by Dutch
colonial rulers, and in recent decades by the Indonesian
government. They have roused the ire of Kalimantan's natives by
accepting menial jobs at lower wages, by laboring on plantations
created from government-expropriated land, and, according to
locals, by settling their disputes with physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   Minor disputes _ over a robbery and an unpaid bus fare _
escalated into revenge campaigns that have claimed more than 200
lives since January, officials say. Community leaders and aid
workers suspect that the true number is 10 times that.
</P>
<P>
   A charred patch on the main street of the sleepy town of Sambas
marks the spot where a mob burned a man alive. A tiny bridge in
Tebas, a 45-minute drive away, is where attackers played soccer
with another victim's head. Malayu men with machetes and rifles are
still patrolling villages and sleeping in shifts, manning nighttime
checkpoints to search cars for weapons and Madurese.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is for them to leave West Kalimantan
altogether,'' said Fauzi, a farmer in Pemangkat village who smiled
jovially while brandishing a sickle at his guard post. ``If they
are moved from this area to refugee camps, it makes it seem safe,
but they're still among us. We've been under their thumbs for 50
years. They've robbed us, killed us, and we've done nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there are nice ones,'' he allowed. ``But 80 percent
are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Madurese make up only about 6 percent of West Kalimantan's
population of 3.5 million, according to a government survey, and
physically, much resemble locals.
</P>
<P>
   Haji Sulaiman, a wealthy Madurese who is head of West
Kalimantan's Chamber of Commerce and a member of the provincial
assembly, says a small number of Madurese ``steal, gamble, and rob,
and we condemn this behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's also a social envy,'' he said. ``Madurese live
better, we're hard-working. Say there's unproductive land; Malayus
neglect it, but the Madurese take it over and make it productive.
They also say Madurese are stingy. Well, we save and in the end, we
can buy nice houses, wear gold, and go on hajj,'' the annual Muslim
pilgrimige to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Yuslizar, a Malayu farmer patrolling Pemangkat village with a
rifle taken from the abandoned home of a Madurese neighbor, snorts
at the suggestion of jealousy: ``Of course they're rich _ from
stealing from us. We plant seeds; they harvest. We raise chickens;
they take them from the coop.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance of native customs, on the part of the government as
well as the Madurese, has fueled animosities. Dayaks practice
slash-and-burn agriculture, leaving patches of land fallow for
years while they grow back to forest. The central government has
ignored indigenous land claims and seized the land for timber and
palm oil plantations, and for migrants. Madurese have reputedly
settled on fallow land and refused to move. The tradition among
some Madurese of carrying knives _ a symbol of the hero in Madurese
culture _ has fed the perception that they are violent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, chopping off heads and eating organs seems an extreme
reaction. Adi Sunarso, a hotel employee who is Malayu and Javanese,
says he hasn't seen anything like it in his 34 years. ``What if
that were my wife and child?''
</P>
<P>
   The violence is not the first between Madurese and locals; since
1967, eight conflicts have broken out between Madurese and Dayaks,
and one between Madurese and Chinese. In 1997, a Madurese-Dayak
clash claimed 300 lives by official count, though aid workers
estimated the toll at 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Madurese refugees say army trucks and boats were waiting for
them this time when they were chased out of their villages, raising
suspicions that the military was forewarned of attacks or chose not
to prevent them. Second Lieutenant Suparyana, the Javanese
commander of an army base in Sambas, scoffs at the notion. ``The
only way of protecting them was to get them out. There was nothing
else we could do. I had only 25 men _ not even a full platoon _ and
there were thousands of attackers. At least we tried to prevent it
from spreading to other villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, not even the Roman Catholic bishop of Pontianak has
called for reconciliation. ``The only solution is that the Madurese
are moved, and they should not come back,'' said Bishop Hieronymus
Bumbun, a Dayak. ``Maybe we have to find an empty island for them.
We have 17,000 islands; surely we can find one.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the short-term fix seems to be refugee camps and offers
of passage to Madura. Hedy Sukarsono of Volunteer Relief Center
says he has registered 63,000 Madurese refugees, and estimates
17,000 more are living with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Madurese huddled under tarpaulins in muddy fields and
foul-smelling stadiums hardly seem the dangerous ogres described by
their former neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Sarijan, 60, a farmer and third-generation Madurese from
Sendoyan village, was on the verge of tears describing his eviction
from his home. ``When my father got there, it was a jungle. He cut
down trees, built a house, and made a field, and I want to go back
and enjoy what my father worked hard for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I go to Madura? I feel Indonesian first,'' he
declared. ``If they stop calling this place Indonesia, I'll happily
go to Madura. But as long as this is Indonesia, I think I have a
right to stay here.''

<P>
   An overload of conflicting and often alarmist information about
vaccinations is leading some medical experts into a new field of
research: not the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, which they
consider proven, but the public's questions, doubts and fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we're doctors doesn't mean we don't also look at
the Internet,'' said Dr. Bruce G. Gellin of Vanderbilt University,
staff director of the Vaccine Initiative, a special project of the
Infectious Diseases Society of America. Some Web sites about
immunization, he said, ``focus to a large degree on concerns about
safety that are far more hypothesis than fact.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the society created the initiative, which is
using focus groups, surveys and other marketing tools to explain
immunization to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But Gellin and other experts are not the only ones who feel
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, them,'' said Barbara Loe Fisher of Washington, referring
to the experts, adding, ``They have been attacking parents who have
been talking about vaccine safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher is president of the National Vaccine Information
Center, which she and another woman founded after their children
had what they called severe reactions to
diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus shots. She said the children, both
boys, also were found to have learning disabilities and attention
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not anti-vaccine,'' Ms. Fisher said. ``We believe a
humane vaccination and health policy should be in place. We are
against forced vaccination.''
</P>
<P>
   The group pushed for federal legislation in 1986 that created a
no-fault compensation system for vaccine-related injuries, and for
changes in the pertussis vaccine. The organization also promotes
informed consent: parental awareness about vaccination risks and
the right to refuse shots, which puts them at odds with most public
school regulations. Ms. Fisher said she believed her son was
injured by the vaccine and expressed resentment that anyone might
consider such an outcome tolerable. ``Parents are saying, ``Hey
wait a minute, my child is important, too!''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that question or oppose vaccination include many people
besides concerned parents _ some are advocates of alternative
medicine, some are political conservatives and some are
libertarians, to name a few. They have become more visible for
several reasons: the Clinton administration has increased aid for
vaccine research and distribution, including immunization
registries; new vaccines have been recommended for preschool
children, including vaccines against hepatitis B since 1991 and
rotaviral diarrhea since December; and the Internet has grown,
allowing groups to create Web sites and to communicate their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the vaccine critics agree that groups like Ms.
Fisher's have helped raise useful questions. The problem, some
officials say, is that by discounting safety data and accepting
sometimes unverified accounts as fact, they may drown out the real
answers.
</P>
<P>
   To public health experts, vaccination is one of the century's
triumphs. Smallpox has been eradicated, and last year the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported only 1 case
each of diphtheria and polio, 34 of tetanus and 89 of measles.
</P>
<P>
   But as illness from vaccine-preventable disease has plummeted,
illness from the vaccines themselves, however rare, looms larger in
the minds of some.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Ms. Fisher's do not attribute a specific total of
injuries and deaths to vaccine _ some assert that vaccine-related
cases are frequently misdiagnosed, and so there are no reliable
data _ but they allege that the risk is much higher than mainstream
physicians and the government say. For example, Ms. Fisher's group
says on the Internet that it is calling for government financing of
independent researchers ``to investigate the reported links between
vaccines and neurological and autoimmune disorders.'' The site
lists problems that group members say may be associated with
vaccination _ including learning disabilities, attention deficit
disorder, autism, asthma, diabetes and ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   Many medical authorities warn against paying too much attention
to these reports. The CDC says vaccines cause so few ill effects
that the risks cannot be reliably measured. The agency says that
the risk of encephalitis or severe allergic reaction from
mumps-measles-rubella vaccine is 1 in 1 million. It says the risk
to unvaccinated children is one death in 3,000 measles cases, one
encephalitis case in 300 cases of mumps, and one case of congenital
rubella syndrome for every four mothers infected early in
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in danger of becoming a victim of our own success,''
Dr. Louis Sullivan, the former Secretary of Health and Human
Services, told the annual National Immunization Conference in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our citizens cannot remember seeing a child with
measles or polio,'' he continued, ``but they are constantly reading
and hearing about the adverse reactions linked to the vaccines that
have nearly vanquished these threats in the United States.''

</P>
<P>
   In a report in January favoring community and state immunization
registries, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee said that fear
of misuse was strong, privacy should be enforced and use of a
registry by tax, immigration or other agencies must be prohibited.
It opposed a national registry and said that parents should be
allowed to keep their children from participating.
</P>
<P>
   A central data base ``is in no way what we're talking about,''
said Dr. Robert W. Linkins, chief of the systems development branch
of the CDC's National Immunization Program.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, a state immunization registry for preschool children
was approved last month after the Idaho Christian Coalition
initially opposed it but later endorsed it after changes in the
language.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Parents Requesting Open Vaccine Education, a group
that uses the acronym PROVE, insisted that the state's immunization
registry include only children whose parents approved of their
being included in the registry in writing. The group also asked
that the data not be shared with other states.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Brad Dacus, the director of the Pacific Justice
Institute, a network of politically conservative lawyers,
questioned the need for a childhood vaccination for hepatitis B,
which is often spread by sexual contact or intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, however, notes that about 25 percent of all people
infected with hepatitis B have no known risk factor. Hepatitis B,
which infects 200,000 Americans a year, is acquired by exposure to
blood or body fluids from an infected person. It is about 100 times
easier to transmit than is HIV, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   Universal vaccination, the agency says, is not only easier to
achieve with young children, but protects low-risk children from
accidental infection by others. Besides, the CDC adds, no one can
predict which children will grow up to become high-risk adults.
</P>
<P>
   Experts add that some critics ignore what would happen if their
advice was taken and vaccination programs were curbed _ if laws
requiring vaccinations for measles and other diseases for entry to
school were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can credit largely the school laws with the
near-elimination of measles from this country in the last few
years,'' said Dr. Neal A. Halsey, a professor at the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health and the director of its Institute for
Vaccine Safety.
</P>
<P>
   A January 1998 article in The Lancet detailed the sharp rise in
pertussis rates in the 1970s and 1980s in countries where popular
accounts of adverse reactions led to sharp drops in vaccination.

PARENTS MUST HAVE KNOWN

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ They are the most frequent targets for blame
in the aftermath of the shooting and bombing rampage that left 15
dead at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Where were those boys' parents?
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the question on the muddy hillside overlooking the
high school library, where mourners have erected a large wooden
cross to mark the scene of one of the worst schoolhouse massacres
in history.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear it on radio call-in shows that have set aside all
comment about Clinton and Kosovo to talk nonstop about the carnage
at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Even the president, in his weekly radio address to the nation,
said Saturday that ``parents come first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should turn off the television and pay attention to
what's on the computer screen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed too soon, too cruel, in the last few days to ask how
much an abdication of parental responsibility contributed to the
apocalyptic acts of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the heavily
armed students suspected of storming their suburban high school,
bent on murder and suicide. Those parents are grieving, too.
</P>
<P>
   But how can we not ask now, after Jefferson County Sheriff John
Stone has said that the plot to blow up Columbine High and gun down
its student body was not some clandestine scheme, hatched away from
prying adult eyes in an Internet chat room?
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Stone said Saturday, ``police recovered hate
literature, Nazi books and propaganda, and bomb-making materials in
plain view in at least one of the suspect's homes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really question this,'' the sheriff said. ``A lot of people
have stuffed animals and baseball mitts, not pipe bombs'' in their
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Could Harris or Klebold really have kept a detailed, handwritten
diary for more than a year outlining plans for the siege of
Columbine _ complete with diagrams of the school and estimates of
the hour an attack would yield maximum casualties _ without a
mother or father knowing?
</P>
<P>
   Could teenagers really build pipe bombs in the family garage, as
this pair apparently did, without a parent becoming alarmed? Could
two intact, financially secure families really miss the mounting
rage their misfit sons felt in the face of the ridicule to which
they were subjected in a school dominated by jocks and preppies?
</P>
<P>
   How could these parents not have known?
</P>
<P>
   There is not a parent among us who does not fear the dark side
of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard enough, with inadequate screening software, to shield
our children from pornography. How do we protect them from the
violence and the proliferation of hate sites on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard enough to monitor the video games our children play
at the house next door. How do we know which Web sites they are
surfing at the town library?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, many of our children live in a benign enough universe
parallel to our own. We see them at breakfast, their ears encased
in headphones, the faint sounds of their favorite CD leaking from
their headgear into our kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   We reconnect after work and school at home, where we find them
tying up the computer, chatting with friends on line as we once
yakked with ours on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   We do not monitor their e-mail any more than we would eavesdrop
on their phone conversations. Teenagers have privacy rights, too.
</P>
<P>
   But respecting an adolescent's need for independence and
supporting his right to choose to wear a black trenchcoat or a polo
shirt is not the same as surrendering parental guidance and
authority.
</P>
<P>
   These are still children, after all, lacking the maturity or
perspective to know that the hero in high school might well be the
goat in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Harris and Klebold have sequestered themselves in
their homes, hired lawyers, and turned their attention, as have
their neighbors, to burying their children.
</P>
<P>
   They are likely to have their lawyers longer than their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Said a visibly angry Stone, ``I think parents should be held
responsible for their kids' actions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Midwesterners who worry about earthquakes got some good news
last week: their risk of catastrophe may have been vastly
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   New measurements taken around New Madrid, Mo., _ the epicenter
of devastating earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 _ show that the ground
there is scarcely moving. According to many scientists, this means
that it will take 2,500 to 10,000 years before another very large
earthquake could occur in the region, although smaller, less
damaging earthquakes are possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motions are small to zero,'' said Dr. Seth Stein, a
professor of geological sciences at Northwestern University in
Evanston, Ill., who made the new measurements. Earlier evidence
showing rapid regional ground motion, a geologic sign that large
quakes are probable, ``was based on honest scientific errors,''
Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists challenged Stein's findings, reported in
the current issue of the journal Science. ``We see evidence for
very strong ground shaking over the past 2,000 years,'' with great
earthquakes recurring as often as every 500 years, said Dr. Eugene
Schweig, the Central United States coordinator for the United
States Geological Survey's Earthquake Hazards Program at the
University of Memphis in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Schweig said he believed Stein had gone too far in calling the
hazard overstated, and cautioned, ``We need to exercise great
caution when presenting interpretations of our results to the
general public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stein took issue with the criticism. ``This is a classic
example of a geologic argument,'' he said. ``We have to wait
hundreds or thousands of years for real answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of ground motion means that regional building codes
should be relaxed rather than strengthened, Stein said. It is even
possible, he said, that Missouri will never experience another
large earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists do agree, however, on what is happening in the region
at present. Small earthquakes are occurring regularly in the
region, although most are too small to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   Also, evidence for past earthquakes continues to accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side can say for sure what causes earthquakes in New
Madrid. This part of the country is in the middle of the North
American plate, one of a dozen floating on hot, molten rock deep
inside the planet. When these plates collide, scrape or dive past
one another, earthquakes occur.
</P>
<P>
   According to every current model of earthquake dynamics, the New
Madrid region should be unceasingly immobile, stuck as it is in the
middle of a large plate.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began in the 1980s when geologists found signs
that there had once been massive upheaval in the New Madrid
landscape. Whole forest tracts sank. Soils liquefied. The
Mississippi River changed course temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Using carbon dating and other techniques, scientists concluded
that catastrophic earthquakes occurred there in A.D. 500, 900 and
1530. Two or perhaps three earthquakes were centered there in 1811
and 1812, causing widespread damage in the Midwest and parts of the
East Coast. All these events, the scientists said, were probably
magnitude 8, among the most powerful earthquakes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So geophysicists began to study ground motions in the area, and
found that the ground beneath New Madrid was moving almost as fast
as the ground in California, where earthquakes are relatively
common. The scientists calculated that a magnitude 8 earthquake
could occur in New Madrid every 500 to 800 years.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Geological Survey identified the New Madrid
area as one of most dangerous places to live in the nation.
``Memphis is said to be more dangerous than L.A. or San
Francisco,'' Stein said. ``I think this is unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying the numbers ``just didn't make sense,'' Stein and
colleagues from four institutions re-did the ground motion
measurements using far more accurate satellite techniques. ''It
hardly budged,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be, he said, that the ground is not moving very fast.
Or, he said, it might be that previous earthquakes, which were 500
years apart, were much smaller than thought.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Segall, a geophysicist at Stanford University, has also
gone back to New Madrid and is re-doing his previous measurements
using the advanced satellite technique. ``Although we are still
analyzing our data,'' he said, ``we are comfortable in revising
down the rates of strain of what we observed.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Segall and his colleagues also see little if any
ground motion in New Madrid. But he said that did not necessarily
mean a reduced earthquake risk. After a large quake, strain can
build rapidly for several decades and then slow way down. Thus, the
lack of motion today would not rule out the possibility of a large
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Schweig said standard models of strain accumulation based on
plate motions should not be used in New Madrid. ``This is an
intraplate region,'' he said. ``We don't know or understand why
these quakes happen, let alone when or why they might occur
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stein said the answer was simpler. ``We can concoct a
variety of complicated explanations for why we see no motion,'' he
said, ``but the simplest explanation for nothing moving is that
nothing is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein agreed that the New Madrid earthquakes were a mystery.
Since there is little evidence of earthquakes in the region before
2,000 years ago _ and no mountains built up in the wake of seismic
forces _ it is possible that the seismic activity is temporary, he
said. Perhaps there is an ancient fracture in the North American
plate and somehow geologic forces are causing it to rupture, Stein
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be dying out or already dead,'' he said. ``The risk
is not zero, but it's much lower than the maps say.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, are not ready to turn off the alarm. ``I would
hate for people to think they don't have to take any precautions,
to not worry about their foundations or water heaters,'' Segall
said. ``In my mind, there are too many uncertainties.''

ENFORCED HARMONY UNDONE, HATREDS FLARE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   JAKARTA _ Why, after decades of relative harmony, has group
hatred and separatism taken such a bloody turn here?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts attribute it to the boiling over of cultural
differences long suppressed by an authoritarian state. The currency
crisis, runaway inflation, and food shortages that began last year,
have fueled animosities and shortened tempers. Finally, there is a
conspiracy theory espoused by many Indonesians: that troublemakers
from the military or the regime of President Suharto, who was
forced out last year, are provoking incidents to prevent a smooth
transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia was left with a power vacuum last May, after decades
of autocratic rule. The fall of military strongman Suharto
unleashed long-suppressed resentments across this archipelago of
17,000 islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a country emerges from a long period of autocratic rule,
all the problems come to the fore. What's going on is the result of
32 years of suppressing dissatisfaction,'' said a Western diplomat
in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Under Suharto's model of enforced harmony, ``people couldn't do
reconciliation, because they couldn't admit there was a problem.
Wildly different groups were able to live together as long as they
feared the military and police. But now that fear is gone, and it
hasn't been replaced by a respect for law.''
</P>
<P>
   The national motto _ ``Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,'' or ``They are
many; they are one'' _ goes a long way toward explaining the
refusal to acknowledge differences among the nation's 300 ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Since modern Indonesia formed after winning independence from
the Dutch in 1949, power has been centralized on the main island of
Java, in the hands of an elite. Javanese leaders exploited the rich
resources of a 3,100-mile string of islands and made little effort
to understand local problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now trying to get local grievances addressed,'' the
diplomat explained _ but are doing so in an immediate and violent
way.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to meet those grievances and alleviate separatist
demands that some fear could splinter the nation, the parliament
passed a bill last Wednesday granting Indonesia's 27 provinces more
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has some observers talking of the ``Balkanization'' of
Indonesia, but others say it would be dangerous to draw too close a
parallel with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Andi Mallarangeng, a member of the national election committee,
admits that pockets of Indonesia are now plagued by violence or
separatist demands. But, he cautions, that doesn't mean the country
is on the verge of splitting apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formation of Indonesia was not by force like it was with
Tito and communism in Yugoslavia. We've got a much more widespread
belief in Indonesia as a nation,'' Mallarangeng said. ``Even before
independence, there was a movement for unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Syarif Ibrahim Alqadrie, dean of social and political sciences
at the University of Tanjungpura in Pontianak, also draws a
distinction between government-sponsored ``ethnic cleansing'' in
Yugoslavia and what he believes are grass-roots ethnic conflicts in
his province of West Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
   Any long-term solution, he says, will require leaders from
various groups to discuss problems and educate their communities
about cultural differences, conflict-resolution, and coexistence.
``For 32 years, we were not permitted to talk about ethnic groups
and conflicts openly. . . . Now the problem is different: Everyone
wants to say and do anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   But many swept up in the local conflicts aren't so sure they can
be resolved. ``It's the same here as Bosnia or Kosovo,'' said the
Sultan of Sambas, Haji Raden Winata Kesuma, the traditional ruler
of West Kalimantan's Malayus.

THE QUESTIONS ABOUT NATO HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN LUPO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, there actually were times in the old Alpha
Epsilon Pi fraternity house at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst when some of us stopped discussing the unfairness of exams
and the frustration of being ignored by certain women of great
beauty and engaged in conversations worthy of college students.
</P>
<P>
   In one such session, a couple of us admitted that, skepticism of
our youth to the contrary notwithstanding, we believed in the
ability of such outfits as the Strategic Air Command and NATO to
protect us.
</P>
<P>
   Such conclusions were comforting to young men who had vivid
childhood memories of World War II and who were destined to serve
in the armed forces during the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   We were less likely then than we would become in later years to
question authority, but even through the tumultuous '60s and
onward, many Americans held fast to the belief that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization was to military security what the
Marshall Plan had been to economic security.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as aging citizens, we witness NATO in serious combat for
the first time in its half-century history, and we wonder how it
will acquit itself.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Yugoslavia's remnants is, of course, not the fight
for which NATO had prepared itself all those years. Its purpose was
to stop the Soviet armies from taking over more of Europe should
Stalin or his successors try to do so. There is no longer a Soviet
army. There is still a Russian army, many of whose members now
scrounge the countryside for money or food.
</P>
<P>
   There is, instead, Slobodan Milosevic thumbing his nose at the
collective power of the grand alliance. What we college students of
the 1950s did not know and what we adults of the 1990s ought to
know is that NATO, like all organizations, was never perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance was in `disarray' of one sort or another from the
day the NATO treaty was signed because the partners always had
different expectations and different visions of what they were
doing, '' Richard J. Barnet, a foreign policy analyst, wrote in his
1983 book, ``The Alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Confusion always centered on the NATO military forces,'' he
wrote. ``The stated function of the troops _ to keep out Russian
divisions which military analysts doubted were coming in any event
_ caused people to forget the real political purposes they were
intended to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnet contended that initially, NATO's real purpose ``was to
breathe new life into the European integration movement which by
that time showed signs of running out of steam.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, there were issues that would linger for NATO's
history, such as how much was the United States expected to fork
over in money and manpower, compared with the Europeans, and which
nations deserved membership?
</P>
<P>
   Back on this side of the Atlantic, we generally paid little
attention over the years to the pulls and tugs within NATO. As
recently as last year, as Clinton administration officials, US
senators, and foreign policy specialists hotly debated whether to
add Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to NATO, few citizens
seemed to care one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   In fall 1997, the Pew Research Center found that 63 percent of
those surveyed supported NATO's expansion, but only 10 percent
could name so much as one of the three nations being proposed for
alliance membership.
</P>
<P>
   So, when increasing numbers of politicians, journalists and
interested citizens assert that most Americans could not find
Kosovo on a map, they are asserting the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   This observation is usually made in a discussion of how
important or unimportant Kosovo is to the United States and whether
it is worth the life of any American servicemen or women. But while
accurate, the comment seems pretty useless for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the sad fact that most Americans can't find much of
anything on a map, because geography has not been a required course
for a few decades. Find Kosovo? Some citizens can't find well-known
American cities and states on a map.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that Americans tend to be isolationist and
generally refrain from the desire to get involved in pretty much
anything overseas short of a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   History, like geography, is often not taught, or, at the least,
not taught well, but most Americans probably know that their
grandparents and great grandparents prayed mightily during the
1930s that the United States stay out of the already ongoing
conflicts in Europe and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Pure isolationism took a beating after World War II and during
the Cold War, but there remains in America a stubborn belief that
the nation can absent itself from foreign entnglements, global
economy or no global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Kosovo conflict has reopened the closet door for
those who question whether the United States has any business
endangering its sons and daughters, especially, if, as many
military experts argue, ground troops are needed to neutralize
Serbian troops and keep at least part of Kosovo for the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   How America answers that question will determine if NATO, which
is celebrating its 50th anniversary in Washington this weekend, has
any function or future. Already, serious questions have been raised
as to NATO's ability to respond quickly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   How long does it take to get Apache helicopters in position and
then to get permission to use them?
</P>
<P>
   If ground troops are committed, how much planning is needed, and
is not time the enemy?
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO infantry, artillery, armor, and airborne troops
enter Kosovo, who will lead them? Have they had sufficient practice
in training together? Will they have better luck than the Nazi
troops whom the Serbs, fighting in their mountains, held at bay for
much of World War II?
</P>
<P>
   The questions recall one posed in 1948 by Robert A. Lovett, one
of President Harry Truman's key foreign policy advisers and a man
instrumental in creating the foundation that year for NATO's formal
coming-out in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   In their 1986 book, ``The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World
They Made,'' authors Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas quoted Lovett
saying, ``The United States had sought peace through weakness. . .
. After many heartbreaks, it had reversed its policy and was
seeking to deter aggression by proof of determination. The only
question was how its determination should be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, the same question is frighteningly
current.

 &HT;    PALESTINIAN STATE ON HOLD, BUT GAINING SUPPORT
 &HT;    575&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In recent weeks, frequent flyer Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat has traveled from Burkina Faso in Africa to the
dining room of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright seeking
support for statehood for the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   He has brought his cause a long way, but is still short of its
goal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he apparently won U.S. promises that America will host
an Israeli-Palestinian summit meeting within six months and
increase pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (peace process) should not be open-ended,'' said White
House spokesman Joseph Lockhart. ``This can be done and should be
done with the framework of sometime over the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for those final diplomatic victories, Arafat is
expected to make clear in a meeting of PLO leaders back home in
Gaza Tuesday that the time is not right for a Palestinian
declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian parliament gave a nod in that direction Monday
by passing a nonbinding resolution -- adopted 41-1 with two
abstentions -- that does not mention a declaration of statehood on
May 4.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's meeting, 124-member Palestinian Central Council is
to decide what they will do on May 4, the date they see as the
expiration of the Oslo peace process and the day Arafat had vowed
would be the start of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the meeting may run for days and could result
in a reaffirmation of their right to statehood, along with
committees to prepare for eventual statehood under better
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Palestinians are limited to the crowded Gaza Strip
and more than 150 small pockets of land in the West Bank. With
Israel still controlling their movement and surrounding their
cities, many Palestinians say that statehood now would be only
symbolic, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian people understand that a meaningful state
cannot be declared with the situation as it is now,'' said
Palestinian legislator Marwan Kanafani. ``They will understand that
the time is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to their desire for better conditions, Palestinians are
hesitant to make any moves that could frighten Israelis into voting
for hard-line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the May
17 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has been signaling for weeks that he will postpone the
declaration of statehood, instead seeking international support for
statehood at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   That diffused growing tension in the region. A year ago, many
predicted that the declaration could bring open warfare between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Israelis expect the formation of a Palestinian state
on their border someday, they want it to be the result of
negotiations and include restrictions against the formation of a
Palestinian army.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu considers a declaration a violation of the beleaguered
Oslo process and his aides have threatened to retake by force lands
already turned over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians assert that they can declare statehood when the
term of the 1993 Oslo accords comes to an end, May 4. They note
that Israel has delayed land transfers and other provisions
expected under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Israel maintains that the date was just a target and the accords
stay in effect. Israelis blame the delays in Oslo on Palestinian
refusals to fight terror and enter negotiations on the hefty, final
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But, the statehood dispute appears to have been diffused by the
requests and promises of leaders in the U.S. and dozens of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   American officials, opposed to a unilateral declaration of
statehood, have recently increased their criticism of Israeli
home-building in areas that the Palestinians still claim as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lockhart said President Clinton was preparing to send
a letter to Arafat praising his work in the Oslo process, but
withholding support for a statehood declaration. American officials
said the letter will likely promise that the U.S. will lead a
summit meeting of Israeli and Palestinian leaders within six
months, and seek a resolution of the many issues remain under Oslo
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also promise to issue tougher statements against
controversial Israeli building in the disputed lands. All of the
promises will bring more pressure on Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, on Monday Netanyahu appeared to be salvaging a
political victory from the postponement by Arafat. He issued stern
warnings against a declaration and seemed ready to campaign on his
success in holding back Palestinian statehood.

ELLINGTON IS EVERYWHERE

 (EDS: Accompanies DUKE ELLINGTON)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Duke Ellington centennial is being celebrated by just about
everybody, from Down Beat magazine to the 22-year-old Carolina Jazz
Festival to local bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of all this activity, though, is Jazz at Lincoln
Center, which in 1999 is focusing every single event, both in New
York and around the country, on Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights are the Essentially Ellington high school
jazz band competition and a five-month tour undertaken by the
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, which will visit Europe, Russia and
China.
</P>
<P>
   JALC has teamed with PBS for ``Swingin' With Duke: Lincoln
Center Jazz Orchestra With Wynton Marsalis,'' a 90-minute
documentary that premiers May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring footage of Ellington and his band, interview segments
with Marsalis and footage of the LCJO taped live in a New York club
over three nights last August, ``Swingin' '' evokes both the fun
and sophistication of Ellington's music.
</P>
<P>
   The band is in top form, and several guests (saxophonist
Illinois Jacquet on ``Cottontail,'' vocalist Dianne Reeves) do a
commendable job. ``Swingin' '' is relatively light on hard-and-fast
biographical information, and it severely downplays Billy
Strayhorn's contributions, but it's a loving and well-assembled _
if not definitive _ tribute nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying CD, ``Live in Swing City,'' features many of
the cuts from the special, including ``Cottontail,'' Reeves singing
``Bli Blip,'' and strong takes on ``C Jam Blues'' and ``Black and
Tan Fantasy.'' It's a good CD, but it should have been longer: Some
of the best songs on the special, such as ``Dual Highway'' and
Reeves' performance of ``Rocks in My Bed,'' are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz at Lincoln Center is also celebrating the centennial with
its first publication. ``Jump for Joy'' is a handsome 160-page book
with a 1947 essay on jazz by Ellington, two Wynton Marsalis
interviews, essays by Albert Murray and Ralph Ellison, rare photos,
photos by Gordon Parks, and artwork by, among others, Tony Bennett,
Paul Davis and Al Hirschfeld. The book is $25 and available at
select bookstores or by calling (212) 875-5299.
</P>
<P>
   There are also numerous Ellington reissues coming to your local
CD store. The big daddy is ``The Duke Ellington Centennial Edition:
The Complete RCA Victor Recordings 1927-1973,'' a 24-CD look at
Ellington's career. There are six CDs detailing the legendary
1940-1942 band that featured Ben Webster and Jimmy Blanton, and all
three of Ellington's sacred concerts from the '60s and '70s are
brought together for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Records is also reissuing a mess o' Duke: Four CDs are
being reissued: ``Such Sweet Thunder''; ``Black, Brown and Beige'';
``First Time! The Count Meets the Duke, Ellington at Newport 1956 _
Complete'' and the soundtrack to ``Anatomy of a Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   All will be out by mid-May and will be followed in July by ``The
Duke,'' a three-CD box surveying his work for Columbia, OKeh and
various American Record Company labels from 1927 to 1962.

DON'T BE TOO QUICK TO JUMP ON MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever it's time to start bashing the media for their excesses
_ especially the electronic media _ you'll usually find me near the
front of the line. For my money, there are few sights more annoying
than that of a TV news crew shoving a camera into the face of a
victim or a victim's loved one at the scene of some disaster or
other.
</P>
<P>
   I have long predicted that TV news will bring about the end of
civilization as we know it. TV news is simply too rude, too
intrusive, too intimidating, too irreversibly ubiquitous to coexist
with _ much less subjugate itself to _ the process of civilized
news-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm being unfair to the hard-working folks who populate
the electronic media, but that's the way I feel about it. If I
didn't have an opinion, I'd be unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   So. My initial reaction was negative when the TV news hordes
started swarming all over Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., to report on the shooting-and-bombing rampage that left 15
people dead. Maybe it was the frenzied tone of the coverage, or the
cell-phone interviews with students trapped inside the building and
terrified that they would never leave the place alive.
</P>
<P>
   At first it just seemed like too much _ especially when the
networks began unveiling their ``Tragedy in Colorado'' logos and
their mournful theme music. They seemed to be turning mass murder
into entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   As the coverage continued, however, it became perfectly obvious
that this was a story of earth-shattering significance _ not just
to those involved and to the people of Colorado, but to all of
America. These schoolhouse slaughters have been occurring all too
often in this country; the American people are alarmed, and they
want every ounce of information they can get their hands on.
</P>
<P>
   The music and graphics were offensive, no doubt about it, but
that's the world we live in. The media _ all media _ are obsessed
with marketing nowadays. It surely didn't escape readers' attention
that the Fort Worth Star-Telegram labeled pages that carried
stories and photos from Littleton: ``COLORADO SCHOOL SHOOTING.''
</P>
<P>
   When a caller to Mark Davis' talk show on radio station WBAP
complained about the overwrought packaging on CNN and other news
outlets, Davis replied that such things used to bother him but that
he ``got over that a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have been criticizing the incessant TV interviews
with students who survived the attack, with loved ones of those who
were killed, with friends and acquaintances of the teen-age gunmen
who carried out the attack and apparently committed suicide when
they were finished killing others. The interviews were jarring,
that's for sure, and it was sometimes hard to understand why these
people were subjecting themselves to the spectacle of live
television.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, they were subjecting themselves to it. The TV
folks weren't shoving cameras and microphones in front of unwilling
participants.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the students, in fact, seemed to be eagerly making the
rounds, from CNN to ``Today'' to ``Good Morning America.'' If there
was any exploitation going on, the exploiters may have been
star-struck teens grabbing a once-in-a-lifetime chance to talk on
network television.
</P>
<P>
   You could criticize the networks for letting them get away with
it, I suppose, but let's get real: What self-respecting news
organization would turn down an interview with an eyewitness to
mass murder?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers ought to be smart enough to understand that some of
these witnesses might be less-than-reliable sources of information
_ and to evaluate the interviews in that context.
</P>
<P>
   It always strikes me as ironic when critics of the media accuse
TV news of exploiting such stories to boost ratings. If in fact
these stories do increase ratings, it means that the public is
clamoring for the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That's not exploitation. It's supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, covering big stories like the Colorado massacre is
the media's job. They have to do it.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, they did it well.
</P>

THERE'S MORE TO HEALING THAN JUST MEDICINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves,
and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, I will
hear their prayer, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their
land.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 Chronicles 7:14
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Healing is a process as old as Adam and Eve, and as necessary as
breathing. From infancy until death, we're repeatedly in need of
physical, mental or spiritual healing. And I'm convinced that they
are inseparable. Each affects the others.
</P>
<P>
   One frequent observation is that the healing process seems to
respond favorably to a strong will on the part of the patient to be
well. Still, even if we accept this as axiomatic and credit fully
the marvels of medicine, I believe that there may be other elements
involved as well.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, plagued by a slow-healing leg and forced to
re-enter M.D. Anderson hospital for a second effort at a skin
graft, I've become keenly aware of one ingredient of healing:
humility.
</P>
<P>
   Being physically immobilized and dependent on the help of
others, even temporarily, is a humbling experience _ particularly
for guys like me whose self-image has been fed for years by others
coming to us for help.
</P>
<P>
   Some days in Congress, I'd have 50 or more pleas for
intercession of one sort and another. That role is exhilarating _
ego-inflating. Maybe I needed this experience to pierce my pride of
self-sufficiency like a punctured balloon.
</P>
<P>
   These days I've been nursed, wheeled around, fed, medicined,
chauffeured, pampered and made to feel virtually helpless. The
worst is being pushed through busy hospital halls in a wheelchair
by a family member or slender nurse and hoping that nobody
recognizes me. False ego, that's what this is!
</P>
<P>
   Well, the time comes when somebody else has to be the helper and
you the helpee. It never occurred to me before that for me to get
that intoxicating buzz of helping someone who needed it, there had
to be somebody willing to be helped.
</P>
<P>
   There is a socially redemptive role, then, in accepting help
graciously and being grateful for it. That's humbling, and a
necessary part of healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humble themselves.'' That's the way Solomon put the
providential mandate in 2 Chronicles. In other words, admit that we
need help. For individuals and nations in search of healing, it can
be the necessary first step.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a second ingredient of healing is patience, a virtue
with which I've had only a nodding acquaintance. Waiting comes hard
for me. If I were a crocus, I'd be breaking ground in February. Or,
a migratory duck, I'd probably head south in midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural enough that I chafed at the slow recovery of
my leg, from which a bone was removed to make a new jaw. The
original skin graft on the leg did not take, requiring a second
effort. Meanwhile, immobilized, I grew impatient.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation with my old friend Jake Pickle, I
expressed my feelings of frustration. ``Yes, it's understandable,''
said Jake, ``that you would feel that way. But let me tell you what
has happened to my relative.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man in Jake's family _ a remarkably gifted attorney
approaching the prime of his career, the head of an active law firm
_ had been seized by a stroke that has left him partially paralyzed
and (for the time being, at least) stripped of the capacity of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   I realized that my impediment was much less disabling, far more
easily endurable and infinitely less frustrating than his. A sudden
pang of reality reminded me that my temporary misfortune did not
rank mention in the same paragraph with his.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with impatience. It is, in one dimension,
egocentric and mindless of reality. Physical healing proceeds, for
the most part, at its own pace, assuming only our cooperation. It
stands to reason, therefore, that we abet its benign processes by
an awareness of our blessings and an empathetic consciousness of
the afflictions of others.
</P>
<P>
   Our needs for healing transcend the physical. For individuals
and for nations, they sometimes demand a letting go of the agents
of our irritation. Too often this is the hardest task of all. We
cherish the very resentments that, by agitating our ills, keep us
from being whole.
</P>
<P>
   An unwillingness to forgive the past _ just let it be and let it
go _ lies at the heart of much (and maybe even most) of our
suffering. Innocent people are harassed, uprooted and put to
senseless death in the Balkans today because of tortured memories
of things that happened five centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the fear and hate that separate adherents of
different faiths are virtually incomprehensible. But are they any
more irrational, really, than some of the things that keep us angry
and can actually make us ill?
</P>
<P>
   Every psychiatrist is aware of the difficulties in exorcising
the demons of old, half-buried hurts and resentments that can eat
away at our inner selves and debilitate us. Feelings of guilt and
blame, left unresolved, produce all manner of physical symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Enter an old-fashioned word: ``forgiveness.'' To find healing,
we must be willing to forgive. Forgive ourselves. And forgive
others. Recognize it. Forgive it. And let it go. The sense of
relief as the burdens slip away can be palpable _ liberating.
</P>
<P>
   Healing can be a lot of things. It's part medical, part
mystical. We can influence it up to a point. Somehow I think it's
part humility, part patience, part gratitude and empathy, and part
forgiveness. And sometimes the most necessary healing is a healing
of the memories.
</P>

BUILT-IN SUNBLOCK  
 MARTIAL SUNDIAL  
 PROTECTING SALMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like someone who stays too long at the beach, plants can
occasionally overdo it in the sun. While they do not turn red from
sunburn, some plants can suffer irreversible damage to their
chloroplasts, the energy-producing structures within the cell, when
exposed to too much sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers in Britain and Sweden have discovered how one
plant, in effect, loads up on sunblock. Writing in the journal
Science, they describe a system in which too much light produces a
chemical that travels throughout the plant, activating genes that
have an antioxidant effect, protecting the cells from damage from
the excess energy.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied a variety of Arabidopsis, a common
research plant, that had been adapted to grow in low light
conditions. When one part of the plant is exposed to high-intensity
light, the chemical messenger, which the researchers suggest is
hydrogen peroxide, diffuses throughout the plant, even into shaded
portions, and switches on the genes. The whole plant thus becomes
acclimated to the higher light levels. &QL;

   It is not your typical garden ornament, the sundial that is to
be carried aboard a spacecraft due to land on Mars in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The sundial, a three-inch square of anodized aluminum with a
center post, will have a ring pattern arranged to represent the
orbits of Mars and Earth, the word ``Mars'' in more than 20
languages, including ancient Sumerian, and a message wishing future
explorers, human or other, ``a safe journey and the joy of
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The sundial is partly intended to enable space enthusiasts to
track the hours and seasons as the sun moves around the Martian
sky. Because no one knows exactly how the spacecraft, a Mars
Surveyor mission to be launched in 2001, will land, sundial lines
will be determined once the craft's orientation is determined, and
will be superimposed on photographs of the sundial to be posted on
a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The device's other function will be to help calibrate a
panoramic camera on the Mars lander, with the rings and colored
tiles in the corners serving as a test pattern. &QL;

   It may not taste like much grilled on the barbecue, but a rubber
salmon developed by researchers at the Department of Energy may go
a long way toward helping to save real fish.
</P>
<P>
   The six-inch fish, which contains electronic sensors to measure
motion and pressure, is designed to give researchers an idea of
what happens when a real salmon travels through a turbine at a
hydroelectric plant. Newly spawned salmon heading toward the sea on
the Snake and Columbia Rivers in the West must travel through many
such turbines at dams along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that up to 4 out of 10 fish do not survive the
trip, battered by the huge blades of the turbines that turn the
power generators.
</P>
<P>
   Experts within the hydropower industry say that by changing the
shape of turbine blades, the survival rate of salmon may increase.
With 16 salmon species in the Pacific Northwest now considered
threatened or endangered, any improvement in survival would be
welcome and may help the industry avoid what environmentalists have
suggested is the ultimate solution to protect the fish, the removal
of some of the dams.

DOCTORS URGE SCREENING FOR DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is now
recommending that Jews of Central and Eastern European descent be
offered screening to determine whether they are carriers of Canavan
disease, an inherited neurological disorder that causes most
children with the disease to die before age 10.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually appear when children are between 3 and 6 months
of age and involve delays in development, poor head control and an
enlarged head. As the diseases progresses, it causes seizures,
severe feeding problems, significant motor delays and often
blindness. There is no effective therapy for the disease, which can
occur only when both parents are carriers of the recessive Canavan
gene.
</P>
<P>
   Canavan disease is most prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews _ Jews of
Central and Eastern European descent, a group that includes 90
percent of the 6 million Jews in the United States. Medical experts
estimate that one in 40 in this group are carriers of the disease.
When two carriers have children, the risk that the child will have
Canavan disease is about 1 in 6,400. Non-Jews can also be carriers
of the disease, but screening tests are not as accurate for them,
identifying only 40 to 50 percent of non-Jewish carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Screening for Canavan disease requires evaluation of a blood
sample. Testing in the Ashkenazi population will identify 97
percent of those who are carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee on Genetics of the College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists said that if one parent was high risk _ of an
Ashkenazi background or with a family history of Canavan disease _
that partner should be screened first, ideally before conception.
If that partner is a carrier, then the other partner should also be
screened, whether or not he or she is of Ashkenazi background.
</P>
<P>
   The genetics committee recommends that when both partners are
carriers, prenatal testing through chorionic villus sampling or
amniocentesis can accurately determine whether the fetus has the
disease. For more information, call (212) 316-6488 or visit the
Canavan Foundation Web site (www.canavanfoundation.org).

   WASHINGTON _ Days after the nation's last tobacco billboards
were taken down, the Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear a case
that could result in a further crackdown on cigarette advertising
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will examine whether the federal Food and Drug
Administration was correct in 1996 when it declared that it had the
authority to regulate nicotine as a drug and cigarettes as
drug-delivery devices.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's decision became the cornerstone of the Clinton
administration's push to curb teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But last August the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
the FDA lacks such authority. In a 2 to 1 decision, the court said,
``Congress has reserved for itself the regulation of tobacco
products rather than delegating that regulation to the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration appealed that ruling, arguing that the FDA's

</P>
<P>
   But an industry coalition, in a brief filed by Richard M. Cooper
of the powerful Williams and Connolly law firm in Washington,
argued that the appeals court's decision was correct and that
Congress should decide how much authority the FDA should be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA usurped Congress' authority to make policy to the
point of making it a federal offense for a service station or
convenience store to sell cigarettes without verifying the
purchaser's age,'' wrote Cooper, who represents R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., Philip Morris, Lorillard, Brown and Williamson, U.S.

</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry already has had to curtail certain types of
adverstising as part of an agreements reached last year with all 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements, which require the industry to pay $246 billion
over 25 years to settle state claims, ban cartoon characters in ads
and, effective last Friday, all tobacco billboards nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federal government plans to sue the industry to
recover federal health-insurance costs, and the industry faces
individual and class-action lawsuits by smokers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Following the high court's decision Monday to hear the case,
R.J. Reynolds General Counsel Charles A. Blixt said, ``We believe
the (appellate court) correctly interpreted and applied the laws
regarding FDA authority, and we believe that court's opinion will
be upheld by the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA prevails in the case, several proposed regulations
could become law, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring retailers to check the photo identification of
anyone who appears under age 27;
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning vending machine sales and self-service displays,
except in places where minors are not allowed;
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting the sale of single cigarettes and giveaways of
tobacco products;
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning outdoor ads within 1,000 feet of schools and
playgrounds, and limiting other outdoor ads;
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting ads in publications with high youth readership to
black-and-white print only.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised the court's decision to hear the case.
``Every day, 3,000 young people become regular smokers and 1,000
will have their lives cut short as a result,'' he said. ``I remain
firmly committed to the FDA rule, which will help stop young people
from smoking before they start.''
</P>
<P>
   After the court's announcement, anti-smoking activists cited the
importance of the FDA case, arguing that last year's industry
agreements with the states did not go far enough to restrict
tobacco marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling on the FDA case is expected by summer 2000.

CLINTONS DEMONSTRATE LIFE ON THE EDGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not a moment to breathe around here.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Bill and Hillary came to town. Not since the Clinton
years started with Coast Guard and Navy ships ringing the Haitian
coast to assure that thousands of refugees didn't crowd onto
American shores. Not since the furor over Zoe Baird's baby sitter,
the controversy over a big inaugural bash for high-rolling
Democratic contributors, Clinton's suggestion he might be able to
reach some normalization of relations with Saddam Hussein, and
administration indications that there wouldn't be a tax cut for the
middle class after all.
</P>
<P>
   And all that was only the first few days of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   These may be years of peace and prosperity _ and yet they are
also the Frantic Years.
</P>
<P>
   Because after the first few days of tumult in the Clinton's
Washington came the fight over gays in the military. Two more
efforts to find an attorney general. Air strikes against Iraq.
Furious battles over an energy tax. Budget struggles. New crises in
Haiti. The Clinton health plan. Peace efforts in the Middle East.
More air strikes against Iraq. Continuous staff upheaval in the
White House. Whitewater. Travelgate. A firestorm over White House
entrance passes. Another one over FBI files. Sleepovers in the
White House. The 1992 campaign fund-raising scandal. The China
influence-buying scandal. The Cisneros scandal. The Espy scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't even mentioned the name Monica S. Lewinsky yet.
Or Kenneth W. Starr. Or Linda R. Tripp. Or Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crisis follows this guy around,'' says Leon Panetta, who was
Clinton's chief of staff. ``He cannot sit still, and as a result,
neither can we.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisis is, of course, the currency of the realm in the news
business, but history might remember the Clinton years as unusually
full of crisis for a period that, on the surface, might be regarded
as a time of serenity. But the fact that we regard this period as
The Frantic Years offers insights into the character of the
president and the nature of the American political culture at
century's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `crisis' suggests instability, and from the beginning
Clinton was under attack and under question,'' says William E.
Leuchtenberg, a University of North Carolina historian. ``He never
had a honeymoon, he never had a moment of peace. And a lot of it he
brought on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The frantic pace of the past six years is a reflection of the
frantic pace of Clinton's life _ and his outlook.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he was a young man in a hurry. He has his own
explanation: His father died before he was born, on a wet swath of
highway in Missouri, and from the beginning Clinton was in a race _
to cram as much in before he died, to do as much as possible before
he reached his father's age. ``I had been living with the idea of
my father's death and therefore my own mortality since I was a kid,
and that's maybe why I competed so hard and wanted so much,''
Clinton said in a conversation in the autumn of 1991, before he
even entered the presidential race. ``By the time I was governor, I
had already lived three years longer than my father. To me I wasn't
a young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hurried through the beginning of his presidency, the way
he hurried through everything, making stormy a time that even his
critics were willing to grant him for a honeymoon. Seven days
before he was even inaugurated, Donald Devine, a Reagan
administration official and devout conservative, mused
sympathetically about how ``the poor guy doesn't seem to get a
honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   There was never a moment to waste, or even to rest; indeed the
greatest character flaw of the president might not be his weakness
for women but his inclination to see rest as a waste. There was
always something to do, maybe a policy that needed to be formed,
maybe an all-night bull session on welfare that couldn't be put
off, maybe (and here is another problem) a poll finding that needed
to be exploited. The result was a president, and a presidency, that
couldn't say no. It was a promiscuity of a political sort.
</P>
<P>
   Though an Oxford scholar and a lawyer, the president tends
toward the impulsive and not the introspective: He sees a problem
and he wants to do something about it, right this minute if
possible, tomorrow at the latest if not. Last week, after the
massacre in the Colorado high school, the president's instinct was
to fly west, perhaps to share the mourners' grief, perhaps to make
a presidential statement of outrage, perhaps only to share an
important moment in the life of the nation. In the end he didn't
go, deciding instead to visit a Virginia classroom to discuss
school violence, but the impulse provided an important insight into
the president's character.
</P>
<P>
   That impulsiveness, of course, sent him flying into trouble of
the gravest sort during his relationship with Lewinsky, a onetime
White House intern with a taste for dangerous liaisons to match the
president's. ``The man is addicted to risk in all its forms,'' says
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate
University. In that regard, as in so many others, the character of
the presidency has taken on the character of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Many Clinton skeptics criticized the president for offering an
endless menu of suggestions (school uniforms, curfews) instead of
larger policy prescriptions. But perhaps the real danger of the
suggestion-box presidency was its tendency toward motion _ at the
very least, the impulse seemed to be, say something _ instead of
action, as if the president would be measured by the quantity of
his proposals rather than by the quality of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an exhausting president,'' says Richard Norton Smith, a
presidential historian. ``But a lot of it is the media. This is the
presidency under which the 24-hour news cycle has come of age.''
Indeed, Clinton's tendency to be engaged at a high level _ to be
``on'' _ matched the needs and inclinations of the era in
television and cable news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he's `on' all the time,'' Smith says, ``it's not
surprising how much he's on.''
</P>
<P>
   Television and the presidency both existed before Clinton;
before the current administration it was often said that television
came of age during the John Kennedy administration between 1961 to
1963. But in the last several years we have witnessed the
convergence of interests between Clinton, who is inclined toward
constant action like no president of recent memory, and the modern
electronic media, which constantly need new material.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year that convergence produced trouble for the
president, who faced an investigation and then impeachment, even as
it provided high ratings for cable television.
</P>
<P>
   But together the president and the electronic media that
tormented him ended up exhausting the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausting the American people _ and alienating them, too.
Throughout his difficulties, the president retained high
public-approval ratings, but interest in national affairs and in
Washington news flagged. That may be understandable _ readers and
viewers have the right to get tired, too _ but readers and viewers
are also voters, and the danger of the Frantic Years isn't that
Clinton got away with something, or that Clinton was unfairly
accused, but that the public _ the people who hire the politicians
to do their work for them _ has turned away. It's their government,
after all, not the president's, or the Congress's, or the press's.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the end of the Frantic Years, it is not only Washington
that is exhausted. We all are.

<P>
   BLANCO, Texas _ Blanco's 1,300 residents are fiercely protective
of their Hill Country hamlet's reputation. They want outsiders to
know about their exemplary public schools, the churches that form
the bedrock of Blanco's limited social life, and, most of all,
about its antique stores and notion shops and motels with plenty of
rooms available at reasonable prices. What they don't want to talk
about, and don't want the world to hear about, is what happened on
Jan. 9. That's when four law officers from Llano arrived at Christ
of the Hills Monastery five miles outside Blanco. They came to
arrest two monks accused of indecency with a child, a felony that,
if proven in court, could send them to jail for up to 10 years. By

Littleton, Colo., to report on the shooting-and-bombing rampage
that left 15 people dead. At first it just seemed like too much _
especially when the networks began unveiling their ``Tragedy in
Colorado'' logos and their mournful theme music. They seemed to be
turning mass murder into entertainment. As the coverage continued,
however, it became perfectly obvious that this was a story of
earth-shattering significance _ not just to those involved and to
the people of Colorado, but to all of America. By BILL THOMPSON.

PILOTS MUST PAY TO LAND INTERVIEW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ when you apply for law school or medical school, you
typically have to pay an application fee.
</P>
<P>
   But pay a fee to apply for a job?
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines actually charge the people who apply for jobs
as pilots anywhere from $50 to $150 for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, for example, charges its pilot applicants
$100, while America West Airlines charges $50.
</P>
<P>
   To apply at Delta Air Lines, the applicant must register with a
online resume service and fork over $150 (annual renewals are
$100). That's the only method Delta uses to select its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Continental Airlines doesn't charge pilots to
apply but those it wants to interview must pay $50.
</P>
<P>
   Several employment experts were surprised to hear that airlines
charge pilots to apply for jobs instead of considering recruitment
a regular cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' said an incredulous Joe Ahmad, a Houston employment
lawyer. ``I used to think you had the right to work. Now I guess
you have to pay for the privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   So many pilots are drawn to work in what many consider a
glamorous job that airlines can run the show.
</P>
<P>
   They say that it's expensive to do an investigation of a pilot's
background, including a check of training records and criminal
court records, and that they're only trying to recoup some of their
costs.
</P>
<P>
   That rankles an out-of-work pilot who isn't exactly flush with
cash. It's expensive to apply, and as America West points out,
paying the $50 nonrefundable fee ``in no way obligates'' the
airline to interview the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He said he keeps putting off his decision but has only until
April 30 to send his application and his $50 to America West.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs don't exactly pay a lot of money in the early years,
either, he said, asking not to be identified. He said a pilot's job
with America West would pay about $30,000 a year, a figure that
could not be confirmed because America West did not return repeated
phone calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the salary figure appears to be in line with what other
airlines pay for their first-year pilots. Continental, for example,
pays its pilots $30,000 for their first year on the job, a
Continental spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AIRLINE SAYS IT'S NOT FOR PROFIT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are so used to making money from consumers, what with
sophisticated yield management systems and cutbacks in food
service, that they apparently got the idea to make money on job
applicants, Ahmad said.
</P>
<P>
   So are the application fees a new profit center for airlines?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not, said John Hotard, spokesman for American in Fort
Worth. It costs several hundred dollars to check out a pilot
applicant, he said, adding American wants to make sure it gets only
serious candidates. He said applicants who can't afford $100 can
request a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Continental doesn't automatically check out everyone who
applies, so that's why it charges $50 just to the pilots it picks
to interview, said spokesman David Messing.
</P>
<P>
   Delta uses the Universal Pilot Application Service to screen its
pilot applicants. The service, in turn, charges $150 to pilots to
list their resumes
</P>
<P>
   It's actually better for the pilots because instead of paying
$50 at one airline and $100 at another, they can pay just one fee
and get reviewed by several airlines, said Judy Tarver, president
of the online service in Leesburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EMPLOYEES LOST FOR LACK OF CASH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fees certainly run counter to the idea that it is important
to cast your net as wide as possible during the application process
in hopes of attracting the best employees, said John Challenger,
chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the
outplacement firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The fees, he added, knock out people who may be strapped for
cash but would be great employees.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly why California passed a law last year prohibiting
employers from charging an application fee.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted the legislation was a lawsuit filed by the labor
commissioner of California against Northwest Airlines for imposing
a $25 application fee. After the commissioner lost the case, the
California Legislature passed its law forbidding the practice.
</P>
<P>
   There was fear that employers in other industries would begin
charging, said Jose Millan, assistant labor commissioner in San
Francisco, who also said application fees would inhibit people from
applying for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines used to charge its California pilot
applicants a fee but cut that out when the law changed. It was an
administrative nightmare, said Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart, and
eliminated good pilots who didn't want to pay.
</P>
<P>
   That's the last thing the expanding airline wants now, he said.

   Bears in Winter
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help settle a family dispute: do bears hibernate, or not?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bears do hibernate, though not as deeply as some other
hibernating animals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the hibernation of ground squirrels has been found
to be much deeper than that of bears, Wayne Lynch writes in
``Bears'' (The Mountaineers).
</P>
<P>
   Ground squirrels do not sleep straight through the winter,
however, but rouse themselves every couple of weeks to urinate or
defecate, presumably with complex metabolic triggers. Bears can
spend up to five long months without eating, drinking, defecating
or urinating.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have recently suggested that recycling is what
permits bears to engage in what seems like a physiological
impossibility and emerge healthy. They seem to be able to make use
of bone degradation products to build new bone and urinary wastes
to make protein.
</P>
<P>
   Bears' hibernation, which is also called ``denning,'' is
different from that of deep hibernators, which spend most of the
winter with drastically lowered body temperatures. Bears lower
their body temperatures only slightly and continue to burn about
4,000 calories a day, resulting in a Zen-like state of watchful
rest. They can quickly rouse themselves in response to intruders
and can even nurse their young during hibernation.

HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN U.S. CALLED SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Middle-income blacks, Hispanics and whites have significantly
different attitudes toward health care, a new national survey
confirms with a range of new statistics. This research raises
concern among minority leaders that two separate and unequal
systems of care have developed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by Morehouse College of Medicine, a
predominantly black institution in Atlanta, and the New American
Wellness Group, a communications and marketing company that focuses
on minority health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, president of Morehouse and former
secretary of health and human services, said, ``Everybody believes
that because we are all human beings, we are all the same.'' But
the survey shows that ``when we get sick we are very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Thorne, managing director of New American Wellness,
attributed this difference in part to the health care industry's
not having done a better job of developing treatment and education
programs ``that are culturally appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The random-sample survey was restricted to people from 21 to 65
years old with health insurance and incomes of $20,000 to $60,000.
Half were women.
</P>
<P>
   Among the significant findings was that far fewer blacks and
Hispanics than whites had a doctor of their own race or ethnicity.
Among whites, 90 percent had a white doctor; 40 percent of blacks,
a black doctor, and 50 percent of Hispanics, a Hispanic doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical authorities have long stressed the general
importance of a patient's having access to a doctor of the same
racial or ethnic background in helping the doctor fully understand
the patient and in building confidence on the part of the patient
in the doctor and the entire health-care process. A chief aspect of
the problem has been a shortage of minority doctors, a condition
that is growing worse. Minority enrollment has been declining
steadily at medical schools in the United States since 1994, as
affirmative action programs aimed at expanding it have been cut
back.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the survey shows that blacks sought medical
advice more often than whites, or Hispanics. Eighty-five percent of
blacks surveyed had seen a doctor within the past year, compared
with 76 percent of whites and 70 percent of Hispanics. But the
higher visitation rate among blacks was found not to be a measure
of confidence in the system but rather a lack of information about
the system, about health care in general and about health
maintenance. And the lower rate among Hispanics was attributed to
an unfamiliarity with available services, as well as the lack of
access or a cultural focus on the needs of the family rather than
the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause for concern was that compared with whites and
Hispanics, a higher percentage of blacks _ 36 percent _ did not
take their medicine. Among whites and Hispanics, the rates were 18
percent and 15 percent. The reasons cited among all groups included
forgetting to do so, fear of possible side effects, inconvenience,
cost and a disbelief in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The overall findings, Sullivan said, are reflected ``in the
number of minorities who contract illness, and in the number who
die for those illnesses.'' Blacks, according to the National Center
for Health Statistics, for example, have a life span seven years
shorter than whites.

BUSH'S POLITICAL ROAD STARTING TO GET ROUGHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A funny (but not to him) thing has happened to
Gov. George W. Bush on his way to a carefully scripted race for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   More and more questions are being asked about his leadership
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine! Some people actually want to know how strong a leader
is this popular Texan who aspires to be the next leader of the Free
World.
</P>
<P>
   The question is beginning to nag at Bush partly because, in his
effort to snuff out controversy at home before it can damage him in
a national campaign, he is picking his legislative fights very
carefully this session and is having trouble with some of those.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has made his wishes publicly clear on only a
handful of bills, and one of the most visible measures that he is
supporting, a pilot program for tax-backed vouchers for private
schools, is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he is watching his proposed $2.6 billion tax cut
being whittled down by Republican and Democratic lawmakers a alike.
</P>
<P>
   People expect more of Bush _ and rightfully so _ because of his
presidential aspirations, but it's been a long time since the Texas
governor's office resembled anything close to a hotbed of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The last strong governors that Texas had were Allan Shivers,
Price Daniel Sr. and, to a lesser extent, John Connally in the
1950s and 1960s, when Texas was making a painful transition from a
rural to an urban state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas governors' formal powers were as weak then as they are
now. But those governors used their bully pulpits, lobbying skills,
personalities and, sometimes, sheer threats against lawmakers to
force new programs and long-overdue improvements in many state
services.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent governors also have had their programs and
priorities, but their leadership has been inconsistent. Stronger
leadership has come from legislative leaders, particularly from the
lieutenant governor's office during the 26 years that Bob Bullock
and Bill Hobby held the job.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's immediate predecessor, Democrat Ann Richards, earned some
strong marks during her first legislative session in 1991. She
lobbied lawmakers for a new state lottery, pushed for reforms in
insurance regulation, ordered her appointees to the Board of
Pardons and Paroles to sharply reduce early releases from
overcrowded prisons and backed a huge prison expansion program.
</P>
<P>
   But she almost disappeared during the 1993 session, apparently
to avoid controversies that could hurt her 1994 re-election bid,
which she lost to Bush anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who preferred jetting around the country to the more
mundane task of dealing with legislators, lost some of the
insurance reforms during that second session. One of the few times
she did surface in 1993 was to threaten to veto a bill to let
private citizens carry concealed handguns. Her threat killed the
bill that session, and it also helped kill her re-election chances.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Mark White was in a hurry when he moved into the
governor's office in 1983. His confrontational style angered many
legislators, Democrats as well as Republicans, before Ross Perot
and legislative leaders helped White win passage of some major
educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
   White was more low-key during the 1985 session, perhaps trying
to save political capital for his re-election race. But he had to
take a distasteful leadership role in 1986, after the bottom fell
out of oil prices. Two months before Election Day, he had to urge
the Legislature to raise taxes and cut spending to balance the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature did, and the voters booted White out of office,
partly because of the tax increase, partly because of the poor
economy and partly because teachers were still angry at him over
some of the education reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clements made history in 1978, when he was elected Texas'
first Republican governor of modern times. He made some strong
appointments during his first term but also spent a lot of time
learning what the Legislature was all about.
</P>
<P>
   After Clements staged a comeback in 1986, he spent most of his
second term fighting Democratic legislators over tax bills _ and
losing _ as Texas struggled to pull itself out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got high marks during his first legislative session in 1995
for winning approval of his four top priorities _ civil justice
changes, welfare reform, educational improvements and tougher laws
against juvenile offenders. But getting those bills passed didn't
require much heavy lifting because Democratic legislative leaders
and most lawmakers shared his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush faced a more difficult test in 1997, when he tried to
overhaul state taxes but was able instead to salvage only a meager
amount (per taxpayer) of property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 1997 tax reform failure obviously didn't hurt his
re-election last year against a weak Democratic challenger. His
next political race, however, will be more difficult, and his
leadership will be increasingly questioned.

COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER FDA CAN REGULATE TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: FIXES headline and changes 10th graf, removing the word an
and correcting a typo in the word advertising)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Days after the nation's last tobacco billboards
were taken down, the Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear a case
that could result in a further crackdown on cigarette advertising
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will examine whether the federal Food and Drug
Administration was correct in 1996 when it declared that it had the
authority to regulate nicotine as a drug and cigarettes as
drug-delivery devices.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's decision became the cornerstone of the Clinton
administration's push to curb teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But last August the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
the FDA lacks such authority. In a 2 to 1 decision, the court said,
``Congress has reserved for itself the regulation of tobacco
products rather than delegating that regulation to the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration appealed that ruling, arguing that the FDA's
decision was justified by new evidence that the tobacco industry
intended its products to feed consumers' nicotine habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court of appeals was simply wrong,'' Solicitor General
Seth P. Waxman wrote in the government's appeal petition, which is
supported by 39 states. ``Unless reversed by this court, the
panel's ruling will deprive the public of an unparalleled
opportunity to prevent millions of children from beginning a highly
addictive habit that often leads to premature death.''
</P>
<P>
   But an industry coalition, in a brief filed by Richard M. Cooper
of the powerful Williams and Connolly law firm in Washington,
argued that the appeals court's decision was correct and that
Congress should decide how much authority the FDA should be
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA usurped Congress' authority to make policy to the
point of making it a federal offense for a service station or
convenience store to sell cigarettes without verifying the
purchaser's age,'' wrote Cooper, who represents R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., Philip Morris, Lorillard, Brown and Williamson, U.S.
Tobacco, convenience store owners, grocers and tobacco
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry already has had to curtail certain types of
advertising as part of agreements reached last year with all 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements, which require the industry to pay $246 billion
over 25 years to settle state claims, ban cartoon characters in ads
and, effective last Friday, all tobacco billboards nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federal government plans to sue the industry to
recover federal health-insurance costs, and the industry faces
individual and class-action lawsuits by smokers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Following the high court's decision Monday to hear the case,
R.J. Reynolds General Counsel Charles A. Blixt said, ``We believe
the (appellate court) correctly interpreted and applied the laws
regarding FDA authority, and we believe that court's opinion will
be upheld by the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA prevails in the case, several proposed regulations
could become law, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring retailers to check the photo identification of
anyone who appears under age 27;
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning vending machine sales and self-service displays,
except in places where minors are not allowed;
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting the sale of single cigarettes and giveaways of
tobacco products;
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning outdoor ads within 1,000 feet of schools and
playgrounds, and limiting other outdoor ads;
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting ads in publications with high youth readership to
black-and-white print only.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised the court's decision to hear the case.
``Every day, 3,000 young people become regular smokers and 1,000
will have their lives cut short as a result,'' he said. ``I remain
firmly committed to the FDA rule, which will help stop young people
from smoking before they start.''
</P>
<P>
   After the court's announcement, anti-smoking activists cited the
importance of the FDA case, arguing that last year's industry
agreements with the states did not go far enough to restrict
tobacco marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling on the FDA case is expected by summer 2000.

   KUKES, Albania _ Nearly 100,000 Kosovo refugees are getting what
may be a last chance Tuesday to voluntarily move away from this
tenuous border region, before Albanian authorities order them to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been negotiating to prevent the use of force,'' said
Jacques Franquin, spokesman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here.
</P>
<P>
   An Albanian government official said in an interview Monday that
authorities would not forcibly remove the refugees, but he also
said that they simply must get out.
</P>
<P>
   Besides fearing the danger of massive numbers of deaths should
the conflict between U.S.-led NATO and Serb-led Yugoslav forces
expand, authorities see their region buckling socially and
physically under the burden of so many refugees, said special
government envoy Kristo Mertiri.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian government officials were prepared Sunday to issue the
humanitarian groups a deadline for moving out masses of the Kosovar
Albanian refugees who began coming here a month ago to escape Serb
ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia's southern Kosovo province, Franquin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But long discussions led the Albanians to give the UNHCR another
opportunity to convince the refugees to go voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday refugee leaders are to be flown on NATO helicopters
to the sites where the government wants them to be relocated in
cities more distant from the border. They will report on the
conditions there, and recommend to their people whether they should
depart or stay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so difficult, because they will feel for the second time
that they have been expelled from their houses. The first time in
Kosovo and the second time from these tents,'' said Shaip Hajdari,
37, one of the leaders who was selected to take the helicopter
excursion Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hajdari, speaking Monday outside his tent camp where rain
persisted and mud approached ankle level, pulled from his pocket a
rumpled notebook in which he had recorded the names of every family
in the 104 tents in his camp. The camp leaders had visited each and
polled them on whether they want to go or want to stay here, closer
to their homes and to relatives who have not yet managed to escape
from -- or been forced out of -- Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all said, 'If it is up to us, no,''' he said, showing the
column of names and responses in his ruled notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Hajdari said he thinks the helicopter site inspection will be
useful. If the conditions are good, he said, he believes the people
can be convinced to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the conditions are not suitable, we shall refuse,'' he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   He also said refugees are unwilling to go if the aim is simply
clearing space for an expected influx of more Kosovo exiles. They
wonder why the authorities don't take incoming refugees directly to
the new sites, rather than relocate the people already settled in
these tents.
</P>
<P>
   They are more sympathetic to the argument they have heard that
NATO may need this as a staging area for raids across the border
into Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders have not announced any plan to use this area as
a base or a route for the Apache attack helicopters expected to be
operational some time soon. But it is assumed that the Apaches will
need some forward base closer to Yugoslav targets than is the main
NATO military concentration near the Albanian capital of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR's Franquin acknowledged the talk that NATO may want
this area cleared of refugees as badly as do local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely would facilitate a NATO deployment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Serb shelling already a fact of life just 25 miles from
here, the possibility of an attack is not alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Albanian officials) have to evacuate the population
because of a war situation exploding, they will put priority on
their own population before the refugees,'' Franquin said. ``Then
we will be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Mertiri, who is part of a special team the central government
sent as liaison here, said relocating the refugees is the number
one priority for his government. Security is the first reason, but
not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be total destabilization in this country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the stress of having 100,000 refugees -- an estimated
350,000 to 400,000 Kosovo exiles have arrived here since the end of
March -- in a city of less than 25,000 located in one of the poorer
regions of a poor country. Families that have taken in 40,000 of
them are feeling the strain, and they are not getting enough help
from international relief agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have problems of living, problems of food, problems of
health,'' he said. ``There are more than 30 humanitarian
organizations here, but their help is not sufficient.''

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Francisco J. Ayala, former Dominican priest, present day
wine-grape grower, art collector, author of 12 books and 650
articles on genetics, and a professor of biological sciences and
philosophy at the University of California at Irvine, is known in
the science world as the Renaissance man of evolutionary biology.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's many interests are in evidence at his office in Irvine
on a recent morning. Paintings, sculptures and good carpets
decorate the room _ as well as a collection of stuffed parrots,
which Ayala picked up some years ago while on an expedition in the
Amazon. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You teach a basic biology class here at the
University of California at Irvine. How do you handle students with
religious objections to the theory of evolution?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I treat them with respect, and I try to get a dialogue going.
Every year, I start out my course with the theory of evolution. So
on Day 1, there's always a line of students complaining,
``Professor Ayala, I am only here because I want to go to medical
school _ I cannot accept evolution because I am Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   With Catholics, I take out the pope's address to the Pontifical
Academy of Sciences in October 1996 where he endorses evolutionary
teachings. If the students are Christian fundamentalists, I tell
them that there are many Protestant theologians who agree with
evolution. I say that evolution, in my view, is not only NOT
anti-Christian, but the idea of special design, which many
fundamentalists adhere to, might be _ because it teaches the view
of God that is blasphemous. The Special-Design-God is a God who
messes up. Think about all the backaches, infected wisdom teeth and
painful childbirth that exist because we humans evolved
incompletely! ``Do you think God is absent-minded?'' I ask them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why do you think creationism has such a strong hold
on America?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. It is rooted in historical origins. This is a country
colonized originally by people seeking their own religious
feelings, people who felt themselves marginalized because of them.
This beginning gave rise to a kind of religious populism, which
remains a strong part of U.S. culture. Even today.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)There are people saying that the evolutionary
process has come to an end because of advances in genetic
engineering. Do you agree?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Not for a moment. Genetic engineering can accomplish many
things in agriculture, but it will probably not have as great an
effect on the near future on humanity. And evolution will continue.
Indeed, one can demonstrate scientifically that biological
evolution continues, even now, in modern humans. In fact, it is
accelerating because of the rapid changes in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is changing the world we live in, faster and faster.
That is prompting our natural evolution to occur faster and faster.
Yet, it is still very slow. The evolution that is really important
in humans comes through cultural change.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, we do not evolve so much by slowly changing our
genes as we do by rapidly adjusting the environments to the needs
of our genes. For example, our genes make us adapted to live in
tropical climates and yet, we have colonized the whole planet. And
we've done it, not by changing our genes, but by using clothing and
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You're not worried about cloning _ why?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the general public has a misunderstanding of what
cloning means. Contrary to what people think, a human being cannot
be cloned. What can be cloned are genes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, one can clone the genes of Francisco Ayala. But the human
being that will develop will be a completely different person from
me. He may look somewhat like me at the same age, but he will not
have gone through a sequence of experiences that started in my
mother's womb, continued in my family in Franco's Spain and that
went on with me during my immigration to America.
</P>
<P>
   The individual that is developed from these same genes will
experience a completely different environment and will be different
in everything that counts _ temperament, personality, experience.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)There's a colleague of yours here at Irvine, Dr.
Michael Rose, who's doing genetic experiments aimed at increasing
the longevity of fruit flies. You've been somewhat unhappy with
him. Why?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not unhappy with him personally. He has been very
successfully studying the genetics of longevity and he has selected
strains of flies that live longer than the average. Alas, he's
accomplished that by killing off the flies that are not so
long-lived and doing that over many generations. My problem is with
the way Rose goes about it: he's much too drastic _ he lets 99
percent of the flies die. I don't think we'd want to use his
methods to increase human longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Sounds like you have a great fondness for
drosophila, fruit flies?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I do. They are not ugly or anything like that, which people
think. Quite to the contrary! When you look at them under the
microscope, they are very, very attractive creatures. Also, they
are very useful for studying genetics. In a culture you can grow
several hundred of them at very little cost and in just a few days.
On the other hand, much as I like them, I have no problem with
grinding them up for their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You have worked as a member of the National Advisory
Council for the Human Genome Project. Do you think that when the
project makes its report, we will know everything we need to know
about human genetics?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, no. Far from it. We will know some things that will be
helpful. However, we will still be a very long way from
understanding what we humans are, or even how our genome works. One
can know the sequence of letters in the Encyclopedia Britannica,
but that doesn't give us the knowledge contained inside of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What exactly was your role within the Genome
Project?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. One of my concerns was that human diversity be taken into
account. We should not assume that when we have a human genome
mapped that it is the genome of the entire race; every human being
is different. This is something that one has to keep alerting
people again and again: that we are getting the map of one
individual, not the map of the human race.
</P>
<P>
   I pushed for the dedication of some of the budget to evaluate
the ethical and legal and societal implications of what would come
once we had the map. It was early on decided that 3 to 5 percent of
the budget of the whole project would be dedicated to ELSI, which
is an acronym for Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of the
Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You were a part of a scientific group that
discovered that all the world's malaria parasites were descended
from one original creature. What are the implications of that
finding?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. That malaria spread throughout the world comparatively
recently _ after the onset of agriculture. It also implies, very
importantly, that since all the malaria parasites are virtually
identical in their DNA, that there is the possibility of finding a
magic bullet for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)When a new creature is discovered somewhere in the
world, what do you feel?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. If it is an important new species, I get very very excited.
That's what happened when a class of organisms was discovered about
15 years ago _ archaea. These are just like bacteria, but they are
completely different from them and from all other microorganisms.
And they have opened up a whole series of questions to investigate.
Learning about them was comparable to the first time I saw Guernica
by Picasso when I came to New York in 1961. It impacted me in every
important way. It was a sense of opening up new ways of looking at
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Congressman George E. Brown Jr. recently told me he
found scientists to be really poor at getting their needs onto the
national agenda. As the former president of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, do you have insight
into why this is?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. My experience is consistent with his. I think it's because
we're parochial. That's the essence of being a scientist. You have
to focus all your energy into some problem to solve it. In the
process, you become so narrow-minded that you lose perspective of
what else is out there. Scientists are, I think, zealots. They are
completely focused on what interests them, and they pay little
attention to anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What ever prompted you to buy a vineyard in Northern
California? (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. First, it's an incredibly beautiful place, 400 acres at a
high point on the Mokelumne River. I can write there, spend
weekends there. And second, I thought it could be a wonderful
business, which it has been.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you use any of your scientific training in the
grape business?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I use my scientific training to make decisions. For instance,
when I bought the vineyard in 1981, I was told by very experienced
wine producers that chardonnay grapes would not grow well in that
region. I was not persuaded. I planted many acres with the usual
grapes and four with chardonnay. And the chardonnay did very well.
So I planted 163 more. Now, I use the 400 acres to make some wine
for myself, and the rest I sell to Mondavi, Sebastiani, and one or
two others.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Have you considered selling your wine under a
special ``Darwin'' label?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. No, but it's a very good idea.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance that spawned severe thunderstorms Monday across
parts of the western Gulf States will weaken Tuesday as it lifts
slowly east-northeast toward the middle Mississippi Valley.
Nonetheless, potent thunderstorms, some with hail, gusty winds and
downpours, will erupt over parts of Arkansas, western Tennessee and
Missouri. Storms may develop southward into Mississippi and Alabama
as humid air from the Gulf of Mexico converges along of a cool
front associated with the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   On the system's northern flank, steady rains, some with thunder,
will douse parts of the southwest Great Lakes and lower Ohio
Valley. Rainfalls could be moderate to heavy in spots. Meanwhile,
an expansive, stationary high pressure system centered over Hudson
Bay will block the advance of rain into the eastern Great Lakes and
northern Middle Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   Puffy clouds and isolated showers will sprout over parts of New
England as a high-level pool of cold air, which will continue to be
wedged between the high over Hudson Bay and another stagnant high
centered over the north Atlantic, combines will the sun's heating
of the ground to destabilize the atmosphere. Showers will be mainly
restricted to the mountains of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, air temperatures at 18,000 feet off the coast of British
Columbia fell toward minus 33 degrees as a high-altitude pool of
frigid air sank southward. Tuesday, scattered showers and
thunderstorms, some with small hail and gusty winds, will develop
over parts of Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Oklahoma Downpour
</P>
<P>
   A deluge engulfed Oklahoma City on Sunday. Torrents of rain
poured on the city and when the rain tapered off to drizzle, most
sections had measured over 3 inches. At Will Rogers World Airport,
a daily record of 3.79 inches was noted. This rain tally was a mere
.01 inches shy of the 24 hour record for April. A very mild, moist
flow ahead of a sluggish storm exiting the Rockies was lifted by a
ribbon of strong winds just above the surface. This produced a
cluster of thunderstorms on Sunday. The same thing occurred on
Monday, but this time, the heaviest rain fell just east of the
city.

CALIFORNIA ABUSES ITS POWER TO DEFEND MEDIEVAL PRISON POLICIES

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state of California is harassing a respected freelance
journalist because he has advocated changing the state's prison
policy in regard to interviewing inmates. The California Justice
Department ordered Peter Sussman to produce editorial, financial,
phone, computer records and tapes relating to anything the
journalist has written, posted on the Internet (including e-mails),
or said regarding prison access policies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the state's assistant attorneys general, Jane Catherine
Malich, also subpoenaed Sussman for a deposition _ the deposition
lasted 14 hours over several days, according to Sussman.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1997, Sussman was the president of the Northern
California Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.
During that period, the California Department of Corrections issued
new rules disallowing all face-to-face interviews with specified
prisoners and eliminating the confidentiality of inmate mail to the
news media. Sussman worked to oppose the new regulations and then
to reverse them legislatively. He has written extensively about
media access to prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep of the subpoena also requires him to produce all
notes, writings, tape recordings of interviews, news clips, diary
notes, electronic exchanges on an Internet bulletin board called
the WELL, contracts with publishers, drafts and any of his
published work that might relate to California regulations
regarding access to prisoners. It includes anything related to his
``opposition, either as individual or as an officer or former
officer'' of SPJ to changes in prison policies that restrict news
media access to inmates. He is also required to produce all
documents relating to contacts with lawyers over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It would take hundreds of hours just to log the thousands of
materials the subpoena demands so that Sussman can claim reporter's
privilege on each item and record why he claims privilege. If the
court decides an item falls under a reporter's privilege, that item
presumably would not actually have to be produced. But Sussman
works alone and acceding to the subpoena will put a halt to his
work as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, called the actions by the California attorney
general's office, ``astonishing,'' and ``an abuse of the subpoena
process.'' She ended her interview by saying, ``This is a `thought
police' kind of thing that is indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman got sucked into this nightmare because a California
prisoner, Robert Woodard, filed a civil rights lawsuit against the
warden and other prison officials of the California Men's Colony in
San Luis Obispo where he was incarcerated. Woodard had only heard
of Sussman and had not talked to him prior to the alleged
infractions that got Woodard in trouble with prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard was the editor of the prison newspaper, The
Communicator, from 1993 to Feb. 1996, when he wrote a letter to
another journalist about new regulations regarding prison
interviews. David Newdorf represents Woodard. He said Woodard had
invited a journalist to come to the prison to interview his rock
band. The drummer for the inmate band had once played with Eric
Clapton. That invitation caused Woodard to be punished for
``circumventing policies.'' He was removed from the newspaper
staff, charged and found guilty of violating prison rules. Newdorf
claims the so-called ``unwritten change of policy'' did not exist
prior to Woodard's invitation to the journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Newdorf, of the law firm O'Melveny &AMP; Myers in San Francisco, had
an interest in prison access policies, too, and decided to
represent Woodard after seeking out Sussman to discuss the issues.
Later, Newdorf asked Sussman to be an unpaid consultant. According
to Newdorf, Sussman knows more about prison access policies than
anyone except for officials at the California Department of
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Newdorf listed Sussman as a likely witness in his lawsuit. At
this point, Newdorf said in an interview Friday that he doesn't
know whether he will actually call Sussman as a witness.
Nevertheless, the AG's subpoena goes far beyond what Sussman could
be asked as the plaintiff's witness. Much of the materials demanded
by the subpoena are simply not relevant to Woodard's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for the California attorney
general's office, said that Sussman is ``very involved in the
litigation and has been working closely with the plaintiff,
Woodard.'' The AG's office, according to Barankin, has the
impression that Sussman will be called as an ``expert witness.''
Not so, says Newdorf, noting that the deadline for naming expert
witnesses has already passed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, April 29, there will be a hearing on whether
Sussman must produce a privilege log indicating which of the
voluminous records the AG's office wants that he thinks should be
confidential. Creating such a log will consume hundreds of hours,
since collecting and reviewing the materials themselves would take
months.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another political wrinkle in this legal farce. The
newly elected California attorney general is Bill Lockyer, a former
state legislator known for his deep commitment to First Amendment
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Barankin said Lockyer is reviewing the case.
</P>
<P>
   California has one of the most restrictive policies regarding
news media access to prison inmates. These policies severely hamper
the news media's watchdog role in regard to how prisons are run.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that prison officials in Corcoran, one
of California's prisons, were pitting inmates against each other,
as if they were gladiators in the Roman Coliseum. Prison guards bet
on who would win the matches. Seven inmates were shot and killed by
a prison guard, according to Los Angeles Times stories, because the
guards didn't want those inmates to win.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of its Medieval prison policies, the AG's office has
turned its enormous power against a journalist who has been
eloquent in his advocacy for more enlightened prison policies. This
is clearly an abuse of power used to shield an abusive policy.

   PREVENTION: A Plan to Keep Drivers Free of Seizures &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seizure disorders can be controlled by medication, but not for
all patients and not always perfectly. That makes driving a gamble,
which is why most states require people with epilepsy to be
seizure-free for a specified length of time before they get behind
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study, published in the current issue of the journal
Neurology, will help physicians design safer driving programs for
patients by offering them a way to evaluate their risks.

<P>
   Dr. Gregory Krauss, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore who led the study, said the project was organized because
so many patients in the university's epilepsy clinic crashed after
having seizures while driving.
</P>
<P>
   While seizures account for only a tiny portion of the nation's
auto fatalities each year, and only 10 percent of crashes involving
epileptics are attributed to sizures, it is still a subject of
great anxiety to patients weighing the risks of driving.
</P>
<P>
   The study, undertaken by researchers at Johns Hopkins and the
University of Maryland looked at the driving and medical histories
of 100 epilepsy patients, half of whom had been involved in
seizure-related crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor in predicting risk was the length of time a
patient had been seizure-free. Those who had gone a year or more
were 90 percent less likely to crash than those with shorter
intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Another finding was that patients whose seizures were preceded
by auras _ an odd sensation or movement _ were less likely to
crash. But Krauss cautioned that auras gave only limited
protection: some patients were unable to get off the road in time
to make use of the warning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss said he was surprised by the number of patients who were
not reporting seizures to motor vehicle authorities, as required by
law. More than half of the drivers who crashed were driving sooner
after a seizure than the law allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss suggested doctors make these points to patients: Take
rules regarding waiting periods after seizures seriously; keep up
with medication and have it adjusted as needed, and act fast if a
warning sign occurs.
</P>
<P>
   REMEDIES: For Broken Teeth, It's Low-Fat Milk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Pour a glass of milk and see me right away.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What is a dentist's advice in the event of a
knocked-out tooth?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the very best thing to do is put the tooth right back
in the socket it came out of. But few people are willing to try
that, especially when it's their child's tooth they're holding,
said Dr. Leif K. Bakland, a professor of dentistry at Loma Linda
University in California. ``Parents are often squeamish about doing
that and they worry about doing it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakland made a presentation last week to a conference in Atlanta
of the American Association of Endodontists, root canal
specialists, on a new approach to educating the public about steps
to take to help insure successful reinsertion of displaced teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest threats to the tooth are dehydration and
infection, he said. Putting a tooth in water is better than letting
it dry out, but there the tooth faces the opposite problem _ cells
in the root may absorb so much water that they burst, sometimes
within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, on the other hand, is not only free of harmful bacteria,
Bakland said, but is also absorbed slowly enough to pose far less
of a threat than water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skim or low-fat milk is best for the tooth, but don't waste
time looking for it if whole milk is the only type available,'' he
said. ``The difference isn't significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the tooth is safely doused, call a dentist or head to an
emergency room, he advised.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the emergency room, ask whether there is a
dentist on staff, Bakland added. In most cases, a root canal will
be performed to remove damaged tissue, and the tooth crowned.
</P>
<P>
   But time is of the essence, he said. So get a glass and go.
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY: Applying Sunscreen to a Playground &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to protect children from damaging ultraviolet rays,
three agencies plan to build what they describe as the nation's
first intentionally sun-safe playground.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Aid Society, the American Academy of
Dermatologists, and Kaboom, a playground safety group, will
undertake the project on Friday at the Goodhue Center on Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun produces rays of ultraviolet light that can enter the
skin and cause a variety of changes,'' said Dr. Roger Ceilley, a
dermatologist who is a past president of the academy and
co-chairman of the National Coalition for Sun Safety. ``Damage to
DNA can lead to skin cancer, damage to collagen and to elastic
tissue can lead to premature aging, and sunlight that goes
unfiltered into the eyes can lead to cataracts and other eye
problems,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The dermatologists academy estimates that children get 80
percent of their lifetime sun exposure by the time they turn 18,
and that a child born in 1999 has a 1-in-5 risk of developing skin
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While kids are at school, they go out to play in the late
morning, noon or early afternoon,'' Ceilley said. ``The sun is the
most dangerous then. Through volunteer efforts, people have been
installing equipment-safe playgrounds around the country. Why not
make them safe for sun protection?''
</P>
<P>
   Ilene Pappert, director of the Goodhue Center, said the
playground would have swings, a seesaw, covered bridges and
tube-encased slides, and the entire structure would be shielded
from the sun by a special cover that is like a tarpaulin. Benches
will be shaded with roofs to protect the adults watching the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Ceilley also offered the following sun-safety guidelines:
``Avoid midday sun. If you are out in it, wear a hat with at least
a four-inch brim, protective clothes, a minimum of No. 15
sunscreen, and make sure it's reapplied if you're in and out of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   LONGEVITY: Cabernet Sauvignon, the Healthy Toast? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years ago, researchers discovered that Europeans in
Mediterranean countries were less likely to suffer from heart
disease than people elsewhere. This better health was attributed to
the Mediterranean diet, one low in meat and high in fruits,
vegetables, olive oil and wine.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the current issue of the journal Heart, a
cardiologist in the Bordeaux region of France, Dr. Jean-Paul
Broustet, recounted three decades of research on the health
benefits of wine, concluding that cabernet sauvignon made from
Bordeaux grapes was the best wine to drink for good cardiovascular
health and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that the highest concentrations of resveratrol, a
compound that is said to reduce cholesterol in the body and help
prevent clogged arteries and blood clots, was typically found in
Bordeaux grapes. He also noted that good amounts of quercitin,
which helps to break up clots and to dilate blood vessels,
increasing circulation, were also present in his native crop.
</P>
<P>
   But Broustet warned against the dangers of overindulgence,
including high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver and car
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated a regimen of a daily consumption of a half bottle
of red wine with food.

 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ In the seven months since an Australian man
received a new hand and forearm in France, he has defied medical
dogma. His body has not rejected the graft, and nerves are
regenerating faster than his doctors expected. Yet the relationship
of the transplant pioneer, Clint Hallam, 48, and the doctors is
strained over his lack of further progress.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam is gaining feeling in his new fingers and hand. He has
clipped new fingernails, and hair is growing on the forearm below
its point of attachment. Hallam, who said he is a former computer
consultant, looks trim and healthy. He also said he was going to a
gym at least four hours a day and was taking lessons to resume
playing the piano and flying an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   That degree of success has come despite the extraordinary way in
which doctors have carried out the first hand transplant performed
with microsurgery and anti-rejection drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam flew halfway around the world from his home in Perth to
get a dead Frenchman's hand from a team of doctors from Australia,
England, France and Italy that Dr. Earl Owen, a microsurgeon in
Sydney, assembled at the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors chose an unusual patient for the experiment, and
that has caused embarrassment to all parties. Only at the time of
surgery, Owen said, did doctors learn that Hallam, who underwent
extensive psychological testing in Australia and France, had lost
his hand to a saw while in a prison in New Zealand in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Hallam said that eight months before the
transplant he told Owen and his wife the precise circumstances, but
Owen said that Hallam had told him he was a carpenter, omitting the
part about prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam has gained some hand function. But progress has been
erratic. He said he has lost dexterity in the six weeks he has been
back in Australia, and the patient and the doctors offer differing
explanations. The doctors attributed it to Hallam's not following
prescribed supervised physical and occupational therapy. Hallam
disagrees, arguing that Australian doctors are less demanding and
creative than their French colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first and they do not want to do anything that could
damage it, which results in less progress,'' Hallam said.
</P>
<P>
   A hand transplant depends on public appeals for organ and tissue
donors. Thus, doctors say, a transplant recipient, particularly in
a landmark case, has social and moral obligations to make such an
experiment succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam agreed, saying he wants ``to make it work and to show
that it is not a Frankenstein operation and not a freak of
medicine.'' Hallam views himself as a role model for people with
lost limbs who look to a day when they can safely receive
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But his doctors feel let down. ``We doctors are disappointed in
him, but we're not disappointed in his medical condition,'' which
is a ``fantastic result,'' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that this particular person was picked, but
we have to go along with it, and try to treat him in a humanitarian
way however he treats us because he's a role model,'' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam was chosen for the experiment in part because he
convinced the doctors of his dedication and ability to pay for much
of it, and because he assured them he could leave Australia at a
moment's notice when the team was assembled in France, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Owen said he was not aware of what Australian and New Zealand
newspapers later reported: that Hallam, who had been convicted of
fraud, was wanted on fraud charges in Australia and bankruptcy
matters in New Zealand. (Officials have not pressed charges.) Owen
also said he did not initially know that Hallam was classified as
an illegal immigrant in Australia because he had failed to
acknowledge his prison record.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his experience with Hallam, Owen said last week,
``The whole thing is a nightmare of friendly deception,'' and ``in
retrospect, I was being conned.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believe Hallam's physical rehabilitation has been slowed
by his stopping supervised therapy. Hallam argues that he knows his
body best and has long struggled with visa problems with Australian
officials. A spokeswoman for the Australian Embassy in Washington
said laws prohibited it from commenting on individual visa
applications.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning directly to Perth to continue supervised
rehabilitation, Hallam said he visited friends and relatives in
Europe and the United States. In London, Hallam went to a pub with
a member of the transplant team, Dr. Nadey Hakim, and used his new
hand to lift a pint of beer and drink from it.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam said he took charge of his own rehabilitation during the
six-week odyssey, stopping his supervised physical and occupational
therapy and performing what the French physiotherapists had taught
him. He continued taking anti-rejection drugs. Hallam said he was
confident that any rejection problem ``would be clearly visible''
because he was the world's first transplant patient who could ``see
how the operation is proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lack of supervised therapy was like having his hand
immobilized in a plaster cast and held back Hallam's progress,
Hallam's doctors said. Hallam said he had ``lost 40 percent of the
strength in my hand'' at the time he returned to Perth, and more
since then. Now, Hallam said, he ``can barely hold an empty glass
tumbler.'' Owen said Hallam could flex each digit a little and bend
back his wrist about 20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In many experiments, participants are not responsible for the
medical costs but do have to pay to get to where their progress is
monitored, which may be far away from their homes. For Hallam, it
means traveling 2,024 miles across Australia to Owen's office in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes of Hallam's last examination in Sydney in late March
show that sensation has reached the tips of two of Hallam's new
fingers. Pin pricks elicit pain in his little and ring fingers.
Hallam can distinguish between hot and cold objects applied to his
palm and feel an object pressed deep into the palm. Hallam cannot
feel the brush of a feather against his skin, which is the last
sensation he is expected to gain.
</P>
<P>
   In mapping the areas where a patient has feeling, doctors often
insure objectivity by putting eye patches and blindfolds on the
individual. At times, they trick such a patient by saying they are
going to apply a light touch when they stick a pin into a hand.
</P>
<P>
   In Hallam's case, Owen said they did it because ``we do not
believe this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests show that, as expected, Hallam has no feeling in the area
from the site of attachment in the forearm to the wrist because in
the operation the surgeons could not connect the nerves serving
that area.
</P>
<P>
   Skin biopsies have shown that Hallam's only rejection reaction
occurred about two months after the surgery and was easily
controlled by adjusting the amount of immunosuppressive drugs.
Although a skin biopsy showed no evidence of rejection last week,
such a reaction can occur at any time. ``But even if he rejects it
now, it has been a great success,'' said Dr. Marco Lanzetta, a hand
surgeon on the team from Milan, Italy, who was waiting in Sydney
two weeks ago to examine Hallam at an appointment the patient
canceled at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Owen expressed confidence that with more supervised physical
therapy Hallam could get a good handshake, a stronger pinch between
his fingers and thumb to hold a pen, a stronger grip to drive a car
and more. If Hallam ``carries out good physiotherapy, in three
months he should know what he is feeling with his eyes shut,'' Owen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam says that he attends hourlong physiotherapy sessions
three times a week in Perth but that the Australian program is not
``as tough or punishing'' as the schedule of five to seven times a
week that he followed in France.
</P>
<P>
   Owen said he talked several times a week to a team in Perth
headed by Dr. Tony House, the chief of transplantation at the
University of Western Australia, who supervises Hallam's care. The
team is ``happy with his progress,'' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam said his expectations were exceeded the day he used his
new hand to write a thank-you note to the doctors in their presence
in Lyons. The writing was ``a little bit childlike, but certainly
very legible,'' Hallam said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam, who speaks convincingly, said: ``Let me assure you, this
hand will work, and it will have very good function by the first
anniversary.''

`PATTY DUKE SHOW': IDENTICAL COUSINS, FASCINATING AS EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be honest. Are you really expecting much from the ``Patty Duke
Show'' reunion movie?
</P>
<P>
   This was a television series best known for its loopy theme song
(``Here's Cathy, who's lived most everywhere, from Zanzibar to
Berkeley Square''), which a remarkable number of American baby
boomers can sing by heart from start to finish and was probably the
first reference most of us heard to the Ballets Russes. The movie
is exactly in tune with the original series, which ran on ABC from
1963 to 1966, and that is not meant as praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin' in Brooklyn Heights,'' to
be shown Tuesday night on CBS, is now about two identical
52-year-old cousins who are constantly mistaken for each other. The
plot is unlikely: Patty and Cathy's alma mater, Brooklyn Heights
High School, is going to be closed and turned into a shopping mall.
So Patty has to raise $500,000 in a week to save the school by
staging various events. This allows Ms. Duke to speak teen-age
lines like ``The gym! We have to decorate the gym!'' and ``Without
the dance we're sunk.'' Patty works at the school but must not have
heard any new slang in the last three decades. Doesn't she know how
to say, ``How totally not cool is this?''
</P>
<P>
   But the point of television reunion movies, which are nearly
always dreadful, is to see how the old cast looks and to learn what
the writers have decided has happened to the characters over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duke looks harried and worn as Patty Lane but serene and
mature as Cathy. Patty, it seems, married her high school boyfriend
Richard (Eddie Applegate) and divorced him after 27 years, but the
attraction is still there. They have a son who's 33 (which means
Patty had to be secretly pregnant throughout the final season of
the series), and a 14-year-old granddaughter. Cathy, a recent widow
living in her native Scotland, apparently waited longer to start a
family; she has a 14-year-old son, Liam.
</P>
<P>
   William Schallert, who played Patty's newspaperman father, looks
great. Jean Byron, who played Patty's mother, looks pretty good,
too. Everybody else is a little puffy. The only new face is Cindy
Williams, playing Sue Ellen, Patty's high school nemesis, now an
evil real estate broker who wears animal prints.
</P>
<P>
   The flashbacks to the old show are the best part of the two-hour
movie, of course. In the present, viewers are treated to Patty
wearing a strapless evening gown to an arts and crafts fair, Patty
throwing architects' blueprints out a window like a naughty child
and Patty frozen with stage fright in the school production of
``Romeo and Juliet.'' There are pies in the face, a Riverdance
moment and, heaven help us, a Viagra joke.

 &HT;    Struggling to make sense of the nightmare
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as CNN turned to 24-hour-a-day coverage of the killings at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., the massacre also
dominated the newsstand this week, while newsmagazines scrambled to
cover the story and struggled to make sense of the nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   How did smart kids from stable, affluent families turn
themselves into killing machines? This was the big question, and
Time ($3.50) and Newsweek ($3.50) try _ but fail _ to come up with
answers.
</P>
<P>
   What they and others do best, however, is provide chilling
moment-by-moment accounts of the rampage, in the voices of the
students who were trapped under desks and behind barricaded doors.
We hold our breath along with them, stifling a collective scream as
killers prowl the halls.
</P>
<P>
   Time introduces us to ``The Monsters Next Door,'' with
attractive half-page portraits of the violent teens, Dylan Klebold
and Eric Harris. Time visits their homes and interviews friends,
including one who just ``hung out'' with the two boys, and reveals
that, along with the bloody video game Doom, the two enjoyed such
inane kiddie cartoons as ``Pinky and the Brain'' and
``Animaniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   With its cartoonish graphic tracing the movements of the
shooters through the school (red figures stand for dead students,
blue figures are survivors), Newsweek builds a more clarified
timetable of the killings and the SWAT team's response. Newsweek
also tries to answer recurring questions about the agonizingly slow
3 1/2-hour effort to roust the attackers, a delay that allowed
wounded business teacher William David Sanders to bleed to death in
an upstairs classroom, despite the fevered efforts of students to
save his life.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. News &AMP; World Report has more abbreviated coverage of
the disaster, its clumsily written lead paragraph did more than
most to capsulize the frenetic horror of that Tuesday: ``In a whole
lot of ways, this was the worst so far. The death toll, the easily
made bombs, the possible conspiracy, the lunatic rage fueled by a
nihilistic teen culture, the sadism.''
</P>
<P>
   People (2.99) also placed Littleton on its cover, and relied on
first-person accounts from survivors such as 17-year-old Zak
Cartaya, who helped herd students into the office of a choir room,
then barricaded the door with a filing cabinet to protect them from
the shooters.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines try to deepen their reportage with story packages
including sidebars on violent pop culture, the so-called ``Goth''
connection, school safety and other issues that the calamity has
brought to the national round table. The results are uneven.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek delves into brain chemistry in a companion story trying
to explain ``Why the Young Kill'' but fails to prove the premise
established in the headline that ``how these kids are raised can
either save them or push them over the brink.''
</P>
<P>
   A stronger contribution comes from Time essayist Amy Dickinson.
In ``Where Were the Parents?'' Dickinson asks, ``Were the Harrises
aware of the pipe-bomb factory that was in their two-car garage?
The kid down the street was aware of it, and he's 10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   But Time stumbles in a wrongheaded report on ``A Curse of
Cliques'' when it opines that ``There really is a `Lord of the
Flies' dynamic at work among kids,'' but then fails to distinguish
between schoolyard razzing and quasi-gang warfare.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to point the finger at video game makers,
longtime media critic John Leo notes in U.S. News and World Report:
``We are now a society in which the chief form of play for millions
of youngsters is making large numbers of people die.''
</P>
<P>
   That little sentence must give even the most serious fan of Doom
and Quake a moment's pause.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More school violence: On Jan. 8, a suicide pact between a
young Carrollton couple came to its deadly conclusion in a girl's
bathroom at Central High School. Teen People ($2.99) tells how
Andrea Garrett, 15, and Jeff Miller, 17, decided that the only way
they could remain together was in death.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Off the path: Time-Warner will disassemble its foundering
Pathfinder Internet site, which served as the online entryway to
its many magazines (including Time, People, Sports Illustrated and
Forbes) and set up separate ``vertical hubs'' for its various
publications.

 &HT;    Patty Duke reunites her identical cousins
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   `` 'Cuz they're cousins, identical cousins . I . I .''
</P>
<P>
   And now they're back. Everyone's back, in fact, in tonight's
two-hour reunion movie, ``The Patty Duke Show: Still Rockin' in
Brooklyn Heights.'' From Jean Byron and William Schallert as Mom
and beloved ``Poppo,'' to Eddie Applegate and Paul O'Keefe as,
respectively, Patty's hapless boyfriend, Richard, and her
incorrigible little brother, Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Duke reprises her dual role as look-alikes Patty Lane (the
all-American impish one) and her cousin Cathy (the refined Scottish
lass) from the show, which aired from 1963 to 1966 on ABC. It's
doubtful that many people knew then about Duke's hellish home life
with her managers, a domineering married couple who convinced
Duke's unstable mother to let her live with them. In her 1986
autobiography, ``Call Me Anna,'' she wrote about how they changed
her name, refused to let her watch herself on TV and introduced her
to booze and pills. Duke, 52 and a grandmother, recently spoke
about reuniting with her beloved TV family and confronting her
past.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whose idea was it to make this movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: Remember that nostalgia craze about 10 years ago? I was asked
every other Thursday would I do this. And every other Friday I said
no. There were life issues for me that I had all ``mushed''
to-gether with the show. I was still working on ``Was it the fault
of the show that my life was horrible at the time? Or was it my
horrible life?'' I finally determined that not only was it not the
show and the people, but they were my safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Besides the fun of seeing everyone again, did any good come
out of this experience?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Oddly, not as much for me as for Jean and Bill. For all
these years, they carried some sense of responsibility that they
didn't ``save'' me from the situation (with her managers). So one
very long evening, we sat around the dinner table in a restaurant
(and) really thrashed it out. I said, Jean, if you had said to me,
``Honey, is something wrong at home?'' I would've given you 15
minutes on how wonderful it is. Never, ever, did I feel that (Jean
and Bill) had let me down. In fact, those hours that I spent with
them were the only relief I got. And, I witnessed _ even though
they weren't really married to each other and they weren't really
parents _ I witnessed a healthy relationship between a man and a
woman. It was a very emotional conversation. Both of them cried. I
cried.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a sense, you even reunited with yourself, since you played
two characters. What was that like?
</P>
<P>
   A: I only liked playing Cathy as a kid. Patty was stupid and
ridiculous. I had to put up with it so I could get to Cathy, who
was rational, kind, quiet and respected. Well, this time I fell
into Patty quite fast, and I couldn't find Cathy for love or money.
I said to Jean and Bill, ``Help me. How does she talk?'' And both
of them almost simultaneously said, ``Honey, she, too, is 35 years
older. She doesn't sound the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: With technological advances, was it easier now playing two
people in the same scene?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it used to take me only 15 minutes to change from one
character to the other. Now it takes 2 1/2 hours. But you could see
(the result) immediately. I was, for one of the few times in my
life speechless, to see me hug me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the enduring love people have for the show?
</P>
<P>
   A: One thing I feel very strongly about is that theme song. The
other thing was, back then there weren't a whole lot of other
teenage people on television. So it was a place for my compatriots
to go, and for parents it was a weapon. One of my favorite things I
hear is, `My mother wouldn't let me watch it until after I did my
homework.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: Logically, should Patty and Cathy have been twins instead of
identical cousins?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But how would you have had the whole culture clash thing
then?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of them would've had to be evil!
</P>
<P>
   x-mates that I'm very friendly with.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ In a rare sign of dissent within
Yugoslavia's leadership Monday, Yugoslav Deputy Premier Vuk
Draskovic, appearing on local television Sunday, called on state
leaders to stop lying to the people of Serbia. He said the people
should be told that world opinion is against them _ an apparent
reference to state propaganda boosting anti-NATO feelings.
Draskovic, considered a moderate and once the main opposition
leader, said Yugoslavia should accept a U.N. force in Kosovo and
allow the return of ethnic Albanian refugees. His comments, along
with the three U.U. POW's being seen by the Red Cross and alleged
visit the Rev. Jesse Jackson and other clerics, may provide a new
opening for a diplomatic way to end the bombing _ now in its 34th
day. Developments. (Deans, Cox News Service). 30.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ KUKES, Albania _ Ethnic Albanian refugees

shields by Serbian soldiers at an ammunition depot in Kosovo.

IN JONESBORO, FROM AN EARLIER SHOOTING, THE ECHOES HAVE YET TO DIE
AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (mb)  
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. _ When Gretchen Woodard heard about the two
gun-toting boys in Colorado who murdered classmates and a teacher
in another gruesome school shooting, some of her reactions echoed
those of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   She thought, ``Where were these boys' parents? How could they
not have known these kids were building bombs in their garage? Why
didn't they pay attention to the trench coats and other warning
signs of trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Woodard had to stop short of taking comfort in the next
thought on most people's minds, ``My child would never do anything
like that.'' Because, in fact, Ms. Woodard's child did, just last
year, here in Jonesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Mitchell Johnson, then 13, was the older of the two
friends who murdered four classmates and a teacher in the Jonesboro
school massacre on March 24, 1998. In the year and a month since
that day, she has had to stop short a lot, learning to monitor
herself at every turn, trying not to say, do or even think anything
that might cause anyone any more pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made me very humble,'' Ms. Woodard, 43, said on Monday,
from the living room of her tidy, modest home at the end of a
country road, about a mile from Westside Middle School where her
son did the shooting. As Ms. Woodard talked, her 3-year-old
daughter played with a lady bug. ``I am the last person to sit in
judgment of other people. But it is human nature to have questions
and point your finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Her younger son, Monte, 12, has also had to learn to compensate
for living in his brother's shadow. When Monte, a sixth grader,
walks down the halls at Westside Middle School, where pictures of
the shooting victims adorn the walls, he carries all his books and
supplies in his arms, in full view. Early on after the shooting,
Monte decided not to carry a backpack, because he thought it would
scare the other students every time he reached inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first Monte was angry at his brother for doing something so
stupid, so senseless,'' Ms. Woodard said. ``He cried and I just
held him and he kept asking why. I couldn't begin to explain. I was
too overwhelmed with the horror of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry, a youth minister at Central Baptist Church in
Jonesboro, where Monte attends a youth group meeting every
Wednesday night, has seen Ms. Woodard and her sons through some of
that horror. Many times in the past year, Perry has counseled
Mitchell Johnson in jail. ``That family feels a whole buffet of
emotions,'' he said. ``Fear of retaliation. Social shame. A
struggle to maintain their own dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard said she does not try to defend or explain her son's
behavior. ``For so long afterward I blamed myself,'' she said.
``You question everything _ your sense of right and wrong, even
your TV. And all of a sudden, your whole life, whether it be good
or bad, is put under a microscope and everybody is saying, `Well,
you watched that television show two months ago, and it's because
you played a video game, it's because your son listens to rap
music.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Who amongst us can hold up for very long under that pressure?
That is something I know those parents in Littleton will have to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard has heard people blame her son's participation in
the shooting on her divorce from his father after a 15-year
marriage. Soon afterward, she remarried. She has been faulted for
teaching her son to shoot a rifle so he could go hunting, just as
she did when she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the sexual abuse of her son and his brother by a
neighborhood teen-ager when they lived in Minnesota, which she
learned about only when her ex-husband revealed it to Barbara
Walters on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too easy to point your finger and blame the family,''
Perry, the youth minister, said. ``Is Gretchen a good parent? Yes.
Is she flawless? No. Is she evil? No. Does she care for and love
her kids? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, both Monte and his mother have been buoyed and a
little surprised by the kindness of the Westside students and
teachers. ``I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised if people had
wanted to spit on me or yell at me,'' Ms. Woodard said. ``But that
hasn't ever happened. It has been our blessing that this community
has let us go on.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of school this fall, 12-year-old Candace
Porter, 12, who survived a bullet that ballistics tests proved came
from the gun of Monte's brother, sat down next to Monte in the
cafeteria, hugged him, and told him she would always be his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Another person wounded in the shooting, Lynette Thetford, is
Monte's social studies teacher. ``I really thought at first, `Why
doesn't his mother take him away from here?''' she said. ``Now I
know why she didn't. He fits in well with the kids here and they
accept him. And he seems to be handling it well. He is a strong
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte is learning to play the trumpet and Ms. Woodard is vice
president of the band boosters at Westside. On his last report
card, Monte got all A's. And for a citywide Saturday honors program
for which each school in the Jonesboro area can sponsor one pupil,
Westside picked Monte.
</P>
<P>
   Still, each good thing feels bittersweet. Whenever Ms. Woodard
referred to the day of the shooting, her normally warm and open
face froze into a stunned, pained look and she whispered, ``March
24th of '98.
</P>
<P>
   As she talked, Ms. Woodard struggled to hold back tears. Her
daughter, Jessie seemed used to that. She put down the French fries
she was eating, hopped onto her mother's lap, gave her a huge hug,
took her mother's face in her hands and said, ``Please mama, don't
be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard is careful to point out that even her daughter's
love reminds her that the families of her son's victims cannot hold
their children that way. ``No amount of `I'm sorry's' can make up
for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynette Thetford, the teacher who was shot, said she felt for
Ms. Woodard. ``There is no closure for her, and not many people to
comfort her,'' she said. ``I truly believe I would rather have my
child die than do something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Ms. Woodard and Monte have learned to do, Ms.
Thetford stopped herself short, and then tempered her words: ``Of
course, if I had lost my child, I might feel a different way.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In a tradition that is older than jazz, a parade
was on the march on Sunday afternoon. Members of the Revolution
Social Aid and Pleasure Club swaggered in fluorescent-green suits,
carrying big feather crests emblazoned with peace signs, crowns and
the letter R. Joining them were the Untouchables, strutting in
purple and gold. The beat came from the New Birth Brass Band,
huffed out of a battered sousaphone and tapped on cymbals with wire
loops bent from coat hangers. As in any New Orleans parade there
was also a second line: spectators and stragglers who turned into
dancers as the music grabbed them.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a funeral or a neighborhood party on the march. It
was just the 4 p.m. parade, one of 14 processions that wound their
way through the New Orleans Fair Grounds during the first weekend
of the 30th annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, which
continues through May 2. Jazzfest, as it is widely known, now
attracts half a million people every year, making it a New Orleans
institution second only to Mardi Gras. After three decades Jazzfest
has become inseparable from the culture it presents.
</P>
<P>
   Jazzfest's producer and director, Quint Davis, has a distinct
artistic paradigm; he calls the festival ``the world's largest
backyard barbecue.'' While musicians perform on a dozen stages,
hand-picked food vendors offer muffulettas and oyster po' boys,
crawfish etouffe and alligator sausage, gumbo and jambalaya and
pralines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have a food festival that was equal to the music
festival, it wouldn't be an authentic New Orleans experience,''
Davis said. ``When you're having the best music and having
something down in your soul, you're supposed to have something in
your gut that matches.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a festival built on time-tested music with Louisiana roots:
jazz from traditional improvisation to modern modalities, zydeco
and Cajun songs, gospel, blues, rhythm-and-blues and rock. And in
Louisiana, home to the most joyously provincial musical culture in
the United States, holding on to those styles is not the kind of
archival preservation that seals off the past from the present. It
is a matter of continuity because the old styles are still heard in
clubs and on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   When Fats Domino, Sunday's headliner, sang ``Blueberry Hill,''
the audience started waving handkerchiefs and napkins like Mardi
Gras marchers. In New Orleans brass bands play for jazz funerals,
people two-step to zydeco accordion tunes, and young musicians play
jazz styles from 80 years ago because they love them and because
that's where the jobs are.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians who performed over the weekend said that unlike Mardi
Gras, which puts revelry before culture, Jazzfest brings music
lovers to town. To provide an immersion in New Orleans and
Louisiana music the festival mixes a handful of nationally known
performers _ this year's lineup includes Willie Nelson, Ray Charles
and Cassandra Wilson _ with neighborhood parade groups and
musicians who are usually heard in clubs, streets and churches.
</P>
<P>
   One stage at the festival is a gospel tent, where galvanizing
groups like the Crown Seekers or Spencer Taylor and the Highway
QC's make musical converts all day long. Doreen Ketchens, a
34-year-old clarinetist who played traditional jazz with pearly
tone and ebullient, curlicued solos on Friday afternoon, generally
performs outdoors in Jackson Square. ``Unless it rains,'' she said,
``or the police run us off.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year New Orleans has generated bigger hits than it
has in decades, in the form of Top 10 hip-hop albums from Master P
and his stable of gangsta rappers on No Limit Records. Jazzfest
tried last year to book Master P and his fellow rappers but was
turned down, Davis said; No Limit concentrates on studio
productions, not concerts.
</P>
<P>
   While Jazzfest has presented Mystikal, a No Limit rapper, in the
past, the festival isn't dependent on current hits. ``There are a
number of musics in the big commercial mainstream that we don't
have,'' Davis said, citing heavy metal. ``We don't book something
just because it comes from Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most popular-music productions, Jazzfest does not depend
on current hits or revolve around youth. Warren Storm, a drummer
and singer in the swamp-pop alliance Lil' Band o' Gold, drew a roar
of approval when he announced he would sing his hit, ``Prisoner's
Song,'' which grazed the charts back in 1958. But neither is
Jazzfest an oldies festival; the first weekend included younger
performers, like the bluesman Corey Harris and the zydeco band
leader Geno Delafose, for whom down-home traditions are current.
</P>
<P>
   There were also bands whose music was, like a Kurt Vonnegut
hero, unstuck in time. The Dirty Dozen Brass Band went
somersaulting through musical eras when it performed on Friday
afternoon, with tunes that mutated from swinging two-beats to
wrangling modern-jazz dissonances to calypso to funk, taking roots
and connections for granted. La Bottine Souriante, from Montreal,
took a parallel approach to traditional Quebecois music, with
intricately madcap arrangements that called for trombones,
saxophone, jazzy keyboard harmonies and even salsa rhythms behind
its Celtic fiddles and accordions.
</P>
<P>
   Jazzfest started small but ambitious in 1970. The New Orleans
city fathers first approached George Wein, the producer of the
Newport Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk Festival, in the early
'60s. But at the time New Orleans' Jim Crow laws prohibited black
and white musicians from sharing a stage and did not allow
integrated audiences indoors. Wein could not accept such
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   After the federal Civil Rights Act was enacted in 1964, he was
asked again, but it was not until 1970 that Wein finally took on
the job; he is the festival's executive producer. (This year, he
was also a performer, playing limber swing piano on Friday with an
all-star jazz band that included Ken Peplowski on clarinet and Lew
Tabackin on tenor saxophone.)
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration was to pattern the festival not on the Newport
Jazz Festival with its concerts for seated audiences, but on the
multiple informal events of Newport Folk Festival. The first
Woodstock rock festival had taken place in 1969; Wein believed that
the young audience he hoped to attract did not want reserved seats.
And he insisted from the start that the festival needed local food
and local performers like brass bands and Mardi Gras Indians.
</P>

   ``Anybody can hire some artists for concerts,'' Wein recalled
telling the city. ``But if you want to do the fair, that's where
the future is.''
</P>
<P>
   The first New Orleans Jazz Festival and Louisiana Heritage Fair,
its ungainly original title, had more employees than audience. But
Wein persevered, and by the mid-'70s the festival was breaking
even. Its earnings, about $1 million in 1998, are administered by
the nonprofit New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made them realize what their own culture was and how much it
meant to the rest of the world,'' Wein said. ``It wasn't that we
revived anything or saved anything. We just made more people aware
of it.''

   Jazzfest has been a model for other festivals, notably the
Festival International de Louisiane, a free festival that took over
downtown Lafayette, La., a center of Acadian (or Cajun) Louisiana,
last week. The Festival International is dedicated to
French-speaking Creole culture, and 80 percent of its performers
speak French or Creole. It shared some of them _ including La
Bottine Souriante; the Acadian band Beausoleil; the accordionist
Regis Gizavo, from Madagascar, and the singer and songwriter
Angelique Kidjo, from Benin _ with Jazzfest, since both were
celebrating the 300th anniversary of the French presence in
Louisiana. At the festival in Lafayette audiences had room to
dance; on Saturday some were two-stepping not only to the steaming
zydeco of Chris Ardoin's Double Clutchin' but to the African rock
of Amadou and Mariam, from Mali.
</P>
<P>
   Bookings at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival can take
performers from local clubs to the international circuit.
``Promoters come from Europe and go to our festival and hire groups
as they come off the stage,'' Wein said. Eddie Bo, an exuberant
rhythm-and-blues belter and florid barrelhouse pianist who had a
modest hit in 1962 with ``Check Mr. Popeye,'' has a regular gig
playing happy hours at Tipitina's in New Orleans, but he also tours
Europe with his band.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz and Heritage Foundation supports a public radio
station, WWOZ, that plays jazz and other New Orleans music full
time, putting the local culture on the air. The station broadcasts
on the Internet (www.wwoz.org), and it has members from as far away
as China, allowing the Party line to meet the second line. The
foundation also supports the Heritage School of Music where
children learn to play New Orleans jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has decisively changed the annual calendar for New
Orleans' Mardi Gras Indians, the carnival marching societies that
create towering costumes of feathers and beads each year and who
used to dispose of them on Ash Wednesday, the day after Mardi Gras.
Now tribes like the Wild Magnolias and the White Eagles keep their
costumes to parade at Jazzfest. In between they have also started
their own ``super Sundays,'' gatherings of the tribes in March and
April. The tribes, like the brass bands, are hardly an endangered
tradition; Davis said he kept finding out about new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here heritage is not just something you see in the rearview
mirror,'' Davis said. ``It's also shining brightly through the
windshield.''

`SPYING ON SADDAM': FROM ALPHA DOG TO WOUND-LICKING 
</HEADLINE>

 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PBS is a tad tardy in getting around to ``Spying on Saddam,''
considering that Scott Ritter, the disaffected former U.N.
inspector, has been telling his story in print, on television and
to Congress for many a month. Tuesday night's account, produced by
the BBC in cooperation with ``Frontline,'' nonetheless puts the
quarrels involving the United Nations, the State Department, the
Central Intelligence Agency, Israel and other players into
perspective, albeit a sometimes fuzzy one, and it may help viewers
get a sense of what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after the problematic U.N. victory over Saddam Hussein,
a U.N. special commission to dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction set to work. As the U.N. inspectors ran into ever
increasing obstruction from Iraq, the commission, known as UNSCOM,
turned to U-2 surveillance planes, which involved bringing in the
CIA even though this was not supposed to be an American operation.
</P>
<P>
   David Kay, former chief inspector of the commission, calls the
CIA connection ``a bargain with the devil,'' but adds that without
the satellite photographs, the inspectors could not have tracked
down Iraq's ``shell game of moving material around.'' With the help
of the U-2s, the inspectors collected considerable evidence of
secret Iraqi efforts to make an atomic bomb and conceal stocks of
biological weapons, and many weapons or potential weapons were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter, a former Marine intelligence officer who turned to
Israel for assistance in analyzing the photographs, led an
increasingly aggressive series of inspections, pumping up his team
with the news that there would be only one ``alpha dog'' and that
was him: ``When the Iraqi comes up with their tail up, my tail goes
higher, when they growl, I growl louder, when they bark, I jump on
them and I kick them to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   His growls were also turned on the CIA. As he sees it, ``a turf
war'' began that compromised the commission's mission. Moreover, he
says that after repeated confrontations with Iraq he felt let down
by his superiors. When Richard Butler, the commission chairman and
the chief U.N. arms inspector, put pressure on him to ``keep his
head down a bit,'' Ritter resigned with complaints about a lack of
will on the part of the Security Council, several of whose members
were taking what he considered a soft line toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ritter, who admits to going public to protect his own
reputation, is a reliable critic or just an ``alpha dog'' remains
in contention, but the result of all the infighting has been what
one official calls ``the effective end of UNSCOM.'' There Tuesday
night's account ends, but no one doubts that Iraq's efforts to
build and stockpile weapons goes on, uninspected.

dropped to his knees and begged Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., not to
support it.
</P>
<P>
   The episode soon became part of the folklore surrounding the
Harley-riding, chain-smoking, Elvis-impersonating, practical-joke
loving aviation chief.
</P>
<P>
   But in buttoned-down Washington, the free-wheeling ways of the
Dallas-based low-cost carrier have not always sat well with the
rest of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was with some satisfaction that Washington insiders
watched last year as Southwest bowed to convention and opened a
lobbying office. Just recently, the ``outsider'' company took
another bow to convention and started a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has gone corporate. Or has it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up a Washington office because we grew from three
cities to 53 cities and from one state to 28 states,'' said Ron
Ricks, Southwest's vice president of governmental affairs. ``With
our growth, we had more issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And that has meant paying more attention to politicians. A
three-person Washington office has been up and running _ with Ricks
calling the shots from Dallas _ as has an Austin office, also set
up last year, to handle state and legislative issues.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the corporate circle was complete with creation of a
PAC.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kelleher and other officers of the company had made
contributions on their own, this is the first time the company has
created a political action committee. By contrast, Fort Worth-based
American Airlines has had a PAC since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``A PAC is supposed to protect the interests of shareholders,''
Ricks said. ``Our growth finally got to the point it was
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Airlines' Freedom Fund reported $84,234 in
available cash early this year, according to the Federal Election
Commission, a healthy start for a new PAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're no longer a small, little, insignificant airline,''
said Ed Faberman, executive director of the Air Carrier
Association, which represents small airlines, but not Southwest.
``Candidly, I could never understand how they could not have an
office in Washington.'' The reason was largely Kelleher himself,
whose larger-than-life presence made him a popular and successful
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's low fares average $78 each way, and the carrier's
irreverent ways _ pilots have been known to invite passengers to
clean the restrooms _ make it a lightning rod for attention.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing like a threat to those low fares to get
Southwest's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher's fight against an aviation tax in 1997 certainly
forced his attention to Washington where he maintained that a tax
proposal gaining momentum was structured against his carrier
because it was based on flight segments. Southwest flies segments
and does not operate hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the industry ended up with a tax that included levies
on tickets and segments, Southwest redirected its energy to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Southwest is focused on stopping a proposal in a
House aviation bill that would double the so-called passenger
facility charge from $3 to $6.
</P>
<P>
   But will Southwest's lobbyists begin wearing wingtips?
</P>
<P>
   No, laughed Ricks, and they still plan to carry bags of peanuts
around with them.
</P>

LOVE GODDESS TO HER FANS, NEEDING LOVE IN HER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``For years women have told me, `My husband fell in love with
you in `Summer of '42,''' said Jennifer O'Neill, who played the
22-year-old ``older'' woman who seduces the 15-year-old boy in the
classic 1971 film. ``Now they say, `My husband is in love with you
and so is my son.'''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled good-naturedly. Jennifer O'Neill is 51 now and
possibly the most stunning grandmother in America. (Yes,
grandmother _ three times over.) You can see why she was the
spokeswoman for Cover Girl cosmetics for 30 years. That job, she
says, and her role in ``Summer of '42'' have been professional
highlights in a life filled with so much turmoil and unhappiness,
so much of it caused by Ms. O'Neill herself, that she has just
published her aptly titled autobiography, ``Surviving Myself''
(William Morrow).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what she's survived: eight husbands and nine marriages
(she married one twice), nine miscarriages, a suicide attempt at
14, shock therapy after her daughter, Aimee, was born and a broken
back after a riding accident. (``I did precisely what Christopher
Reeve did,'' she said. ``God had his hand on my shoulder.'') Her
fifth husband sexually abused Aimee, and Ms. O'Neill accidentally
shot herself in the stomach with a gun he kept in their home.
(``The bullet missed my spine by a fraction of an inch,'' she
said.)
</P>
<P>
   There's more, including loads of ill-considered career moves,
but those are the highlights _ as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first thought about writing the book, I went back and
forth between `Who would be interested?' and `It's nobody's
business,''' Ms. O'Neill said recently, sitting at a corner table
at Aureole. ``All my life I was a person on a treadmill of drama
and trauma, trying to fill up a hole inside. My daughter encouraged
me to explore the tough issues in the book, starting with the issue
of sexual abuse, with the idea that the truth will set you free.
But as I reviewed my life, I was horrified. I realized so many
issues had not been healed. So I've been revisiting them and trying
to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. O'Neill spoke, she ate a three-course lunch and sipped a
glass of cabernet sauvignon. Tall and still model-thin, she was
dressed in a black pantsuit with a flowered blouse and a purse to
match. She seemed like a placid out-of-towner, murmuring ``How
unusual'' about the lemon custard and peering at the menu through
oversize glasses. The only hints at a darker side came with
questions she did not want to answer, like one about a
stepdaughter. Her easy manner changed instantly. Her face darkened,
her mouth tightened and the song ``I'll Be Hard to Handle'' came to
mind _ and stayed.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the glimpse of inner turmoil, Ms. O'Neill seems to
remain philosophical about getting older. The triple rows of pearls
at her neck didn't entirely hide the lines there. Neither did she
try to camouflage her crow's feet. ``I don't think anything is
wrong with plastic surgery,'' she said, ``but I haven't had it.
It's such a cliche to say that the inside is what counts. But when
I feel peaceful and happy, that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly on the surface of Ms. O'Neill's upbringing, everything
seemed as it should. She was raised in New Rochelle, N.Y., and
Wilton, Conn., by her mother, Irene, and her father, Oscar O'Neill
Jr., who owned a medical supply company. They moved to New York
City, and their daughter enrolled at Dalton. By 15, she had been
signed by the Ford Modeling Agency, appeared on the cover of Vogue
and was earning $80,000 a year _ in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside seemed marvelous, exciting and perfect, and it was
none of the above,'' Ms. O'Neill said. ``My parents and I are great
friends now, but my initial need for them to love me was very
painful. Parents need to love their children unconditionally.
That's where self-respect is born.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had tried psychotherapy unsuccessfully: ``Therapy
would always interest me, but I couldn't connect my mind to my
heart. It left me mentally stimulated and emotionally
disconnected.''
</P>
<P>
   What reconnected her, she says, was becoming a born-again
Christian in 1988. She is careful, however, not to proselytize. ``I
don't want to preach to anybody; I only want to say what happened
to me,'' she said. ``I was approached by a Christian publisher, but
I didn't want this book to sit only on a Christian shelf. I hope I
wrote it with my arms wide open to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   She is in her ninth marriage, to Mervin Louque, a music producer
in Nashville. ``I know I'll be with him forever,'' she said, then
smiled as she heard herself speak. ``You know, it's amazing,'' she
went on. ``With every single one I was sure it was IT. I can't
understand how I'm sitting here and not the biggest cynic. With
each marriage it was almost like doing a new character and going on
location, setting up house with a new extended family, new
stepchildren. Looking back, I don't know how I did it. I was so
determined. I just wanted to be happy, to be loved. And that is not
an attractive package, someone who wants to be loved so much.''
</P>
<P>
   What does she think she did wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose people who put me down,'' she answered immediately.
``It was what I was accustomed to. Nothing I did was good enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What also affected her, she said, was her parents' lack of
interest in her education. Though they sent her brother to boarding
school, they never made her schooling a priority because they
assumed she would marry and have children. Ms. O'Neill eventually
transferred from Dalton to the Professional Children's School
because of her work. She did not graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she became an actress. She has 30 feature films to her
credit, though none besides ``Summer of '42'' was a commercial hit.
She admits to choosing badly, starting with ``Such Good Friends,''
an Otto Preminger flop that she chose after ``Summer of '42,'' and
going on to include titles like ``The Prince and the Surfer'' and
``Love Is Like That.'' In recent years her most successful projects
have been films for USA, the cable network.
</P>
<P>
   She has developed a line of skin care products that she just
started selling on the Shop at Home network, and she has taken on
public speaking engagements (she addressed the National Prayer
Breakfast last year in Washington). But Ms. O'Neill has no
intention of abandoning her acting career. She wrote a story for a
sequel to ``Summer of '42'' and hopes that Timothy Hutton will sign
on once a screenwriter is hired. She is also to play herself from
the age of 38 in the television movie version of ``Surviving
Myself,'' and she sings on an album of inspirational music that is
to be released this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is inspirational enough just to hear her views on aging. ``As
I get older,'' she said, ``I hope that mentally I can gracefully
replace what's not in the mirror with things everlasting. If you
over-focus on this dropping or that dropping, you will not be a
happy person. Life after 50 is surely for me the best part of my
life.'' Her relationship with her daughter Aimee, now 31, is the
best it has been, she says. Her son Reis is 18 and a would-be
actor. Her son Cooper is 12, and Ms. O'Neill calls him ``the light
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be difficult though, to look back on so many of the bad
choices, the ways she damaged her career and herself, and wonder
what she might have done differently.
</P>
<P>
   She shook her head seriously. ``I'm resilient,'' she said. ``I'm
really happy now. To me the success of my life is the reflection of
my presence, be it mother, wife or friend. All my life I've been
unstoppable, but now I feel unswayable. That feels like success to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As for acting,'' she went on, ``I cared very much about being
a good actress, and I learned over the years. But it wasn't my main
motivating force in life; that was my drive for relationships. The
concept of letting a great offer go for the sake of a marriage is
unheard of in Hollywood. I did not make popular decisions. I never
moved to Hollywood. I wouldn't take my clothes off to act.
Hollywood never owned me. My need for love owned me.''

<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ The status of the Russian negotiating
effort, and what Belgrade has agreed to. Parts exclusive. By
Michael Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING (Littleton, Colo.) _ An 18-year-old woman,
described as Dylan Klebold's girlfriend, is questioned about
whether she had purchased two of the four firearms used by Klebold
and Eric Harris in last Tuesday's massacre, a 9 mm carbine rifle
and a TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol. For now, the woman has not been
named as a suspect and no arrests are said to be imminent. The two
teenagers who had planned to kill 500 students, destroy the school
and commandeer a plane to crash it into New York City,
investigators said. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-JONESBORO (Jonesboro, Ark.) _ When Gretchen Woodard
heard about the school shootings in Colorado, her reactions echoed
those of everyone else. She thought, ``Where were these boys'
parents?'' But she had to stop short of taking comfort in the next
thought on most people's mind, ``My child would never do anything
like that.'' Ms. Woodard's child, Mitchell Johnson, and a friend
murdered four classmates and a teacher last year. By Emily Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHILDREN (Brazda, Macedonia) _ The chaotic nature of the
exodus from Kosovo, the unusually high number of children, and the
complicated international aid and evacuation programs here have
helped make efforts to reunite families particularly daunting.
Adding to the potential problem, half of Kosovo's 1.8 million
ethnic Albanians were teen-agers and young children. By David
Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OBESITY-DRUG (Washington) _ The FDA approves an anti-obesity
drug, the first of a new class, which works by blocking the
absorption of up to 30 percent of fat in the diet. But it comes
with some unpleasant side effects and the committee that advised
the agency on it was divided on approving it. The drug is made by
Roche. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-TOBACCO (Washington) _ The Supreme Court offered itself
as the next battleground in the tobacco wars, announcing today that
it would decide whether the Food and Drug Administration has
authority to regulate tobacco products as drugs and cigarettes as
``drug delivery devices.'' By Linda Greenhouse.

`VERA (MRS. VLADIMIR NABOKOV)': A FORMIDABLE ASSISTANT

  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.)

 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Gift,'' Vladimir Nabokov's most clearly
autobiographical novel, the writer-hero Fyodor meets a woman named
Zina who will change his life, a woman who possessed ``perfect
understanding,'' absolute pitch ``for everything that he himself
loved'': ``not only was Zina cleverly and elegantly made to measure
for him by a very painstaking fate, but both of them, forming a
single shadow, were made to the measure of something not quite
comprehensible, but wonderful and benevolent and continuously
surrounding them.''

   Zina is, of course, a fictionalized portrait of Nabokov's own
wife, Vera, the woman he would call his ``first and best reader,''
the woman whom friends would hail as ``the St. Sebastian of
wives,'' the ``international champion in the Wife-of-Writer
Competition.''
</P>
<P>
   As this evocative new biography by Stacy Schiff makes clear,
Vera would serve, throughout the course of their six-decade-long
marriage, as her husband's editor, typist, agent, secretary,
chauffeur, nursemaid, go-between, buffer, researcher and
butterfly-catching companion. For the master sorcerer of words, she
was the consummate magician's assistant _ helping out here, there
and everywhere, without once acknowledging her part in the sleight
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   She typed and retyped all the drafts of her husband's novels,
oversaw dozens of translations and negotiated tirelessly with
editors and publishers on two continents. During Nabokov's years as
a college professor in the United States, she sat in on all his
classes, mopping up his bons mots for posterity, while prepping
herself to substitute for him when he wanted to take a day off. She
drove her willfully hapless husband _ who once bragged of never
having learned to type, drive, fold an umbrella or answer the phone
_ thousands of miles across the country during the summers so he
could hunt for butterflies in the West. And in the post-``Lolita''
days of fame and fortune, she would almost singlehandedly manage
his voluminous correspondence with students, reporters, family,
friends and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly the marriage evolved into a tale of two
marriages, a port for him, a career for her,'' Ms. Schiff writes.
``Her capability was matched only by his capacity for ignoring
everything that did not concern his own work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Vera (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)'' is almost unavoidably
indebted to Brian Boyd's masterful two-volume biography of Nabokov
(``Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years'' and ``Vladimir Nabokov:
The American Years''), Ms. Schiff has succeeded in creating an
elegantly nuanced portrait of the artist's wife, showing us just
how pivotal Nabokov's marriage was to his hermetic existence and
how it indelibly shaped his work. She effortlessly conjures up the
disparate worlds the couple inhabited: from the privileged world of
pre-revolutionary Russia (a world in which it was possible to
speak, as Nabokov later did, of ``the smallest and oldest of our
gardeners'') to the emigre community of Berlin, where the two met
and fell in love; from the rarefied world of American academia,
where Nabokov took a succession of teaching posts, to the even more
rarefied world of the Swiss Alps, where the couple would spend the
latter part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The one large flaw of this book is its reluctance to grapple
with Nabokov's literary achievement, depriving the lay reader of
even a cursory appreciation of his books and the Nabokov fan of a
serious appraisal of his work. In fact the only time Ms. Schiff
discusses specific novels in detail is when she wants to point out
autobiographical motifs or demonstrate the palpable consequences
that a book (most notably ``Lolita'') had on the couple's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiff points out the close resemblance between Vera and the
heroines of ``The Gift'' and ``The Real Life of Sebastian Knight''
(1941), the two novels written in the aftermath of Nabokov's one
serious affair with another woman. She also notes the parallels
between the Nabokovs' intense marital bond and the fierce,
incestuous love delineated in ``Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle''
(1969).
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Ms. Schiff argues, Vera was more muse than model,
presiding as adviser and judge over her husband's writing, and
funneling her memories and observations into his prose. ``The words
were entirely his,'' Ms. Schiff writes, ``but she was their first
reader, smoothing the prose when it was `still warm and wet.' When
scholars questioned the arrangement she shrugged off any active
involvement, even when the handwriting is on the page. She could
only have been transcribing her husband's comments, she insisted.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Vera's denials _ concerning her husband's work,
her involvement in its creation and their lives together _
accelerated. She denied that her husband had worried about the
effect ``Lolita'' might have on his academic career, and she denied
that he had attempted to publish the novel under a pseudonym. She
denied having said words his biographers quoted her as saying, and,
Ms. Schiff writes, she even ``went so far as to deny to a reporter
that she was proud'' of her son, Dmitri. The motive behind these
denials seems to have been to protect her and her husband's privacy
and to burnish the myth of his genius, to insure that Nabokov
``existed not in time, only in art.''
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior, combined with Vera's tenacious negotiation of her
husband's publishing contracts and her imperious manner with
strangers, had the effect, Ms. Schiff points out, of making this
``shy, overworked, morbidly private, highly principled woman''
appear ``prickly, humorless, aloof and intransigent.'' It also made
her a formidable challenge for a biographer _ a challenge that Ms.
Schiff, with this book, has most persuasively met.

   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Wars often turn on who controls
the high ground, and in Northern Ireland the battle between the
province's two major religious groups has centered in recent
troubled years on a rise on the outskirts of Portadown known as
Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   This dull and drizzly Sunday morning, the Drumcree Church of the
Ascension was filled to overflowing. Parishioners lustily sang
forth their mission anthems, listened raptly to a sermon about the
perils of dying without first dedicating their lives to Jesus
Christ and then gathered outside for a ceremony that has become as
much a coda to their earnest Protestant worship as the benediction
that ends the service.
</P>
<P>
   The women, dressed in early spring shades of lilac and lavender,
moved off to the sides of the rural lane that winds by the
unadorned, stone 18th century nave with its tapered steeple and
gently sloping cemetery ground. The men, in dark suits, put on
black bowler hats, white gloves, and orange bib-like collars and
lined up behind Harold Gracey, Worshipful District Master of
Portadown Loyal Orange Lodge No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Then they marched, stepping off smartly on a short journey of
100 yards down to where gray armored vans filled with Royal Ulster
Constabulary officers in bulletproof vests and visored helmets
waited, blocking their passage through the Roman Catholic housing
project beyond. A pennant with a golden scroll reading, ``Drumcree:
Here We Stand. We Can Do No Other,'' was snapping in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   A statement of protest, a prayer, the singing of ``God Save the
Queen,'' and the weekly confrontation was over. Sheep in the
hillside pasture remained curled in sleep. The point, said Gracey,
had been made: ``We want the world to know we have not gone away.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Gracey himself has not left Drumcree since the
Orange Order effort to march through the all-Catholic Garvaghy Road
residential area ended last July in violence and humiliation for
the Orangemen, known to one another as The Brethren.
</P>
<P>
   They were urged by other Protestants to abandon their protest
then. Weapons, bombs and catapults had turned up in their ranks
during the nightly barricade encounters with police, and three
young Catholic boys had been burned to death in their beds by
Protestant paramilitary fire bombers in the town of Ballymoney.
</P>
<P>
   But Gracey, David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orangemen,
and others of the group refused to leave and have kept the vigil
since then. They were dismissed for months as a desultory group of
obstinate nay-sayers, but they are now being joined each Sunday by
increasing numbers of backers and bolstered by ``support Drumcree''
rallies across the province and in militant Protestant communities
in England and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Their influence and the possibility that the Drumcree standoff
will once again convulse the province in rioting grows with each
day that negotiators in Belfast, Dublin and London fail to resolve
a guerrilla disarmament impasse. The issue is blocking the
formation of the new government for Northern Ireland envisioned in
the peace settlement signed last April.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sympathy in the order for the peace settlement
and much anger at David Trimble, the designated first minister of
the new Northern Ireland Assembly and a Nobel Peace Prize winner,
who represents this area in the British Parliament. Four years ago,
Trimble led the march down the Garvaghy Road and danced a jig of
victory with the Rev. Ian Paisley _ a fierce opponent of the peace
settlement _ when the parade succeeded in penetrating police lines.
</P>
<P>
   Portadown is known as the Orange Citadel because the order was
founded near here in 1795. Local Catholics steer clear of the
downtown area, and main street merchants complain that the town's
reputation for sectarian exclusivity and conflict is discouraging
business growth. A rally for the Protestant cause in October became
a fiery riot, and an officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Portadown Orangemen believe Trimble sold out the Protestant
cause by agreeing to the peace plan, which seeks to balance the
minority Catholics' desire for a closer relationship with Ireland
with the Protestant desire to remain part of Britain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For centuries the Protestants made up nearly 70 percent of
Northern Ireland's population and held all authority. But now, with
their numbers reduced to under 53 percent, they are anxious about
their declining power and angry and defensive about Catholic
advances.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order regularly tells Trimble these days that he is
not welcome in Portadown. Paisley by contrast, was the featured
guest in a full regalia Orange Order fife and drum march that
paraded through the center of Portadown last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on all sides of the dispute warn darkly of the dangers
of entering another ``Marching Season'' with the province's
politics so uncertain. The simple word ``Drumcree'' now connotes
for most people the moment each year when Northern Ireland is at
its most volatile.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500 Protestant parades in Northern Ireland mark epochal
moments like the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, when William of
Orange, the Protestant King of England, overcame his Catholic
rival, James II.
</P>
<P>
   The argument in Portadown is over 10 blocks' worth of pavement
that takes 15 minutes to walk, but its real dimensions emerge in
the words of the debate _ words like history, culture, heritage,
faith, human rights, civil liberties and even ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen refuse to meet with the residents of Garvaghy
Road, who contend that the parade for them is a ``triumphalist''
celebration of Protestant domination and has no business coming
through their community. In response to the snub, the residents
have hung their neighborhood with signs saying, ``No Talking, No
Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Working to forestall another Drumcree explosion, Prime Minister
Tony Blair has met with leaders from both sides of the Portadown
dispute at 10 Downing Street, and has assigned one of his closest
aides, Jonathan Powell, to conduct talks. But there has been no
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the church service, the block numbers outside the parish
house where Gracey has been billeted were rehung on their hooks to
record his 296th consecutive day on the hill. Thousands of
Orangemen are expected here Thursday night at a rally to mark 300
days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones spoke bitterly about past police and government decisions
to bar the Brethren from making their march each July, a tradition
stretching back to 1807. He looked out across the pastoral meadow
that each summer becomes thronged with Orangemen facing down
police. ``If they attempt to throw us off this hill,'' he said,
``then they will suffer the consequences.''

 &HT;    New vaccine shows promise against virus like AIDS
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Emory University researcher has created a vaccine
that appears to substantially protect monkeys against a virus
similar to the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year study by Dr. Harriet Robinson that involved 32
rhesus macaque monkeys indicates the vaccine prevents most monkeys
from becoming sick after being repeatedly exposed to a ``challenge
virus,'' a blend of HIV and SIV called SHIV. HIV does not reproduce
or cause illness in monkeys, but SIV does.
</P>
<P>
   The study is promising news for HIV vaccine research, which has
lagged behind efforts to discover and develop new AIDS drugs. A
working AIDS vaccine is still years away, vaccine experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet, but it's an important step,'' said
Robinson, chief of microbiology and immunology at Yerkes Regional
Primate Research Center at Emory University. Robinson performed the
study, to be published in May's issue of Nature Medicine, while at
the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson tested several versions of the vaccine, the most
successful of which uses a series of shots. First, an inoculation
consisting of SHIV genes ``primes'' the animal's immune system,
helping it mount an initial defense against the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent ``booster'' immunizations that use the same genes
inserted into a pox virus, administered at 46 and 66 weeks, help
maintain the immune response.
</P>
<P>
   This version of the vaccine was given to four out of the 32
macaques in the study; the other monkeys received different
versions of the vaccine, which were not as effective.
</P>
<P>
   Those four monkeys were later exposed to SHIV three times: twice
with a strain identical to the type used to make the vaccine, and a
third time with a different, much more virulent strain. Several
different strains of HIV exist, so a vaccine that is effective
against more than one strain would be most useful.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four macaques showed no detectable virus after the
first two exposures. The fourth monkey had extremely low levels of
the virus.
</P>
<P>
   After the third exposure, two of the remaining three monkeys
stayed healthy; the third became sick.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the study, all 32 monkeys were euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS vaccine advocates expressed enthusiasm for Robinson's
findings, but stressed the need to quickly develop a product
applicable to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly an advance,'' said Wayne Koff, vice
president for science of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
``The AIDS vaccine field should look at this candidate in a serious
way, in trying to move it into clinical trials as fast as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Avrett of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition agreed,
saying, ``The evidence is very tantalizing, and it's a very good
example of why we need faster research and more applied product
development in clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson plans further vaccine testing in macaques at Yerkes.
Human trials are at least a year away, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one potential AIDS vaccine has progressed to large-scale
human testing. The AIDSVAX vaccine, developed by VaxGen, a company
based near San Francisco, is being tested in 5,000 people in North
America and another 2,500 in Thailand.

 &HT;    BellSouth in strong position, officials say
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A week after announcing a $3.5 billion deal with Qwest
Communications, BellSouth officials assured shareholders Monday
that the company is well-positioned to take on rivals.
</P>
<P>
   F. Duane Ackerman, chairman and chief executive of the $23
billion-a-year BellSouth, reminded those attending the 15th annual
shareholders meeting that the Atlanta-based company produced an 80
percent return to shareholders last year. Company stock last year
jumped from about $28 to nearly $50 a share. BellSouth closed
Monday at $43.56 1/4 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, the numbers show the firm is preparing
for the future by being ``transformed from a traditional utility to
a top-flight, consistent-growth company,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   That change has taken BellSouth from having one of the least
efficient payrolls among similar firms to one having the most
revenue per employee _ $261. For years, reaching that meant
dramatic cuts in the work force, mostly in the phone unit, although
BellSouth in 1998 began expanding again.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lost jobs had been positions represented by the
Communications Workers of America. CWA official Noah Savant
reminded shareholders and directors Monday of workers'
contributions to BellSouth success, asking that company prosperity
be used in part to further reward retirees.
</P>
<P>
   During 1998, BellSouth earnings per share rose 16.3 percent,
capping five years in which BellSouth enjoyed a 12 percent compound
annual rate of growth. The company has predicted earnings growth of
19 percent to 21 percent during this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because brand awareness is critical, the company has in recent
years doubled its budget for advertising, tagging a number of
sports teams with BellSouth sponsorship, Ackerman said. ``We're
investing in advertising wherever we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth expects data to become central to all operations. Last
year, BellSouth revenue from data services jumped 42 percent to
$1.9 billion, and BellSouth expects data revenue to surge to about
$5 billion within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Buying 10 percent of Qwest, which is both a long-distance and a
high-speed data carrier, is key, Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of BellSouth's revenue comes from the nine
Southeast states where it offers local service, the company
continued to extend that core phone business. Of 3.6 million
customers, about 75 percent come from businesses in which BellSouth
has competition. For example, the company's U.S. wireless business
has grown to 4.8 million and its Internet business is expected to
hit 1 million subscribers this year. Investments overseas,
especially Latin America, also continued to grow in importance.
</P>
<P>
   In other business, shareholders re-elected a slate of directors
and rejected proposals to trim incentives paid to top executives.
Ackerman last year was paid a $900,000 salary and a $2 million
bonus. BellSouth officials say executive compensation is average
for companies of similar size.

   ATLANTA _ For adults, understanding teenagers can be like a
visit to their high school: It's recognizable from the outside but
a strange new territory on the inside. Some of the familiar
benchmarks are still there _ the cliques and the classes _ but
teens say it's impossible to understand their world unless you're a
part of it _ or at least listen closely. We talked with metro
Atlanta teens about their lives. Their commentary paints a
compelling portrait of teen fears, hopes and insights in the wake
of the Columbine High School massacre.

   Maybe those (Colorado) kids were teased for a long, long time
because they were different. And then over the years, they became
different because they didn't know what else to do, they didn't
know how else to turn.
</P>
<P>
   I was teased for years for being a chubby kid; I would end up
crying every day to my mom. That's probably why, in part, I became
a Christian. I know I have a relationship with someone who will
always accept me, no matter what color my hair is.
</P>
<P>
   Why do I dress this way? Well, because I like the music, I like
punk music, and this is part of it. The two are interwoven, it's
part of the style. Some would say this is my way of getting
attention, but it's not. It's a way of fitting in with the group of
friends I have. When we are together, we look the same. For me to
dress preppy would look odd.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, people stare at me when I'm in a mall, at Rich's or the
grocery store, but when I'm with my friends, I fit right in. People
don't understand that. They start saying that you must be this way
or that way if you dress like this. They think you're a bad person,
you're a troublemaker, you do drugs. And that's not necessarily
true.
</P>
<P>
   At my school, there's been kids who have worn trench coats for
years, and in the past week they've been searched _ with the only
reason being that some kids in another state killed people and
happened to be wearing the same things. Now, that's not right.
</P>
<P>
   I'm lucky because I've always been very close to my mom, who
went through some of the same things in high school. And I became a
born-again Christian when I was 9, so I don't feel alone.
</P>
<P>
   What leads to things like the shooting is people don't realize
how much kids are hurting. They don't see how much they need help.
They may look different, but everyone needs to be accepted by
someone.

   My dad got me into the whole athletic thing.
</P>
<P>
   I was living with him and he was a single parent for a while and
I think this is one way we bonded. He was my first coach. We
started out with basketball, and then I branched out from there. My
main sport is basketball, but I also do cross country, track and
golf. He told me to remember three things about sports: Have fun,
work as a team and learn about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's definitely the athletic crowd. But we're just one
of a bunch of groups in school. There's the Christian group, the
smart kid group, the group who are the skaters _ that includes
white people who try to act black. There's the outcast group _
where even the guys wear black eyeliner _ and the extreme outcast
group. There's about 10 to 15 people in that category and they
don't interact with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   I think the biggest change in high school is women in sports.
You can't have a pure ``jock'' group because too many girls are
playing on teams. And I think there's a difference in attitude. And
for me, I've always seen sports as my ticket to college. So I don't
see it merely as a way to spend my social time. Sports also helps
me stay focused and develop more discipline. I don't have the
chance to take other roads like kids with more time, I don't have
the time to be introduced to other things like drinking or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, jock types sometimes do pick on smaller kids, but usually
not at this level. When I was younger, I saw a lot more of it. But
I think by high school, most of us are more mature and we've moved
on. I don't see kids at my school worried about it.

   I spent a year as a foreign exchange student in Japan. And life
in Japan, especially high school life, is so much more innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest problem they had was kids not wearing their
uniforms right. It was like a different planet. Parents let their
children play outside and didn't worry about them at all. They just
weren't very street-smart _ and they didn't need to be.
</P>
<P>
   Here (in America), we have a public school life that includes
fights, drug searches, security guards. In Japan, it was a very
homogeneous structure. Everyone belonged and adhered to the same
social structure, and here that's just not the case.
</P>
<P>
   We have diversity, which I think is a good thing, but it makes
getting along more complicated. I've never really paid attention to
how little I noticed diversity until this interview.
</P>
<P>
   I was born in Washington, D.C., lived in Geneva, Switzerland,
when I was 2 and moved to Atlanta when I was 8. I've always
interacted with different kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
   I think people tease (other people) because they're not
comfortable with differences _ and because they're still searching
for their own identity. I see the worst teasing in junior high
school, where kids are suddenly exposed to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   You're thrown out there and everything is so big and you feel so
small. The bullies don't want to feel small, so they attack others.
But by high school, I think that eases, because people gain a
better sense of themselves.

   To make it through high school, you have to remember why you're
there. You're not there for a social life, you're there for an
education.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of pressure. Right now, I'm taking
advanced-placement statistics, advanced-placement French,
international baccalaureate English and international baccalaureate
history. And I've often been the only black kid in the class,
although it's not that hard because most of the kids _ the girls _
I've known since elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   I think another key to coping with high school is you also need
to find a group of people who are like you and find a mentor. But a
lot of kids still fall through the cracks. There are so many who
started with me but won't finish with me. It hurts me, and I worry
about them. But they did have the exact same opportunity as I did,
and for some reason they have thrown it away.
</P>
<P>
   I still see so many students with nothing in their hands. No
bags, no books, no papers. Just a pencil stuck behind their ear. I
keep thinking, if you're going to come to school like that, why
come?
</P>
<P>
   But I'm lucky because of my mom and my Nigerian background.
She's been a single parent since I was in the eighth grade, and we
are very close. I'm very independent, but I still keep her posted.
And although I was born here, my mother raised me with a Nigerian
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The discipline is much higher, things are a lot stricter. But I
think it's helped me succeed.

   Numerous television reports have produced psychologists and
others who claim factors such as violent video games and
influential films caused the gunmen to act as they did. The two
films that have been commented on the most are ``The Basketball
Diaries'' and ``The Matrix.'' They seem to closely resemble what
happened in Colorado. Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Basketball Diaries,'' the main character is shown
shooting students with a shotgun in a dream sequence. ``The
Matrix'' contains similar violence, but the movie is based on a
very fictional, alternate reality.
</P>
<P>
   Most teens I know regard these movies with the attitude ``that
looks so cool'' or even ``it would be so awesome if we could
actually do that.'' Most people don't tag on the end, ``Let's go
try that.''
</P>
<P>
   People may seem to be influenced by movies nowadays more than
ever. It's probably because many films cater to more diverse and
sometimes controversial groups. There is a movie out there for
everyone now.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has at least one character they can relate to. Will
Hunting in ``Good Will Hunting'' can inspire us to live up to our
highest potential. William Wallace from ``Braveheart'' can inspire
us to have more courage. Even a character like Kenny Fischer from
``Can't Hardly Wait'' can inspire us to be ourselves and maybe
learn something about love.
</P>
<P>
   These movies all have extreme in-your-face styles. ``Good Will
Hunting'' had its excessive, questionable language. ``Braveheart''
had its extremely violent war scenes and ``Can't Hardly Wait'' had
its very raw yet comical look at a teenage graduation party.
</P>
<P>
   They all had material that could possibly inspire inappropriate
behavior. The truth is, no matter how long people search for an
answer, we will never know. The only people that know the motives
were the actual shooters.
</P>
<P>
   And while psychologists and other experts search for a reason,
they give inspirational and entertaining films a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I see a report on what movie the shooters might have
watched or what video games they played, I get so furious that I
feel like reaching into the television and slugging them in the
stomach for their naive and desperate analysis. But perhaps that's
the result of me watching the film ``Rocky.''

   ATLANTA _ For adults, understanding teenagers can be like a
visit to their high school: It's recognizable from the outside but
a strange new territory on the inside. Some of the familiar
benchmarks are still there _ the cliques and the classes _ but
teens say it's impossible to understand their world unless you're a
part of it _ or at least listen closely. We talked with metro
Atlanta teens about their lives. Their commentary paints a
compelling portrait of teen fears, hopes and insights in the wake
of the Columbine High School massacre.

   LOS ANGELES _ Each May, TV gets a lot more interesting. It's no
coincidence: It's a ``sweeps'' period, when ratings will determine
how much money individual networks will be able to charge for ads
in upcoming seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the end of the season for TV shows, so there are
guaranteed to be a number of high-profile stunts and curtain calls
_ this year, most notably from the long-running series ``Mad About
You'' and ``Home Improvement.'' Made-for-TV movie events include _
pay close attention _ ``Joan of Arc,'' ``Noah's Ark'' and ``The
Simple Life of Noah Dearborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliffhanger endings seem more popular than ever this year for
shows that want to make sure fans tune back in next season. On
``Walker, Texas Ranger'' (May 22), Walker and Sheree are trapped in
a plane crash. Tune in next fall for the exciting conclusion! ``The
X-Files'' predictably ends the season with a question mark _ with
Mulder and Scully's alien quest continuing _ and ``Felicity'' has
the title character agonizing over whether to go to Europe with
Noel, or to Silicon Valley with Ben (note to Felicity: Vienna waits
for you). Meanwhile, ``Spin City's'' Mike (Michael J. Fox) has to
choose between true love Nikki and supermodel Heidi Klum. We hate
when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a listing of some special events in store during
sweeps, which officially kicks off on Thursday. You may want to
tape a few things _ summer is often a long, dry spell when it comes
to good TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
April 29
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Kneivel: Grand Canyon Jump Live (Fox, 8 p.m.) The show's
executive producer, Jeff Androsky, says this death-defying
motorcycle jump is something Evel's son has ``wanted to do all his
life.'' What a coincidence, so did we _ it's on our list right
after sticking our arm in a shark tank.
</P>
<P>
   WWF Smackdown! (UPN, 8 p.m.) Robbie Kneivel smackdown, more like
it. This bit of counter-programming is being touted as the return
of professional wrestling to network TV. Oh, come on, guys ... it's
just UPN.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
April 30
</P>
<P>
   A Celebration: One Hundred Years of Great Women, With Barbara
Walters (ABC, 9:30 P.M.) Gee, we knew Barbara was getting up there,
but ... La Barbara chats up and recaps ``the most interesting,
influential and intriguing women of the century.'' All in 90
minutes _ half an hour less than she gave that modern-day Great
Woman, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 2
</P>
<P>
   Noah's Ark (NBC, 9 p.m.; second part airs at 9 p.m. May 3) From
``Midnight Cowboy'' to savior of the species is about as far as an
actor can stretch. Jon Voight co-stars with Mary Steenburgen
(funny, you never hear anything about MRS. Noah, do you?) in this
two-parter based loosely _ VERY loosely _ on the Bible story. F.
Murray Abraham, Carol Kane and James Coburn also come along for the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 4
</P>
<P>
   Down Will Come Baby (CBS, 9 p.m.) Meredith Baxter stars in this
TV movie about a family's struggle to stay together after a fatal
accident. The network touts it as ``an unpredictable suspense
thriller''; that should make it a refreshing change from all those
predictable suspense yarns.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 5
</P>
<P>
   The 34th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards (CBS, 8 p.m.)
Awards season is almost over, we promise. For country music lovers,
this one features performances by Garth Brooks and the Dixie
Chicks; for lovers of the (slightly deflated) female form, Pamela
Anderson co-hosts, with funnyman Damon Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 8
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche: The White Death (NBC, 8 p.m.) If this show were on
Fox, instead of having been produced for NBC by National
Geographic, it probably would be titled ``When Snow Attacks!''
Instead, Peter Coyote narrates a more highbrow special on deadly
avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
May 9
</P>

ON
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0427.

<P>
   DURRES, Albania _ The part of his scalp where the Kosovar
guerrilla fighter who calls himself ``The Wolf'' was hit by a Serb
rifle bullet while fighting in Yugoslavia embattled Kosovo province
just 16 days ago is not fully healed.
</P>
<P>
   But he is about to catch a bus back toward this country's
northern border. From there, The Wolf and his unit of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, or KLA, are likely to walk across the border into
Kosovo to resume his personal war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid at all,'' said The Wolf, who is 29 and asked
that his real name not be used. ``Whatever happens, it is foreseen
by the gods. If you are going to die, you are going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a skinhead in his aviator glasses, The Wolf was
hanging around in his fatigues under a pink tile roof at the Cafe
Drenica. It is the seaside hangout that is the KLA's main transit
station for busing out fresh recruits and the recovering wounded
who are headed for the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly every guerrilla movement of this century, the KLA is
made up of cold-blooded fanatics who don't much mind dying. They
are split among factions espousing extreme anti-communism and
others that believe in a variant of Marxist-Leninism.
</P>
<P>
   What's different about this bunch of guerrillas is that thanks
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's intransigence, the
fighters of the KLA have become America's fanatics in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, this secretive, relentless band of anti-Serb
guerrillas is poised to inherit the fruits of any victory the
U.S.-led NATO forces can wrest from Milosevic. Yet the outside
world knows very little about their ideological leanings, their
sources of funding or their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   There could not be a sharper contrast between the passionate
dedication of men like The Wolf and the laconic professionalism of
the American troops who have flown in to fight in an uncomfortable,
unstated alliance with the KLA guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to do a mission, and then we are all going home,
every one of us,'' says U.S. Army Sgt. Jeffrey Landry, 34, of
Lincoln, Neb. He is the crew chief of a high-tech Avenger
anti-aircraft battery.
</P>
<P>
   Victory doesn't mean the same thing for fighters like The Wolf.
For him, Kosovo is home. He means to live long enough to get
married by this coming September in the liberated Kosovo capital of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   His problem is he doesn't know whether his fiancee has been
killed in a month of Serb ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1999, The Wolf lived in Germany and earned good
money at an automobile factory. He heeded a KLA summons on March 1
for young Kosovar Albanians to join the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded for three days by Serb forces on April 10, the fresh
recruit had gone into battle with only 10 days training. Like a lot
of the KLA frontline troops, he was obeying a worldwide KLA call
for fighting volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   He and his 13 fellow volunteers were sent into Kosovo, just
north of the Albanian district of Tropoje. They were without
helmets or flak jackets.
</P>
<P>
   They were supposed to protect a column of Kosovar refugees on
tractors. Instead, The Wolf and his KLA unit was surrounded by Serb
police and soldiers after they had been in action just four days.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 14 KLA guerrillas were killed, most by Serb
rocket-propelled grenades. The Wolf and two others were wounded. It
was a battle the outside world never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   When The Wolf is asked why he wants to go back to war, he talks
of patriotism and of reclaiming the land from the Serbs. ``Maybe
I'm crazy, I don't know,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Binac, 20, a fresh recruit who arrived at the Cafe Drenica on
Sunday from Germany, is even more gung-ho. ``I am ready to die for
the future of Kosovo,'' he says. ``Am I afraid? No, not even a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Binac says that a NATO ground invasion would be superfluous.
``We can liberate Kosovo ourselves,'' he says. ``Of course we will
need mortars, grenade launchers and anti-tank grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Albanian Army's Military Hospital in Tirana, there are
rooms full of wounded amateur soldiers like The Wolf who say they
cannot wait to get back into battle.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I am a young salaried professional, and I am
concerned about the long hours that I am putting in at work. As
demanding as it is, I like my job, but I am stressed out because it
is destroying my relationship with my fiance. I want both, but I am
thinking that's impossible. What are your thoughts? S.A.
</P>
<P>
   A. You may be able to have both, but unless you take some
corrective action now, you may end up with neither. The demands of
your job are creating difficulties with the significant other in
your personal life, and those difficulties can lead to significant
productivity problems at work.
</P>
<P>
   Many upward-striving individuals never tell anyone at work that
their job is hurting other commitments in their lives, as they fear
being labeled as weak. However, submissiveness is a far greater
sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   There are companies that understand this type of situation and
have implemented work/life programs that seriously support and
encourage employees to put some balance in their lives. These
companies have flexibility in terms of their hours, support for
family-friendly policies, travel benefits for partners/spouses, and
the like. Although they may implement these kinds of programs
because they are caring employers, they also recognize that there
are costly outcomes when employees fall into the stress cycle that
you have entered.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for you to honestly assess the priorities in your
life and consider discussing your concerns with management. The
discussion should include some suggestions regarding the ways to
introduce more work/life balance, and the benefits associated with
doing so. If you are subsequently labeled as a weak employee, then
you are in a weak organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I work in the Human Resources Department of a large
corporation. There are four of us, three females (myself being one)
and one male. Our boss gives us many projects with unreasonable
deadlines, doesn't help with the work, but takes all the credit.
She just bought a new house, so she is gone a lot. We work 60-plus
hours every week, but our male co-worker only works around 40. The
president is completely snowed by our boss, but one of the vice
presidents is slowly becoming aware of the problem. If we go over
our boss's head, we fear retribution. Would you please make some
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A. For a Human Resources Department, there certainly does not
seem to be much focus on humans or resources. It is truly
commendable that you were able to meet any deadlines at all.
</P>
<P>
   The first step for you and any of your equally dissatisfied
associates is to meet with this boss. Present specific examples of
the issues that you regard as unfair, inappropriate or
dissatisfying. And, for each such issue, present a plan of
correction.
</P>
<P>
   You can conclude the meeting by saying that you hope the problem
will end here, as you do not wish to go to senior management with
it. If your boss continues to mismanage the group, you should
approach the one vice president who is starting to see the light.
You need to turn that light into a spotlight by letting him see the
costs of what is going on. Be sure to mention your fears of
retaliation for speaking with him, and conclude by asking for his
help. Unless he specializes in being clueless, he will provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our manager tells us that fear is the greater motivator. He
threatens to write us up, give us poor reviews, hold back our
raises, and terminate those who are not up to his standards. I
don't think fear is a great motivator at all, but I am working
hard. Does he have something? T.C.
</P>
<P>
   A. The only thing that your manager has is incredible lack of
understanding of management. Certainly, fear can motivate. When a
manager walks into the office and threatens to terminate anyone who
does not obey, the troops are going to obey, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that virtually every study on the effectiveness
of fear as a motivator finds that its motivational impact is short
term at best. It is just a matter of time before the employees
start to respond with resistance, rebellion and retaliation. Your
manager has totally missed the concept of treating the employees as
individuals and trying to link their needs and objectives to
departmental or organizational objectives, and this is at the heart
of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   As a footnote, since employees tend to learn many of their
managerial skills from their prior managers, it will be
particularly important for you to avoid emulating this manager's
style. Using fear as a motivator can be effective on a short-term
basis, but it is ultimately most effective at motivating people to
leave.

NATO RULES OUT USE OF FORCE IN EMBARGO, SAYS MILITARY OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of NATO's Military Committee said
Monday that the alliance will not use force in the Adriatic Sea to
choke off oil supplies headed to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even though NATO leaders agreed Saturday at a summit here to use
warships in enforcing an oil embargo, German Gen. Klaus Naumann,
who heads the alliance's military advisory group, said sailors on
the ships will not be allowed to fire warning shots at freighters
or forcibly board them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A visitation-and-search regime does not give us the right to
force anyone to abandon his course; so we cannot stop a merchant
vessel by the use of force,'' Naumann told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   His comment left unclear just how the fuel embargo, announced by
the European Union and then by NATO, will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea declined to discuss how the alliance
will respond if a freighter does not agree to be searched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't yet have the initial concept of operations from the
military authorities,'' Shea said, adding that the alliance's top
military commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, is scheduled to
brief NATO leaders in Brussels Tuesday on the proposed naval
operation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planners, said Shea, ``are not seeing this (embargo) as a
panacea, which in itself is going to reduce or eliminate all oil
deliveries.'' The alliance also is stepping up the aerial bombing
of roadways to prevent Yugoslav oil trucks from resupplying
military units, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting off Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's outside oil
supplies is a key strategy in NATO's month-long air war. Aerial
attacks have shut down Yugoslavia's two oil refineries and
destroyed about 70 percent of its reserves, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann said that the ships ``visiting the (Montenegro) port of
Bar are to some extent European Union ships. So I think we will see
a certain impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend NATO leaders debated what to do about ships
from Russia, Yugoslavia's main oil supplier, and other ``third
nations'' that might seek to make shipments to Yugoslav ports.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann predicted that even without the threat of force, the
embargo will have a deterrent effect on oil shipments. Freighters
bearing oil ``will be very, very cautious'' about approaching
Yugoslav ports with NATO ships prowling the waters, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planners opted against authorizing warships to use force
after concluding that the alliance lacks the legal authority _ a
mandate from the United Nations Security Council _ to do so,
Naumann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As things stand, we have no choice, and we have no chance to
get a United Nations embargo,'' he added, referring to expected
vetoes by Russia and China if the Security Council were to take up
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   F. Stephen Larrabee, a senior military analyst with the Rand
Corp. think tank here, said that if NATO is not allowed to use
force to stop oil shipments, the embargo will have no teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of blockade is it if you can't force any vessels to
stop?'' Larrabee asked.
</P>
<P>
   The countries honoring the embargo include the NATO nations:
Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Also honoring the embargo are Austria, Finland, Ireland and
Sweden, which are European Union members along with 11 NATO
countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NATO has been careful not to use the term ``blockade'' in
describing the emerging naval operation. Instead, officials say
they will ``visit and search'' commercial ships bound for Yugoslav
ports to ensure there are no oil shipments.
</P>
<P>
   W. Bruce Weinrod, former deputy assistant secretary of defense
for European and NATO policy, said that for legitimacy under
international law, a naval blockade typically requires a formal
declaration of war, something the NATO nations have declined to do
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Also, international law may not recognize a naval blockade
erected by NATO unless it is sanctioned by the United Nations,
Weinrod added.
</P>
<P>
   Using force to enforce the embargo has been a sticking point
with some NATO leaders. French President Jacques Chirac stressed at
the NATO summit that while his country supports an embargo,
forcibly boarding a ship challenges a nation's sovereignty and is
an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia
would ignore any NATO decision to impose an oil embargo against
Yugoslavia.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLANCO, Texas _ Blanco's 1,300 residents are fiercely protective
of their Hill Country hamlet's reputation. They want outsiders to
know about their exemplary public schools, the churches that form
the bedrock of Blanco's limited social life, and, most of all,
about its antique stores and notion shops and motels with plenty of
rooms available at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't want to talk about, and don't want the world to
hear about, is what happened on Jan. 9. That's when four law
officers from Llano arrived at Christ of the Hills Monastery five
miles outside Blanco. They came to arrest two monks accused of
indecency with a child, a felony that, if proven in court, could
send them to jail for up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The monks had already been suspended from priestly duties two
months earlier by the monastery's parent Russian Orthodox Church.
Fifty-four-year-old Father Benedict, the monastery's founder,
wasn't there when the officers arrived to arrest him; he'd moved to
Colorado. Father Jeremiah, 37, was placed in the Blanco County
Jail. The trial is set for Aug. 2. in Blanco County.
</P>
<P>
   When the story spread, and when a judge imposed a widespread gag
order to head off anticipated requests by the defense for a change
of venue, the townspeople were struck with a collective amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a really strong Christian community,'' says Blanco Mayor
Louann Hayes, whose full-time job is with Blanco's United Methodist
Church. Although the monastery moved to its hilltop perch in 1980,
Hayes says she knows ``absolutely nothing about it; that's not my
province.''
</P>
<P>
   County Commissioner Dorsey Lee Smith echoes Hayes' comment.
``Don't ask me about those monks because I don't know anything,''
he insists.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out he does. Many people in Blanco do. But any
suspicion of monkish wrongdoing paled beside the ``other'' thing
that was crystal clear _ that Christ of the Hills monastery, with
its miraculous ``Weeping Virgin'' icon, brought outsiders with
money to spend into an out-of-the-way town with a shaky economy.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime resident finally rolls her eyes, sighs and blurts,
``Look, it was a situation where we all said to ourselves for a
long time, `I don't know exactly what's going on out there, but I
probably can't stop it anyway, and besides they're bringing money
into the community.' There were always rumors. But what good would
it have done to find out they were true?''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Father Benedict, one of the accused monks, is also known as Sam
Greene. The judge's gag order prevents investigators in the
indecency case from sharing their knowledge of Greene's colorful
background _ Henry Nolan of the district attorney's office has
perfected the words, ``No comment,'' and he notes the gag order
muzzles ``anyone involved in any aspect of the case'' at peril of
fine and/or imprisonment. But even a cursory check of old newspaper
articles and court documents indicates that this isn't the first
time Greene has fronted a religious community and run afoul of the
law.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, Greene, who has said he was born in New York
and spent time in monasteries in the United States and Europe, was
associated with the Espada Mission, a Roman Catholic program in San
Antonio. Later, Greene operated Galilee Ranch in San Antonio,
coordinating with the Bexar County Juvenile Court, which placed
troubled youngsters in the facility. According to old newspaper
articles, Greene and the kids at Galilee lived by selling
vegetables they raised.
</P>
<P>
   His next incarnation is public knowledge. Greene became one of
San Antonio's and the Hill Country's best-known real estate
wheeler-dealers. His ads saturated area airwaves. He made land
deals all around Blanco County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I knew Mr. Greene before he became a bishop,'' chuckles
Roy Byars, who has lived in Blanco for 80 years and served as the
city's postmaster. ``He was around (Blanco) all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Greene formed a group known as Ecumenical Monks Inc.,
which built a monastery near Boerne in the Hill Country. They named
their site Christ of the Hills, and Greene said the monastery was
associated with the Greek Orthodox Church. Court records show that
the San Antonio Regional Trade Association sued Greene and
Ecumenical Monks for failure to pay for goods received. In 1980,
the monastery was moved to a rugged 105-acre site outside Blanco;
Father Pangratios, the monastery's spokesman, says the relocation
occurred because ``we wanted to get a little more out in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of monks at Christ of the Hills varied, usually
between 15 and 20. The monks supported themselves by selling
souvenirs _ incense they made themselves, honey from bees they
raised, church icons they bought from outside artisans. Wearing
their rough black robes, they made daily trips to Blanco for
supplies and to send and receive mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sure sent out a lot and got a lot,'' Byars recalls. ``It
was from all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some newspapers and magazines wrote stories about the monastery.
In 1984, Eastern Orthodox clergy in San Antonio publicly denied
that Sam Greene and his monks had any affiliation with their
church, despite Greene's claim to the contrary. Greene replied it
was a matter of internal church debate, but he soon began listing
Christ of the Hills as a Russian Orthodox monastery.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The '80s were hard on Blanco. The town suffered then, as it
still does, from an acute water shortage that limits its ability to
support any new businesses or residents. The Blanco River is the
city's only supply; it does not have access to the Edwards Aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hill Country tourists bypassed Blanco for
nearby Fredricksburg and Kerrville and Blanco arch-enemy Johnson
City, whose leadership Blanco residents still resent for
``stealing'' the county seat from them in the 1880s. Blanco
residents couldn't make a living farming; the harsh caliche soil is
only suited to growing rattlesnakes. Some residents commuted to
jobs in San Antonio or Austin. The area was in economic decline.
Except for visitors to a small state park, anyone pausing in Blanco
was just stopping for gas or a quick meal; the town was not a
destination in the sense that outsiders came, stayed awhile, and
spent a lot of money. ``It got difficult,'' Byars says.
</P>

<P>
   The monks were always around, and, according to Byars and
others, Sam Greene had a regular spot at the only bar in town. But
Christ of the Hills wasn't a key element in Blanco's stuttering
economy until the Virgin cried.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It was on May 7, 1985, Father Pangratios, a monk at Christ of
the Hills, says that he discovered a Virgin Mary icon in the
monastery chapel weeping tears of myrrh, an aromatic oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reported this to church authorities and committees of
several Orthodox priests and bishops came at different times to
examine the icon,'' he says. ``One even camped out in the chapel
overnight. There had been other rare instances of an icon weeping,
so I knew it was something possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Christ of the Hills began advertising its miracle icon, sopping
up myrrh-tears on cotton balls and, Pangratios says, giving them
away to whoever wanted one.
</P>
<P>
   ``As word spread, we sometimes had 1,000 visitors a day,'' he
says. The story was widely reported. Many of the people who came
stayed overnight in Blanco. The town had become a ``destination,''
not a place to drive through along U.S. 281.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people came with sick relatives they wanted to have
cured by the miracle,'' recalls David Leese, a proud
fourth-generation Blanco resident.
</P>
<P>
   Brochures touting the icon _ brochures printed by the monastery
on their private press _ appeared in almost every Blanco shop and
office, including City Hall. The monastery is featured on Blanco's
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Along with more tourists, though, rumors about possible
goings-on at the monastery blanketed the town. After initially
claiming not to know anything at all about the monks, several
residents did recall some of the gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors are typical small-town fare, running the gamut from
sexual hijinks to questionable personal hygiene. And, always, there
were young boys supposedly living there. In small-town Blanco,
everybody talks about everybody else. But few residents say they
ever drove out to the monastery to visit and see for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, out here in the country we really don't know much
about that sort of thing,'' Smith says. ``You know, with boys and
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the rumors, Pangratios responds that ``in small
towns, people say things. Please don't judge Blanco by a few who
make accusations. Most of the people there are kind and loving.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the monastery announced in one of its mailings that
it had been certified by the Russian Orthodox Church to operate a
parochial school for potential monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a three-year period when it is customary to see if
the lifestyle is appropriate,'' Pangratios explains.
</P>
<P>
   When Greene _ now identifying himself as Bishop Benedict _
wasn't having a few drinks in Blanco, he and other Christ of the
Hills monks traveled extensively. One 1990 monthly newsletter from
the seminary noted recent trips to Russia and Alaska. State records
show real estate companies operating from the same post office box
address as the monastery; Pangratios explains that one is set up to
support Greene's aging mother, who lives on the monastery grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in January, Benedict and Jeremiah _ originally named
Jonathan Hitt, and identified by several town residents as Greene's
most frequent companion on forays into Blanco _ were charged with
three counts each of indecency with a child.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Greene and Hitt were already in trouble with the Russian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Hughes, an Austin lawyer representing the church, confirmed
the two had been suspended ``from their priestly duties'' in
November 1998. The suspensions ``had to do with complaints with the
way the monastery was being run, though I can't go into
specifics,'' Hughes says, adding the complaints were not
``exactly'' linked to the indecency charges.
</P>
<P>
   Suspensions, Hughes says, ``are standard operating procedure
with any kind of problems, even lesser ones than someone being
criminally indicted. We have suspended our own internal
investigation pending the outcome of the criminal case, so the
individuals can concentrate on their defense there.''
</P>
<P>
   The gag order restricts much knowledge of the specific indecency
charges, and courts and the media routinely do not reveal the
identities of children involved in such cases. The boy in question
was 13 when the alleged indecencies occurred. Court records
indicate the child claims Greene and Hitt asked him to touch their
genitals three times during the summer of 1997. The trial date is
set so the boy can be available for testimony during his summer
break from school.
</P>
<P>
   By the time officers came to arrest Greene and Hitt, Greene was
living in Colorado. Pangratios says Greene, who weighs well over
300 pounds, was forced to move ``to a more conducive climate'' by
ongoing, severe cardiac problems. He was also injured in a car
crash while in Colorado and has since developed colon disease,
Pangratios adds. When Greene surrendered himself to the Llano
court, he wore a portable oxygen mask and tank. He and Hitt are
still living on the monastery grounds.
</P>
<P>
   So are an additional 13 monks ranging in age from ``16 or 17 to
98,'' Pangratios says.
</P>
<P>
   But the two have their supporters, including parents whose
children have come to Christ of the Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Penn, a professor of ethics at St. Edwards
University in Austin, co-signed Greene's $50,000 bond. Penn's son,
who is a full-fledged priest at the monastery, first moved there at
age 14 as a novice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monastery is a very special ministry,'' Penn told the
Austin American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Visitors have to follow two narrow country roads to reach Christ
of the Hills. The entrance to the monastery is a long, unpaved
trail up a steep hill. A sign warns visitors to dress modestly (no
shorts) and speak softly.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small parking area at the top of the hill. A few
surrounding buildings are pristine brick; others are slapped
together from cheap wood. Two dogs, one large and white, the other
a tiny, playful puppy, romp about the grounds. Several silent,
black-robed monks perform various tasks _ sawing wood, raking
pathways, fiddling with a drip-irrigation system in a sparse
garden. In the middle of one path is the decaying corpse of some
unidentifiable animal; its fangs and exposed rib bones glisten
whitely in the hot morning sun.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Father Pangratios, slender of frame and wispy of beard, hurries
up to greet visitors. He apologizes for the rough setting _ ``Monks
should not have too much luxury'' _ and notes everyone at the
monastery arose at 3:30 a.m. for morning prayer. At 10 a.m.,
they're well into their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mostly live hand to mouth,'' he explains. ``We each have
some regular work assignments and other tasks are assigned as needs
come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pangratios is eager to cite the gag order _ ``I really can't
talk about anything to do with the unpleasantness'' _ and even more
eager to offer a tour of selected buildings. The weeping icon,
housed in a special chapel, comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Though their numbers have declined a bit since the mid-'80s and
the first news of the miraculous icon, Pangratios says a steady
stream of visitors _ ``believers and those who are just curious'' _
continues making the 15-minute drive from Blanco to the monastery.
But during a 90-minute visit on a Tuesday morning, no other cars
arrive at the main compound.
</P>
<P>
   Pangratios eventually says goodbye, adds a gentle ``God bless
you,'' and pointedly notes he believes the Lord will put fairness
into the hearts of all who come to visit Christ of the Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call if you need more information,'' he concludes, and gives a
private number.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The timing of what Pangratios calls ``the unpleasantness''
couldn't be worse for Blanco. Recently, the town's chamber of
commerce and its separate merchant's association ended months of
feuding and developed a joint new marketing plan. Money has been
raised; a new billboard touting the town is up beside the highway,
and Blanco residents are proud enough to brag about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is working together to get the word about the town
out,'' says Norm Gaida, who owns the Swiss Lodge motel.
``Obviously, we want those tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanco is getting lots of media mentions in stories about the
allegations at Christ of the Hills. Residents questioned by
reporters are torn. They don't want to associate themselves or
their town with alleged sex abuse of children, but they do want
people to keep coming to see the weeping icon. So they compromise
by saying they know nothing personally about the monks or the
monastery, while prominently displaying Christ of the Hills
brochures in their shops and city offices.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, often over iced tea or coffee in The Bowling Alley,
Blanco's mom-and-pop eatery, they follow their ``don't know
anything'' rote with information about what they do know.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, for example, says he knows about a monastery
furniture-making operation, dogs he claims they breed and sell, and
that somebody from a Russian Orthodox church in New York came down
recently on some investigation. As a member of the local tax board,
Smith has even inspected the monastery himself.
</P>
<P>
   In no instance does it appear that anyone in Blanco had solid
evidence of malfeasance at Christ of the Hills. But they had plenty
of suspicions, which, if confirmed, could have killed the cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Father Pangratios says the monastery will continue to operate no
matter how the trials of Benedict and Jeremiah turn out. The Virgin
icon weeps daily, its tears interpreted by the monks as a sign of
sadness at the wickedness of the world. Father Benedict and Father
Jeremiah await their days in court.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Blanco, in the few shops around a square dominated
by a courthouse that's been empty for a century, business owners
await tourists. Mayor Hayes, Commissioner Smith and the rest
continue to tout the town's excellent public schools and tightly
knit church community. A prominent sign in the window of the police
station suggests, ``Tell Your Minister.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in Austin, attorney Lin Hughes concludes, ``It's going to
be very unfortunate if the allegations are true, and very
unfortunate if they aren't.''

 &HT;    Saturation frenzy feeds emotion, not facts
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Images of violence and terror gobbled up
television this past Tuesday, as the carnage of another school
shooting took center stage and stayed there all week.
</P>
<P>
   As the siege at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
unfolded, TV cameras were everywhere. The unblinking eye showed us
time and time again the frantic efforts of a wounded boy trying to
escape through a second-story window, the tearful faces of
survivors, the hysterical parents awaiting news of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Hours and hours of live coverage were followed by days and days
of follow-up. As awful and newsworthy as the shootings in Littleton
were, many of us (perhaps with a bit of guilt) wondered if the
coverage didn't hit the saturation point by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What did we learn from a two-hour ``town hall'' edition of
``Nightline'' on Thursday night? What was gained from having
residents of Jonesboro, Ark., the site of a previous school
shooting, join the still-shocked residents of Littleton in an
electronically connected group therapy session? I found myself
alternately bored and appalled by my boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ask ourselves, does this have any value beyond
emotional impact, and very often it doesn't,'' said Dan Amundson,
research director for the Center for Media and Public Affairs in
Washington, D.C. ``TV news should be in the news business, not
trying to put on good drama. Our main purpose should be
information. . . .I think the media needs to put a lot more filters
between what they're getting and what they're showing.''
</P>
<P>
   When television airs live, raw footage of breaking news, viewers
get an emotional rush but not much more. Reporters thrown on the
air live often are unable to offer context or long-term
perspective. The result can be senseless speculation and,
unintentionally, danger.
</P>
<P>
   Two Denver stations were criticized for airing live footage of
the SWAT team's movements while students were still trapped inside
the school. If the shooters had been watching TV, they would have
seen the escape routes that were being prepared. The stations also
were criticized for airing a whispered cell phone call from a
student begging for help. Both CNN and MSNBC picked up the footage
and aired it while the situation was unstable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for someone to start a network called `Where Really
Bad Things Can Happen Live,' `` said Linda Ellerbee, a former
network news reporter who now produces programs for ``Nick News.''
``I don't think they had to go on and stay on so long live. We're
just not at our best live. A lot of it is irresponsible and
erroneous. In one sense, what TV does best is convey the
experience, but I think we're at a place now where we have to start
relying on common sense in individual situations. The public's
right to know is not always in the best interest of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we were better off before the technology allowed TV to go
live instantly and stay live indefinitely. When news stories had to
be reported and packaged for the evening news, we didn't have to
worry about killers watching and ``eyewitnesses'' giving bad
information.
</P>
<P>
   With time to fill in the aftermath of live coverage, mistakes
and bad judgment can be compounded. In reality, police
investigations are slow and dull. Television needs things to move
faster, so news people assemble parallel cases, bringing in their
own witnesses and experts. But the result is little more than
emotional displays and speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much we learn from interviewing the 14th
student and parent,'' Amundson said. ``There's a point where you
say, let's put together a more traditional news story and
synthesize the experience. I'm not sure all these one-on-one
interviews advance our knowledge so much as keep a raw wound
open.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us are concerned about our children and the violent world
they live in. We wonder about the impact of television, movies,
music and video games, and we ask lots of questions. Did the two
boys in Colorado base their murderous plan on a video game, a
Marilyn Manson song . . . or TV's coverage of a previous school
rampage?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers in any of this,'' Ellerbee said.
``There are lots of good questions. I don't think the fact that we
covered the other events where children were shot is what caused
the kids in Littleton to do this, but I'm not sure it's not some
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an interrogation of the shooters, we'll never
know why they did what they did. Nor will we know if the TV
coverage will inspire copycatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these shootings have had their own unique psychological
dramas,'' Amundson said. ``Yes, similar types of people seem to be
doing similar things, but that doesn't mean they're doing it for
the same reason. They can be aware of other instances but not
necessarily copying them.''
</P>
<P>
   What do supposedly normal kids get from watching real-life
mayhem on TV?
</P>
<P>
   We know from surveys that children have a heightened sense of
paranoia and fear from watching crime coverage on TV. They are
usually far more fearful than they need to be. We can assume that
the events in Littleton will have a similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean TV shouldn't cover such shootings? No, but it
does mean we should think about what we see, ask thoughtful
questions and remember that not everything on TV news is necessary,
accurate or helpful.

 &HT;    Atlanta leaders look to Glasco
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: TEXAS EDITORS.)
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta Chamber leaders hope that Darrell Glasco
can show the resourcefulness here that he did in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president for economic development at the Greater Austin
Chamber, Glasco didn't just aim for big companies. He looked for
companies with promising products that could grow in Austin. That's
why he went after Trilogy Software Inc. five years ago, then a
five-person software company in Palo Alto, Calif. Enticed by the
area's quality of life, inexpensive housing and the University of
Texas, the company moved to Austin, and now has 1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the best companies are the smallest ones,'' said
Glasco. ``You can't just look at size. You have to look at
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Glasco will become a vice president and the
number-two economic development executive at the Metro Atlanta
Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   State and metro economic development officials have said they
want to recruit high-tech companies by growing the number of
technology workers in the area. They hope to do that by increasing
the number of university students majoring in high-tech fields and
by bringing in experienced technology workers from other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Glasco established a reputation in Austin for recruitment
innovation. For example, two years ago he organized a job fair in
Boston to recruit technology workers for companies in Austin. Over
the next month, Austin will unveil a national marketing campaign
aimed at technology workers and an Internet site listing available
technology jobs in the Austin area.
</P>
<P>
   Glasco's own decision to move to Atlanta came after he received
a phone call from former mayor Andy Young. ``The fact that they
would have someone like that call me meant a lot to me,'' Glasco
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his initial evaluation of metro Atlanta, Glasco says he
doesn't know enough about the area yet to comment on its
weaknesses. For strengths, he lists Hartsfield International
Airport, the community's energy level and local leadership's focus
on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the leadership to back the effort it doesn't
happen,'' he said. `` It's not from anything other than the
leadership.''

A GALLANT STRUGGLE ENDS
</HEADLINE>
  By SHARON EDELSON 
 From Women's Wear Daily 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was the epitome of glamour escorting Princess Diana to the
Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996,
but beneath the velvet and satin, Liz Tilberis was fighting the
battle of her life. On Wednesday morning at Mount Sinai Hospital
here, Tilberis, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, lost her
six-year struggle with ovarian cancer. She was 51 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry expressed shock and sadness at Tilberis's
death. She had been able to face down the disease several times
before and many assumed she would continue to overcome it. ``She
was a very special woman,'' said Calvin Klein. ``I don't know
anyone who's displayed the kind of courage that she has in the last
six years. To have editorial meetings while she's having bone
marrow transplants, and be a wife and mother and run a fashion
magazine while she's dealing with this terrible illness is
incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout all this time, there's her extraordinary will to
live and to enjoy life,'' Klein added. ``She had such a sense of
humor and still had such a passion for clothes and for photography.
And she always wanted to gossip. She'd call and say, `Okay, let's
have it.' I don't gossip with very many people, but we talked about
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan recalled meeting Tilberis in London at British Vogue
in the 80s. ``I remember her sitting there with that gorgeous white
hair of hers and I immediately felt a kinship with her and her
womanliness,'' Karan said. I knew at that point she was not going
to be just someone I met through business. It was going to be far
deeper than that. ``Liz was so big in my eyes, larger than life,''
Karan added. ``It was always her smile. It was the way she talked.
She was always concerned about the next person and never herself.
We had so much fun together. I felt a real connection. She allowed
people to be that close to her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not unusual, what she was going through,'' said
Jeanette Chang, Bazaar's publisher, of Tilberis's cancer fight.
``It has been a miracle for six years. She was always going to pull
through and be here.'' Tilberis used her high-profile position to
bring attention to the cause of ovarian cancer. As president of the
Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, she convinced retailers to host
events in their stores and manufacturers to donate proceeds of
special products to the organization. Just this week, Sebastian
announced it would give 100 percent of the profits of a new Berry
Bazaar Trucco Divinyls lipstick to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tilberis published a memoir, ``No Time to Die: Living
With Ovarian Cancer.'' In it, she wrote: ``I never wanted to be a
cancer spokesperson. But cancer has become an immutable part of my
persona. I don't run from it. I study, anticipate and confront
it.'' But Tilberis never let the illness get in the way of her job.
Colleagues at Bazaar said she remained involved with the
publication until the last days of her life. ``The last
conversation I had with her about five or six days ago,'' said
creative director Fabien Baron, ``she said, `Wait for me at the
magazine.' She loved her husband, kids and the magazine. She loved
the job. She was asking me all about the June issue and I was
telling her how great it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Liz could have had meetings on the June issue as late as
last Thursday,'' said Cathleen Black, president of Hearst
Magazines. ``She's directing traffic and pushing and cajoling. She
loved this magazine so much that throughout all this amazing battle
she made light of it most of the time.'' Black said Tilberis' love
of fashion, art, architecture and literature, celebrities, artists
and musicians was reflected in Bazaar. ``Those were the kinds of
things she tried to infuse the magazine with to make it more than
just a fashion magazine,'' Black said. ``It took people places. It
was a statement; it was aspirational, yet it was approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bazaar's future issues, Chang said: ``Thankfully, Liz has
a lot of senior captains: Karen Johnston, managing editor], Tonne
Goodman, fashion director and Annemarie Iverson, beauty and fashion
news director. Photographer Patrick Demarchelier has been here for
years. All the stories have been going on while she's been ill.
It's not as though anything is coming to a halt by any means. The
next four issues were planned with her blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis seems to have been one of those rare, unusually focused
people who identify their life's calling at an early age. Fashion
has always been her passion. Tilberis was born in Shirehampton,
England in 1947. She won a fashion essay writing contest _ one of
her topics was on costume historian James Laver, of whom she wrote,
``It was from him that I learned that hemlines are tied to the
wider world.'' The prize: a summer internship at British Vogue in
1969. At the same time, she edited a weekly fashion page in a local
newspaper, the Bath &AMP; Wiltshire Evening Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Leicester Polytechnic in 1970, Tilberis
joined the British Vogue staff as a fashion assistant. She was
promoted to fashion editor four years later, and in 1984 became
executive fashion editor, rising to editor of the entire magazine
in 1987. Tilberis' big coup at British Vogue came in 1990, when she
snagged the Princess of Wales for the December 1991 cover. Two
years later, she was on her way to New York to become editor of
Harper's Bazaar, which at the time was celebrating its 125th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis was known to joke about the change in her life when she
moved to New York from London. In her homeland she was a chic
matron, favoring size 14 suits and a simple bob for her straight
gray hair. After a short time in New York, she began to adopt
sophisticated, minimalist looks from the likes of Calvin Klein and
Gucci. ``I even have my own publicist now,'' she once said
self-deprecatingly in a speech in London, adding she would never
have dreamed of such self-promotion when she was editor of British
Vogue. But longtime colleagues stressed that Tilberis never lost
sight of what was most important in her life _ her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is when she went to America she didn't stop
being a Mum,'' said Anna Cryer, who was Tilberis' executive
assistant when she was editor of British Vogue and moved with her
to Harper's Bazaar. ``She always remained grounded. She'd have
lunch with Karl Lagerfeld, tea with Donna Karan and still go home
at 6 p.m. to make dinner for her kids. It was a huge gap between
those two worlds but she bridged it because being a parent was so
important to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis always made people want to be part of her gang, Cryer
said. ``Someone once said to me that Liz was so nice she could call
you into her office, fire you and you'd walk out thanking her for
it,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tilberis arrived, Harper's Bazaar was in need of a
makeover. She and Baron conceived of a magazine that was elegant
yet playful, with floating, overlapping graphics the likes of which
had not been seen in a contemporary fashion publication. ``We were
very nervous, but we knew Bazaar was a beautiful magazine,'' Baron
said. ``We called it `Sleeping Beauty.' '' Tilberis said she had
always wanted to produce a cutting-edge magazine. ``I suppose
creativity is pushing the envelope forward in a very constructive
way,'' she told WWD in an interview last October. ``All my life,
I've loved creativity in people. I like the idea that a magazine
offers creativity to readers, particularly in the styles. When we
launched with Fabien's graphics, it kept Harper's Bazaar on the
cutting edge,'' she said. `
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis had an affinity for American fashion. In the October
interview, she said, ``American designers invented sportswear. They
introduced pants and sweaters for women.'' Klein said when he saw
Tilberis' first issue of Harper's Bazaar, he thought, ``How great.
It takes a Brit to make a great American fashion magazine. She
understood what was American more than most American editors.''
</P>
<P>
   While the publication has not always been universally well
received, it did shake up the industry when it launched and set the
stage for a legendary _ at least as it was played up by the press _
rivalry between Tilberis and her British Vogue mentor, Anna
Wintour. In 1987, Wintour was named editor of HG, formerly House
and Garden, and Tilberis became her successor at British Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Liz was a very formidable competitor,'' Wintour said
on Wednesday. ``I think she had an incredibly strong fashion
esthetic and put out a very elegant magazine. When we were working
together at British Vogue, she always struck me as being an
amazingly strong person with an incredible love of fashion. A
fashion editor par excellence. ``She was passionate about her
sittings and her work,'' Wintour continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis's talent was evident to many others. Both Ralph Lauren
and Klein said they tried to hire Tilberis away from British Vogue
when she was a fashion editor. ``When she was at British Vogue,
about two or three years before she came to America, I had hired
her and she was all packed,'' Lauren said. ``She was going to work
with me as an assistant in design. It was all set. But British
Vogue didn't want her to leave, and gave her a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually even tried to bring her into my organization,''
Klein said. ``She was clearly a great talent and we all knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Lauder, chairman and ceo of Estee Lauder Cos., said:
``Liz Tilberis was a woman of enormous grace, charm and courage.
Any normal person, when faced with this serious illness, would have
retired or just gone home to lick their wounds. Not Liz. She fought
not only for her own life but for the lives of countless others. We
owe her a great deal of debt of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Many industry veterans were too distraught to discuss Tilberis
over the phone. Karl Lagerfeld, in a fax, wrote, ``I am so sad
about the death of dear Liz Tilberis that I can hardly talk. She
was such a marvelous friend _ so optimistic, so like sunshine and
so courageous. She was so special and human in our tough fashion
world. Nice with everybody, but strong. That's a very rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a very courageous woman,'' said Giorgio Armani.
``She lived and worked up until the end, as if she were never
affected by the terrible pain. I saw her last in January. We talked
about work, but most of all, we talked about life. She never
betrayed any signs of pain on her beautiful face or in her
intelligent words.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, people spoke of Tilberis' kindness and ability to
transcend the cutthroat fashion industry. ``She was a real lady in
the truest sense of the word,'' said Emanuel Ungaro. ``Liz gave a
sense of welcome to new people. She was not just following the
megastars of fashion. She was trying to understand the young
designers. For me, her curiosity was her greatest contribution.
``She was never judging you,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost more than a great editor,'' said Valentino. ``We lost
a special friend. She was a real woman. Real as fashion rarely is.
She was courageous and very sweet.''
</P>

A GALLANT STRUGGLE ENDS
</HEADLINE>
  By SHARON EDELSON 
 From Women's Wear Daily 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was the epitome of glamour escorting Princess Diana to the
Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996,
but beneath the velvet and satin, Liz Tilberis was fighting the
battle of her life. On Wednesday morning at Mount Sinai Hospital
here, Tilberis, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, lost her
six-year struggle with ovarian cancer. She was 51 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry expressed shock and sadness at Tilberis's
death. She had been able to face down the disease several times
before and many assumed she would continue to overcome it. ``She
was a very special woman,'' said Calvin Klein. ``I don't know
anyone who's displayed the kind of courage that she has in the last
six years. To have editorial meetings while she's having bone
marrow transplants, and be a wife and mother and run a fashion
magazine while she's dealing with this terrible illness is
incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout all this time, there's her extraordinary will to
live and to enjoy life,'' Klein added. ``She had such a sense of
humor and still had such a passion for clothes and for photography.
And she always wanted to gossip. She'd call and say, `Okay, let's
have it.' I don't gossip with very many people, but we talked about
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan recalled meeting Tilberis in London at British Vogue
in the 80s. ``I remember her sitting there with that gorgeous white
hair of hers and I immediately felt a kinship with her and her
womanliness,'' Karan said. I knew at that point she was not going
to be just someone I met through business. It was going to be far
deeper than that. ``Liz was so big in my eyes, larger than life,''
Karan added. ``It was always her smile. It was the way she talked.
She was always concerned about the next person and never herself.
We had so much fun together. I felt a real connection. She allowed
people to be that close to her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not unusual, what she was going through,'' said
Jeanette Chang, Bazaar's publisher, of Tilberis's cancer fight.
``It has been a miracle for six years. She was always going to pull
through and be here.'' Tilberis used her high-profile position to
bring attention to the cause of ovarian cancer. As president of the
Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, she convinced retailers to host
events in their stores and manufacturers to donate proceeds of
special products to the organization. Just this week, Sebastian
announced it would give 100 percent of the profits of a new Berry
Bazaar Trucco Divinyls lipstick to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tilberis published a memoir, ``No Time to Die: Living
With Ovarian Cancer.'' In it, she wrote: ``I never wanted to be a
cancer spokesperson. But cancer has become an immutable part of my
persona. I don't run from it. I study, anticipate and confront
it.'' But Tilberis never let the illness get in the way of her job.
Colleagues at Bazaar said she remained involved with the
publication until the last days of her life. ``The last
conversation I had with her about five or six days ago,'' said
creative director Fabien Baron, ``she said, `Wait for me at the
magazine.' She loved her husband, kids and the magazine. She loved
the job. She was asking me all about the June issue and I was
telling her how great it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Liz could have had meetings on the June issue as late as
last Thursday,'' said Cathleen Black, president of Hearst
Magazines. ``She's directing traffic and pushing and cajoling. She
loved this magazine so much that throughout all this amazing battle
she made light of it most of the time.'' Black said Tilberis' love
of fashion, art, architecture and literature, celebrities, artists
and musicians was reflected in Bazaar. ``Those were the kinds of
things she tried to infuse the magazine with to make it more than
just a fashion magazine,'' Black said. ``It took people places. It
was a statement; it was aspirational, yet it was approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bazaar's future issues, Chang said: ``Thankfully, Liz has
a lot of senior captains: Karen Johnston, managing editor], Tonne
Goodman, fashion director and Annemarie Iverson, beauty and fashion
news director. Photographer Patrick Demarchelier has been here for
years. All the stories have been going on while she's been ill.
It's not as though anything is coming to a halt by any means. The
next four issues were planned with her blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis seems to have been one of those rare, unusually focused
people who identify their life's calling at an early age. Fashion
has always been her passion. Tilberis was born in Shirehampton,
England in 1947. She won a fashion essay writing contest _ one of
her topics was on costume historian James Laver, of whom she wrote,
``It was from him that I learned that hemlines are tied to the
wider world.'' The prize: a summer internship at British Vogue in
1969. At the same time, she edited a weekly fashion page in a local
newspaper, the Bath &AMP; Wiltshire Evening Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Leicester Polytechnic in 1970, Tilberis
joined the British Vogue staff as a fashion assistant. She was
promoted to fashion editor four years later, and in 1984 became
executive fashion editor, rising to editor of the entire magazine
in 1987. Tilberis' big coup at British Vogue came in 1990, when she
snagged the Princess of Wales for the December 1991 cover. Two
years later, she was on her way to New York to become editor of
Harper's Bazaar, which at the time was celebrating its 125th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis was known to joke about the change in her life when she
moved to New York from London. In her homeland she was a chic
matron, favoring size 14 suits and a simple bob for her straight
gray hair. After a short time in New York, she began to adopt
sophisticated, minimalist looks from the likes of Calvin Klein and
Gucci. ``I even have my own publicist now,'' she once said
self-deprecatingly in a speech in London, adding she would never
have dreamed of such self-promotion when she was editor of British
Vogue. But longtime colleagues stressed that Tilberis never lost
sight of what was most important in her life _ her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is when she went to America she didn't stop
being a Mum,'' said Anna Cryer, who was Tilberis' executive
assistant when she was editor of British Vogue and moved with her
to Harper's Bazaar. ``She always remained grounded. She'd have
lunch with Karl Lagerfeld, tea with Donna Karan and still go home
at 6 p.m. to make dinner for her kids. It was a huge gap between
those two worlds but she bridged it because being a parent was so
important to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis always made people want to be part of her gang, Cryer
said. ``Someone once said to me that Liz was so nice she could call
you into her office, fire you and you'd walk out thanking her for
it,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tilberis arrived, Harper's Bazaar was in need of a
makeover. She and Baron conceived of a magazine that was elegant
yet playful, with floating, overlapping graphics the likes of which
had not been seen in a contemporary fashion publication. ``We were
very nervous, but we knew Bazaar was a beautiful magazine,'' Baron
said. ``We called it `Sleeping Beauty.' '' Tilberis said she had
always wanted to produce a cutting-edge magazine. ``I suppose
creativity is pushing the envelope forward in a very constructive
way,'' she told WWD in an interview last October. ``All my life,
I've loved creativity in people. I like the idea that a magazine
offers creativity to readers, particularly in the styles. When we
launched with Fabien's graphics, it kept Harper's Bazaar on the
cutting edge,'' she said. `
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis had an affinity for American fashion. In the October
interview, she said, ``American designers invented sportswear. They
introduced pants and sweaters for women.'' Klein said when he saw
Tilberis' first issue of Harper's Bazaar, he thought, ``How great.
It takes a Brit to make a great American fashion magazine. She
understood what was American more than most American editors.''
</P>
<P>
   While the publication has not always been universally well
received, it did shake up the industry when it launched and set the
stage for a legendary _ at least as it was played up by the press _
rivalry between Tilberis and her British Vogue mentor, Anna
Wintour. In 1987, Wintour was named editor of HG, formerly House
and Garden, and Tilberis became her successor at British Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Liz was a very formidable competitor,'' Wintour said
on Wednesday. ``I think she had an incredibly strong fashion
esthetic and put out a very elegant magazine. When we were working
together at British Vogue, she always struck me as being an
amazingly strong person with an incredible love of fashion. A
fashion editor par excellence. ``She was passionate about her
sittings and her work,'' Wintour continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis's talent was evident to many others. Both Ralph Lauren
and Klein said they tried to hire Tilberis away from British Vogue
when she was a fashion editor. ``When she was at British Vogue,
about two or three years before she came to America, I had hired
her and she was all packed,'' Lauren said. ``She was going to work
with me as an assistant in design. It was all set. But British
Vogue didn't want her to leave, and gave her a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually even tried to bring her into my organization,''
Klein said. ``She was clearly a great talent and we all knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Lauder, chairman and ceo of Estee Lauder Cos., said:
``Liz Tilberis was a woman of enormous grace, charm and courage.
Any normal person, when faced with this serious illness, would have
retired or just gone home to lick their wounds. Not Liz. She fought
not only for her own life but for the lives of countless others. We
owe her a great deal of debt of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Many industry veterans were too distraught to discuss Tilberis
over the phone. Karl Lagerfeld, in a fax, wrote, ``I am so sad
about the death of dear Liz Tilberis that I can hardly talk. She
was such a marvelous friend _ so optimistic, so like sunshine and
so courageous. She was so special and human in our tough fashion
world. Nice with everybody, but strong. That's a very rare gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a very courageous woman,'' said Giorgio Armani.
``She lived and worked up until the end, as if she were never
affected by the terrible pain. I saw her last in January. We talked
about work, but most of all, we talked about life. She never
betrayed any signs of pain on her beautiful face or in her
intelligent words.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, people spoke of Tilberis' kindness and ability to
transcend the cutthroat fashion industry. ``She was a real lady in
the truest sense of the word,'' said Emanuel Ungaro. ``Liz gave a
sense of welcome to new people. She was not just following the
megastars of fashion. She was trying to understand the young
designers. For me, her curiosity was her greatest contribution.
``She was never judging you,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost more than a great editor,'' said Valentino. ``We lost
a special friend. She was a real woman. Real as fashion rarely is.
She was courageous and very sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her bravery was unbelievable,'' said Oscar de la Renta. ``She
was always so gracious and at the same time created great awareness
for the terrible thing that cancer is. She was able to raise a
tremendous amount of money using her own suffering. She never first
thought about herself.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Tilberis is survived by her husband, Andrew; two sons,

Stuart-Black and a brother, Dr. Grant Kelly. A spokeswoman for
Hearst said funeral services will be private. A memorial service is

INDIA MAKES WAY FOR THIRD ELECTION IN THREE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ After the collapse of the government led by
Hindu nationalists and the failure of opposition parties to put
together a majority, President K.R. Narayanan dissolved the lower
house of Parliament Monday night to make way for India's third
general election in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The election has not yet been scheduled, but it must take place
within six months. The chief election commissioner, M.S. Gill,
strongly suggested that it would not be possible to hold the
election before late July, when a national drive to update the
voting rolls is finished. Monsoon rains that peak in July and
August may cause further delay.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is months away, the Herculean task of organizing
an election in a democracy with a staggering 600 million voters
will begin immediately. Election officials must see to it that
800,000 polling stations staffed by 4.5 million workers are ready
to go.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-page memorandum released to reporters, Narayanan laid
out his painstaking efforts to consult leaders in Parliament since
the government led by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee lost a
confidence vote on April 17 by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president could not but observe that the ruling alliance
had lost its majority because of a lack of cohesion within its
ranks, and those who voted out the alliance showed the same lack of
cohesion when trying to form an alternative government,'' the memo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the two main national parties, the Bharatiya Janata
Party and the Congress Party, met feverishly to plot strategy. The
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party now has about a third of
the votes in Parliament, while Congress has about a fourth. Both
hope that they can turn this debacle into an opportunity to
increase their strength.
</P>
<P>
   But political experts said the failure to form a new government
was an unmitigated loss for the woman who pulled the thread that
unraveled the old one: Jayalalitha Jayaram, a former actress who
leads a party in Tamil Nadu and who reduced the government to a
minority when she withdrew her support. Jayalalitha, who is known
by her first name, is desperate to avoid conviction on numerous
corruption charges, but now she has no guarantee of a friendly
government in New Delhi anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying for political advantage was well under way Monday,
with both sides portraying themselves as victims of betrayal. The
Congress Party, whose leader, Sonia Gandhi, acknowledged on Sunday
that she had failed to form a government, turned its ire on Mulayam
Singh Yadav, the leader of a party in Uttar Pradesh, whose refusal
to support a Congress government doomed it to failure _ and whose
Muslim supporters Congress covets for itself.
</P>
<P>
   One Congress leader, Arjun Singh, condemned Yadav as a spoiler
who had blocked the effort to get rid of a Hindu nationalist-led
government that Congress has portrayed as anti-Muslim and
anti-Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress attack on Yadav appeared to be part of a concerted
strategy to improve its long-sagging fortunes in Uttar Pradesh,
India's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which
led the coalition government, described itself as the casualty of a
cynical power grab by the Congress Party. Congress, which governed
the nation for most of the last half century, is led by Sonia
Gandhi, the Italian-born inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi political
mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an anger in the people of this country for dislodging
Vajpayee for no reason,'' said Pramod Mahajan, a spokesman for the
ousted government, which is now serving as a caretaker. ``And we
are very sure this anger wil be ventilated at the ballot boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to catch a wave of sympathy from voters angry about more
political instability, Bharatiya Janata Party officials pressed for
quick elections in June, but it appears unlikely that they will get
their wish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the party's optimism, some political experts say the
odds are stacked against the Bharatiya Janata Party. While
incumbency is regarded as an advantage in many countries, it is
more often a curse in India.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last quarter century, only one national government has
been returned to power, and that was controlled by the Congress
Party under Rajiv Gandhi in 1984. He was elected in a landslide
after his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists were trounced by Congress in state
elections in November when prices of staple vegetables soared.
Prices have since come down, and Vajpayee had been governing with a
more confident hand, but very public squabbling in the government
coalition may well have undermined his reputation for effective
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be quite extraordinary if they came back to power,''
James Manor, a political scientist at the University of Sussex in
England, said of the Hindu nationalists. ``They think they're
different from all these other parties. But every BJP state
government has been thrown out of office except once in Rajasthan
in '93. They don't have any special magic that gets them
re-elected.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLANCO, Texas _ The ``Weeping Virgin'' icon is kept in a special
chapel on the grounds of Christ of the Hills monastery.
</P>
<P>
   At the door to the chapel, and again inside before the icon,
Father Pangratios performs several elaborate genuflections. Many
converts to Orthodoxy from Roman Catholicism or the Episcopal
Church cite their admiration for the ``bells and smells,'' the
elaborate ceremony associated with all Orthodox religious
practices. Pangratios is even happy to repeat the bows, kneelings
and icon-kissings when a photographer admits his roll of film ran
out at a crucial moment. The exercise seems to tire the monk; he
pants noticeably when he finishes for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin weeps real tears of myrrh,'' Pangratios says,
opening the glass casing. ``She doesn't weep at specific times.
Sometimes she weeps for an extended period. She's not weeping now,
but she did earlier. If you lean in at just the right angle, you
can see faint traces of oil on the icon's surface. And, of course,
you can smell the myrrh.''
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen cotton balls are jammed into the bottom of the
icon's frame. These, Pangratios says, will be left until they
absorb miraculous tears. Then they will be reverently wrapped in
aluminum foil and given to any true believers who request one. The
scent of myrrh is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors have come to see the icon, but their tour often
includes several other places of interest on the monastery grounds.
</P>
<P>
   There's a separate sanctuary where daily services are conducted
(visitors are asked to remove their shoes to spare unnecessary wear
on a very torn and faded rug); a graveyard bristling with high,
elaborate crosses marking the final resting places of Russian
Orthodox members who ``requested the honor of burial here''; crude
classrooms for religious instruction of the novices; a series of
tiny hillside structures serving as individual cells for
established monks; a gleaming 2-story dormitory for novice monks; a
small solar power station; a deserted workshop where, Pangratios
says, the monks make their various spices for sale (it, too, smells
strongly of myrrh); and a small structure whose sign announces
``St. Anna's Cafe'' and offers ``Espresso-Food-Snacks-Juice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of our visitors requested snacks that we went ahead
and put this in,'' Pangratios says. ``We monks ourselves eat much
plainer food. Vegetables, mostly. Fish on certain holy days. And we
fast during other holy periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The monastery gift shop would rival any at Disneyland. Its walls
display a variety of souvenirs. Some _ candles, pins _ cost only a
few dollars, but other elaborate hand-painted boxes and carved
statuettes cost as much as $475. There are books and icons and jars
of honey and pens and Mother Seraphima, who comes in on crutches
and beams when asked to pose for a picture.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Erica Lemus picked wildflowers and ran through the
lawn Monday, while Amanda Clanton sat in a wheelchair, her moving
head conveying her delight in seeing sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Erica, 6, and Amanda, 9, suffer from a rare skin disorder called
xeroderma pigmentosum.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the first day they were able to sit or play in the
sun without the risk of getting skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   They were presented specially designed NASA suits, which will
allow them to abandon the days of having to stay indoors with the
shades drawn or travel in a car with a blanket or towel draped over
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited and nervous,'' said Amanda's mother, Angie
Calloway, 31, a teacher's aide from nearby Crosby. ``We're finally
going to be able to take her to places that I've longed to do. I
want to take her to the park. I'd like to be able to take her to
SeaWorld one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda, who had not been in the sun since she was 11 months old,
clapped as about 20 family members at NASA's Rocket Park surrounded
her. The girl, who suffers from numerous neurological problems
associated with the skin disorder, will be able to go outside for
recess Tuesday for the first time at Barrett Primary School, where
her mother is a teacher's aide.
</P>
<P>
   Erica, whose family moved to Houston from Honduras two years
ago, is planning to attend Chambers Elementary School in the Alief
school district next month.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed after she came to this country, Erica, unlike Amanda,
does not suffer from any neurological problems and has been taught
at home by a homebound teacher, Carole Harrel.
</P>
<P>
   Harrel said Erica was dying when her mother, Tomasa Silva,
sneaked across the border to bring Erica to Houston for medical
attention. The girl's father, Regoberto Lemus, stayed behind to
sell their possessions before joining them.
</P>
<P>
   The family is now going through steps to become legal U.S.
citizens. Erica's father, a 33-year-old air-conditioner repairman,
ran outside with his daughter after she put on her special suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to go outside and play with other children,'' he
said, ``and she wants to go to the beach in Galveston.''
</P>
<P>
   They watched during the ceremony as Erica, their only child, was
fitted with her light blue cotton and Lycra-blend suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are made of machine-washable fabric that contains a
chemical that blocks ultraviolet light, said Robert L. Dotts. He is
assistant director of NASA's Technology Transfer and
Commercialization Office, which designed the suits.
</P>
<P>
   The suits will protect the girls from 99.9 percent of UV rays,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The office worked with Solar Protective Factory in California to
develop the fabric and the Microclimate Systems Inc. in Michigan to
provide the cooling systems for the suits, Dotts said.
</P>
<P>
   The suits, which include pants and a loose-fitting, long-sleeve
top, socks and gloves, are worn over regular clothes. Also included
are a neckband and hooded cap with built-in dark, tinted goggles.
Over the suits, the girls wore a white cooling vest equipped with
four gel packs,
</P>
<P>
   which last for two to three hours. The vests can be recharged in
a refrigerator in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the girls received the suits during a presentation at
Space Center Houston, they put them on and boarded a tram for a
short visit to Rocket Park.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither spoke _ Erica is shy and Amanda is unable to talk
_ their enjoyment was evident.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 21 children throughout the world who suffer from the
disease, as well as from other conditions that prevent them from
going outside, have been fitted with the special outfits, Dotts
said. Thirty others are on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration got involved
in creating the suits after being contact by Hampton, Va.,
homemaker Sarah Moody in 1986. She requested help for her nephew
who was born without sweat glands. Moody went on to found the HED
(hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplastia) Foundation. With money donated
to the foundation, the $2,000 suits are given to ailing children.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children without NASA would still be confined to their
homes,'' Moody said Monday during the ceremonies in which the girls
received their suits. ``It will give them a quality of life they
could never have had without NASA. We've opened the door from
darkness to sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really going to get to go outside,'' said Amanda's
stepmother, Veronica Clanton, 29, of nearby Kenefick in Liberty
County. ``It's kind of scary to think that for the past 9 years
Amanda has never gotten to go outside and now they're saying this
suit is going to enable her to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda's mother and her father, John Clanton, 32, a centrifuge
mechanic, knew something was wrong with their daughter when she was
5 months old and was not growing at a normal rate. She was
diagnosed with the life-threatening disorder at 13 months of age.
</P>
<P>
   Caused by a genetic disorder, the disease has been identified in
less than 1,000 cases known worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Persons with xeroderma pigmentosum have no pigmentation and no
defense against ultraviolet light. The slightest exposure to the
sun can cause skin cancer. A range of symptoms are associated with
those inflicted with the ailment _ including blindness and
deafness; blistering or freckling on minimum sun exposure;
developmental disabilities; dwarfism and hypergonadism; increased
skin and eye cancers; and mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no cure, those with the disorder can only curtail
it by avoiding the UV radiation by staying indoors with sunlight
blocked out or by using protective clothing, sunscreens and
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda, who has 17 different doctors, is non-verbal, 90 percent
blind and 85 percent deaf. She wears glasses and a hearing aid and
is in a wheelchair since she has not been able to walk since age 4.
Because of poor muscle tone she is unable to eat and is fed through
a gastric tube.
</P>
<P>
   For day-to-day activities, Amanda's life will not change that
much, said her stepmother, Veronica Clanton, who works for an oil
and gas company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going to be very hard for her and very hard for her
mother at all times. But we are so appreciative for everybody who
has made it possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Amanda's stepsisters, Shelby, 8, and Katilyn, 7, found out
their sister was going to get a special suit that would allow her
to go outside, they suggested that their parents take them all to
Disney World in Orlando, Fla.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER FDA CAN REGULATE TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court offered itself Monday as the next
battleground in the tobacco wars, announcing that it would decide
whether the Food and Drug Administration has authority to regulate
tobacco products as drugs and cigarettes as ``drug delivery
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting an appeal by the Clinton administration, the court
kept alive the prospect that the extensive regulations the federal
agency issued in 1996, aimed at deterring smoking by minors through
restrictions on cigarette sales and advertising, may yet take
effect. The regulations were struck down last year by the federal
appeals court in Richmond, Va., on the ground that Congress had not
given the FDA the authority to regulate tobocco products.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the administration said the
2-1 ruling last August by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
would ``deprive the public of an unparalleled opportunity to
prevent millions of children from acquiring a highly addictive
habit that often leads to premature death.'' The appeal, filed by
Solicitor General Seth Waxman, said the regulations were the result
of ``the most important public health and safety rule-making that
the FDA has conducted in the past 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry, which had brought the suit to block the
regulations as soon as they were issued, tried to dissuade the
justices from taking the case by arguing that the settlement
reached last fall between the industry and 46 states already
included an array of restrictions. In addition, the industry
argued, the question of the FDA's jurisdiction remained before
Congress. In his State of the Union speech in January, President
Clinton renewed his request to Congress for legislation ``to
reaffirm'' the agency's authority _ authority that the appeals
court's majority found had never existed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Food and Drug Administration vs. Brown and Williamson
Tobacco Corp., No. 98-1152, is likely to be argued in November,
with a decision sometime next spring. Even if the agency prevails,
however, the case will be far from over. The tobacco industry has
raised a variety of statutory and constitutional objections to the
regulations, including a First Amendment challenge to the
advertising restrictions. Having concluded that the agency lacked
authority to issue the regulations, the appeals court did not
address these specific issues but would have to do so if the
Supreme Court disagrees with its jurisdictional conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, Congress gave the
FDA jurisdiction over drugs and ``devices,'' both of which the law
defined as items ``intended to affect the structure or any function
of the body.'' For years the agency viewed this language as not
conveying authority to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   But it changed its mind in the mid-1990s after studying the
issue in light of new disclosures from tobacco industry witnesses
and documents showing that manufacturers carefully controlled the
amount of nicotine in cigarettes and viewed their product as a
means for delivering doses of a habit-forming chemical. Thus, the
agency concluded, nicotine not only had obvious effects on bodily
functions but was ``intended'' by the cigarette industry to have
those effects. Judge William Osteen of U.S. District Court in
Greensboro, N.C. agreed, upholding the FDA's authority in a 1997
ruling that the appeals court then overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel's majority said that while a ``mechanical
reading'' of the statute appeared to support the agency's assertion
of jurisdiction, the overall structure of the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act did not. The court said that since the FDA had
concluded that cigarettes were fundamentally unsafe, its only
option under the law was not to regulate them but to ban them, as
it would ban any other unsafe drug _ something Congress had clearly
not intended, in the majority's view.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the outlook at the Supreme Court is
uncertain, anti-smoking advocates greeted the court's announcement
Monday with relief. Matthew Myers, executive vice president of the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the court's decision to take
the case ``has to be interpreted as an appreciation of the public
health importance of the issues raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a lawyer, said the outcome may well be determined by
whether the case strikes the justices as ``about an agency that
reached out for authority it was never given or about an industry
seeking to be rewarded for decades of hiding the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine states filed a brief urging the justices to hear the
administration's appeal. They said that despite last year's
multi-state settlement, the federal agency's regulations ``address
matters that cannot be effective addressed by the states alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the regulations, the terms of the settlement contain
specific provisions aimed at smoking by minors, but the FDA
regulation had broader restrictions on outdoor signs, other
advertising, and certain retail practices, including limits on
vending machines, self-service sales, and coupon redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Citizen Discrimination
</P>
<P>
   The court granted a second case Monday, agreeing to decide
whether a Reconstruction-era civil rights law bars discrimination
against non-citizens in the making of private contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The lower federal courts have been dispute on the question for
years, and the justices' effort to decide it four years ago was
thwarted when the parties settled a case the court had agreed to
decide. United Brotherhood of Carpenters vs. Anderson, No. 98-958,
is an appeal by a labor union that dismissed its business manager,
a legal immigrant from Jamaica, because he was not a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled last
year that the man was entitled to bring a discrimination suit under
the federal law known as Section 1981, which guarantees to ``all
persons'' the same right to make and enforce contracts ``as is
enjoyed by white citizens.'' While that law, derived from the Civil
Rights Act of 1866, clearly applies to race, the question is
whether it also bars discrimination against aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Congress revisited the law and strengthened its
protections to overturn a Supreme Court decision that had narrowed
it. Among other things, Congress made clear that the law barred
private as well as state-sponsored discrimination. But Congress did
not address the question of the law's application to citizenship in
the first place. This case was evidently the subject of unusual
behind-the-scenes activity among the justices, who considered what
to do with it at eight successive closed-door conferences before
issuing Monday's order.

NEWS ANALYSIS: CHINESE PROTESTERS ARE HARD TO DEFINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The most amazing thing about the well-organized
protest that occurred here on Sunday was the ease with which more
than 10,000 followers of a religious sect materialized at the door
of China's leadership and then vanished.
</P>
<P>
   To the authorities, who are nervous about any unsanctioned
gathering, it can only be deeply unsettling that so many people
assembled without warning, essentially walking up to the secretive
compound where China's leaders live and work, and sitting silently
for an entire day.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike student protesters who noisily thronged the streets of
Beijing with colorful banners and pungent slogans 10 years ago,
Sunday's demonstrators drew no attention to themselves and
attracted no notice until there were suddenly many thousand of them
sitting quietly in one of the most politically sensitive locations
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They looked like ordinary people from different parts of China,
which they were. Here lies a puzzle _ and for China's leaders, the
scariest thing about the protest.
</P>
<P>
   As followers of a sect of qigong (pronounced chee-goong), a
traditional Chinese teaching that human energy can be cultivated by
yoga-like disciplines and directed to improve one's own health, to
heal others and, when mastered, to achieve powers like flying, the
protesters represent an amorphous and hard-to-control body that is
deeply confident and far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming majority of Chinese believe in qigong to some
extent, making it hard to know exactly who belongs to the sect
called Buddhist Law, which carried out the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law, led by a qigong master named Li Hongzhi, claims to
have more than 100 million followers. Even if that is an
exaggeration, the government's estimate of 70 million adherents
represents a large group in a nation of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Chinese history, mysticism has played a critical role
in times of political turmoil, attracting adherents confused by
sudden changes in society and becoming explosively violent when the
authorities act to suppress them.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts the potential strength of such a sect need
only have witnessed the protest Sunday, when the followers seemed
to appear from nowhere, sitting immobile and silent on sidewalks in
the heart of Beijing. Even if efforts by many of them to direct
mystical energy at the leadership compound fell short, their
impressive organization left a significant imprint on Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting a demonstration in this city is no easy trick.
Plainclothes police and informers are everywhere, keeping an eye
out for any hint of organized protest. Even lone protesters who
tried to unfurl banners on the street during a meeting of China's
legislature last month were whisked away, usually within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing returned to normal Monday, as the police tightened
security outside the leadership compound, blocking pedestrians from
the street where China's leaders come and go from their compound,
Zhongnanhai.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhu Rongji met several representives of the sect on
Sunday, and directed government officials Monday to form a clear
strategy to handle the group's complaints, The Associated Press
reported. The state-run media remained silent about the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders are in a bind: Acting decisively against a
qigong sect clearly risks a greater counterreaction; allowing large
protests is an invitation to other kinds of demonstrations,
including the overtly political.
</P>
<P>
   The government position has so far remained ambiguous. Hundreds
of sects of qigong have flourished in recent years as China has
become a less regimented society. While officials approve of
harmless health exercises, they are alarmed at the appearance of
popular qigong masters, some of whom fool followers with crass
get-rich-quick schemes, while others like Li command fervent
followers who believe their sect is morally superior to any other
organization, including the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has never banned qigong and other bodybuilding
activities,'' said a spokeman for China's State Council. ``It is
understandable that there are different views and opinions. They
should be expressed through proper channels.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Buddhist Law, founded by Li in 1992, mixes traditional Chinese
teaching with Buddhism and Taoism to urge its followers to be good
citizens by leading a moral life, not to smoke or drink or have
sexual relations outside marriage, and to resist the consumerism
that has swept China.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's protest was apparently set off by an incident in
Tianjin, where practitioners staged a protest last week after a
local magazine ran an article maligning Buddhist Law and the police
used force to drive away followers.
</P>
<P>
   The group decided that the time had come to demand that the
central government clarify its stand on qigong sects so that the
group can practice legally, protesters said. They also want the
authorities to ease restrictions on publishing books of Buddhist
Law teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands sound innocuous. Yet because Buddhist Law commands
such a huge following, and has now shown that it can execute
well-organized and disciplined demonstrations, it must cause deep
concern to Chinese leaders.

COMMENTARY: JUDGMENT NOT INCLUDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Articles about the shootings at Columbine High School contained
two sets of initials you don't often see together: NRA and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   That the NRA, the National Rifle Association, should feel guilty
about the Columbine massacres goes without saying. The idea that
two high school kids were able to amass an arsenal that included an
Intratec fingerprint-resistant, high-volume assault weapon; a
Hi-Point 9-millimeter carbine; a sawed-off pump-action shotgun, and
a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun should make anyone who opposes
gun control ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   But what about AOL, America Online, the Internet provider that
housed the warped Web site of Eric Harris, one of the presumed
student gunmen? According to The New York Times' reporting, the AOL
Web postings attributed to Harris included instructions on how to
build pipe bombs (``shrapnel is very important''), an illustration
of a creature toting a shotgun and a knife while standing on a pile
of skulls, and the song lyrics: ``What I don't do I don't like.
What I don't like I waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Should we be as worried about the Internet as the Intratec?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is no. AOL is not the equivalent of the NRA _
but that doesn't quite end the matter. Here's why: Assault weapons
have only one purpose, and that is to kill other human beings. The
Internet, alas, is everything and its opposite. It can be an
incredible knowledge tool and an incredible microphone for hate. It
can be a place where grieving Columbine students can come together
to comfort one another and a place where a student outcast can
nurse his grievances, research his revenge and find encouragement
from neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But precisely because the Internet is such a neutral, free, open
and unregulated technology it means that we are all connected, but
no one is in charge. The Internet is democracy, but with no
constitution. It is Orwellian in the way it can connect us all, but
with no Big Brother watching over us all. And therefore personal
judgment and responsibility are critical when using this
technology. The only filter is the one you bring in your own head
or your own heart, and since kids often lack the judgment
microchip, it is even more critical that parents and educators
provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some of those closest to this technology get it the
best. After Columbine I called Steve Case, the CEO of America
Online. I expected to hear him say: ``AOL has nothing to do with
this story. Goodbye.'' But he was clearly wrestling with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I share the outrage that everyone feels about this incident,''
said Case, ``and to the extent that there is an Internet connection
_ finding information about bomb-making or whatever _ it is
alarming and troubling. This is especially hard for me because I
have spent most of my life building a medium that I want to be used
for the better. But the Internet empowers people in ways that were
not possible with television or newspapers. With these
broadcast-type media there was a producer or an editor making
decisions for the audience _ deciding what they should see or hear.
That simplified things, and it also deprived the audience of the
full range of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changes that by giving people unlimited choices and
unlimited power to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they have more choices,'' Case argued, ``they have more
responsibility to show good judgment. We can't unilaterally impose
that judgment, and we shouldn't try. But we can try to offer
certain tools like technological filters, and educate parents about
them and encourage them to take some responsibility here. The same
attention that parents should pay to what their kids watch on
television, or how they use the telephone, has to be paid with the
Internet, only more so, because this is an interactive technology
with no editor. Instead of us trying to be the all-powerful censor,
we are trying to encourage parents to take control of the
dashboard. Technology can be a useful tool, but it can't be a
replacement for caring, involved parents.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, if we are all connected and no one is in
charge in cyberspace, then cultivating citizens in the schoolyard
or the backyard becomes that much more important. The more the
Internet makes us all broadcasters, all researchers, all consumers
and, alas, all potential bomb makers, the more critical it is that
our teachers, parents and communities are still making us all
citizens.

WHAT IS IMPORTANT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a wonder the substantive business of the
nation gets done. It really is.
</P>
<P>
   It has ever been thus, although it does seem that inertia and
cowardice have increased with the intense partisan polarization
that characterizes modern American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is full of wimps who steadfastly refuse to face the
crucial issues of the day until public demand becomes so urgent
that they are forced to act.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is not much better, preferring small pleasant
themes to the overarching tough issues that might actually make a
historic difference in our lives. His own political standing is too
fragile to take on Republican congressional leaders in a big way
and get by with it.
</P>
<P>
   We are seeing this stalemate now, as the White House and both
the House and Senate duck grave national questions that cry out for
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Reform of Social Security, listed as everyone's priority only a
month ago, has just been declared dead for this congressional year
by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. He blames Clinton for not
taking the lead. Clinton blames the GOP-controlled Congress for not
even coming up with a plan. And so it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control, a festering problem complicated by huge National
Rifle Association contributions to key members of Congress, jumped
back in the public eye after the Littleton, Colo., high school
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has refused to pass even such a minimal restriction as
mandated child safety locks on all guns sold, although public
resistance is steadily growing to the NRA's inflexible insistence
on putting more firearms in the hands of more people. For all the
renewed concern about violence and the proliferation of guns, a
sudden congressional epiphany on this subject is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also dithering about our role in the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia to drive President Slobodan Milosevic's troops out of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Individual members are happy to second-guess the
administration's handling of the crisis, but none have any
remarkable solutions of their own to offer. The criticism falls
into two simplistic categories, neither original nor useful:
Appease the Serbian monster or send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   As an institution, Congress has the right and responsibility to
formally approve or disapprove of the war against Yugoslavia. The
War Powers Act makes it imperative that the legislative branch be
consulted. On the eve of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Congress
voted after heated debate to authorize the military action.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the House nor Senate leadership is eager for an official
showdown this time. That would put their votes where their mouths
are and would be politically dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, however, House Speaker Dennis Hastert has
reluctantly agreed to a vote this week on resolutions that offer a
smorgasbord of legislative choices, from demanding that U.S. forces
withdraw to declaring war on Yugoslavia. Whatever the outcome, the
impact of this toothless display is not going to change NATO
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   On a lesser scale, campaign finance reform is also too tough for
the easy legislative ``out'' box. It's one thing to tut-tut about
the evils of gross gobs of campaign money and quite another to
close off an easy avenue of raising it. Neither party wants to give
it up, the public is indifferent, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   So what are our elected representatives doing to earn their
keep? Not much, actually.
</P>
<P>
   They want us to know, however, they are standing firm against an
unspeakable horror that threatens to unravel the very fabric of the
republic: flag-burning.
</P>
<P>
   They are against flag-burning. Wow. Bravery against a
nonexistent enemy. For this they are paid $136,700 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittees in both the Senate and House held hearings
recently on a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban and
criminalize the desecration of the Stars and Stripes. This
amendment is flying along with the speed of a Stealth aircraft,
invisible to enemy radar and fueled up for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was approved in both panels and seems headed for
full committee passage in both houses. We have been around this
barn before _ several times.
</P>
<P>
   The House twice approved it in the past. The Senate vote four
years ago fell three votes short. It has not been brought up there
again because it still narrowly lacked the two-thirds majority
required. But changes in the Senate's party makeup this year may
have improved chances of passage.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing is an irrationally emotional fake. The Supreme
Court has ruled that flag-burning is a constitutionally protected
freedom of political speech. And in 208 years those safeguards in
the Bill of Rights have been regarded as so crucial to democracy
that they have never been amended.
</P>
<P>
   The demand to tinker with the First Amendment over an act that
poses no danger to the republic is irresponsible. If there have
been more than a handful of flag-burnings in the past decade,
nobody knows about them. Burning the flag was a popular
demonstration of rage against the Vietnam War, but that war has
been over for a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   The American flag symbolizes our national identity. But it is a
sturdy emblem, not a fragile flower. Irreverent replicas appear
imprinted on shirts, jackets, tablecloths, napkins and in
self-serving commercials. The flag has retained its dignity
throughout. Never fear. It will keep flying.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should leave the flag, and the Constitution, alone.

   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ Thirty refueling airplanes will
be sent immediately to Europe and reservists will be called up as
early as Tuesday to staff them, the Pentagon announced Monday. The
Pentagon also announced it was constructing a refugee camp in
western Albania to house the 20,000 Kosovar Albanians who were
originally to be sent to Guantanamo base in Cuba. The camp in Fier,
Albania will be able to house 2,500 refugees as early as next week.

   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ As a high ranking American envoy
arrived in Moscow for talk over Kosovo, Igor Ivanov, Russia's
foreign minister, said Monday that NATO, as well as Belgrade, would
have to bend if the conflict was to be brought to an end. In an
interview, Ivanov insisted that progress was being made on two
fronts: the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and an
international force to police a settlement. By Michael R. Gordon.

<P>
   KOSOVO-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Republicans are preparing to add
$5 billion to $7 billion in Pentagon programs to President
Clinton's emergency request for $6 billion in spending on the
Balkans, key members of Congress said Monday. Seeking to make
President Clinton's performance as commander-in-chief a political

   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ A Yugoslav deputy prime minister,
Vuk Draskovic, vowed to lead street protests against President
Slobodan Milosevic if military control over Belgrade's Studio B
television station is not lifted immediately. Draskovic, the most
liberal member of the weak federal government, said a military

International Committee of the Red Cross has found 276 children who
arrived here with no adult relatives. They are now in the care of
strangers, and aid workers have posted photographs of lost children
in refugee camps here hoping parents will come forward. Another 600
parents are searching desperately for missing children. By David

   KOSOVO-RAPE (Skopje, Macedonia) _ Her tormentor told her she was
chosen for her beauty. But it is her determination that sets her

ethnic Albanian women willing to say openly that they were sexually
assaulted by Serb soldiers during the chaotic exodus from Kosovo.

   KOSOVO-EUROPE (Berlin) _ A month of war in Europe has already

<P>
   KOSOVO-OIL (Undated) _ NATO's anticipated oil embargo on
Yugoslavia is certain to be tested by adventurous oil suppliers
from Russia, China, Greece, Macedonia and Western Europe, all eager

   TEL AVIV, Israel _ As a young commando, Ehud Barak placed a
woman's wig on his head, squeezed into high heels and stuffed an
oversized purse with explosives as he set off on a derring-do _ and
ultimately successful _ mission to eliminate a Palestinian
terrorist cell in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years later, wearing pants, Barak, 57, the Labor
Party candidate for prime minister, poured himself an Israeli
Goldstar beer and misquoted Robert Frost to sum up his new formula
for dealing with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``High fences make good neighbors,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Barak does not wholeheartedly embrace
the idea of a Palestinian state, that he does not, in his words,
``dream about it at night.'' That would represent too radical an
evolution for Barak, a former general and the most decorated
soldier in Israeli history.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the mold of the late Yitzhak Rabin, Barak is a kind of
hawkish dove whose animosity toward the Palestinians has dissipated
over the decades. He speaks with empathy for their plight, with
respect for their sovereignty, and with an unblinking pragmatism.
The Palestinian state is inevitable, he said, a ``de facto
phenomenon,'' and it is ``not up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I focus on the security of Israel,'' he said. ``I assume that
Palestinians will take care of their interests. We don't have to
intervene with their decisions about stamps and passports and so
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Barak was as loose and engaging as he is
tight and lackluster on the public stage.
</P>
<P>
   Election Day is May 17, and Barak is slightly ahead of the
incumbent prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a five-way race.
An expected runoff, which is likely to be Barak and Netanyahu, the
conservative Likud Party candidate, is scheduled for June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Cherub-cheeked and short-necked, Barak is not photogenic, and he
reluctantly allows makeup to be applied in the service of his
campaign. At rallies, he waves stiffly and hammers his talking
points. But in person he is at ease, his hands fly freely, chopping
through the air, crashing down on his desk, and he is not willing
to corral himself.
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to engage in a long, humorous, muddled metaphor
about the Middle East as an aquarium, ending with a high-pitched,
``Who is the carp here? Who is the carp?'' he does so. If he wants
to go ``off the record'' to talk about a rocket re-entering the
earth's atmosphere, he does that too.
</P>
<P>
   A brainy, complex and irreverent man, Barak is not a natural
candidate. His expansive discourses do not boil down easily into
sound bites. What those close to him perceive as decency can come
across as dullness. His relaxed self-confidence can be taken as
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak, who holds a master's degree in economic engineering
systems from Stanford University, is not typical. Few politicians,
when they first encounter a Teleprompter, examine it and conclude
that it could be better made, as he did, according to Bob Shrum,
one of his American political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Also, to some critics, Barak, who holds strong, colorful
opinions, can seem fuzzy as he tries hard not to be boxed as what
he is: the kibbutz-born, classical piano-playing leader of the
left.
</P>
<P>
   In the peculiar dynamic of Israel, the left, embodied by Labor,
is the political home of the Ashkenazi elite, including business
leaders and, traditionally, generals. The right, embodied by Likud,
is the home of the working-class, the immigrants and outsiders. Yet
polls show that most Israelis consider themselves to be in the
center, and so Barak, Netanyahu and a third candidate, former
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, are all trying hard not to be
so opinionated that they alienate the vast middle.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, presenting himself as part of a worldwide trend, casts
himself in the image of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and Gerhard
Schroeder _ as the leader of a political movement that is finding
its way from left to center.
</P>
<P>
   But as Barak leans toward the center, Netanyahu tries to push
himself leftward in the public eye. The prime minister's new
television commercials, which ran Monday night, portrayed Barak's
face with the face of Yossi Beilin, the Labor member most widely
known as a leftist, repeatedly popping out from behind him.
</P>
<P>
   To play down Labor, Barak created a new movement for this
campaign, called One Israel and portrayed in new commercials as a
melting pot of faces. For the moment, One Israel includes Labor,
the Gesher party, the Sephardic party of former Foreign Minister
David Levy and Meimad, a moderate religious party (whose members
Barak undiplomatically called ``less fanatical zealots'').
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he hopes One Israel will be a ``bandwagon,'' allowing
him to forge the broadest possible coalition without sharing power,
and diluting his principles, in a unity government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already now heads of Likud branches joining us,'' he
said. ``Even some of the settlers are behind me. I know them very
intimately since I ran the command that controls Judea and Samaria.
They trust me more than they trust Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Barak's assessment were true, Pinchas Wallerstein, who
heads an organization representing Jewish settlers in the West
Bank, sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you say `oy vey' in English?'' he asked. ``It is true
we trust him a lot. If he were running alone, without the other
left, he'd have maybe 20 percent or more of the settlers. But given
he's married to some real leftists, you can count the settler votes
on only one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Building on that perception, Netanyahu is trying to paint Barak
as an unrepentant leftist, barely distinguishable from predecessor
at the helm of the Labor Party, Shimon Peres. Barak, though, does
what he can to avoid being tarred by the same brush as Peres, under
whom he served as foreign minister; in his offices, his picture
stands beside that of Rabin, and Peres, now No. 2 in the party, is
noticeably absent from the walls.
</P>
<P>
   From the left, Barak is charged with failing to differentiate
himself strongly from his opponents. Asked if he felt his message
was muddled or diluted, Barak said, ``No. I feel very clear, more
than any Israeli leader in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the strong stance he has taken in the cultural war
between religious and secular _ or less observant _ Israelis. He
said he was not afraid, like other politicians, of challenging the
ultra-Orthodox by standing up for the rights of Reform and
Conservative Jews; by pushing for the rights of Russian immigrants
whom the chief rabbis do not recognize as Jewish; and by proposing
the conscription into the army of ultra-Orthodox yeshiva boys, who
are automatically exempted for Torah study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should equally bear the burden,'' Barak said. ``It's a
moral question. It's not against the religious. What the hell is
the story? I read in Maimonides that the groom should come out from
under the huppah,'' or wedding canopy, ``to help Israel defend
itself. So why the hell a guy cannot on a normal sunny day, go by
foot from Bnei Brak, walk 900 yards to the computer center in Ramat
Gan, and enlist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I served in uniform for 35 years, and I can tell you frankly
that we don't need F-15 pilots out of the yeshiva buchers,'' or
boys, he said. ``We are not going to end up drafting many of them.
Still, it's the principle. The very shadow cast by my initiative
will shape their readiness to negotiate.''

 TEL AVIV, Israel: to negotiate.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Russian immigrants, who consider themselves Jewish but are
not considered Jewish under religious law, cannot marry here _
intermarriages are not performed _ or be buried in state
cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he is considering many ways to ease their dilemma,
including eliminating the ``nationality'' category, which is really
a religious or ethnic identification category, from Israeli
identification cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every citizen should feel at home whether he's a Jew or
Christian or Muslim,'' Barak said. ``Why are we distinguishing
between people on the ID cards?''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last 15 years, the Interior Ministry, which
controls the identification cards, has been in the hands of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, whose leader, Aryeh Deri, a former
Interior Minister, was recently convicted of corruption charges.
Following his sentencing, Barak announced that if elected he would
take the Interior Ministry from Shas and put it under the control
of a Russian immigrant party.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly electioneering. Russians immigrants, while
generally conservative, nonetheless represent a critical bloc of
potential swing votes in a country where people tend to be born
either Labor or Likud. Barak ordered all calls during the interview
to be held except for those from his wife, Nava, or from a Russian
radio station _ ``our most precious electorate,'' he called their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   As he was talking about the great potential for Israel to become
a leading society, Barak grew mesmerized by the tape recorder
before him. ``It works well, huh?'' he said, after a pause. ``It's
Japanese. It should.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A key theme of Barak's campaign is that Israel under Netanyahu
is ``stuck.'' The first thing to come unstuck, Barak said, would be
the most recent peace agreement with the Palestinians, negotiated
at the Wye Plantation in Maryland last fall. He said he would try
to return more land quickly to the Palestinians, even though he
finds himself ``in pain just thinking of giving up some of these
pieces of ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak volunteered that security analysts believe the freeze in
the peace process has helped reduce terrorism, specifically suicide
attacks by Islamic fundamentalists opposed to making peace with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading that in a simple way,'' he said, ``might lead to the
conclusion that it's better not to pursue peace. But I think if we
don't, at a certain point, the violence would erupt like a volcano.
It could lead us back not just to the point where Rabin was
assassinated but back a few generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he would also immediately reopen negotiations with
the Syrians, and resume the thorny final status talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes a ``physical separation'' from the Palestinians,
without which, he said he fears that Israel would end up ``a
binational state or an apartheid state.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls for what he describes as ``four security red lines'': a
united Jerusalem under Israel's sovereignty; no return to 1967
borders; no modern armed forces west of the Jordan River; and the
consolidation of Jewish settlers in the West Bank into several
large blocs under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he hoped the Palestinians and the Jordanians would
forge a confederation, Barak said that he was happy to hear they
were considering it ``since we cannot patronize their judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Haaretz newspaper published Monday,
Barak said he would consider retaining the portfolio of Defense
Minister to oversee the sensitive negotiations. The announcement
was analyzed as a possible jab at Mordechai, the natural candidate
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his candidacy that will almost certainly force the
elections into a runoff, and Barak has been negotiating with
Mordechai to withdraw from the race and join forces with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of energy to go into a runoff when we could join
hands and win the first one,'' Barak said. ``It gives Netanyahu
another two weeks to manipulate. And it might turn the election
into a kind of Middle Eastern bazaar, about who will be able to
seduce or bribe more effectively some small parties to line up
behind him.''

JUSTICES TO HEAR ANTI-BIAS IMMIGRANT CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide
whether a 19th-century civil rights law prohibits discrimination
against immigrants in the awarding of private employment contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The justices and lower federal courts have long held that the
law prohibits discrimination against blacks. But the high court has
never addressed whether the statute, Section 1981 of the 1870 Civil
Rights Act, bars private employers from discriminating based on
immigrant status.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to hear the case this fall or early
next year and render their decision by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose five years ago, when the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners of America fired Linden Anderson, a Jamaican
citizen living in the United States, from his position as a
business representative for the union. The group's constitution
prohibited non-U.S. or non-Canadian citizens from serving as
business representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson sued, claiming he was dismissed in violation of Section
1981. The U.S. District Court for Southern New York dismissed the
case, ruling that the federal law prohibits discrimination based on
race, not immigrant status.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that
the statute protects immigrants as well as racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In successfully urging the justices to hear its appeal, the
union argued that Congress enacted Section 1981 in the aftermath of
the Civil War to protect the newly freed black slaves from
discrimination. The law was not intended to protect immigrants, the
carpenters' group said.
</P>
<P>
   The union also said that Congress subsequently passed the
Immigration Reform and Control Act to protect immigrants from
discrimination, an indication that the 1870 law provided them no
safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government, with Congress' blessing,
discriminates against immigrants in hiring insofar as federal
civil-service regulations state that a ``person may be admitted to
competitive examination only if he is a citizen of or owes
permanent allegiance to the United States,'' the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, in his unsuccessful request that the justices reject
the union's appeal, argued that Section 1981 does prohibit
discrimination against immigrants in private contracts.

FDA APPROVES NEW TYPE OF ANTI-OBESITY DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Until now, Americans looking for a pill to help
them lose weight have had only one option: appetite suppressants.
That changed on Monday, when the Food and Drug Administration
approved the first in a new class of anti-obesity drugs that work
by blocking the body's absorption of dietary fat, as opposed to
tricking the brain into ignoring hunger.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, orlistat, by Hoffman-LaRoche of Nutley N.J., was
approved for seriously overweight people who meet the federal
government's definition of obese _ 30 percent overweight _ and for
people who are 20 percent overweight and have high blood pressure,
high cholesterol or diabetes, conditions that are exacerbated by
obesity. At five feet five inches tall, a person would weigh 180
pounds and 160 pounds, respectively, to fit those criteria.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors will be able to prescribe orlistat for anyone, and
experts said on Monday that the midnight blue colored capsules,
which will appear on pharmacy shelves in the next few weeks under
the trade name Xenical, might soon become a familiar fixture in the
medicine cabinets of millions of Americans. It will not be cheap:
the drug is recommended for use three times a day, for periods of a
year or longer, and the company says it expect to charge around
$1.10 per capsule.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overestimate the interest of Americans in losing
weight, said Dr. David F. Williamson of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, an epidemiologist who studies diabetes and
who has written about the drug. ``I predict a brisk trade in this
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts were quick to say that orlistat is hardly a panacea for
obesity, and in clinical trials the drug helped obese people lose
only modest amounts of weight. In one year of taking the drug, most
patients experienced weight loss ranging from 5 percent to 10
percent of their initial body weight, the company said. And that
was in combination with a reduced calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a magic bullet,'' said Dr. Eric Colman, the FDA
medical officer who reviewed the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Although some weight loss experts said on Monday that they were
eager to begin prescribing orlistat, especially in combination with
approved appetite suppressants, others criticized the agency's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry this drug was approved,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an
obesity expert at Rockefeller University in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drug is on the market in 17 countries, and has been
prescribed to 1 million people worldwide, an agency advisory panel
of independent experts split 5-5 last year on the question of
whether the drug should be marketed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drug caused a four percent difference in body weight
between placebo and the drug itself,'' said Hirsch, who served on
the panel and voted against approval. ``That means a 200 pound
person might lose eight pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, reported in January in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, patients who took orlistat and
followed a weight loss diet for one year lost an average of 19.3
pounds, while those who followed the same diet and took a dummy
pill lost 12.8 pounds. And after the year was up, some of those
taking orlistat began to put on weight even as they continued to
take the drug. It was not known what the long-term effects of
taking the drug would be.
</P>
<P>
   In seven clinical trials involving more than 7,000 patients
worldwide, those who took orlistat also showed ``measurable
improvements'' in high blood pressure, high cholesterol and
diabetes, Hoffman-LaRoche said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hirsch said the changes ``were very small, and we are not
assured that such small changes are necessarily beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlistat works in the gastrointestinal tract, blocking an enzyme
that is needed to digest fat. Instead of being digested, a third of
the fat a person eats will accumulate in the intestines and be
excreted in the stool. But by blocking fat absorption, the drug
also blocks absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K,
as well as beta-carotene, and so patients must take daily vitamin
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, orlistat can cause unpleasant side effects, like
bloating, flatulence, oily stool, diarrhea and fecal incontinence,
that tend to discourage patients from eating fatty foods. Some have
described it as ``the Antabuse of weight loss,'' referring to the
drug for alcoholism that makes people ill when they drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``If patients eat a big fat meal _ a pizza and a milkshake _
they will pay for it in a day or two,'' said Dr. Richard Atkinson,
professor of medicine and nutritional sciences at the University of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some lingering fears about whether the drug might
be linked to breast cancer. In data Hoffman-LaRoche submitted to
the food and drug agency last year, women who took orlistat
experienced slightly more breast cancer than those who did not. But
an agency official said on Monday that additional data submitted by
the company have convinced the agency that the risk of breast
cancer was ``not a real concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlistat is the second diet drug to receive the food and drug
agency's imprimatur since July 1997, when fenfluramine and its
close cousin, dexfenfluramine, were removed from the market. Those
drugs, along with with another drug, phentermine, were hailed as a
diet panacea and clinics sprang up around the country to prescribe
the combination, known as fen-phen. But fenfluramine and
dexfenfluramine were later withdrawn from the market amid concerns
that they caused heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   The other approved drug, sibutramine, sold under the trade name
Meridia, is an appetite suppressant made by Knoll Pharmaceuticals
of Mount Olive, N.J., a division of BASF. Sibutramine was approved
for sale in November 1997 and became available in February 1998.
More than 800,000 people have been prescribed the drug in the
United States, a company spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Because orlistat and Meridia have two different mechanisms of
action, some weight loss experts said on Monday that they were
likely to prescribe the drugs in combination with one another, even
though they had never been tested that way.

3 CAPTURED AMERICANS APPEAR TO BE SOUND, RED CROSS OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Mich.)  (With Kosovo package) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Three American soldiers, captured by
Yugoslav forces a month ago, appeared to be in good condition
Monday during a brief visit by the president of the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelio Sommaruga, the Red Cross official, said he had a short,
normal conversation with the three men in the presence of Yugoslav
authorities. He refused to comment on their condition, saying that
a full visit by a Red Cross doctor would take place on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a White House spokesman was more forthcoming after American
officials were briefed by the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is good news that they appear in good condition,''
the spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said in Washington. ``I emphasize the
word `appear,' because they were not able to speak privately or
have doctors examine the three.''
</P>
<P>
   The men were shown on Yugoslav television with bruised faces and
cuts immediately after their capture on March 31 near the
Macedonian border. Yugoslav officials said then, a week after the
NATO bombing campaign began, that the three had resisted capture.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross had previously been denied access to the soldiers
_ Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Spc. Steven
Gonzalez, 21, of Huntsville, Texas; and Staff Sgt. Christopher
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the occasion to see them and shake their hands and I had
a short talk with all three,'' Sommaruga said at a news conference
Monday. ``But further than that,'' he said, ``I really cannot say.
I had no knowledge of what they feel. I had no doctor with me to
analyze their health.'' He did not specify where the meeting on
Monday took place, but it was believed to be somewhere near
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Sommaruga had a separate meeting with the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, who authorized the visit, to seek permission
for the Red Cross to resume relief work in Kosovo and throughout
Yugoslavia. The government in Belgrade has been reluctant to allow
any foreigners free access to Kosovo, where many thousands of
Albanians have fled or have been driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Television showed the two men meeting in a rustic office,
sitting on worn armchairs and a sofa, clearly not the usual
reception room Milosevic uses in the Beli Dvor, or White Palace,
which is his ceremonial residence. The meeting was believed to have
taken place in Milosevic's country residence at Dobanovci. But
given the stormy, cold weather here, which made a rural weekend
uninviting, it also appeared to indicate that Milosevic, whose
Belgrade residence was bombed by NATO last week, is altering his
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic told Sommaruga that the only obstacle to Red Cross
access is the danger posed by NATO bombing, according to the
official news agency, Tanjug. ``In an open conversation, referring
to important humanitarian problems caused by NATO bombing,
Milosevic said that the Yugoslav side imposed no obstacles for
International Red Cross teams to operate on the whole territory of
Yugoslavia,'' Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said, according to Tanjug, ``The only obstacle could
be the continuous bombing of civilian facilities, which was the
reason why people in Kosovo had fled their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommaruga said later: ``I was glad to establish, and get
assurances at the highest level, that we would receive full
assistance from the federal government in carrying out our programs
without difficulties, particularly as to the delivery of
humanitarian goods.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said his staff would have to sit down and discuss
security arrangements both with the Yugoslav army and with NATO in
order to work safely in Yugoslavia, particularly in the Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not immediately clear whether the Red Cross would have
access to Kosovo, or how soon. Refugees cannot return, Milosevic
said, as long as the bombing continued.
</P>
<P>
   Sommaruga said he was not optimistic that the three soldiers
would be released before the war ended. ``International
humanitarian law says prisoners of war would be liberated only at
the end of active hostilities,'' he said. ``Regrettably, we are not
at this point at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the American politician and minister, is
hoping to come to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic and to try to
secure the release of the soldiers. Jackson, who is a confidant and
emissary of President Clinton, has organized a group of
Serbian-American clergy, Muslim clerics and rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said the Americans they are holding had
strayed into Yugoslav territory when they were captured and would
be treated as prisoners of war. American officials at first
insisted that the men were kidnapped from Macedonian territory,
then said they were unsure, but demanded their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier effort to secure their release by a Greek Cypriot
politician failed.

 &HT;    A&AMP;P to close stores in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A&AMP;P confirmed Monday it is closing or selling all of
its stores in metro Atlanta. The grocery chain has agreements to
sell 14 of its 34 stores here and will close the remaining 20 by
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., which operates stores here as
A&AMP;P, will also close its distribution center and administrative
office in Atlanta. About 2,000 employees will lose their jobs, said
A&AMP;P spokesman Andy Carrano. Eligible full-time employees will
receive severance pay, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Teeter, which has seven supermarkets in metro Atlanta,
will buy three A&AMP;P stores. Harris Teeter said it expects to close
the deal by June 3, remodel the stores and reopen them early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a memo distributed to A&AMP;P employees on Monday,
Publix Super Markets and Staples Inc. have also expressed interest
in stores. The companies refused to confirm the memo, however. ``We
have not signed anything yet,'' said Publix spokeswoman Rita Owens.
``That's not to say we're not talking to them.'' Staples, a new
player in the Atlanta office supplies superstore market, looked at
some of the A&AMP;P sites but does not intend to buy any, said Staples
spokeswoman Shannon Lapierre.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;P's exit from Atlanta is part of an overall retreat from
competitive cities as the Montvale, N.J.-based parent chain focuses
on its core markets in Detroit, New York and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to achieve a No. 1 or No. 2 market share
position in every market we serve. The Atlanta market is already
highly concentrated and we therefore could not see ourselves
achieving a top position,'' said Christian Haub, A&AMP;P's president
and chief executive. In terms of sales, A&AMP;P is the No. 6 chain in
metro Atlanta, according to the Shelby Report of the Southeast, a
trade newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;P has tried several competitive rallies in Atlanta after
hitting financial trouble in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, A&AMP;P
rolled out its ``Futurestores'' concept to challenge Kroger. At
that point it held a 9 percent market share of metro Atlanta sales,
compared to Kroger's 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But A&AMP;P's chances were squelched in 1992 when Publix entered the
Atlanta scene, snatching a 10 percent market share in a couple of
years with shiny, bigger stores. The metro Atlanta supermarket
competition is now largely defined by Kroger and Publix, which
together have more than half the market share and dominate the
northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;P underinvested in new stores. They failed to make their
stores bigger and add services like the competition did,'' said Tom
Agan, a principal with retail consulting firm Kurt Salmon
Associates. In its new strategy for core markets, Great Atlantic
plans to open up to 200 superstores over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, A&AMP;P's exit is bad news for its shopping center
neighbors because they're largely dependent on the grocery store to
bring in traffic, Agan said. ``A strip center implodes when a
supermarket bails,'' he said. ``The center typically converts from
primary retail to secondary retail and services, like chiropractic
offices or veterinary clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent grocers may pick up some of the A&AMP;P sites, said
Chuck Gilmer, editor of the Shelby Report. ``Some mom-and-pops have
a strategy of going into closed chain operations because they can
get a good lease and lower overhead,'' Gilmer said. Wayfield, which
has 10 Atlanta stores, is a good example, he said. Save-A-Lot,
which features a limited assortment of goods at steep discounts,
has a similar strategy. It currently has two stores in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;P isn't the only chain recently to get run off by Atlanta's
fierce supermarket competition. Bruno's pulled out of Atlanta in
1998, when it sold 13 stores to Ingles. A couple of stores
re-opened as Ingles, while others were sold to Kroger and Cub
Foods.

JUSTICES TO DECIDE WHETHER FDA CAN REGULATE TOBACCO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed to decide Monday whether
the federal government has the authority to regulate cigarettes as
a drug.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to hear an appeal by the Clinton
administration marks a small victory for the president's effort to
discourage children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the strict regulations imposed by the Food and Drug
Administration on the sale and advertising of cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco to minors. Tobacco companies and retailers have
successfully argued that the FDA lacks the statutory authority to
regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Texas joined 38 other states in successfully urging the justices
to hear the president's appeal. The states argued that tobacco
products have imposed enormous health costs on the nation and
should be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Texas settled its lawsuit with tobacco companies in January 1998
for $17.6 billion to recover its Medicaid costs for treating
victims of smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appealed a ruling by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that Congress never intended to give the
FDA authority to regulate their products.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued that the FDA may regulate
tobacco as a drug under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
The FDA concluded that tobacco is a drug after reviewing scientific
evidence showing that the nicotine in tobacco is addictive and acts
as a sedative, stimulant and appetite suppressant, much like other
drugs that the agency regulates.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's controversial regulations prohibit the sale of
cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to anyone younger than 18, require
retailers to check the identification of would-be tobacco buyers
younger than 27, and restrict vending-machine sales of cigarettes
and smokeless tobacco to adult-only locations.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also requires that print ads appear in black and
white, except in adult publications; bans outdoor advertising
within 1,000 feet of schools and public playgrounds; prohibits the
distribution of clothing and other products that bear a tobacco
company logo; and bars tobacco companies from sponsoring of
athletic, cultural or other events under tobacco brand name.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, pressing Clinton's appeal to
the justices, noted that 400,000 people die annually in the United
States from smoking-related diseases. Most of the adults who smoke
began as children, Waxman added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless reversed by this court, the panel's ruling will deprive
the public of an unparalleled opportunity to prevent millions of
children from beginning a highly addictive habit that often leads
to premature death,'' Waxman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies argued that Congress never intended for
the FDA to regulate tobacco. Instead, Congress has passed
regulating legislation that requires the surgeon general's warning
on cigarette cartons and bans smoking on commercial airplanes, the
companies argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, owing to their widespread use, national regional
economic importance, perceived risks, and lack of therapeutic
benefits, tobacco products have long presented public-policy issues
very different from those presented by foods, drugs, medical
devices and cosmetics,'' wrote the companies' lawyer, Richard
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies challenging the FDA include Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., Philip Morris Inc., Lorillard Tobacco
Co., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and United States Tobacco Co.
Joining them were the National Association of Convenience Stores
and the North Carolina Tobacco Distributors Committee Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The high court will hear arguments from the Clinton
administration and tobacco companies in the fall or early next year
and render its decision by July 2000.

 &HT;    Atlanta real estate boom continues
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta could set a record for housing permits this
year and lead the nation, according to projections by a real estate
industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by U.S. Housing Markets newsletter projects that
housing permits here will increase 9 percent, to 62,600, in 1999.
That would also make Atlanta number-one in the nation in permits.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is expected to rank fourth _ behind Texas, Florida and
California _ in total number of new permits. Texas, now the
nation's busiest homebuilding state, might register 175,000 new
permits this year, while Georgia is expected to record 94,000.
</P>
<P>
   The predicted year-over-year percentage increases for both
states are close _ 12 percent for Georgia and 11 percent for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Permits in Florida will reach a 10-year high if the 5 percent
increase expected by U.S. Housing Markets materializes.
</P>
<P>
   Given a robust economy, good job growth, consumer confidence,
low mortgage rates and good weather, ``the housing market is
holding strong cards,'' according to the newsletter.

 &HT;    Brakes put on Mustang museum plans
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A proposed Mustang museum, which had selected Atlanta
as one of two finalists for its site, has hit a wall because of
fund-raising problems.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the board is exploring the option of joining with an
existing museum or attraction to house a Mustang collection.
</P>
<P>
   High costs for real estate, construction and operations for the
proposed $30 million facility _ as well as competition in the
tourism industry _ made a stand-alone museum ``economically
unfeasible,'' officials said. Orlando was the other location under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reopening the site process,'' said William Dillard, a
Calhoun insurance claims specialist and president of Mustang Museum
Inc. ``We have a lot to offer an established automotive museum.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the fund-raising effort would have consumed too
much of enthusiasts' time and energy. ``In the end, we decided we'd
rather devote our passion to the cars, not to fund-raising,''
Dillard added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the museum would fit best with a similar not-for-profit
museum or attraction. He said a number of facilities in Georgia or
the Southeast might be a good fit but declined to single out any of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. has continued its pledge of $1.5 million toward
the project.
</P>
<P>
   A 100,000-square-foot interactive museum and attraction was
planned as a testament to the popular pony car introduced in 1964.
More than 7 million Mustangs have been sold, generating more than
400 Mustang clubs with about 70,000 members worldwide.

FORD ANNOUNCES USED-PARTS SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. intends to become the world's largest
automotive recycler by buying existing recyclers and building its
own auto recycling centers to provide used parts, the company
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford expects the new subsidiary, which has not been named, to
add $1 billion in revenue within a few years by taking apart old
cars and trucks and reselling the parts to body shops, insurers and
consumers. Company officials did not project profits.
</P>
<P>
   Ford bought a recycling company, Copher Brothers Parts, in
Tampa, Fla., in March and is negotiating with other recycling
operations nationwide. Within five years, the company will be
global, Ford officials said. Ford did not provide numbers on how
many recycling businesses would be bought or how many it would
build. The auto maker also refused to disclose the amount of seed
money approved by its board for the business.
</P>
<P>
   The recycling business is also part of Ford's larger plan to be
involved in areas related to a vehicle's life cycle beyond its
development and assembly.
</P>
<P>
   With its Ford Retail Network, the auto maker is consolidating
dealerships in specific geographic areas of the United States and
buying a stake in them. Earlier this month, Ford bought Kwik-Fit,
Europe's largest independent fast-fit repair chain.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of Ford's new business development, Bill Li, 29,
came up with the idea for the recycling company and will be its
chief operating officer. He said huge growth potential existed in
the vehicle recycling business because demand for used parts by
repair shops far exceeds supply.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 10,000 such operations, ranging from small, antiquated
junkyards to large, modern vehicle dismantling operations, exist
nationwide. Most are family owned and are being run by second and
third generations. About 11 million vehicles a year are sent to the
junkyard because they have been damaged in accidents or have
reached the end of their life. About three-quarters of the scrapped
vehicles are recycled or their parts are resold. The rest are
shredded and buried in landfills.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the amount of scrap that goes to landfills, Ford's
goal is to recycle or re-use at least 90 percent of every vehicle,
Li said. In Europe, the law will require nearly all vehicles to be
recycled or reused after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Li said about half of the new company's business would come from
selling used parts _ everything from body panels, doors and lights
to engines and transmissions _ to car dealerships, auto body shops
and auto repair companies. The company eventually intends to link
its recycling centers with its customers through the Internet to
track down used parts. Li said that computer systems did not yet
exist to track parts and that Ford's research showed that repair
shops found the used part they were seeking only about 10 percent
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be like going to the store and finding milk only
one out of 10 visits,'' he said. ``That's unacceptable.'' With an
online inventory of parts, consumers should have to wait less time
for repairs and possibly pay less for parts, he added. Indeed,
insurers often prefer that repairs be made with used parts because
of the lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   As for the recycled materials, Ford and its suppliers likely
will be the biggest customers of the company's recycled metals,
glass and plastics, Li said.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of the recycling subsidiary plays into the
theme of environmental leadership advanced by the company's
chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., and the focus on entrepreneurial
spirit set by its president, Jacques Nasser. Indeed, Li said he got
the idea for the new company last June and presented it to company
executives in September. The first recycling business was bought in
March.

IN EUROPE, TENSIONS AND PATRIOTISM OVER KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A month of war in Europe has already brought deep
changes to the continent, awakening a new sense of European
patriotism, rekindling tensions over ``American imperialism'' and
reviving the sagging fortunes of some leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Raised after World War II to reject military violence but also
to insure that the barbarism of Hitler and Stalin never be
repeated, a generation of Europeans has been abruptly forced by
events in Kosovo to a painful choice between these principles.
</P>
<P>
   In general, they have come down in favor of using military power
to try to stop the ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo and have
increasingly portrayed the fate of the province as a decisive test
of Europe's commitment to a continent freed in the 21st century of
the mass deportations and killings that marked this one.
</P>
<P>
   Ludger Volmer, Germany's deputy foreign minister and a member of
the once pacifist Green Party, said: ``We have to fight for our
Europe where boundaries no longer matter, against old notions of a
Europe of ethnic identity and race-based violence. An integrated
Europe with an open wound in the Balkans is unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unconvincing results of more than four weeks of NATO
bombing and the failure of past appeals to rally to a European
rather than national ideal, such ideas have had a surprising
resonance as image after image of desperate ragged refugees hounded
from Kosovo have filled newspapers and television screens.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of people in Britain, France, Germany and Italy
support the military campaign. A poll last week in France showed 70
percent in favor of the NATO intervention. Support for Gerhard
Schroeder, the German chancellor, has surged as his chief
preoccupation has become war rather than unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such is the popular support that the British and French
governments have felt able to go further than President Clinton in
suggesting the use of ground forces, although the allies' summit
meeting in Washington over the weekend suggested that support for a
land war is limited and that the air campaign will persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be ready to die for Pristina,'' Kosovo's capital,
``because to die for Pristina is to die for the future of Europe,''
said Andre Glucksmann, a leading French philosopher. ``Americans
have died for Europe twice. Now we have to make sacrifices to show
this continent will no longer tolerate policies that recall
Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Europeans have been looking to their own future. Many
see the conflict as a decisive moment for the internal politics of
the continent _ one that could give Europe the political and
military identity it has lacked even as economic ties have
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Images of trainloads of deportees, of stunned refugees with
unseeing eyes, have stirred terrible memories. In a Europe no
longer divided by the Cold War, the images have prompted a
determination to act, and to establish a continent-wide respect for
human rights that will serve as the basis for the Europe of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   But this bold new determination to salvage Europe's pride after
a wounding century, a determination embodied most emphatically in
the oratory of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, is by no means
shared by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   With an American general directing the NATO military campaign,
deep concern or outright anger over European dependency on
Washington and over what some see as America's control over the
post-Cold War world has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Deploring Europe's premature decision to cash in the ``peace
dividend'' and cut military spending, Lamberto Dini, the Italian
foreign minister, said: ``The United States cannot be the gendarmes
of the world, nor the mercenary soldiers for countries that do not
intend to assume military responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In a distinctly anti-American tone, some French intellectuals
have portrayed the war in Kosovo as the latest attempt by
Washington to satisfy the appetites of its military-industrial
complex, undermine Europe and bolster the unilateral power that the
United States has enjoyed since the Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undeclared war in the Balkans is not a war against the
Serbs,'' Guy Declos, a French sociologist, wrote in the French
daily Le Monde. ``It is a war against Europe.'' Disguised as a
fight for a certain morality, it is in reality a struggle to
``stamp out definitively any hope of a multi-polar planet,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such anti-Americanism is not new in France; but its
tone has been sharpened by events in Kosovo, and found strong
echoes among small left-wing European parties, though not with the
dominant center-left forces led by the likes of Blair and the
French premier, Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, it appears that a crisis of European-American
relations has been averted, although one could develop if the
current confusion turned into an irreversible debacle.
</P>
<P>
   A rupture in relations with Russia has also been avoided, and
Western governments now seem determined to back a Russian-led peace
bid because President Boris Yeltsin's influence in Belgrade is
considerable. Whatever the outcome of this diplomacy, concern is
strong, particularly in Germany, that Moscow not be alienated.
</P>
<P>
   After Europe's profound failure in Bosnia, a war the European
Union initially volunteered to stop and much later saw halted by a
``Pax Americana,'' the desire to assert a political and military
identity with a success in Kosovo is strong.
</P>
<P>
   And with the arrival this year of the common European currency,
the euro, the continent has been casting around for some new
catalyst for the political and military integration that has been
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo could be our military euro, creating a political and
defense identity for the European Union in the same way as the euro
is the expression of economic and financial integration,'' said
Ulrich Beck, a professor of politics at Munich University.
</P>
<P>
   But the attainment of a ``military euro'' is evidently a long
way off. A month of bombing has failed to bring any of the results
NATO had sought, and the longer the war continues, the sharper the
tensions in Europe are likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   Volmer, the German deputy minster, said he thought his Green
Party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, would be
unable to accept the dispatch of ground troops if NATO moved in
that direction to break the impasse. ``This could bring down the
German government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens are to hold a congress on May 13 at which they are
likely to vote on this issue. The tensions in the party reflect the
way the conversion of Volmer and of the foreign minister, Joschka
Fischer, to supporting military force against Yugoslavia has by no
means been followed by all members of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Similar tensions may emerge in Italy's coalition government,
where the former Communists are very uneasy about ground forces,
even as the British and French governments push the view that a
long war fought only with air power may risk losing public support.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a war in which the only victims are civilians does not
appear likely to command widespread support indefinitely in a
continent where the idea of ``body bags'' is more acceptable as a
price of war than it is in the United States.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Top of order not sorry to leave April behind
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hidden beneath a heap of runs the Braves offense has
been scoring is a bad vibe at the top of the order. Leadoff hitter
Otis Nixon has had another rough April and No. 2 man Bret Boone has
been the unlucky hitter in the Braves order.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is hitting .170 and Boone is hitting .235 and together
that adds up to a .206 batting average and an on-base percentage of
.290, which is not the kind of setting up that will keep this
offense chugging.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is figuring he just needs to get out of April, a month in
which he's hitting .232 in his career. That and as hitting coach
Don Baylor is suggesting, don't be in such a hurry to get out of
the batter's box as he finishes his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants me to keep the ball out of the air,'' Nixon said.
``As long as I can keep hitting hard groundballs, I'll be OK...I've
played long enough to know what's going to happen, to trust
yourself, stay within yourself and you'll be all right. You play
good defense and manufacture some runs and it's as good as getting
a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon has still found ways to be productive, like on Sunday when
he reached twice an error, stole two bases and scored a run and in
Tuesday's game in L.A. when he drew a pair of bases loaded walks.
</P>
<P>
   Boone has been the bad luck hitter of the order, starting the
first couple days of the season. It's resurfaced lately, like in
the 5-4 April 20 loss in L.A., when with Gerald Williams at third
base, Boone would have tied the game had his line drive been just
about anywhere but right at third baseman Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   So Boone's not making any big adjustments at the plate, he's
just trying to stay patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know with this approach (at the plate) and if I continue to
work, it's just a matter of time,'' Boone said. ``It's hard, but
I'm not going to walk around moping. It happens to everybody. It
just so happened to me it happened at the start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury Update
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones missed his first start of the year on Monday with
a strained adductor muscle in his left thigh, which he injured
running from first to third on an error in Sunday's game. Keith
Lockhart replaced him at third base Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I improve as much between today and tomorrow as I did
yesterday to today, I can play, but I can't do anything today,''
Jones said before Monday's game. ``Yesterday I was about 40-50
percent. Today I'm probably 70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko said he's nearly ready after being out for almost
two weeks with a high hamstring pull. Manager Bobby Cox wasn't
ready to put him in the lineup on Monday. Klesko's last time in as
a pinch hitter, he pulled up hurt after running out an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be 100 percent probably for another few weeks,''
Klesko said. ``Maybe giving it extra time will be good for
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Rocker took his work on Sunday _ recording four
outs against four batters in a non-save situation against the
Marlins _ and used it to continue regaining his confidence after
the blown save in Colorado. Rocker said he figured out in Denver
that he can't count on blowing his fastball by hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I learned no matter how hard you throw, you can't
throw stuff down the middle,'' Rocker said. ``Guys are looking for
one pitch (the 97-plus MPH fastball)....I'll have to be a little
smarter with it. I won't just try to blow a fastball right down the
middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The most consistent reliever the Braves have had so far this
season is Rudy Seanez, who's pitched scoreless ball in six of his
first seven outings with good hard stuff and even better control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pinpoint, but it's better than it's ever been,''
Seanez said. ``I've never been able to paint the black or divide
the plate up into thirds...I'm not trying to throw hard, not trying
to make the perfect pitch all the time.''

 &HT;    Hot Hawks pushing up button in East
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Someone's knocking on the door; somebody's ringing the
bell.
</P>
<P>
   If they look around in Orlando, Indiana and Miami, they'll see
the Hawks, and they won't want to let them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning cures a lot of things,'' Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Hawks were staggering in sixth place, as
close to ninth in the Eastern Conference _ out of the playoffs _ as
they were to fourth and home-court advantage in the first round.
Now they're fourth, the hottest team in the East with six
consecutive wins, and the three teams above them each lost its last
game.
</P>
<P>
   With a reasonably secure grip on No. 4 _ two losses better than
Philadelphia, three to the good of Milwaukee and Detroit with five
games to play _ the Hawks have their eyes on better things.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the picture:
</P>
<P>
   _ The No. 1 Miami Heat appears to be out of reach. Miami had
three fewer losses than the Hawks entering its game Monday night at
Cleveland. Miami also won the season series, so a tie doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2 Indiana is intriguing, because the Hawks are one game
out of first in the Central with the division-leading Pacers here
Friday night. Because the Hawks are 3-0 in the season series, a tie
would work to Atlanta's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slumping No. 3 Orlando, losers of five straight, leads by only
a half-game. If the Hawks can't take second seed, third is
consolation. The teams split four games this season, but the Magic
has a better record in the East, so Orlando gets the tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Either No. 2 or No. 3 will lose tonight, with the Magic playing
at Indiana. The Hawks are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys, 'Take care of business and things have a way
of falling into place,' `` Wilkens said. ``This has been the best
possible result for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach is refining his offense and defense and honing his
player rotations to take full benefit of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game is so important, I want our best guys on the
floor,'' Wilkens said. ``Plus, we have a lot of off days so (the
veteran starters) will get their rest.''
</P>
<P>
   With Alan Henderson returning Wednesday at the Georgia Dome
against the Knicks from a bruised back _ ``I can't stand sitting
around any more,'' Henderson said _ the Hawks will be at full
strength. That means Roshown McLeod, Jeff Sheppard and Ed Gray will
become game-time cheerleaders unless there are blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens will continue a pattern that started in Washington on
Friday and continued Sunday against Milwaukee, with Anthony
Johnson, Mark West, Ty Corbin and either Grant Long or Henderson
rotating off the bench in relief of Mookie Blaylock, Dikembe
Mutombo, Steve Smith, Chris Crawford and the starting power
forward, Henderson or Long.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and West play as needed in the second half, but Wilkens
essentially will use a tight seven-man rotation. When the games are
close in the fourth quarter, expect to see Corbin, who is
refreshed, playing the small-forward minutes for Crawford, Wilkens
said, ``Because Ty is such a smart player, and I want a veteran
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens can employ that strategy easily through the first round
of the playoffs, because the Hawks play consecutive games only once
more, on the final day of the season against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have our best guys out there,'' Wilkens said. ``This is
the time for that.''

PENTAGON ANNOUNCES INITIAL CALL-UP OF U.S. RESERVISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon announced the initial call-up of Air
Force Reserves on Monday to help in NATO refueling operations amid
the first serious signs of a split in the Yugoslav leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said they were encouraged by Yugoslav Deputy
Premier Duk Draskovic's comments on Serb television over the
weekend calling on President Slobodan Milosevic to end his
``intransigence'' on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who has been a strident nationalist, said it was time
for his government to face reality and to begin telling the Serbian
people the truth about the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN Monday, Draskovic said Serbia ``has no
chance except to build up democratic institutions in our country.''
He added that his goal ``is to reform Yugoslavia ... into a Balkans
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting cautiously, White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart
said the remarks might represent ``some breaking of the Yugoslav
political structure'' in face of a firm allied commitment to drive
Serb forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's stunning remarks came amid signs that the Milosevic
government might be easing its hard-line stance. Three members of
the International Committee of the Red Cross were allowed to visit
briefly with the three U.S. servicemen being held as prisoners of
war, even though the visits were not permitted to be private.
</P>
<P>
   They were, however, allowed to give messages to the three Army
soldiers _ Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Spc.
Steven M. Gonzalez, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt.
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. _ from their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelio Sommaruga, head of the ICRC who also met with
Milosevic, said he was told that a Red Cross doctor would also be
allowed to return for a longer, private visit Tuesday with the
three soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   There were also indications Monday that the Belgrade government
would allow the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a group of clergymen into
Yugoslavia to visit the Americans and meet with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO planes continued to be hampered by increasingly
bad weather in the Balkans, but were successful in carrying out
several bombing runs on key targets in Kosovo and in northern
Yugoslavia. One of the targets destroyed was the last remaining
railroad and highway bridge over the Danube River at Novi Sad,
which served as one of the main resupply and refueling routes for
Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Allied bombs had hit the bridge last week but apparently failed
to make it impassable.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, allied officials also announced that the 23
U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters and their support forces are
now in place in Albania and are undergoing final preparations for
deployment against Yugoslav ground troops and tanks inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that an Apache helicopter had apparently
crashed on a routine training run near its Albanian base. The crash
at its base at Tirana airport apparently was an accident and that
the two crewmen aboard had escaped without serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   The incident will have to be investigated before the Apaches are
sent into combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache contingent, complete with ground-based missile
launchers, Black Hawk helicopters and support troops, represents a
combat-ready unit made up of 3,400 U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also announced that 30 more KC-135 and KC-10 tanker
refueling aircraft will be deployed by this weekend to help
``increase the tempo'' of the NATO bombing mission dubbed Operation
Allied Force. The tanker pilot and support crews will consist of
both active-duty and Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the initial call-up of
reserve and national guard personnel to assist in the tanker
mission would include crews from Arizona, California, Michigan and
one other unspecified state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pentagon officials indicated that up to 33,000
reservists and national guardsmen could be called to active duty.
Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to provide that figure
Tuesday when he makes the official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon described the new deployment of tankers as a
``downpayment'' on about 300 additional U.S. aircraft requested by
NATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark to augment a force of NATO
planes that is already more than 600 strong.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO continued to beef up its air operations, it also made
plans for an oil and fuel embargo on Yugoslavia. The allied leaders
approved a ``visit and search'' plan during their weekend NATO
meeting in Washington that would allow allied ships to stop vessels
from entering the port of Bar near Montenegro, a main supply route
for oil and other products into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon and a top NATO general seemed to disagree over
whether force would be used if necessary to stop ships, and whether
NATO would attempt to block Russian vessels from entering the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot stop a merchant vessel by the use of force,'' German
Gen. Klaus Naumann told reporters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Pentagon, Bacon said the United States takes the
position that the ``so-called (international) rules of armed
conflict'' would allow the use of firepower to enforce a maritime
blockade.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO operation has destroyed Yugoslavia's oil-refining
capability and most fuel reserves. Land routes over which oil can
be brought in have also been disrupted. But oil can still be
brought in by sea through Montenegro, which is autonomous but still
a province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, Vice President Al Gore spoke with
Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin for an hour by telephone.
Chernomyrdin met with Milosevic last week in an attempt to broker a
deal between Belgrade and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The two ``reviewed'' the discussions Chernomyrdin had with the
Yugoslav president Thursday in which he reportedly said he was
willing to accept an international security force in Kosovo, a Gore
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   That position was rejected, however, by NATO leaders who said it
didn't go far enough toward accepting all the terms laid down by
NATO, including a complete pullout of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo,
the return of ethnic Albanians driven out by the Serbs, and a
NATO-led force to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also met Monday at the White House with
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov to talk about the Kosovo
conflict, the refugee problem in Macedonia and the allies' role in
helping to rebuild the region when the conflict ends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spoke to congressional leaders about his $6 billion
emergency request to help pay for the U.S. portion of the NATO
operation. House Republicans want to increase the requested amount
by at least another $5 billion to $14 billion, but administration
officials are concerned that it could get bogged down in
contentious debate about what kind of programs ought to be funded.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also preparing for possible votes this week on
whether to declare war against Yugoslavia or to end U.S.
involvement in the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., is demanding a vote on a
declaration of war, which he said would fulfill Congress' duty
under the War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point I think it is important for us to express
ourselves again. I don't think that it's necessary to declare
war,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ The morning sun had barely crested the low,
tawny mountains to the east of this city when Doris Haddock hit the
road.
</P>
<P>
   She was worried about the temperature, which was likely to rise
above 70 by noon, and wanted to finish her walk before then.
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles was her goal, or rather her daily requirement, a
distance that might be less impressive if Mrs. Haddock had not done
it more than 100 times already _ heading east from Pasadena,
Calif., more than three months ago _ and if she was not 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have arthritis in both hands, and sometimes my legs hurt at
night,'' Mrs. Haddock said in a chirpy voice as she catalogued the
health problems that hamper her cross-country odyssey, which was
taking her past strip clubs, shacks selling fireworks and countless
tufts of scrub brush along Route 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``the emphysema has greatly improved with the
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mrs. Haddock logged the 1,000th mile of her one-woman
trek to protest the failure of Congress in recent years to pass
several bills that proposed an overhaul in campaign finance
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   That meant she had a little more than 2,000 to go until she
reached Washington, probably in January. Initially, she had hoped
to get there by late November, but complications arose.
</P>
<P>
   She woke up one morning near Salome, Ariz., with difficulty
breathing and spent the next four days in the hospital, being
treated for dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was resting for two days every week and carrying on her
back a bag of water with a long plastic tube that works like a
straw. As a piece of sophisticated supplemental equipment, it
joined the steel corset that she wears to support her
intermittently aching back.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Haddock shared her plans with her sister last year,
her sister cried. Her son-in-law told her, only half kiddingly,
that she might be a candidate for institutionalization.
</P>
<P>
   But she had time on her hands, adventure in her heart and an
issue that she wanted to publicize. She figured, rightly, that
reporters and local politicians would be unable to ignore a woman
of so many years, her stooped shoulders giving her a forward tilt,
marching across the formidable breadth of America.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Haddock, who takes frequent stops to proselytize, there
is no problem in this country more significant than the prevalence
of ``soft money,'' or largely unregulated and unlimited
contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just infuriates me!'' she said over dinner in a Mexican
restaurant here on Saturday night. She balled her hands into fists
and struck the table so hard that the tortilla chips jumped a few
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we are losing our democracy,'' she said. ``The
corporations are taking over and deciding who gets elected.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many political pilgrims have preceeded Mrs. Haddock, and they
have traversed America, on foot and on bicycles, for a myriad of
causes. But, given her age, Mrs. Haddock may be the most audacious.
</P>
<P>
   She has assumed a catchy moniker, Granny D, which actually sells
her short, because she is in fact a great-grandmother of 11. She
advertises her agenda on a reflective vest that says, ``Granny D
For Campaign Finance Reform.'' Motorists who have seen her on local
TV often honk.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site, www.grannyd.com, gives the details of her itinerary
and enables supporters to join her for a day or two. Many have,
including a 65-year-old man from Arizona with what she described as
``a personality problem'' _ ``he was enrolled in a course to
control his violent temper,'' she said, ``but he didn't finish it''
_ and a 25-year-old man from California who insisted on dragging
any road kill, with his bare hands, into the desert for a proper
burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walking's OK,'' Mrs. Haddock said, ``but personnel has
been the biggest problem.''
</P>
<P>
   She is never alone: the advocacy group Common Cause, having been
informed of her intentions, helped to organize partners to
accompany her, a van to trail her and hosts to give her places to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little nervous,'' admitted Matt Keller, a lobbyist
with Common Cause, ``mainly because she's a very old woman. Did we
want to support something that may turn out to be tragic?''
</P>

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Each time a busload of refugees rumbles into
the dusty refugee camp in the town of Brazda, 14-year old Murat
Beqiri scans the faces peering from the windows. When he hears his
family name called out over bullhorns by aid workers searching for
a specific refugee, he scrambles expectantly out of his tent hoping
he may find his mother or father. Every day he tries to call home
to Pristina, but the line has been dead for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are trapped in Pristina,'' Kosovo's capital, said
Murat, a drawn and distracted look casting a shadow over his
youthful face. ``I think they can't get out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the frantic, chaotic hours when Albanians were forced from
their Kosovo homes, hundreds of parents and children lost track of
each other. Some children crossed the border alone or with
relatives. Others got separated by accident in the camps,
especially one night when Macedonian police officers forced Kosovo
Albanians crowded into a camp to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Murat last saw his father when his father told him and his
sister to leave home and find their way to Macedonia by train as
word spread in Pristina that Yugoslav forces were ordering people
to leave. His parents planned to remain at home with his
grandmother as long as they could.
</P>
<P>
   Lost children have been a big problem wherever families have
been suddenly uprooted, as in Rwanda. But it is especially
difficult in this case because half of Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic
Albanians were teen-agers and young children. The chaotic nature of
the exodus from Kosovo, the unusually high number of children, and
the complicated international aid and evacuation programs have
helped make efforts to reunite families particularly daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Albania, Macedonia has been forcing refugees to move on,
even putting them on planes to several other countries. Adding to
the problem, on April 7, 50,000 Kosovo refugees were rousted from a
camp in the border town of Blace and hustled away to other camps or
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun came up, Jehona Ulialu, a 5-year-old girl, was
found wandering alone in the remains of the camp. Aid workers have
posted her photograph in the larger refugee camps in Macedonia and
are trying to determine if her parents were sent to Turkey or
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks have passed, but Jehona's parents have not emerged.
British NATO soldiers at first cared for her, but she is now living
with a refugee family in Macedonia. They are missing children of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   By one count, Murat and Jehona are two of 253 ethnic Albanian
children in Macedonia refugee camps separated from their parents,
the International Committee of the Red Cross says. But there are
other children unaccounted for because 776 parents have reported
that their children are missing and are not on the Red Cross lists.
</P>
<P>
   Of lost children aid workers know about, few have been
completely abandoned and most are being cared for by relatives. The
Red Cross is posting the names of children it has located on
bulletin boards in the camps, hoping parents or relatives will come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, only 54 children have been reunited with their
parents through the efforts of the Red Cross and Save the Children.
Aid workers predict that parents and children are not likely to be
reunited for weeks, possibly months, and countless other relatives
_ siblings, aunts, uncles and grandparents _ are also missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we are just dealing now with the tip of the
iceberg,'' said Francois Zen-Ruffinin, a Red Cross spokesman.
``We're starting with children. They are the priority. But just
about every single family is missing a relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Families started scattering even before the NATO airstrikes.
Many parents hustled their children out of larger towns and cities
to the rural homes of relatives for safekeeping. But when Yugoslav
forces launched a major offensive after the bombing began, hundreds
of parents were blocked from retrieving their children.
</P>
<P>
   Even families that began the flight from Kosovo together were
sometimes separated. Panicked crowds swarmed aboard trains headed
for the border and the Serbian police cut off convoys of cars,
ordering some to the border, and others back into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Murat, who lives in a tent with his 25-year-old sister and her
husband in the sprawling refugee camp of 27,000 in Brazda, went to
the train station in Pristina after his aunt burst into in his home
in tears a week after the bombing began. Serbs had just expelled
her from her nearby home, she said, and Murat and his sister were
told to go to the train station immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said, `You go, we'll catch up with you,''' Murat
said. ``We waited for three hours. They never came.'' He managed to
reach his parents at a neighbor's house a week ago, but has heard
nothing since.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents said they were forcibly separated from their
children. Hyzri Gaytani, 24, and his wife, Imrani, 20, said the
Serbian police expelled them from their home in Pristina and then
blocked them from going to the hospital where their premature baby
was still in an incubator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 17 days,'' Gaytani said, holding his first, and
only, child's birth certificate. ``We don't know where he is.''
Phone calls to the doctor in Pristina have not been answered. They
have asked the Red Cross to see if they can send someone to the
hospital to find their infant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Families that had already been split up in Kosovo have been
divided yet again. Fatmira Mehmeti, 15, said she, her sister and
two brothers were separated from their parents after being taken to
their uncle's home in Pristina for safekeeping. After the NATO
bombing began, the children fled with their uncle to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   When Macedonian police officers cleared out the Blace camp, the
two girls and one of their brothers managed to stay with their
uncle. Their other brother, aunt, grandmother and three cousins
disappeared. ``Somebody told us they went to Turkey,'' Fatmira
said. ``But nothing is confirmed. We don't know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with children, elderly and mentally ill people have been
found wandering alone in Brazda. A dozen people in their 60s, 70s
and 80s and two mentally retarded teen-age boys are being cared for
in a tent run by the International Catholic Migration Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the boys can offer a hint as to who they are, their
age, their home or who cared for them. When strangers appear in
their tent, one offers a warm smile, waves his hand in the air and
blurts out garbled words. The other stares blankly at a wall of the
tent, seemingly traumatized by the tragedies that brought them to
Brazda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite likely we're not ever going to find their
families,'' said Albert Ramirez, a social worker from Austin,
Texas, who has been caring for the boys. ``They can't communicate
with us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In another tent, Benin Kukiqi and his college-age friends
represent one more group, teen-agers and young adults separated
from their parents. Kukiqi, 20, is the oldest of five students
sharing a tent in Brazda. None of them know where their parents
are.
</P>
<P>
   All five are childhood friends from the town of Glogovac in
northern Kosovo. Taking classes at Pristina University, they were
dozens of miles from their families when the NATO airstrikes began
a month ago. Kukiqi, a mechanical engineering student, said the
last time he spoke to his parents was from a phone booth in the
main post office in Pristina the day the strikes began.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, he said, lectured him for taking the risk of walking
through the center of town to make the call. Since then, phone
lines to Glogovac have been dead and no refugees from the town have
emerged. He has no idea where his parents and 17-year-old sister
are. ``There has been nothing at all,'' he said, ``just rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his tent-mates keep busy working with relief
organizations in the camp, a seeming distraction from thinking
incessantly about the missing. Kukiqi, steeling himself from what
could be weeks of doubt and worry, said the best thing he can do is
stay in one place and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am staying here to wait for some kind of contact,'' he said
resolutely. ``If my parents are alive, and I hope they are, they
will find me here.''

BORDER (Washington) - Arizona State Rep. Gail Griffin will tell a
U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee Tuesday that residents of
southeastern Arizona are ``prisoners in their home homes'' because
of illegal immigrants, and she denies ranchers have become
``vigilantes.'' By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RANCHERS (Douglas, Ariz.) - Dale Cureton's voice turned soft and
wistful as he recalled the good old days here on the sprawling
Rocker M Ranch, just a jackrabbit sprint from the Mexican border.
He spoke of a time when the same handful of deferential Mexican
farmworkers repeatedly used his place as their first stopoff point
on their way north.Today, an endless stream of illegal immigrants -
as many as 10,000 a month - take on this arid minefield of
rattlesnakes and thickets of prickly pear, mesquite, agave,
ocotillo and cholla spines that tear the flesh. By MARK SHAFFER and
DENIS WAGNER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
DRUGS (Phoenix) - With the Phoenix area now the drug capital of the
West, area law officers are begging the federal government for
funds to help fight 28 major drug-trafficking organizations.
Federal, county, state and city police are asking that central
Arizona be declared a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. They
say the funds that go along with being a HIDTA will help in the war
against drugs. By WILLIAM HERMANN. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARMS (Phoenix) - We find out how easy it is for an average Phoenix
area citizen to legally equip himself/herself with semi-automatic
weapons, bombs, body armor, etc. By WILLIAM HERMANN. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - In case you were wondering what the
state of Arizona's official waiting period is on mocking the dead,
it's six days. Less than a week after two teenagers slaughtered 12
high school students and a teacher in Littleton, Colo., legislators
here have reintroduced a couple of bills to protect gun
manfacturers and prevent the cities and towns in which you live
from protecting you. By E.J. MONTINI Story will move in the ``A''
and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POSTMODERN (Phoenix) - ``Postmodern'' _ the buzzword of the past 20
years. It started in the arts, spread to academe and now shows up
in virtually every form of popular culture. So what does it mean _
really mean? Republic art critic Richard Nilsen hashes it out. A
three-part series: Postmodernism in art _ Can you know yourself too
well? Postmodernism at large _ Is your whole life a media
event?Postmodernism's fate _ Does anything so now have a future?
Stories moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COMPUTER COLUMN (Phoenix) - Let's begin this week with a few
interesting, helpful and fun Web sites to check out: For example,
the respected ``National Geographic'' magazine now has a daily news
site. You can find it at www.ngnews.com. In addition to news, the
site offers several cool features, including a ``Map Machine'' that
allows users to tap into the magazine's archive of famous maps. The
service is great, especially for kids working on school projects.
By DAVID HOYE. Story moved in the ``F`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Used to be the best unrealistic goal
most newspaper columnists could hope for was winning the Pulitzer
Prize or seeing a compilation top the ``New York Times'' bestseller
list. Mary Schmich has changed all that. Now a columnist can
futilely yearn to write a pop hit as well. Schmich is a columnist
for the Chicago Tribune. Her name may not be familiar, but the
novelty hit ``Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)'' probably is.
Schmich wrote the ``lyrics.'' By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story moved in
the ``L'' category. &QL;

   Neanderthals are back _ not that we ever doubted their presence
in the gene pool. But some DNA research reported two years ago by
scientists at the University of Munich shook the long shadow of the
cave man and purported to prove that he was a species apart from
modern humans, no matter how many knuckle-draggers still seemed to
be thumping through life in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Now science, fascinating for its fluidity, has new evidence to
bolster what human beings have long felt in their bones. In fact,
those very bones tell the story, according to Portuguese and
American researchers who studied the 24,500-year-old skeleton of a
boy discovered last December in the Lapedo Valley north of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Erik Trinkaus, a paleoanthropologist at Washington
University in St. Louis, told The New York Times that the boy had
the facial features of modern man but a thick-set body and short
legs that were unmistakably Neanderthal, even though he was born
4,000 years after Neanderthals had become extinct.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation: interbreeding between the relatively
sophisticated early European humans, known as Cro-Magnons, and the
low-browed, slow, brutish personalities that have been a favorite
stereotype for at least a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The research proves something else that human beings have known
intuitively, even though many are loath to admit it: the
Neanderthal stereotype is not without charm. The Cro-Magnons
obviously thought so, for the Lapedo Valley boy appears to be the
product of generations of interbreeding. Perhaps this melding of
tool culture cool with chest-pounder is the source of that ancient
axiom of romance _ ``Opposites attract.''
</P>
<P>
   Having science confirm what we think we know is always
comforting, for the typical discovery today usually makes us gasp.
But the Neanderthal just makes us sigh. Knowing that research
appears to be solidifying his standing as a blood relative may help
us get through the tension of the next family reunion. ``I'm a
Cro-Magnon,'' someone might explain, ``but your Uncle Harry, well,
he's from the other side of the family.''

SUCCESSOR IS SELECTED TO RUN AMERICAN EXPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   American Express Co. said Monday that Kenneth Chenault would
succeed Harvey Golub as chief executive in 2001. That move would
elevate a black executive into the ranks of the country's top
corporate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   If the succession takes place and no other black executives
secure a key to the chief executive's suite before then, Chenault
would join Franklin D. Raines, head of the mortgage-financing giant
Fannie Mae, as the only black leaders of Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, 47, the company's president and chief operating
officer, has earned a reputation as a savvy marketer and a
determined revenue builder, qualities American Express will
continue to need as it navigates the brutally competitive straits
of the credit and charge-card businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken's influence has been felt at Amex for some time now,''
said David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, an Oxnard,
Calif., newsletter covering the credit- and charge-card industry.
``He has proven leadership skills, and he's an executive people
look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of American Express' succession plan came as no
surprise, though the timing was unexpected. Chenault was first
designated as Golub's successor two years ago, but Golub said at
the time that he intended to stay until 2004. Golub, 60, said
Monday that he would cede the chief executive post to Chenault
earlier, in April 2001, to ensure an orderly succession, often a
difficult proposition in corporate America because chief executives
are notoriously loath to relinquish the power and perks that come
with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   People close to both executives and to the board of American
Express confirmed that reasoning, saying that Golub had not been
asked to relinquish his title earlier than originally planned.
Golub said he would stay on as chairman for a year after stepping
down as chief executive. After that, Chenault will become chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no agenda here other than this being an action that
was purely logical, rational Harvey,'' said one adviser to American
Express and its board. ``Harvey is viewed as the guy who fixed it
up, and Ken is viewed as the revenue generator and marketer.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent black members of the business community praised the
decision, including the president of Time Warner Inc., Richard
Parsons, who is also a longtime friend of Chenault's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny is clearly an enormously talented guy who has worked for
everything that has come his way,'' Parsons said. ``Of course it's
significant, but these seeds were sown back in the '60s when Jim
Crow laws were dismantled. Some of those flowers are starting to
bloom now. It's never enough, but something is better than
nothing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chenault, the son of a dentist and a graduate of Harvard Law
School, joined American Express as strategic planning director in
1981 after stints at Bain &AMP; Co. as a management consultant and at a
law firm. After arriving at American Express, he snared a
succession of high-profile jobs in the company's lucrative
charge-card business. By the early 1990s, he had also won oversight
of most of the company's travel-related services. He was named vice
chairman in 1995 and president and chief operating officer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Chenault's early years with American Express, the ubiquitous
green card enjoyed unequaled cachet among status-hungry consumers,
and the company appeared to be poised for growth. But the company's
high-profile chief executive, James Robinson, led American Express
on a series of costly and ill-considered forays into brokerage and
investment banking services that left the company weakened and its
work force demoralized. Moreover, American Express' market share in
the card business was severely diminished by other more creative
and competitive companies that issued credit and charge cards under
the Visa and Mastercard logos.
</P>
<P>
   Those blunders led to Robinson's replacement as chief executive
by Golub in 1993. Under the leadership of Golub and Chenault,
American Express became a very different company than it was during
Robinson's reign. American Express belatedly refocused its efforts
on its core card business and maintained a studied devotion to
profitability. The company's net income was $2.14 billion in 1998,
up from $578 million in 1992. Shares of American Express have
soared since December 1992, climbing from about $22 to $134.3125 at
Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
   But Chenault, despite his proven abilities and the rebound he
and Golub have engineered, will still have to wrestle with some
daunting challenges. American Express lost market share to Visa and
Mastercard again last year, slipping to 17.7 percent of purchase
volume from 18.43 percent in 1997. Visa and Mastercard raised their
respective shares last year to 50.61 percent and 25.44 percent of
the market, according to the Nilson Report.
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, known to be an extremely competitive manager who does
not like to lose, disputed the Nilson Report's data and said that
it was still ``inconclusive'' that American Express lost market
share last year. Even so, he said in an interview that the company
``would like to more aggressively grow market share.'' Specifically
citing the Internet and enhanced forms of direct marketing,
Chenault added that ``the challenge is understanding how to use
different distribution channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenault has pushed for greater access to banks and the merchant
network dominated by Visa and Mastercard, an effort that may prove
fruitful depending on the outcome of an antitrust investigation of
those two companies by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   American Express failed to complete a merger it pursued with
Citicorp, now Citigroup, in 1996, and Golub said in an interview
Monday that the company did not rule out a big merger if it made
financial sense. But he said he favored partnerships with smaller
companies that help build American Express' brand name. Still, some
analysts and bank advisers see American Express as a logical
company for Citigroup to acquire if it successfully carries out
last year's merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   Chenault, who was born and raised in Mineola, N.Y., is married
and has two children. Besides his law degree, he holds an
undergraduate degree in history from Bowdoin College.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his American Express board seat, Chenault also
sits on the boards of IBM, Quaker Oats and several charitable
concerns.

A DOUBLE STANDARD ON SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, Sudan was able to keep its ugly little secret:
the capture of black Christians and animists in southern Sudan and
their enslavement by white Arabs in northern Sudan, a practice that
has been going on for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of tenacious nongovernmental organizations _ the
Boston-based American Anti-Slavery Group and Christian Solidarity
International of Geneva _ have not only broken through the wall of
silence that surrounded slavery in Sudan; they have raised money
from schoolchildren in Massachusetts, Colorado, and Oregon to buy
the freedom of enslaved women and children in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the slave redemption program run by Christian
Solidarity International has been criticized by the United Nations
International Children's Fund, or UNICEF. This is a program that
has emancipated 5,000 southern Sudanese slaves at a cost of $50 for
each person freed.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, which runs its own inoculation and food relief programs
in cooperation with the Sudanese regime in Khartoum, at first tried
to deny the existence of slavery in Sudan. When that became
impossible, the UN organization turned its ire not against the
slave traders or the regime that encouraged them but against the
human rights groups seeking to free the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF argued, preposterously, that these groups should instead
be trying to stop Sudan's long-running civil war; that buying the
slaves' freedom would encourage the arms trade; and that the very
purchase of a human being is intolerable. But the slave redemption
program has no effect on a war that has been going on for decades.
UNICEF's dollar payments to Khartoum do far more to fuel the arms
trade than slave redemptions in local currency. And UNICEF itself
buys the freedom of children in India who have been sold into debt
bondage by their impoverished families.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF's criticism of those who liberate slaves reeks of the
politicized behavior that has given its master, the UN General
Assembly, a bad name. Human rights have no meaning if they are not
universal.

UNDER THE GUN: BUSH URGED TO TAKE ACTIVE ROLE IN REVIVING PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, in the wake of the Colorado
school shooting last week, endorsed a controversial gun control
proposal that had been killed only hours earlier by a Texas House
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, before his public comments, apparently hadn't
lifted a finger to get the bill passed, people on both sides of the
issue said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel chairman, who voted against the bill, said the
governor had never told him he supported it. Bush's statement also
surprised supporters of the measure, which would require instant
criminal background checks of people buying firearms from
unlicensed sellers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is a hot-button issue in Republican Party politics.
And the governor's presidential aspirations have subjected him to
increasing criticism this year for failing to take stands on
specific pieces of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Although he endorsed the concept of instant criminal background
checks at gun shows, he didn't say he supported a specific bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, the House sponsor, laughed when a
reporter asked if the governor had made any effort to advance her
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   She said she learned of Bush's interest only when she read about
his comments ``after the vote to kill the bill occurred in
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, the Senate sponsor of a similar
measure languishing in a Senate committee, challenged the governor
Monday to take an active role in trying to revive the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor, given his popularity in the state of
Texas, has the power to resurrect that bill,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor's office was
monitoring Danburg's bill, which ``had some flaws in it and died in
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority in this area this session is a bill that would
require automatic detention for juveniles who commit crimes with
guns,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   That measure has been approved by the House and is pending in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Butts, spokeswoman for Texans Against Gun Violence, also
called on the governor to lobby for the background check measure,
which also is supported by a number of law-enforcement agencies but
is opposed by the National Rifle Association and the Texas State
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vote in the House Public Safety Committee was 6-2
against the bill, with one member absent, and an attempt to reverse
the vote would be difficult, Butts said her group isn't giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough vote for some of the people on that
committee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was ``no doubt'' the governor could have swayed some votes
the other way if he had called committee members, she added. All
but one of the votes against the bill were cast by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House Public Safety Committee rejected Danburg's gun show
bill, House Bill 1199, late Tuesday night, the same evening that
news of the school shooting in Littleton, Colo., which left 15
people dead, was rocking the country.
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon, Bush held a news conference to comment on
the Colorado shooting, which he called a ``tragic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering reporters' questions, Bush said he supported instant
criminal background checks, which the federal Brady Law already
requires of people who purchase firearms from licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady requirement, however, doesn't apply to purchases from
unlicensed people at gun shows, a loophole that Danburg's and
West's bills would attempt to close in Texas. The background checks
wouldn't be required of buyers who are law-enforcement officers or
who hold state handgun licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think about instant background checks at gun
shows?'' one reporter asked Bush in a follow-up question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support that,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation say it is necessary to clamp down
on felons who purchase weapons at gun shows. According to some
reports, one of the guns used in the Littleton shooting may have
been purchased at a gun show in Colorado by a friend of one of the
two students who shot up the school.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argue that the proposal is an unnecessary
infringement on gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is simply another step toward the desire by
those who oppose law-abiding citizens the right to own firearms,''
said Randy Gibson, executive director of the Texas State Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Turner, D-Coleman, chairman of the House Public Safety
Committee, said the governor's post-Littleton comments were ``a bit
of a knee-jerk reaction probably.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To this moment, the governor has never talked to me about the
bill,'' said Turner, who voted against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) never called me. His staff here who work with us in
the House every day, all day have never visited with me at all
about the bill,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said background checks at gun shows would take too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few enough phone lines, usually, at a gun show until
a two-day gun show could run into a two-week gun show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Butts said background checks usually don't take much time. They
would have to be conducted by someone with a federal firearms
license in a phone call to a computerized data center. She said
each gun show usually includes several licensees who could place
the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he still opposed the bill. But he said he would
allow the committee to reconsider the measure if Danburg convinces
him enough members have changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria, chairman of the Senate Criminal
Justice Committee, said he also opposed the gun show proposal. And,
in light of the House committee vote, he said he didn't plan to
grant West a hearing on his companion measure, Senate Bill 1566.
</P>
<P>
   Armbrister said he hadn't heard anything about the bill from the
governor's office either.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Turner, other Public Safety Committee members who voted
against Danburg's bill were Reps. Leo Berman, R-Tyler; Bill Carter,
R-Fort Worth; Suzanna Gratia Hupp, R-Lampasas; Phil King,
R-Weatherford; and Terry Keel-R-Austin, a former Travis County
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Roberto Gutierrez, D-McAllen, and Manny Najera, D-El Paso,
voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Driver, R-Garland, was absent.

CLINTON WARNS ARAFAT AGAINST DECLARING PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (With ISRAEL-BARAK) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a meeting of the Palestinian
policy-setting body in Gaza, President Clinton on Monday warned
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat against unilaterally declaring
Palestinian statehood but edged toward support for eventual
independence for the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   In a public statement and a private letter, Clinton said that a
Palestinian call for full independence that was not the product of
negotiations with Israel was certain to set back the already
faltering Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton went further than he has before toward endorsing an
eventual Palestinian state. ``We support the aspirations of the
Palestinian people to determine their own future on their own
land,'' Clinton said in a letter to Arafat that was delivered on
Monday night. Previously, the president has said only that he
supports the right of Palestinians to ``live free today, tomorrow
and forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also set a one-year target date for completion of
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on fundamental
issues of security, territory and the disposition of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, speaking to reporters in Gaza on Monday night, called
the Clinton letter ``more than positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders, nearing the end of a bitter national election
campaign, issued a threat on Monday to annex territory slated to be
turned over to the Palestinians if the Palestinian Central Council
issues a statehood declaration at its meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu, facing a fierce challenge from Ehud Barak,
the Labor candidate, has made opposition to Palestinian statehood a
central plank of his re-election platform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted on Monday that the transitional period of autonomy
for the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza will expire on May 4
with many of the most difficult issues dividing Israel and the
Palestinian people still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States was prepared to convene a new set
of peace talks within six months after the Israeli elections are
completed in early June in order to address outstanding questions,
including the status of Jerusalem, security relations between
Israel and the Palestinian entity and regional water rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on both sides to abide by existing agreements and
to complete the so-called final status talks within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Israelis and Palestinians are to reach an agreement, it is
essential that they do their part to create a serious, fair and
credible environment for negotiations,'' the White House said in a
statement on Monday afternoon. The document called on Palestinians
to curb terrorism, and on Israelis to cooperate with Palestinian
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, Palestinians and Israelis must avoid unilateral
acts and declarations that prejudge or predetermine issues reserved
for permanent status negotiations,'' the statement continued.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the document was an unambiguous
message to both sides to abide by agreements already signed, cool
their rhetoric and return to the bargaining table immediately after
the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's chief spokesman, said that
Washington had offered little of substance at a delicate time. And
that is perfectly fine with Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very satisfactory, and there is not much new in it,''
Bar-Illan said on Monday night. ``It reaffirms many things we've
been insisting on. There's nothing here that we can raise an
objection to. There's nothing here that exceeds what's been said
before and has been accepted by Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House statement and Clinton's letter to Arafat were
seen in Israel as an American ladder that will enable Arafat to
climb down from his threat to declare independence on May 4.
Israeli officials expressed the hope that Arafat would refrain from
calling for a declaration of statehood in return for the American
commitments to hold Israel to its pledges under agreements reached
at Madrid, Oslo and Wye Mills, Md.

 &HT;    Shooting suspect wrote of kamikaze-type suicide, police say
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo._Police released a friend of one of the
Columbine High School shooting suspects on Monday after questioning
her about whether she helped purchase guns for the deadly attack.
Officials said that she is not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said that a diary kept by one of the teen
killers indicated they hoped to murder as many as 500 people at
their school and in their neighborhood, then hijack an airplane,
which they would crash into New York City in a fiery kamikaze act.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling revelations came as this shaken town approached the
one-week anniversary of the nation's deadliest school shooting, in
which Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, gunned down 12
classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Monday that toxicology tests on the suspects
indicated neither had ingested drugs or alcohol before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of investigators continued scouring the school building
and grounds for clues, interviewing the suspects' friends and
witnesses and reviewing tapes from the school's security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about police handling of the rampage also
continued to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of Harris said police did nothing after they filed a
March 1998 complaint that Harris had threatened to kill their son.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown family told a deputy that Harris made verbal threats
and posted messages on his Internet site that named their son and
read: ``I am the Law. If I don't like what you do, you die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The police department was handed this on a silver platter and
they did nothing,'' said Judy Brown, whose son Brooks was a boyhood
friend of Harris but grew distant when they reached high school.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, who kept a copy of their official police complaint,
called deputies eight separate times to follow up after Harris made
the threat and threw ice that broke their son's car windshield, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said he was
aware of the complaint, but that deputies receive hundreds like it
each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it was overlooked,'' Davis said. ``We receive
so many calls like that. We try to check out the ones we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also addressed criticism that police acted too slowly and
did not pursue the killers aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   The family of slain teacher Dave Sanders, who bled to death in a
classroom where he lay for three hours despite frantic cell phone
calls from students with him, have questioned whether he might have
been saved by quicker police action.
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted that the gunmen may have killed themselves a
short time after the melee began at 11:15 a.m. Police did not find
their bodies until around 4 p.m., after more than three chaotic
hours. A detailed time line of the incident is still being
prepared, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very possible it was a short time from when the shooting
started to when the suspects killed themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis also said he believes police saved many lives, perhaps
hundreds. The school's police resource officer returned fire within
minutes of the attack, and officers acted heroically to get
hundreds of kids out of the school. In light of the killers' diary,
police may also have saved lives in the surrounding neighborhood by
keeping the suspects from expanding their rampage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that perhaps a major catastrophe was averted by the
police actions that were taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis would not reveal the name of the suspect's friend who was
questioned. He confirmed local media reports that the 18-year-old
woman was Klebold's girlfriend and that she was questioned about
buying a machine pistol and a semi-automatic carbine rifle for the
boys.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the day, Sgt. Jim Parr, another spokesman, wouldn't
say whether she was a girlfriend or what the questioning was about.
</P>
<P>
   Both spokesmen said the woman is not a suspect and that no
arrests are imminent.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities said more arrests may follow, especially if they
find that others helped by buying weapons or building or
transporting bombs. The helpers would've had to be aware of the
plotters' criminal intent, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly believe that more than two were aware of it,''
said Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas. ``Whether or
not more than two were involved, that's the essence of our
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigators worked, more funerals were held for the
victims, including students Cassie Bernall, Lauren Townsend and
Daniel Rohrbough.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend was an honor student and the school's volleyball team
captain. Rohrbough reportedly was killed as he held a door open for
other fleeing students. Bernall was singled out when she told the
killers she believed in God.
</P>
<P>
   A service for teacher Dave Sanders was also held, drawing
several thousand tearful mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have positively influenced more lives than we can ever
count,'' said Angela Sanders, recalling her dad's long teaching
career and his heroism in herding students to safety during the
rampage. ``You are truly a hero and will never be forgotten.''

EXPERTS SAY IT WILL BE HARD TO CHARGE PARENTS OF GUNMEN WITH A
CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING) 
(sw) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado have
suggested that if the parents of the teen-age gunmen at Columbine
High School had any hint of their plans and had failed to act, the
parents might be held criminally responsible for the young men's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But if the parents were criminally charged for the killings,
legal experts say, such a case would be extremely difficult to
prove. American law generally holds people responsible for crimes
only if they actively participate, aiding and abetting in a
homicide, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every tragedy like this there is always the instinct to
find someone to blame, but the reality is there are serious legal
obstacles to simply venting community outrage,'' said Peter
Arenella, a professor of criminal law at the University of
California in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those principles,'' Arenella continued, ``is that
parents are not legally responsible for the criminal acts of their
children unless they were aware they were going to commit such acts
and failed to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County sheriff, John P. Stone, highlighted the
attention on the parents of the two gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and
Dylan Klebold, 17. Stone said on Saturday that a sawed-off shotgun
and bomb-making materials were found in plain sight in one of the
boy's rooms. ``Parents should be held accountable for their kid's
actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Russell, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County district
attorney, David J. Thomas, said on Monday that investigators ``will
look at everyone.'' But Ms. Russell added that there was no
evidence that the parents of the teen-agers were involved and that
they were not suspects at this point. Because homicide and similar
crimes are generally state crimes, the decision on whether to
charge the parents would most likely be made by Colorado
law-enforcement officials, not by federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   American legal rules generally require prosecutors to prove that
a defendant had the intent to participate in a crime in order to be
found guilty of a crime. Although there is a special relationship
between parents and their children, legal experts say, the courts
have not said that parents should be held criminally responsible
for their children's acts simply because they are parents.
</P>
<P>
   The facts that are known so far about the two Columbine killers'
families, several legal experts say, do not suggest that the
parents had enough specific knowledge that a massacre was being
planned to make an obvious case against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just too complicated a world to begin blaming parents
under criminal statutes for the behavior of their children,'' said
Martin Guggenheim, an expert in juvenile justice at New York
University School of Law. ``There isn't the kind of direct
connection between parental behavior and a child's wrongdoing to
justify punishing parents criminally for a child's wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   To impose such criminal responsibility, Guggenheim and other
experts said on Monday, would bring government into family
relationships and could press parents to become informers on their
own children.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Aron, a juvenile justice lawyerin Chicago, said that
in 25 years of law practice he had not heard of an effort to hold
parents criminally responsible for an act like the Columbine
attack. That, Aron said, was because prosecutors recognize that
teen-agers are often well beyond the control of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point do you draw the line?'' Aron asked. ``If Charles
Manson's parents are still alive, should they be imprisoned?''
</P>
<P>
   Owens and Reno each said over the weekend that law-enforcement
officials should determine what the gunmen's parents knew or should
have known and ``take appropriate steps,'' as Reno said. Owens said
the parents could face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no shortage of signs'' of what the two teen-agers
were planning, the governor said. There are many possible legal
claims under both civil and criminal law that could be lodged
against the parents. Across the country in recent years, increasing
numbers of suits have sought to impose civil damages on parents of
children who commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say such suits in Colorado could seek unlimited civil
damages claiming that the parents of the two teen-agers were
negligent in their supervision of the young men and ``knew or
should have known'' about the stockpile of arms and bomb-making
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Many states, including Colorado, have parental responsibility
laws that make parents liable for moderate damages even if they did
not know about malicious acts of their children, like vandalism.
Colorado limits damage verdicts under that law to $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   About half the states have enacted such parental responsibility
laws. In some states, thousands of parents have been fined,
sentenced to counseling or to a few days in jail for failing to
supervise their delinquent children.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado lawyers said on Monday that there are several state
criminal laws under which charges could be filed against the
parents for crimes less serious than responsibility for the
killings. Those laws include a provision that makes it a violation
for an adult to permit a juvenile to possess a firearm if the adult
knows there is a ``substantial risk'' that the youth will use it to
commit a felony. Such charges could subject the parents to
imprisonment for two-to-six years if they were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that it was theoretically possible for a
parent to be charged with more serious crimes, like accessory to
murder or reckless homicide when a child commits a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But they said prosecutors would need much more evidence than a
shotgun or explosives found in a boy's room to charge the parents
with culpability for the deaths. Because of the pervasiveness of
guns in Colorado, several lawyers said, the presence of the shotgun
might not cause a reasonable parent to conclude that a crime was
being planned.
</P>
<P>
   H. Richard Uviller, a professor of criminal law at Columbia
University Law School, said prosecutors would have to prove that
the parents actually knew about whatever explosive materials were
discovered among their son's possessions. In addition, Uviller
said, information that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were involved
with violent Web sites would not necessarily help a prosecutor make
a case against their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Uviller said, ``is a long way from presenting an
immediate threat to another human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver on Monday, some lawyers said that they, like many
people, were wondering about the responsibility of the parents of
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Something must have gone wrong in
those relationships, several of them said. But whatever went wrong,
they said, the questions raised by the Columbine attack were not
necessarily questions for which the criminal law could provide
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this could happen is to me outrageous and inexplicable,''
said Jeffrey Springer, a Denver criminal defense lawyer. ``But is
that a crime? Not in this state. Being an irresponsible parent who
has blinders on is not a crime.''

 &HT;    Teens arrested after taking bomb to Atlanta schoolyard
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three boys arrested for possession of a pipe bomb on
school property learned how to make the explosive by browsing the
Internet, according to testimony at a court hearing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident prompted some parents to keep their children out
Mt. Bethel Elementary School in suburban Atlanta, and authorities
to send a bomb-sniffing dog through the building.
</P>
<P>
   While the youths still face harsh penalties for making the
device, authorities said they intended no harm. ``I don't want this
to be a knee-jerk reaction to the events in Colorado,'' said Cobb
County District Attorney Pat Head.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors agreed to allow the boys to return home with their
parents and be placed under house arrest rather than spend the next
few weeks in the Cobb County Youth Detention Center. They must
remain under constant adult supervision, have no access to the
Internet and may not communicate with each other while the case is
still pending, Juvenile Court Judge James F. Morris ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the boys are 14, and one is 15. They made their court
appearance dressed in shackles and orange jail overalls that were
too big. One of the three is a high school freshman in Cobb County
and has been suspended pending an investigation by school
administrators. The other two attend Atlanta Country Day School in
nearby Sandy Springs, a private school.
</P>
<P>
   The pipe bomb was one of several ``copycat'' incidents in metro
Atlanta that have drawn increased attention since the school
killings in Colorado. Four high school students from North Atlanta
have been arrested for blowing up a mailbox at a nearby elementary
school. The milk-jug bomb used water and dry ice and exploded
shortly after midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the incident at Mt. Bethel, two people walking on a path
noticed what appeared to be a pipe bomb about 30 yards from the
school building. The bomb was made from half-inch diameter PVC pipe
six to eight inches long. Packed inside were small, black
brickettes the detective identified as rocket motor fuel. Finishing
nails were scattered on the ground near the pipe. The bomb had no
cap on it, but the end of the pipe was burned as if someone had
tried to detonate it.
</P>
<P>
   While walking the grounds in search of other devices, Det.
Dwayne Morris came upon the three boys huddled around a tree stump.
``They had stuff in their hands and put it right back down on the
stump,'' Morris said. ``They said, `We just found this stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ``stuff'' turned out to be two sets of rocket motors
identical to the fuel found in the PVC pipe, two bottles of nail
polish remover _ which can be used as an accelerant in a bomb
because it is so flammable _ a box of cigars, a yo-yo and a
cigarette lighter.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned, one of the boys admitted that they had tried to
detonate the pipe bomb the previous day and left it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,130 students at Mt. Bethel Elementary School, about 280
failed to attend Monday _ three times the normal absentee rate. To
allay parents' fears, Cobb County police took a bomb-sniffing dog
to the campus after students were dismissed for the day. No more
explosives were found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, between 50 to 75 parents attended a meeting with
school administrators. ``It was three kids doing a stupid thing at
a real stupid time,'' said Mt. Bethel PTA president Bonnie Brand.
``Two weeks ago it probably would have been written off as a very
bad prank.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TZANEEN, South Africa _ Tony Leon, the head of South Africa's
liberal Democratic Party, a man with the slight lockjaw accent of
those educated at this country's best English-style boarding
schools, came here recently to pay homage to Chief Samuel Mpumulana
Muhlava II and to make his pitch to the Tsonga people who live
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign bus rattled up the dirt road and stopped before the
run-down meetinghouse where a group of traditional dancers with
drums and sheepskin anklets were ready to greet him here, 225 miles
northeast of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Leon's speech was thick with deference to Muhlava and skirted
the rather thorny issue of how exactly you reconcile democracy with
chieftainships, which are, after all, usually passed from father to
son.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, said Leon after he had removed his suit jacket and
striped tie in the sweltering heat, needed to ``carve a niche'' for
traditional leaders where they could continue to be ``the voice of
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon is not the only South African politician rushing down
unpaved roads to see the chiefs these days.
</P>
<P>
   With little time left before the second post-apartheid elections
on June 2, the newspapers are suddenly awash with pictures of
politicians wearing beads and emphasizing the importance of
protecting ``the old ways.''
</P>
<P>
   For many chiefs, the sudden attention is more than welcome.
Since the 1994 elections, traditional leaders _ many installed and
sustained by apartheid authorities because they did what they were
told _ have hovered at the margins of the new order, grumbling at
their lack of official status, power and pay.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling African National Congress continues to study what
exactly its policy will be regarding the 700 traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But it did decide last month, in time for the election, that
they were entitled to hefty raises, pensions and medical benefits.
They will all be paid about $1,000 a month, a very good salary by
South African standards and about twice what they were getting
before, though salaries varied widely.
</P>
<P>
   While their role in a democracy may be hard to figure out, there
can be little doubt that the chiefs continue to hold enormous sway,
particularly in the rural areas, where they function much as they
did before democracy: doling out land, settling disputes and
punishing those who break traditional law.
</P>
<P>
   They are no doubt capable of delivering hundreds of thousands of
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four years, the government has basically tried
to avoid the problem of traditional leaders,'' said Sean Jacobs, a
political analyst with the Institute for Democracy in South Africa,
a nonprofit research group. ``But now they are out talking to them,
and it's all about the election.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to raise the chiefs' salaries touched off protests
from some of the opposition parties, including Leon's. ``The DP
finds this transparent move a dishonest ploy at taxpayers'
expense,'' proclaimed Wessel Nel, a Democratic Party Member of
Parliament, shortly after the announcement. ``In our opinion, the
very idea of remunerating individuals merely by virtue of cultural
status is objectionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon, however, did not bring this up with Muhlava, who soon made
clear that he expected Leon to insure that he and his subchiefs got
their money. He also made clear that he wanted some running water
and electricity in the ramshackle settlement his people live in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just now, if Tony Leon wants water, this is the last I have,''
the chief said, pointing to a pitcher beside the podium. ``I had to
go 10 kilometers for that. I pity for you if you all be thirsty
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the intense focus on the chiefs is that
South Africa's newest party, the fast-growing, multiracial United
Democratic Movement, has been wooing them for months. The party is
led by Bantu Holomisa, who was thrown out of the African National
Congress for insubordination, and Roelf Meyer, who was pushed out
of the largely white-supported former National Party because of his
reformist views.
</P>
<P>
   Holomisa comes from the Eastern Cape province, much of which is
still under the control of Xhosa chiefs, and he is said to use his
skills well there. When polls began to show that Holomisa was
making huge inroads in this area, ANC officials began to fight
back. A recent poll suggests that the Congress, which is expected
to win the election but is pushing for a two-thirds majority, may
have reclaimed some of its support.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, both Mandela and his deputy, Thabo
Mbeki, who is virtually certain to become the next president, have
visited tribal leaders and attended showy ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Mandela once again married Graca Machel, the
former first lady of Mozambique, whom he married at his
Johannesburg home last year. This time he went through a
traditional ceremony in his own Eastern Cape village, Qunu. Mrs.
Machel, who is a lawyer and is active in children's rights, wore a
traditional Xhosa outfit with face paint and underwent rituals to
make her a full member of Mandela's Tembu clan.
</P>
<P>
   Well-wishers included at least a dozen Cabinet members. ``Any
great man who is not in touch with his culture is like a thin piece
of paper dangling in the air,'' said the sports minister, Steve
Tshwete.
</P>
<P>
   The following weekend Mandela and several other top ANC
officials were present as Patekile Holomisa, a half brother of
Bantu Holomisa and a member of the Congress, was installed as chief
of the Gebe.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela told the crowds that South Africa needed to marry its
traditional authority and its newfound democracy if the country was
to be successfully rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has demonstrated its faith in traditional
leaders,'' Mandela said, ``and acknowledged the role they could
play in building a nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But some experts expect the oratory to fade away after the
elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chiefs, in part because they were dependent on the money
that the apartheid machinery doled out, do not have a long history
of supporting the liberation movement and are often looked at with
some suspicion by the African National Congress. In some parts of
the country, like KwaZulu/Natal, they have also traditionally
supported another black-led party, the Inkatha Freedom Party.
Moreover, the traditional leadership does not sit well with many of
the young.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1994 elections, the chiefs have been given a national
council, which has advisory powers and is supposed to promote the
role of traditional leadership within a democratic constitution.
But what their future role will be in local community government
and in distributing farming and water rights on tribal land remains
in question. A draft bill could be ready by next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ANC is not really embracing `Let's protect our
traditions,''' said Lew Elias, the news editor of Daily Dispatch,
the biggest daily newspaper in the Eastern Cape. ``They are just
trying to make the best of it in an election year. Holomisa was
talking to the chiefs months ago, and suddenly they realized the
damage he had done, so they got moving.''

 &HT;    Darkness is beauty: That's all, Goths say
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Want to get a handle on a party's
patrons? Ask the bartender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the crowd,'' said Kelley Howley, scanning a room full
of black-clad people wearing chokers and eyeliner. ``They're good
tippers and very friendly, although scary-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion: the Bewitching Hour Ball, held Friday night at
Respectable Street Cafe as part of the night club's 12th
anniversary activities.
</P>
<P>
   The event drew several dozen Goths, followers of a lifestyle
that was connected _ unfairly, they say _ to the two young men in
last week's Littleton, Colo., shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Those guys weren't Goths, and we're nothing like them, said Ken
Collins, a 23-year-old chef from Lake Worth, Fla. with black
lipstick and a smile. ``We're peaceful, quiet, calm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The partygoers did the normal club thing _ drinking beers,
gabbing in groups in the courtyard and taking over the dance floor.
They danced dreamily by themselves to a growly, male version of
Madonna's ``Like a Prayer'' and moshed mildly to Iggy Pop's ``Lust
for Life.''
</P>
<P>
   A 45-year-old woman, a horse trainer who would not give her
name, took a short break and sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I'm in a nightgown,'' she said, pointing to her white
lace dress. ``No one bothers me. But if I go to (another local bar)
dressed like this, the guys would be humping my leg like a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last group to see a fight in, you know what I
mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some were nervous after the week's events. Angelina no
last name, owner of the Sepulchre boutique in Lake Worth and the
ball's sponsor, decided, for the first time, to leave her 1972
hearse at home.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Spear, 19, of Jupiter, Fla. came in a black outfit and
found himself, like others, trying to explain the Goth culture in a
breath or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like any other group out there,'' he said. ``I was gonna
wear a trenchcoat to prove a point, but I was afraid I was gonna
get my (rear end) kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   And what group would the Littleton shooters fit into? ``I would
say ... freaks?''

   Defining a typical Goth is as tough as defining, say, a long
black coat, a popular clothing choice because, while women can find
long dark dresses, it's hard for a guy to find clothes that fit the
Goth image, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Mormon greatcoat,'' one said of his outerwear. ``A
military jacket,'' said another. Or ``a velvet opera coat.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do Goths stand for? ``I just like dressing up,'' said
Cassandra Croy, 21, of Boynton Beach, wearing a full-length ball
skirt and a cropped, beaded bodice. ``I find beauty in darkness,''
said Spear, who says he particularly likes cathedrals. ``There's
just an attitude to it, an artistic point of view,'' said Reza
Beha, a 27-year-old computer programmer from Deerfield Beach. ``I
like the way it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrieann Preston, a 19-year-old waitress from Wellington,
walked up. ``Goths are not about hatred,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She started describing a recent Goth convention she attended in
New Orleans. About 1,000 people were there for music (try Bauhaus
and The Cure), author signings (Anne Rice is good Goth reading) and
a masquerade ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was a Goth Easter-egg hunt,'' she said. ``They gave
away stuffed bunnies with vampire teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goth humor,'' Collins explained.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's main event, a best-dressed contest, was
interrupted when a guy climbed on stage and drew a razor blade
several times across his stomach in a promotional stunt for his
band.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at Respectable's immediately kicked him out. Goths on
the sidewalk looked at him in disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Said one, ``You might want to get some Bactine for that ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bactine is for wusses,'' the guy said.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... and some help, man.''

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES PUSH NASDAQ AND S&AMP;P TO RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rising technology shares pushed the Nasdaq and the
S&AMP;P 500 to records Monday, but the activity was sedate compared
with last week's hectic pace.
</P>
<P>
   Computer shares helped to lead the charge, as stocks like IBM
rose for a fifth consecutive session after an industry report
showed that first-quarter shipments of personal computers rose more
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was responsible for nearly half of the 28.92 point gain in
the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index closed at
10,718.59, up three-tenths of a percent. The gain in the Dow left
the average below its record of 10,727.20, set on Thursday. But the
other two market gauges rose to new peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a surge in America Online, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index gained 3.19 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to
1,360.04. And the Nasdaq composite index, lifted by companies like
Microsoft and Intel, jumped 61.36 points, or 2.4 percent, to
2,652.05. The Nasdaq, which sustained one of its worst sell-offs
ever a week ago, is up 21 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was very quiet, but technology had a good bid due
to IBM and anticipation of earnings from a number of Internet
companies,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to believe that technology will be a strong
leadership factor in our market,'' Clark added. ``Without a strong
technology sector, it is hard to imagine a strong overall market.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action provided mixed signals about market breadth, an
indication that stocks outside of a few key sectors are doing
better.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the number of stocks that fell
in price outnumbered those that rose. But on the Nasdaq, more
stocks gained than fell in value. But there were positive
indicators.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 3.24
points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 434.97. And a leading
small-cap analyst said conditions in the sector might be on the
verge of improving.
</P>
<P>
   In a fresh report, Satya Pradhuman, director of small-cap
research at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., noted that there had been a sharp
increase in mergers and acquisitions since the start of the year,
driven in large part by low market valuations for companies with
market capitalization of less than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, more than 200 deals involving companies of
that size were announced, Pradhuman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average over the last decade, about 160 deals a year were
done in this part of the small-cap market,'' he said. ``The last
time we saw this much activity was in 1988 and 1989, which was at
the tail end of another small-cap bear market. This is very
positive, because it suggests that valuations have become relevant
again. If you have corporate clients looking for value, that
creates a floor'' under stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session, however, was again dominated by technology.
Computer shares rose after a report from International Data Corp.,
a market research firm, said worldwide shipments of personal
computers rose 19 percent in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   IBM jumped 10[, to a record 209~. The stock also gained on
speculation that Big Blue's board will approve a higher dividend
and a stock buyback program before its annual meeting, scheduled
for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about earnings at America Online helped to power the
stock higher. The company, which is expected to report results for
its third quarter Tuesday, saw its share price surge 15, to 162.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the biggest maker of software for personal computers,
gained 2, to 88. Intel, the big chip maker, gained 2 11/16, to 64
7/16. And Dell Computer rose 1 13/16, to 44 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in technology prices masked a sharp drop in
pharmaceutical and financial service company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, a Dow component, fell 1 1/16, to 134 5/16.
J.P. Morgan, another Dow stock, lost 5[, to 134 7/16. Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter slumped 4|, to 100]. And Merrill Lynch lost 3
3/16, to 87].
</P>
<P>
   Among drug stocks, Merck fell 1|, to 74. Johnson &AMP; Johnson
declined 1 9/16, to 100 3/16. And Pfizer lost 3, to 123 13/16.

PENTAGON ANNOUNCES INITIAL CALL-UP OF U.S. RESERVISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Subs 7th graf to correct to ``Gonzales'' sted of
``Gonzalez.'') 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon announced the initial call-up of Air
Force Reserves on Monday to help in NATO refueling operations amid
the first serious signs of a split in the Yugoslav leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said they were encouraged by Yugoslav Deputy
Premier Duk Draskovic's comments on Serb television over the
weekend calling on President Slobodan Milosevic to end his
``intransigence'' on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who has been a strident nationalist, said it was time
for his government to face reality and to begin telling the Serbian
people the truth about the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN Monday, Draskovic said Serbia ``has no
chance except to build up democratic institutions in our country.''
He added that his goal ``is to reform Yugoslavia ... into a Balkans
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting cautiously, White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart
said the remarks might represent ``some breaking of the Yugoslav
political structure'' in face of a firm allied commitment to drive
Serb forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's stunning remarks came amid signs that the Milosevic
government might be easing its hard-line stance. Three members of
the International Committee of the Red Cross were allowed to visit
briefly with the three U.S. servicemen being held as prisoners of
war, even though the visits were not permitted to be private.
</P>
<P>
   They were, however, allowed to give messages to the three Army
soldiers _ Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas; Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and Staff Sgt.
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. _ from their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelio Sommaruga, head of the ICRC who also met with
Milosevic, said he was told that a Red Cross doctor would also be
allowed to return for a longer, private visit Tuesday with the
three soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   There were also indications Monday that the Belgrade government
would allow the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a group of clergymen into
Yugoslavia to visit the Americans and meet with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO planes continued to be hampered by increasingly
bad weather in the Balkans, but were successful in carrying out
several bombing runs on key targets in Kosovo and in northern
Yugoslavia. One of the targets destroyed was the last remaining
railroad and highway bridge over the Danube River at Novi Sad,
which served as one of the main resupply and refueling routes for
Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Allied bombs had hit the bridge last week but apparently failed
to make it impassable.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, allied officials also announced that the 23
U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters and their support forces are
now in place in Albania and are undergoing final preparations for
deployment against Yugoslav ground troops and tanks inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that an Apache helicopter had apparently
crashed on a routine training run near its Albanian base. The crash
at its base at Tirana airport apparently was an accident and that
the two crewmen aboard had escaped without serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   The incident will have to be investigated before the Apaches are
sent into combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache contingent, complete with ground-based missile
launchers, Black Hawk helicopters and support troops, represents a
combat-ready unit made up of 3,400 U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also announced that 30 more KC-135 and KC-10 tanker
refueling aircraft will be deployed by this weekend to help
``increase the tempo'' of the NATO bombing mission dubbed Operation
Allied Force. The tanker pilot and support crews will consist of
both active-duty and Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the initial call-up of
reserve and national guard personnel to assist in the tanker
mission would include crews from Arizona, California, Michigan and
one other unspecified state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pentagon officials indicated that up to 33,000
reservists and national guardsmen could be called to active duty.
Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to provide that figure
Tuesday when he makes the official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon described the new deployment of tankers as a
``downpayment'' on about 300 additional U.S. aircraft requested by
NATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark to augment a force of NATO
planes that is already more than 600 strong.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO continued to beef up its air operations, it also made
plans for an oil and fuel embargo on Yugoslavia. The allied leaders
approved a ``visit and search'' plan during their weekend NATO
meeting in Washington that would allow allied ships to stop vessels
from entering the port of Bar near Montenegro, a main supply route
for oil and other products into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon and a top NATO general seemed to disagree over
whether force would be used if necessary to stop ships, and whether
NATO would attempt to block Russian vessels from entering the port.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot stop a merchant vessel by the use of force,'' German
Gen. Klaus Naumann told reporters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Pentagon, Bacon said the United States takes the
position that the ``so-called (international) rules of armed
conflict'' would allow the use of firepower to enforce a maritime
blockade.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO operation has destroyed Yugoslavia's oil-refining
capability and most fuel reserves. Land routes over which oil can
be brought in have also been disrupted. But oil can still be
brought in by sea through Montenegro, which is autonomous but still
a province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, Vice President Al Gore spoke with
Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin for an hour by telephone.
Chernomyrdin met with Milosevic last week in an attempt to broker a
deal between Belgrade and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The two ``reviewed'' the discussions Chernomyrdin had with the
Yugoslav president Thursday in which he reportedly said he was
willing to accept an international security force in Kosovo, a Gore
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   That position was rejected, however, by NATO leaders who said it
didn't go far enough toward accepting all the terms laid down by
NATO, including a complete pullout of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo,
the return of ethnic Albanians driven out by the Serbs, and a
NATO-led force to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also met Monday at the White House with
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov to talk about the Kosovo
conflict, the refugee problem in Macedonia and the allies' role in
helping to rebuild the region when the conflict ends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spoke to congressional leaders about his $6 billion
emergency request to help pay for the U.S. portion of the NATO
operation. House Republicans want to increase the requested amount
by at least another $5 billion to $14 billion, but administration
officials are concerned that it could get bogged down in
contentious debate about what kind of programs ought to be funded.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also preparing for possible votes this week on
whether to declare war against Yugoslavia or to end U.S.
involvement in the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., is demanding a vote on a
declaration of war, which he said would fulfill Congress' duty
under the War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point I think it is important for us to express
ourselves again. I don't think that it's necessary to declare
war,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

TIME WARNER TO CLOSE ITS PATHFINDER WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that symbolizes a passage from the early experimental
era of the World Wide Web to a mature publishing platform, Time
Warner will shut down Pathfinder, its pioneering outpost in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   During the last five years the company's Time Inc. unit has
lumped together all of its magazines, including Time, Fortune,
Money and Entertainment Weekly, in Pathfinder, a single, massive
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be phased out over the next six months, to be
replaced by so-called hub sites that combine related magazines,
features and links with the Web sites of other Time Warner
properties like CNN, CNNfn and other information and entertainment
properties. Each new hub will go after a more precisely targeted
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines will retain their individual home pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an evolution, and it follows the way consumers have
been using our sites,'' said Jeffrey Coomes, vice president of
marketing at Time Inc. New Media. Coomes said the decision to
dismantle Pathfinder was based on the fact that most consumers go
directly to the individual magazine sites and skip the Pathfinder
home page. He said the move was part of a long-term strategy
already in place. ``Now we're working on promoting individual
brands, like Time.com and Fortune.com, and their features and
functions,'' Coomes said.
</P>
<P>
   But the move, first reported Monday on CNET's News.com Web site,
comes late, industry analysts said. Lisa Allen, a senior analyst at
Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass.,
said that Pathfinder's demise was about two years overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' she said. ``It is repurposed print content
online, and that just doesn't work. The success of a site like
Pathfinder is about creating a specific online entity. It doesn't
mean throwing up a group of magazines on one home page and having
people drill down to the magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, Pathfinder was one of the first corporate sites
to open on the Web. But it was dogged by problems, from the merely
technical _ like the initial lengthy download time that users found
frustrating, and a cluttered layout _ to those of a constantly
shifting management.
</P>
<P>
   Like any pioneer, Pathfinder bore a number of scars as the first
major publisher to face issues like intellectual property rights in
a free-for-all medium and the gamble of offering print content
online at the risk of hurting newsstand and subscription sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Pathfinder underwent a flurry of changes in management
and focus when it named as president Linda McCutcheon, a Time Inc.
vice-president of sales and marketing. Ms. McCutcheon resigned
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner spent more than than $15 million a year in
developing the site, said a former staff member. It was unclear how
much, if any, of that investment was recouped. No one at Time Inc
would comment on the costs or cash flow, said Graham Cannon, a
spokesman for Time Inc. New Media.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst at Jupiter Communications, said
Pathfinder had made a number of missteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was burying all those wonderful consumer brands
like Time magazine and Fortune magazine under the URL Pathfinder,''
he said, referring to the Web address pathfinder.com. ``That was a
terrible mistake, because people had to learn what Pathfinder
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The bright side, Mooradian said, was that the demise of
Pathfinder ``is paving the path for much more editorial control and
the empowerment of the individual properties.''
</P>
<P>
   One way in which that individual empowerment may come about is
through electronic commerce. Most of the success on the Web is
attributed to sites that offer a combination of content and
commerce _ for example, when a user can read about the new Britney
Spears' CD on the Teen People Web site, then click on a picture of
the album cover and purchase it.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Time Warner announced in January the formation of
Time Warner E-Commerce to consolidate the company's current
direct-marketing efforts on the Web and introduce other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pepe, the former president of the Time Inc. Business
Information Group _ which includes Fortune, Money, Your Company and
Mutual Funds magazine _ was named president of the e-commerce unit.
At the time, Pepe said he expected the magazine group's growth in
e-commerce to be big. ``We're beginning to create parallel,
complementary Web sites for our magazines that will provide new
ways to talk to our consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web audience, said Ms. Allen of Forrester Research, has ``a
different set of expectations. They look for utility and
convenience and savings, as well as content.'' She said that Time
Warner had recognized that the old publishing model of magazines is
different on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online publishing blends content and commerce increasingly, as
if the old lines between edit and advertising are disappearing,''
she said. ``I'm sure that's a very tough nugget for traditional
publishers like Time Warner to stomach, but that's what's happening
on the Web.''

 &HT;    Alienation, depression not unusual for teens, experts say
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The murdered children at school desks and locker
bays are only the most obvious tragedies when kids open fire on
their classmates. Squinting through the horrific gunsmoke, experts
on the feelings of children can also see teen-age alienation,
loneliness and depression in frightening numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people aren't willing to talk about yet,'' said
Kettering psychologist Dennis O'Grady. But while student gunmen in
seven United States schools have killed 29 people in the past 19
months, the American Psychiatric Association has noted that 5,000
teen-agers a year die when depression leads to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably no feeling more painful than loneliness and
alienation,'' said John Baren, a Centerville psychotherapist and
former mental health consultant to the Dayton police SWAT team.
``In fact, it's the area in psychiatry that the least is written
about, and one reason why is that it's pretty painful even to write
about.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Grady, Baren and many other professionals hope the national
grief over last week's massacre in a suburban Denver high school
will focus attention beyond metal detectors to deeper problems.
They see a widespread inability to express hatred and anger
constructively. They see more tolerance of bullying than of
individual differences. And they see a pervasive reluctance to
acknowledge and treat even low degrees of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   But they recommend far more than hugs and smiles for alienated
children. In fact, they trace much of the problem to misguided
attempts at waiving children's personal responsibility and at
bestowing self-esteem without requiring them first to accomplish
something.
</P>
<P>
   Alienation is the common thread connecting the kids who have
shot up schools, experts say _ not drug use, not pierced eyebrows,
not poverty, not violent juvenile rap sheets. The incidents are
revenge of the spurned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything mysterious about it,'' said O'Grady, who
often gives hourlong seminars on the progression from rejection to
resentment to revenge. ``You talk to a lot of shrinks in general
practice, and everyone's seeing three or four alienated adolescents
who are talking about things like going and shooting people. They
feel there is nothing to live for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids will always be bullied and ostracized, of course. But that
doesn't mean the psychological costs always have to be so steep.
</P>
<P>
   After John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate President Reagan,
his father started a foundation encouraging public recognition of
mental illness. ``Their slogan was `Learn to see the sickness,' ''
said Dr. William Klykylo, professor of child and adolescent
psychiatry at the Wright State University School of Medicine. But
18 years later, Klykylo is still bemoaning the absence of mental
health services for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescence is a hard time for everyone, certainly. It is when
kids begin feeling emotions they haven't learned to express or
control, ``and they're kind of left on their own to figure it
out,'' said Kim McElroy, a licensed clinical counselor at Samaritan
CrisisCare.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a time when kids fight contradictory battles to
assert their individuality and to be part of a group. ``Even
getting glanced at funny can be very upsetting,'' McElroy said.
</P>
<P>
   So any teen with a heartbeat will feel some alienation, she said
_ even a popular one. The trick is identifying and helping those
not-so-few who ``spend their whole teen-age years feeling nothing
but sad and alienated and strange and rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   They are becoming more prevalent, said Centerville psychologist
Kathy Platoni. She sees hatred surface far more often among ``even
the good kids, the bright kids,'' especially where divorce has left
them feeling abandoned. ``They're so filled with anger and they
have no way to express it, because no one's listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Quality time isn't enough, O'Grady said. Parents need to be
available repeatedly, too. ``Listen to their music,'' he urged.
Instead of blaming Marilyn Manson for being popular, ask why he's
appealing. That doesn't mean parents should treat junior to
Manson's latest CD. It means they should find another way to
address the need he's filling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids tend to have much fewer restrictions today,'' Baren said.
Most young children need to hear ``no'' more often.
</P>
<P>
   From athletes who blame someone else for their drug addiction to
presidents who didn't inhale, Baren said, ``We've become a nation
of people who never take responsibility for their behavior, and
that plays a big role in why kids behave the way they behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ``moral development'' is arrested, he said. Few seem to go
to church anymore, and he sees a surprising number who have never
heard the classic fables and fairy tales. Those morality plays have
been replaced by Gameboys and Nintendos, ``where so much time is
just spent obliterating things, starting at a very early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Those early ages are when alienation and depression begin. It's
nice to know that kids who start fires, hurt animals and socially
withdraw are more likely to snap, but a parent noticing any of
those warning signs in a high school sophomore is too late, McElroy
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot more could be done when children are younger,''
McElroy said. Grade schools, for example, could teach kids how to
value their differences, how to solve disagreements without
fighting, how to be likable to other kids.
</P>
<P>
   Even without overhauling their curricula, schools can show all
kids that they'll punish bullies for tormenting them and they'll
offer an activity they enjoy, whatever their interests, said Barb
Murphy, the Ohio Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free
Schools consultant. She said research shows that kids stay out of
trouble when they feel someone cares about them at school and at
home.
</P>
<P>
   As publicity emphasizes the repeated role of outcasts in school
shootings, professionals worry that unconventional kids will be
further stigmatized instead of nurtured. They also worry that
understandable fears will lead to disciplinary crackdowns that
leave more kids feeling they have nothing to lose when they need to
feel they have somewhere to belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard too many politicians and commentators using this
to advocate for their own pet issues,'' Klykylo said. He hears talk
of making it easier to sue or prosecute parents, of raising more
money for training teachers, of putting tighter controls on guns,
drugs and Hollywood _ as if laws can shape attitudes instead of the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is we're going to fluff the pillows, beat our chests
and cry some tears, but we're not going to do a doggone thing to
change violence in our society,'' O'Grady said. ``And it's my
fault. I'm an adult. It's the adults' fault.''

 &HT;    Reynolds and Reynolds announces hire of new president
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton-based Reynolds and Reynolds Co. said
Monday it has hired a senior IBM executive as its new president,
chief operating officer and likely successor to Chairman, President
and Chief Executive David R. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd ``Buzz'' Waterhouse headed International Business
Machines' new e-business services unit, a $700 million operation
with 3,000 employees that is being heavily advertised on television
and in print by Big Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse officially joins Reynolds on Saturday and is in line
to succeed Holmes within five years when his employment contract
expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes with a lot of people on his side (to become chief
executive)'' of the $1.5 billion business forms and information
management company, said Holmes, 58.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse, 47, said, ``My plan is to learn more about Reynolds
and Reynolds and get my feet on the ground in Dayton and take it
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is relinquishing the president's title he has held for
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analyst Greg Gieber, who follows Reynolds for Brown
Brothers Harriman, said ``On paper (Waterhouse) looks like a superb
choice . . . (The company) needs somebody who can take them into
the digital age.''
</P>
<P>
   In 26 years with IBM, Waterhouse has been IBM's general manager
for marketing and business development, director of strategy,
president of IBM's Asia Pacific Services Corp. and senior managing
director of IBM Japan. IBM's e-business unit is considered a key
part of the $78 billion company's growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   IBM officials said the company's policy is to not comment on
personnel issues. But information technology industry analyst Sam
Albert of Sam Albert Associates said Waterhouse's departure is a
big blow to IBM. ``He was a key player in the services business,''
Albert said.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse said he was not job hunting or even interested in the
job when first approached. But after learning more about Reynolds,
he found it attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get phone calls two or three times a day from Internet
companies. I decided I didn't want to go into the Wild West or a
risky company or a direct competitor of IBM. Reynolds and Reynolds
is none of that,'' Water house said. He said he believes Reynolds
has a tremendous future.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he started looking for a successor late last year.
Waterhouse's general management, international and e-commerce
experience makes him a good fit for Reynolds and he is capable of
turning the company into a real powerhouse information management
company, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who is building a house in Maine, said he might leave
the company before his employment contract expires. Holmes came to
Reynolds in 1984 after working for Nabisco Brands Inc. as general
manager and vice president of the snack food business.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said Waterhouse's arrival will not free up his schedule
for more community work. Holmes and his wife, Nancy, spearheaded a
fundraising campaign to transform Dayton's downtown riverfront into
a community showpiece. Holmes serves on the board of directors of
both NCR Corp. and DP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse said he will move his wife, Lorraine; daughter, Lynn,
14; and son, Brian, 12, here this summer. The Erie, Pa., native
said he is looking forward to returning to the Midwest. He began
his IBM career 26 years ago in Youngstown.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As he planned the assault on Columbine High
School, Eric Harris wrote in a diary that he envisioned killing as
many as 500 students, going on to attack neighboring homes and then
hijacking a jet and crashing it in New York City, police
investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Harris or his accomplice, Dylan
Klebold, took any steps to carry out this grander scheme, but Steve
Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department,
said, ``If in fact they were able to carry out their entire plan,
there could have been quite a bit more damage and quite a few more
fatalities.'' The officials did not release the contents of the
diary.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a week after Harris and Dylan Klebold brought guns and as
many as 30 pipe bombs to school, killing 12 students and one
teacher before taking their own lives, the police on Monday
questioned and later released an 18-year-old girlfriend of one of
the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a female who I believe had access to this weapon
prior to Tuesday,'' Dave Thomas, the Jefferson County district
attorney said, referring to a semiautomatic TEC-9 pistol recovered
with the suspects' bodies. ``We are looking into how she got access
to that weapon, and what involvement she may have had.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney and the police spokesman emphasized that
no arrests were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not called her a suspect at the time, by any means _
there is no arrest warrant either,'' Davis said. Responding to a
reporter's question about the four guns found in the school, he
answered, ``She was questioned on the handgun and the rifle, not
the shotguns.'' The authorities here say most of the victims'
wounds were appear to have been caused by two sawed-off shotguns
the pair carried rather than the TEC-9 or a 9-millimeter
semiautomatic carbine rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been confirmed as far her supplying those
weapons,'' he added. ``They are simply asking her and questioning
her on that line.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continued into last week's rampage,
funerals were held Monday for the teacher and three of the students
slain. The teacher, William Sanders, 47, was shot twice in the
chest as he led students down a hallway to safety. Services were
also held for Lauren Townsend, 18, the captain of the girls'
varsity volleyball; Daniel Rohrbough, 15, who was shot while
holding a door open for fleeing students; and Cassie Bernall, 17.
</P>
<P>
   With bomb squad investigators continuing to search the grounds,
Davis spoke to reporters outside the cordoned-off school. There
remain ``many, many lockers to go through, many, many backpacks to
go through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold, who were both seniors at Columbine, had
apparently pinned their hopes on blowing up their school to a
25-pound propane bomb in the school's kitchen that they had planned
to detonate. When the timing device failed, Davis said, ``there
were indications that they had possibly tried to fire on that
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office said
Monday that toxicology tests on the bodies of the two youths did
not show traces of drugs or alcohol. In addition, Davis said that
investigators had not found any illicit drugs or drug paraphernalia
at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the parents of the two youths had hired lawyers and had
not spoken with investigators since last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Tuesday's attack, the parents of Brooks Brown, a
classmate of the suspects, have disclosed that they notified the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department eight times last year with
complaints that Harris, a neighbor, had threatened their son. The
couple, Randy and Judy Brown, said that after Harris chipped the
windshield of their son's car, he created a computer game that
revolved around destroying the Brown house and created a web site
that featured a death threat against their son and accounts of
manufacturing and exploding pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harris and Klebold were on probation at the time,
Jefferson County detectives never followed up on the complaints,
the Browns have said. On Monday, Davis said that a ``suspicious
incident'' report had been located. Later, he added, ``This is part
of the ongoing investigation and I do not want to make any comments
about that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said, ``As far as I know, nothing was ever brought to my
office.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While trading at the nation's four busiest stock exchanges came
to a halt for one minute at noon Monday in memory of the 13
victims, this Denver suburb endured a numbing marathon of funerals.
About 2,500 people turned out for the funeral of Sander's, who had
taught and coached at the school for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday as shots rang out at lunch, Sanders, a grandfather,
jumped on a table in the school cafeteria and shouted for students
to duck, and then to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running around, and I remember seeing him jumping over
the chairs and yelling `Everybody get down!''' Lindsay Dowling, a
student recalled. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many other
people's.''
</P>
<P>
   As he ran through the halls, herding students to safety, the
teacher was shot twice in the chest. After taking him into a
barricaded classroom, students tried to keep his spirits up by
showing him wallet photos of his wife and three daughters. But he
died shortly after being freed by the police, the only teacher to
die in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank him for saving my life,'' Laurel Salerno,
another student who escaped the cafeteria, said in a church
overflowing with students. ``Mr. Sanders, I thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at the same time, another 1,000 mourners attended the
funeral of Bernall, a junior, who often wore a bracelet inscribed
``WWJD'' _ shorthand for `What would Jesus do?'
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, one of the attackers cornered her in the library,
trained a gun on her, looked in her blue eyes, and asked if she
believed in God. After a pause, surviving students have recounted,
Bernall, a born-again Christian, answered deliberately, ``Yes, I
believe in God.'' He then shot her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cassie died a martyr's death,'' Pastor George Kristen, of the
West Bowled Community Church said. ``She went to the martyr's hall
of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, a funeral was held for Townsend, a National
Honor Society scholar, She was to have been the class valedictorian
at graduation ceremonies next month.
</P>
<P>
   The last funeral of the day was for Rohrbough, a freshman. He
was last seen alive running from his stalkers and screaming for his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures warmed in Denver, hundreds of people continued
to make somber pilgrimages to a memorial site in a park near the
high school. Many parked a half-mile away to add flowers to the
thousands of bouquets already there.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 students from other high schools marched up to nine
miles to the site. Referring to the killers, one held a placard to
passing cars, ``There are more of us than there are of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a teen-ager,'' said one marcher, Morgen Warner, a junior
from Jefferson County Open School. ``This affects me more deeply
than any adult could even begin to comprehend.''

 &HT;    Reservists put in hours, keep planes going to conflict
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two more military cargo jets left
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Monday to support NATO's air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane crews are Air Force reservists volunteering for
extra duty, but even more reservists have been working quietly
behind the scenes at Wright-Pat to support the stepped-up activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more to it than the eight men and women in the
airplane,'' said Brig. Gen. Robert Duignan, commander of the 445th
Airlift Wing. ``For every one of them, there's probably a dozen''
working on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's departures _ one on a trip staying inside the United
States, the other bound for an unidentified staging base in Europe
_ brought to 16 the number of flights the wing has made since
February to haul military supplies for the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For every flight, reservists have put in extra time scheduling
missions, fixing the big jets, and rigging their cargo holds for
whatever payloads are assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
   The wing is authorized for 18 C-141s, although it usually has
fewer in its fleet. Spokeswoman Sharon Erli said the wing has about
350 full-time workers and about 1,850 reservists.
</P>
<P>
   The full-time workers keep the wing operational and train the
reservists. But the Air Force has been turning to its reserve units
for extra airlift during the Kosovo conflict, and that has prompted
Duignan to ask reservists to put in extra duty.
</P>
<P>
   In a maintenance hangar, Tech Sgt. Steven Stiger and Senior
Airman Robert Caskey stood under the wing of a C-141 and drove
rivets into a pylon where an engine had been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Stiger works full-time for the wing as an Air Reserve
Technician, but Caskey is a reservist who works for Airborne
Freight Corp. in Wilmington. But for the last two months, Caskey
said, he's been been wearing his reserve stripes full-time.
</P>
<P>
   This duty is in addition to his usual 15 days of annual reserve
training, Caskey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go back to my civilian employer for two weeks, then come
back for my two weeks'' of reserve training, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the flight line, Staff Sgt. Nelson Scott was
troubleshooting a radio in one of the C-141Cs, the newest model
with upgraded avionics, a term for aviation electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, an avionics technician, said he's here from Glouster in
southeastern Ohio for his regular annual duty, but he's being
trained on the new electronics so he will be fully qualified in
case the wing is activated.
</P>
<P>
   Scott showed a quiet, serious pride in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really glad that people are dying, but that's why
we're here. The ethnic Albanians are pretty defenseless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is in the second month of its air attacks on Serb forces
that have routed hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from
their homes in Kosovo. Refugees have said the Serbs are raping and
killing helpless civilians, destroying their documents and burning
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen Monday ordered 30 more Air Force
refueling aircraft deployed, and Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said reservists would be ordered to active duty within a few days
to fly the refueling planes and perform other support duties for
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The only refueling wing in Ohio is the Ohio Air National Guard's
121st Air Refueling Wing at Rickenbacker Air Force Base near
Columbus. Spokeswoman Denise Varner said no Ohio guard units have
been alerted to expect a callup.

HOST OF BBC CRIME PROGRAM AND TV EVENING NEWS IS SLAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Jill Dando, a well-known BBC television news
broadcaster, was found murdered on Monday outside the front door of
her home in London.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dando, 37, had been a host of the BBC's ``Six O'Clock
News,'' a travel program and a show called ``Crimewatch'' that has
had success solving cases by graphically reconstructing crimes and
then enlisting the public in solving them by helping the police
identify suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Through her four-year association with the show, Ms. Dando had
become closely identified with crime fighting. Last year, she
reported being stalked by an obsessive fan, but the police on
Monday night discounted him as a suspect, saying he was working in
his garden at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, she had introduced a series called ``Antiques
Inspectors,'' and a picture of her standing in front of a
collector's-item car is on the cover of the current Radio Times.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard said Ms. Dando died from a single gunshot wound in
the head. Two neighbors found her covered in blood on the doorstep
of her $700,000 home on Gowan Avenue in Fulham, Southwest London,
shortly before noon. She had just arrived in her car when she was
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the street said they saw a man dressed in a suit
and carrying a mobile telephone rush away from the house at the
time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   She was taken to Charing Cross Hospital where she was pronounced
dead early on Monday afternoon. Her body was identified by Dr. Alan
Farthing, a medical doctor she was to marry on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the police searched a stretch of the River
Thames, including the shoreline and shallow water near Putney
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1961 in Weston-Super-Mare in Southwest England, she
joined her hometown paper after high school graduation and five
years later moved into local radio and television. She came to
London in 1988 and began work for the BBC on its ``Breakfast Time''
news program.
</P>
<P>
   A BBC news reader, Jennie Bond, a friend and colleague who
specializes in covering the royal family, went on the air to
announce the slaying in a bulletin early Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a completely horrible thing to have to do,'' she said.
``I have never seen the BBC newsroom in a more somber state.''

FAA CALLS NEW RADAR INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday
that a new traffic control system for lower-altitude aircraft,
already several months behind schedule, still cannot run fast
enough to serve in busy environments.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had hoped to begin using the system in Boston last
December. Now, its debut is expected to be in Syracuse, N.Y., late
this year, and El Paso is expected to get the system early next
year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's existing screens are so old, with spare parts
scarce, that it had been trying to rush the new equipment into
service in busy radar centers serving New York City, Washington and
Dallas-Fort Worth. Those offices were to get half the new system,
consisting of new computers at the controllers' desks running off
existing computers in the back room. But the FAA said Monday that
instead, those three places would get ``stopgap'' replacements, new
screens that will plug into the old computers.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials say they are confident that the full $1-billion
program, called the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement
System, or Stars, will eventually work well, when they have
perfected both new back-room computers and the equipment at the
controllers' desks. But they are no longer saying when that will
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Challan, director of air traffic control systems
development, said the agency was ``currently projecting that we
will have a finite answer to that question later this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few disappointments with the program,'' Challan
said. He said he would not give another firm date, because ``I
don't want to set us up that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other problems, when one controller tries to ``hand off''
an airplane to another controller, by clicking on the blip, the
computer takes too long to make the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says the program is behind schedule largely because the
controllers wanted changes in its operation.

RED CROSS OFFICIAL MEETS WITH CAPTURED U.S. SOLDIERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Red Cross official met briefly Monday with three
U.S. soldiers held captive by the Serbs, and was promised a longer
meeting Tuesday that would include a medical examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to talk to them only a few minutes,'' Cornelio
Sommaruga said at news conference. ``We looked into each others
eyes and shook hands very warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers _ Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas;
Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and Staff Sgt.
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. _ appeared to be
in relatively good condition, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sommaruga, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
was allowed to see the soldiers before a meeting with Yugoslav
president Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Milosevic had denied Red Cross access to the
soldiers, who were captured March 31 as they patrolled the
Macedonia-Kosovo border as part of a NATO unit stationed in
Macedonia. They were captured in the early days of the NATO air
campaign against Milosevic's Serb forces operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Red Cross chief had not been given advance notice
that he could see the soldiers, he clearly was prepared. A
spokesman for the International Red Cross, based in Switzerland,
said Sommaruga gave the POWs letters from their families.
</P>
<P>
   Both Red Cross and U.S. officials noted, however, that Monday's
meeting did not fulfill the Geneva War Conventions governing
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with those rules, Red Cross doctors must be allowed to
give the soldiers a quick medical exam. Furthermore, Red Cross
officials must be permitted to interview the soldiers without
Yugoslav officials present.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said that Sommaruga had been assured that he could
return Tuesday and conduct a visit with the soldiers that complied
with the Geneva rules.
</P>
<P>
   It was anticipated that the soldiers would be allowed to reply
to the messages from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' families expressed relief about the first outside
contact with the men since they were captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we do have confirmation that
everyone appears to be in good condition,'' said Larry Fitzgerald,
speaking on behalf of Gonzales' parents, Gilbert and Rosie Gonzales
of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gonzales family is very heartened by this news,'' said
Fitzgerald, a spokesman at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice
where the Gonzales also are employed. But Fitzgerald said the
family was awaiting additional details from the expected medical
examination.
</P>
<P>
   The Stone family also was buoyed by the news. Stone's wife is
from San Antonio,
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they are all right and they are doing well. The Red
Cross told us that Chris was very coherent,'' Lisa McKinney,
Stone's mother-in-law, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's wife, Tricia, and their 4-year old son are living in San
Antonio with McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   While welcoming the initial contact, U.S. officials remained
firm that Milosevic comply with the rules regarding prisoners of
war.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said ``our initial report
is that they were not permitted to meet privately with the
prisoners, as would be their normal practice. They were not
permitted to conduct a medical examination of the prisoners, but
that the prisoners appeared to be in relatively good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said U.S. officials expect Tuesday's promised meeting with
the soldiers ``to take place in accordance with the Geneva
Conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon Spokesman Kenneth Bacon noted that a Serb soldier in
NATO custody has been allowed two visits by the Red Cross. That
soldier was captured April 16 by the Kosovo Liberation Army and
turned over to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's been a radically different treatment by the allied
governments on the one hand, who have worked hard to comply with
the terms of the Geneva Convention, and the Yugoslav government,
which has not complied,'' Bacon said.

AID TO THE POOR HAS STALLED, WORLD BANK SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A generation of helping the poor is in danger of
stalling, the World Bank warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Recent years have seen declining poverty, lengthening life
expectancy and better health. But now it is becoming increasingly
difficult to meet goals that U.N. conferences have set for 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago we confidently predicted that the international
goals of halving poverty, cutting infant and child mortality by
two-thirds and enrolling all children in primary education by the
year 2015 could be met,'' the president of the bank, James D
Wolfensohn, said in a statement. ``Now these goals are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be more cautious of programs that promote growth in
ways that are not sustainable or which save the economy, or at
least the exchange rate, but at the cost of increased poverty,
interrupted education or declining life expectancy,'' the chief
economist of the bank, Joseph Stiglitz, said in introducing the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively gloomy view contrasts with the attitude of a
sister institution of the bank, the International Monetary Fund. On
Sunday, the managing director of the fund, Michel Camdessus, told a
news conference that Asia and Russia had passed the worst of their
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the developing nations from 1991 to 1997,
when growth averaged 5.3 percent a year, ``raised expectations that
the goals set during this decade for 2015 might be obtained,'' the
bank wrote. ``But those expectations must now be tempered _ by the
sudden slowdown of growth in 1998, to be followed almost certainly
by more disappointment in 1999,'' the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   Current forecasts suggest that only China and some other Asian
countries will achieve the target set at the Copenhagen Social
Summit in 1995, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the bank
calculated that the number of people living under the poverty line
of $4 a day has grown, from 14 million in 1989 to 147 million
today.

 Lost Records Can Be Taxing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I own some stock, but have lost the confirmation slip
showing when I bought it and what I paid. I tried to get the
information from my brokerage firm, but they didn't have it in
their records. I want to sell these shares, but I don't know how to
report the capital gain when income-tax time rolls around. Is there
any solution to this problem?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Internal Revenue Service spokesman Joe Calderaro
advises you to make ``the best reasonable estimate'' of your
purchase price and date. ``If the taxpayer makes that effort,
chances are we will go along,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If you can pinpoint an approximate purchase date, your broker
will supply you with the stock's price range on that date.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you won't have to figure the purchase date or price
if you decide instead to give your stock to charity. If you do
that, it won't matter _ to the charity, the IRS, or you _ how much
you paid or when. The only tax consideration will be the value of
your charitable deduction. That will be the market value of the
stock at the time it is transferred to the charity. You can claim
that amount as a deduction on your tax form.
</P>
<P>
   However, you can't eliminate the tax problem by giving the stock
to a family member or other individual, rather than to charity. If
you do that, you will merely be transferring the problem to the
recipient. That's because the recipient's cost basis for the stock
would have to be the same as yours _ whatever that may be.
</P>
<P>
   If you change your mind about selling the stock and hold the
shares until you die, the cost-basis problem will disappear along
with your other earthly woes. When the stock is passed to your
heirs, the cost basis changes to the value of the stock on the day
you died.
</P>
<P>
   IRA Contributions
</P>
<P>
   Q: I opened a Roth Individual Retirement Account last year.
Recently I also began participating in a 401(k) plan through my
employer, and I contribute the maximum allowable amount. Can I
continue contributing to the Roth IRA if I am maxing out my 401(k)?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Yes. Your 401(k) and any IRA you hold are independent.
What you contribute to one doesn't affect how much you are
permitted to contribute to the other.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have more than one IRA account, you may
contribute a total of no more than $2,000 per year to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   You probably will want to contribute the entire $2,000 to your
Roth, because for tax purposes it is better than any other kind of
IRA. Any earnings from your Roth will accumulate tax-free. With
traditional IRAs, the earnings are taxed as ordinary income when
you withdraw the money.
</P>
<P>
   Stock Distribution
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently received shares of a company that was spun off
from another company. The parent company stated that this was a
``tax-free distribution.'' However, I have now sold the spun-off
shares. How do I report the proceeds from the sale on my tax form?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, there isn't a simple answer to this question.
Every case is different, depending on the relative sizes of the
spun-off company and the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   A certain portion of the amount you invested in the parent
company became your cost basis for the spun-off company. What that
portion is I can't say, because you don't identify the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when a company does a spin-off, it sends a letter to
its shareholders spelling out the proper tax treatment. If you
don't have any such letter, call the company headquarters and ask
for the investor relations department.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: You will have to report either a capital
gain or loss on the sale of the spun-off shares.
</P>
<P>
   If the value of the parent-company shares rose since you bought
them, then you will automatically have a capital gain on the
spun-off shares. If the value has gone down, you will report a
capital loss.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase date you should report on your tax form is the date
on which you bought the parent-company shares. If you owned the
parent-company shares for more than a year before selling the
spun-off shares, then your gain (or loss) qualifies as long-term.
If you invested in the parent company less than a year ago, then
your sale was short-term.
</P>
<P>
   For tax purposes, it doesn't matter how long you held the
spun-off shares themselves.
</P>

GOP WANTS ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION FOR KOSOVO OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans are preparing to add $5 billion or more
in Pentagon programs to President Clinton's emergency request for
$6 billion in spending on the Balkans, key members of Congress said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to make Clinton's performance as commander-in-chief a
political issue in next year's elections, they have seized on
Pentagon spending as a hot issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked for $5.1 billion to pay for military operations,
and about $900 million in other funds, most of which would help
refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans contend the Pentagon faces other emergencies,
like the need for munitions and spare parts and for money to
maintain military depots and to conduct an expanded recruiting
drive. Many also want to add a pay increase for Pentagon personnel
to the emergency package.
</P>
<P>
   The additional billions would come from surplus Social Security
revenues, which both parties have said should be sacrosanct. The
use of an emergency appropriation allows lawmakers to add billions
of dollars from the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, has said
he wants a total package of no more than about $11 billion,
including a proposed Pentagon pay raise of more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, who leads the defense panel
of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an interview that
the emergency bill being drawn up by House Republicans could reach
a total of $12 billion _ ``and it could go higher'' if a pay raise
is included. The raise would add between $2 billion and $3 billion
to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are real dollars, and they can be justified as an
emergency circumstance,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, David
Obey of Wisconsin, said the Republican effort to add funding for
the Pentagon was ``the opposite of patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriotism,'' he said, ``is taking what soldiers need and
getting it to them immediately. It's not pouring money into
military contracts for items we can't take off the shelf for two or
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said
the emergency spending bill might not pass if it becomes a
carry-all for other Pentagon programs. ``How you get from $6 to $12
billion is something that has a lot of us interested,'' he said.
``Until we see the specifics, I guess we won't decide on a
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   A proposed House bill for emergency spending will be drawn up by
Thursday, Lewis said. The final bill probably will emerge from a
conference next week.

 &HT;    Business dispute between rock-funk pioneers may have lead to
deaths
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco and Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Roger and Larry Troutman, pioneers of the
rock-funk ``Dayton sound'' of the 1970s who died Sunday in a
murder-suicide, were involved in a family enterprise that had been
struggling financially for most of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Troutman Enterprises rode a wave of success with the family's
band Zapp, whose self-titled debut album hit the pop top 20 in
1980, then scored a major hit with the song More Bounce to the
Ounce. Roger Troutman eventually went solo, recording under the
name ``Roger.'' He hit No. 1 in 1987 with the single I Want to Be
Your Man.
</P>
<P>
   The company was established in 1980 by the five Troutman
Brothers _ Larry, Rufus, Roger, Lester and Terry.
</P>
<P>
   The business expanded in 1982 into rehabilitating older
properties and building new homes by hiring and training unskilled
people.
</P>
<P>
   The company suffered a downturn in the early 1990s when funding
fell through for a deal to build 25 homes, putting the corporation
in a ``cash crunch,'' according to U.S. Bankruptcy Court files.
</P>
<P>
   The company plunged into bankruptcy April 23, 1992, listing $3.8
million in debts and $414,800 owed in delinquent taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy case remains open. The last filing of Oct. 12,
1998, listed $7,299.72 in a money market account.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County Coroner's Office,
said the office did not know why the shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coroner James Davis said at a news conference the
shooting may have involved a business dispute between the brothers,
with Larry objecting to ``Roger going out on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger had recently jump-started his career, finding new
audiences with the song California Love , a Grammy-nominated
collaboration with hip-hop superstars Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre. He
released a greatest-hits album in 1996 and apparently planned to
tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Roger was shot four times as he tried to leave Larry's car
Sunday morning, according to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Troutman then drove off and killed himself minutes later
with a single shot to the head, using the same. 357 Smith &AMP; Wesson
revolver whose shots killed his brother, the coroner's office
determined. The gun was recovered in Larry's Lincoln, which crashed
into a tree on the 2100 block of Harvard Boulevard. Larry Troutman,
54, was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Troutman, 47, was found in an alley behind Catalpa Drive,
near the music studios his family owned, about 7:20 a.m. He died
later at Good Samaritan Hospital and Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered four gunshot wounds to the torso, two in the front
and two in the back, said Betz.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Troutman, brother of Roger and Larry, said Monday morning
he did not have any idea what happened between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have none,'' he said, ``None whatsoever. We'll just have to
put it together and depend on the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Troutman thanked the city of Dayton for support for the
family, both during its musical heyday and following Sunday's
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grieving,'' he said. ``It's very, very hard for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements will not be made until today, Lester
Troutman said. He would not discuss the family's business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy file showed a company with high aspirations
struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troutman Enterprises maintains that the black community is a
vital resource that is often overlooked by both the private and
public sectors,'' states a brief filed by Dayton attorney Ruth A.
Slone. ``They have demonstrated that commitment by the hiring and
training of unskilled, and often hardcore, unemployed blacks into
all endeavors of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Moves to cut payroll and sell some real estate fell short.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.344 million in secured claims included $2.18 million in
mortgages on more than 50 parcels of real estate valued at $2.319
million, according to court records
</P>
<P>
   Creditors included Time Warner - $360,000; Warner Brothers
Records Inc. _ $870,000; First National Bank of Dayton _ $245,000;
and First National Bank of Southwestern Ohio _ $1.221 million. It
was also listed in 12 pending lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the U.S. government sought to have the bankruptcy
converted from reorganization to liquidation, citing delinquent
taxes, including $159,806 owed to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 4, 1996, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thomas F. Waldron
approved the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Originally part of Zapp, Larry left the band to devote himself
full-time to business matters. He was president of Troutman
Enterprises, and used the nickname ``Dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   He also got in trouble with the law in 1968, when he served 29
days of a 30-day sentence for assault and battery in his native
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Larry was fired in 1969 from the Frigidaire division of General
Motors, where he worked as an assembler, following a brawl with
company guards. He later said he fought with guards because they
wanted to search him as he left the plant, but wouldn't allow other
black workers to witness the search. ``Incidently, I won the
fight,'' he said in 1972, one year after he lost an appeal of the
firing.
</P>
<P>
   The company's report to an umpire said Troutman bit one guard's
hand, hit a second in the nose, and broke a plant foreman's
eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Troutman was one of seven people _ as was his brother
Rufus _ who were fired from the Shawen Acres Children's Home in
1975 following a Montgomery County Sheriff's Office investigation
into allegations of child abuse and excessive discipline. The seven
were reinstated in 1976. Larry Troutman was head of youth leaders
at the home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a long way from cyberspace to Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   On an electronic message board on the Internet, shareholders of
United Companies Financial Corp. have been engaged for weeks in an
emotional ether-world debate over how to save their faltering
company, a high-risk lender in Baton Rouge, La., that filed for
bankruptcy protection on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for them, the company's fate is actually being
decided in the real world of U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,
where a committee of powerful creditors _ banks and bondholders,
mostly _ is trying to retrieve the $1.3 billion the company owes
them.
</P>
<P>
   And however outspoken they may be in virtual reality,
shareholders typically stand at the end of the line in bankruptcy
court. By law the company's first obligation is to satisfy the
valid claims of its creditors. Frequently, stockholders can do
little but watch as their shares are canceled and new stock is
distributed to settle the company's debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet may be about to change that balance of power.
At least that is the hope of the group of United Companies
shareholders who have banded together in cyberspace to seek a voice
in the real-world negotiations in Delaware, where many companies
are incorporated because of its light regulatory touch and
efficient courts that enforce a well-established body of corporate
law.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort, being hailed by some as a first in shareholder
activism, could set the stage for a mammoth collision of cultures,
said Michael J. Venditto of Kensington &AMP; Ressler, a New York law
firm that does both bankruptcy work and Internet company
financings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy doesn't proceed at the pace of cyberspace _ just
the opposite,'' Venditto said. While the Internet celebrates speed
and instant information, the slow and stately bankruptcy process is
deliberately designed to give a struggling company breathing space
to plan and meet with creditors. ``The two arenas are entirely
incompatible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Stoller, a professor of rhetoric at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill., and a leader of the message-board
activists, acknowledged that bankruptcy court was alien territory
for him. But he argued that the Internet's lightning pace was
exactly what allowed small shareholders to find one another quickly
and seek out the expertise they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the electronic manifestation of Ben Franklin's famous
line that we must all hang together or we will surely all hang
separately,'' said the professor, who owns just under 60,000 shares
of United Companies stock.
</P>
<P>
   United Companies, a fixture in Baton Rouge, was a major player
in the once-exuberant ``subprime'' loan market, lending money at
high rates to borrowers who could not get more affordable loans
elsewhere and then selling packages of those loans to Wall Street
investors hungry to earn high yields.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's own cost of borrowing skyrocketed after Russia
defaulted on its debt last summer, which prompted investors to flee
the riskier corners of the credit market. By March, its cash-flow
problems were so severe that it filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11, reporting assets of about $1.3 billion and liabilities
of $1.25 billion. Now, its liabilities have risen to roughly $1.3
billion, while the realizable value of the company's assets has
probably shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   The company's increasingly visible problems have demolished the
price of its stock, some of which was owned by its employees
through an employee stock ownership plan. Shares that fetched as
much as $76 apiece in 1993 can now be had for less than 25 cents,
wiping out many employees' retirement savings and igniting a
firestorm of anger and suspicion among shareholders and employees
alike.
</P>
<P>
   That hostility flooded into a Yahoo message board, at
http://messages.yahoo.com/?action(EQ)q&AMP;board(EQ)UC. There,
investors and employees met to trade angry opinions, alarming
rumors and minute dissections of the latest news. But in the weeks
since the bankruptcy filing, the message-board participants have
done something far less common: Guided by Stoller, they have formed
what he calls an ``ad hoc alliance'' and persuaded a bankruptcy
lawyer, Michael D. Warner of Fort Worth, Texas, to represent the
group _ free, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Warner formally asked the Office of the U.S. Trustee
in Philadelphia, which oversees the Delaware bankruptcy process, to
give the shareholders a voice in the negotiations. He asked the
trustee to approve the formation of an equity committee, which
would be entitled to legal representation and could apply to the
court to recover its legal fees from the debtor.
</P>
<P>
   In his petition, Warner noted that he represented the holders of
2.1 million of the company's 28 million outstanding shares _ or
about 20 percent of the 10.4 million shares that are not owned by
insiders. According to Stoller, more than a hundred people have
stepped from behind their message-board aliases to enlist in the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said he did not expect a decision until next week at the
earliest. If the answer is no, the shareholders can appeal to U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, Warner arranged for a Delaware lawyer to appear on
behalf of the shareholders at a court hearing before Ms. Walrath
Monday in Wilmington to raise objections to the procedures the
company has proposed for auctioning off some of its assets. The
outcome of that hearing could not be determined Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said that he was not aware of any other Internet chat
room or message board that has organized itself to play a formal
role in a bankruptcy case. ``I just wish the group had acted
sooner,'' he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stoller acknowledged that shareholders waited too long to make
the shift from ``a purely cyberspace medium to one in which we were
starting to pull the levers that the three-dimensional world
provides.''
</P>
<P>
   But delay is just one of the hazards that lawyers and bankruptcy
experts see in the approach taken by Stoller's alliance. There's
also the risk of running afoul of federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a staff lawyer at the Securities and Exchange
Commission telephoned Aaron Brown, another leader of the ad hoc
alliance and a finance professor at Yeshiva University, to instruct
him about the disclosure requirements the SEC imposes on
shareholders who take collective action. Such groups typically are
required to file a form 13-D to inform the marketplace of their
agenda and their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very friendly and helpful,'' Brown said. ``My
conclusion after talking to him is that we should file, and I'm
working on that now.''
</P>
<P>
   And a close reading of the message board in the weeks after the
bankruptcy shows that such forums provide an abundant opportunity
for misinformation and even manipulation, given the complexities of
bankruptcy and the highly illiquid market for bankruptcy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   United Companies was kicked off the New York Stock Exchange
after its bankruptcy filing, and its shares now trade only in the
electronic ``pink sheets,'' the OTC Bulletin Board. Posted messages
show that investors who were unfamiliar with this intensely
speculative and illiquid marketplace were nevertheless encouraged
by others in the group to buy more shares _ shares that their
anonymous advisers might actually have been selling.
</P>
<P>
   Many other investors have posted messages that reveal a profound
misunderstanding of the risks of buying stock in any bankrupt
company _ the chief one being that the shares will be rendered
worthless by the bankruptcy settlement. Moreover, United Companies,
like most bankrupt corporations, has not been able to file its
financial statements in a timely fashion, leaving investors to rely
on outdated quarterly statements from last September.
</P>
<P>
   Stoller and his supporters are not blind to these risks but say
that they are far outweighed by the way the Internet empowers the
shareholders of troubled companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we are not successful in Delaware, we will have done
something very important,'' Stoller said. ``We will have put this
management on notice that its actions are being closely observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the troubled company engaged the prominent
turnaround advisory firm of Jay Alix &AMP; Associates in Detroit and
hired Deborah Hicks Midanek, a seasoned turnaround manager, to
serve as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Midanek has been scrambling to find ways to cut the
company's overhead, complete its necessary financial audits and
preserve the value of the $6.5 billion portfolio of securitized
subprime loans in which it has a residual stake. She simply did not
have the time, she said, to monitor and respond to the outraged
postings on the message board.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Ms. Midanek had been a frequent target of angry
message board participants, including Stoller, who complained
bitterly that she did not respond to the group's demands for
information.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as shareholders are trying to step from cyberspace into
the courtroom, management apparently has become more conciliatory.
Indeed, Brown was scheduled to attend a meeting Tuesday in Baton
Rouge with Ms. Midanek and the company's top officers.
</P>
<P>
   The financial outcome of this campaign is still uncertain, and
some smart players in the takeover market are betting that there
will be little, if anything, left for shareholders after United
Companies settles its creditors' claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is struggling to keep body and soul together,''
said Christopher Beard, the publisher of the Turnaround &AMP; Workouts
newsletter in Washington. ``If that effort fails, there is nothing
left to fight over.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the outcome of this particular case, bankruptcy
experts are intrigued by its implications for organizing
shareholders in the bankruptcy process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to become the norm,'' Warner, the
lawyer, said. ``Thanks to the Internet, I think you'll see more
publicly traded cases where an equity committee is going to be
formed.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, several bankruptcy lawyers agreed, bankruptcy
negotiations could become longer, more complicated and more
expensive. But they also may become fairer, at least for a bankrupt
company's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have someone looking out for a group that usually
doesn't have anyone looking out for them,'' Warner observed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Stoller's campaign is already being talked
about, at least in cyberspace. Last Wednesday, an anonymous
correspondent known as ``Stinger707'' posted a notice on the
message board for followers of United Companies. ``Word of your
hard work to have a voice in the affairs of your company is
spreading,'' the correspondent wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The writer said he was visiting from the message board for the
lackluster Sunshine Mining and Refining, whose participants have
grown frustrated with the company's puny stock price but who were
unsure how to make themselves heard. He invited someone from
Stoller's group to visit the Sunshine message board to ``outline
the steps that we should take to gain the attention of our
management.''

RUSSIAN MINISTER SAYS MILOSEVIC WILL MAKE CONCESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As an American envoy arrived here for talks on Kosovo,
Russia's foreign minister said Monday that President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia was prepared to make concessions, but that
NATO would also have to bend if the conflict was to be brought to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks of the foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, came a day
after President Boris Yeltsin of Russia telephoned President
Clinton about Kosovo, and coincided with the arrival of Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to pursue the possibilities of
Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ivanov did not proclaim any major breakthrough in an
hourlong interview, he laid down the cooperation that Russia
expected from both sides if it was to proceed as interlocutor. With
Milosevic still unbowed after more than a month of intensive
bombing, NATO and the United States have been seeking to involve
Russia, a country with traditional links to Yugoslavia, in the
search for a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't serve as a postman. We won't deliver NATO's
ultimatums to Belgrade,'' Ivanov said. ``That is not our mission.
If there is an ultimatum from one side and then an ultimatum from
the other side there is no maneuver for negotiation. There should
be cooperation on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering a preview of what Milosevic was prepared to concede,
Ivanov said that the Yugoslav president was ready to reduce his
forces in Kosovo to the level they were at in October, before the
Serbian military began preparing for its offensive against ethnic
Albanians there. Ivanov said that Milosevic had also agreed in very
general terms to allow an international presence to police a
settlement in Kosovo, though crucial details remain to be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Minister acknowledged that the Yugoslav
proposals, which were made in recent talks with former Prime
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on Kosovo,
fell well short of NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   But he said they represented a starting point for serious
discussions on ending the Kosovo conflict, and warned that a
political settlement would not be achieved if the Western alliance
refused to negotiate on its demands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yugoslav proposals outlined by Ivanov on Monday
suggested that there is still an enormous gap between NATO and
Belgrade. Negotiations to bring the fighting to an end appear to be
at a very early stage and it remained far from clear that Russia
would prove to be the successful mediator the West is hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   The West's decision to welcome Russia's diplomatic involvement
stands in sharp contrast to the 1991 conflict in the Persian Gulf,
when Yevgeni Primakov's efforts at shuttle diplomacy were regarded
by Washington as a meddlesome effort to protect Saddam Hussein from
defeat. Primakov, now prime minister, was then director of Russia's
foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   This time, NATO seemed anxious to give the Russians a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's mission, American officials said, is to learn the
details of the proposals Milosevic made to Chernomyrdin. It is
also, they say, to explain NATO's demands to the Russians so that
they can continue their mediating role with a better understanding
of what the Western alliance can and cannot agree to.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac telephoned Yeltsin on Monday and
urged him to keep up the political pressure on Yugoslavia, French
officials said. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is also scheduled
to arrive this week for talks with Russian leaders on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For all the diplomatic movement, nobody denied that NATO and
Yugoslavia are far apart. Belgrade's offer to slash it troops is a
case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov portrayed Milosevic's readiness to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to their October level as a significant concession, hinting
that Belgrade might we willing to make still further cuts.
According to NATO estimates, Yugoslavia had about 22,500 military
and interior ministry troops in Kosovo in October, compared with
some 40,000 now.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav proposal does not come close to meeting NATO's
demands. The alliance has insisted that Yugoslavia withdraw
virtually all of its forces from Kosovo, saying that ethnic
Albanian refugees will never return as long as the Serb units that
attacked them remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that those Serb military forces, police or
para-military units who are responsible for the ethnic cleansing
and war crimes in Kosovo can stay is a non-starter,'' said James P.
Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of an international force is even more difficult, the
Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started from a position where Belgrade refused to accept
any foreign military presence, including a Russian one,'' Ivanov
said. ``After our official talks, Belgrade has officially confirmed
its readiness to accept an international presence under the
auspices of the United Nations. For now, this question has not gone
any further. Talks are under way about its composition and other
things, but this work is in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Russia was prepared to send peacekeeping troops, but
that it would be very difficult for Milosevic to accept a force
that was essentially under NATO's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself in the place of Yugoslav's leaders,'' he said.
``Would you allow the same people who destroyed your country to
carry out the peacekeeping operation?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, NATO has insisted that it play the major role in
any peacekeeping operation. Thousands of British soldiers are now
assembling in Macedonia for precisely this mission and Britain's
Defense Minister has said that it is just a matter of time before
they are deployed. Lightly-armed U.N. peacekeepers, NATO says, will
not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of a credible military presence, Kosovo
refugees cannot come back, and we are determined to create the
conditions for them to come back,'' Rubin said. ``A force with NATO
at its core will provide the magnet for them to return.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond negotiating proposals and tactics, Russia and NATO have
issued wildly divergent accounts of how the war is going.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have insisted there are signs that political and
economic elites in Belgrade have grown unhappy with the war and
that the Milosevic regime might crack soon under the strain. Senior
British officials have even argued that the air strikes are so
punishing that an allied ground force might be able to move into
Kosovo in several months against minimal resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivanov insisted this is a misreading of the situation.
Foreign Minister said Moscow had warned alliance officials that its
air strikes would plunge the region into chaos and asserted that a
ground war would have horrific casualties for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We warned that as soon as the bombing started there would be a
flow of refugees,'' Ivanov said. ``It was also clear that the
strikes wouldn't undermine Milosevic's position. On the contrary,
his position has strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we still warn that if the ground operation begins, it will
lead to large casualities, including on the side that carries out
this operation,'' Ivanov added. You should know the history of
World War II. There won't be a quick ground operation just as there
has not been a quick air operation.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials argue that they put off air strikes for months as
they pursued a diplomatic solution. They say that the conflict in
Kosovo might have been avoided had Moscow had more leverage over
Belgrade and been willing to use what leverage it does possess to
induce Milosevic to agree to the autonomy accord for the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, however, argued that Russia can cajole, press, but not
force Milosevic to agree to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for whether Russia can persuade Milosevic, I must ask
another question: can the United States persuade the Israeli
government to implement what was signed in Washington in the
presence of the United States president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has done nothing to bring the situation to what it is
today,'' he added. ``Russia is ready, not alone, but together with
others, to solve this political conflict. Everybody must
participate in the process.''

RELIGIOUS LEADERS DETERMINED TO GO TO BELGRADE TO SEEK SOLDIERS'
RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A combination of canceled flights, logistical
problems and antagonism from administration officials stalled the
plans of religious leaders to travel to Belgrade on Monday to seek
the release of three captive American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the organizer of the mission, said the
group will try to get to the Yugoslav capital by an overland route
this week to take advantage of a written promise from the
Yugoslavian mission to the United Nations that the group of
Christian, Jewish and Muslim clergy could visit the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that if we could see them and make a humanitarian
appeal for their release, it could be a kind of circuit breaker,''
Jackson said. ``We want to break this cycle of bomb and cleanse,
cleanse and bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission, which began to take shape last week, has run into
stiff resistance from the administration. Several of the 14 people
scheduled to take part in the trip said they had received calls
over the last few days from White House officials urging them not
to go.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the message was that the trip was not safe. In
other cases, the officials argued that the trip would provide a
propaganda bonanza for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
without producing much in the way of credible evidence that the
Serbs are ready to meet NATO demands for an end to ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Joan Campbell, the general-secretary of the
National Council of the Churches in Christ in the United States,
said the pressure from the White House on different religious
organizations to derail the Belgrade visit has been intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really impressive and unique delegation of religious
leaders,'' she said, adding that its efforts to search for a way to
stop Serb atrocities in Kosovo and bring an end to the NATO bombing
campaign should be allowed to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants in the mission are Nazir Uddin Khaja,
president of the board of the American Muslim Council; Steven
Bennett Jacobs, a Los Angeles rabbi; the Rev. Raymond Glen Helmick,
a Roman Catholic priest from Boston; Bishop Marshall L. Meadors,
Jr., of the United Methodist Church in Jackson, Miss.; the Rev.
Leonid Kishkovsky, an official of the Orthodox Church in America;
and Rt. Rev. Kodic Mitrophan, bishop of the Eastern American
Diocese in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's private missions to war zones and international
conflicts have produced results in the past. In 1990, after meeting
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, he negotiated the release of
several hundred hostages who were being held by the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contention, then and now, is that wherever there are
releases, it gives a breathing space, a window for talks,'' he
said. ``You're looking to break the no-talk policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Jackson helped arrange the release of a Navy pilot, Lt.
Robert O. Goodman Jr., who had been shot down over Syria.

ZAMBRANO SAYS NO HARD FEELINGS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Answering questions for the first time since
he was fired last week as coach of the Los Angeles Galaxy, Octavio
Zambrano wished the team luck and said, ``I harbor no ill feelings
toward anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, who had refused comment since his firing Thursday, set
up his own conference call with reporters and avoided comments
critical of team management or new coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Sigi and his players the very best,'' said Zambrano,
who left Major League Soccer with the best career winning
percentage (.684) and record (39-18) among MLS coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the last game (a 1-0 victory over San Jose) and I
rooted for the Galaxy. They will always be a sentimental team for
me because this is where I got my break.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, fired after his team started the season 2-3, said he
had heard rumors for some time that Galaxy president Tim Leiweke
coveted Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dismissal came as a complete surprise because it was so
early in the season,'' Zambrano said. ``I thought we were well on
our way to achieve the desired level. It was only a matter of time
for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe that management wanted the present coach from
the beginning and as soon as he was available, he was put in
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the change is what bothered Zambrano the most.
Leiweke had a chance to hire Schmid in October. Many people felt
Schmid wanted to finish the UCLA season and his commitment with the
U.S. U-20 national team before moving on.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Schmid finished his U-20 commitment a week ago, he
was named head coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Zambrano was the man Leiweke wanted from the beginning, he
could have offered Zambrano a multiyear contract. Instead, he gave
a three-year deal to Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, showing his loyalty to the end, promised Leiweke he
wouldn't make a statement until after Schmid's press conference. In
return, Zambrano said Leiweke told him he would be thanked for his
time served.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would handle it with dignity and respect,''
Zambrano said. ``It was supposed to be more about Sigi, not about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly was Leiweke's explanation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had asked Octavio to work on creating a better relationship
and a better style of communications within the players,'' Leiweke
said. ``It became pretty obvious in the past week that was still an
issue. The players wanted to be coached. They wanted to be told
what they're doing right and what they're doing wrong and that
wasn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Upset with the personal attacks, Zambrano declined comment over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for any of that (personal attacks),''
Zambrano said. ``I think I have always handled myself with fairness
and integrity. I don't want to create an ambience of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach I have to respect their decision. Whatever reasons
they had I have to accept it. Soccer is such a small circle and my
intentions are to coach again in this country and I don't want to
be in a situation where I'm in a confrontation with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say during a prepared statement that his teams were
always prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``My record should speak for itself,'' Zambrano said. ``We had a
game plan and we executed it most of the time. At halftime, we
would talk about key tactical issues needed to be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took steps to correct any problems that we may have had when
I became aware of them. I brought our captains, both Robin (Fraser)
and Cobi (Jones), to talk about issues. I don't know why anyone
would say something to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano said he has other offers outside the country but he
will take a few weeks to clear his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a coach and that's definitely what I do,'' he said. ``I'll
let a little time go by and make some decisions later.''

DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER THREATENS TO LEAD PROTEST OVER CENSORSHIP OF
TV STUDIO
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia,
Vuk Draskovic, pledged on Monday night to lead street protests
against President Slobodan Milosevic if military control over the
Studio B television station here was not immediately lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, the most liberal member of the weak federal
government, said a military officer went to the station on Monday
evening and prevented the rebroadcast of an interview that
Draskovic gave on Sunday evening. His party, the Serbian Renewal
Movement, runs Belgrade, and, thus, Studio B.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he said that he was sure that Milosevic ``would
overturn this stupid decision.'' If not, ``I will fight against Mr.
Milosevic,'' he said. ``We will enter the streets and demonstrate
in the streets against this anti-democratic action.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sunday interview, Draskovic urged the government to seek
a compromise peace in the war over Kosovo, recognize that NATO
cannot be defeated and accept a U.N. armed force, including some
NATO troops, inside Kosovo to implement a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Draskovic insisted that Milosevic
supported ``the general direction'' of his remarks, and then said:
``I think he does. I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Most observers here interpreted Draskovic's comments, most of
which he has made before, as a new effort to lobby Milosevic to
settle the Kosovo matter and stop the escalating destruction of
Yugoslavia's military and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen welcomed Draskovic's remarks on Monday as a sign,
as the British defense minister, George Robertson, said, ``that
inside the system the facade of unity is cracking wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic, while speaking for many ordinary Serbs,
especially in Belgrade, is not ``inside the system.'' He claims he
joined the Milosevic government in January not to support it, but
to change it. Many Serbs who supported him when he helped lead
anti-Milosevic demonstrations in 1996-97 regard him as an
opportunist trying to position himself for a more democratic
future.
</P>
<P>
   But few regard Draskovic as a serious challenge to the power of
Milosevic, particularly during wartime, and some senior Yugoslav
officials on Monday night wondered whether he is seeking a way to
get fired from the government _ or even arrested _ to distance
himself from responsibility for a wearying and ugly war.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic's challenge on Monday night, however bold it
seemed, was also confusing and a touch bizarre, since it seemed
based on at least some misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had made repeated attacks on the facilities and
transmitters of Serbian state television, where at least 12 people
died, six of whom were buried in an emotional ceremony on Monday,
while another 20 are still missing. Given the damage, the Serbian
government on Monday got all the stations _ including Studio B _ to
agree to a wartime requirement to transmit state television's news
at its regularly scheduled time.
</P>
<P>
   Studio B and another private station, Politika, did so on Monday
night for the first time. But they also ran their own news
bulletins, which have been subject to wartime censorship in any
event.
</P>
<P>
   All the channels also were required to have a military censor on
site to vet the news, to prevent military secrets from being shown.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic charged that at 6 p.m. on Monday night, an army
major came to Studio B and sent the regular editor home. The major
oversaw the transmission of the state news, vetted the Studio B
news and, Draskovic said, banned the retransmission of the Sunday
interview. According to staff at Studio B on Monday night, the
major then left and programming went on as before.
</P>
<P>
   But in a fiery and somewhat wandering news conference at his
party headquarters and then, later, at a hotel where many foreign
journalists are staying, Draskovic laid down his challenge to
Milosevic to remove the military editor or face street
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic insisted that having spoken to Milosevic ``a few days
ago'' about how to settle the Kosovo problem, he ``got the
impression President Milosevic is doing and thinking in the same
way I'm doing. I believe I am right.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said: ``I believe _ I hope _ President Milosevic
supports my program.''
</P>
<P>
   But in public, Milosevic has only agreed to the idea of an
unarmed U.N. ``presence'' in Kosovo made up of civilian observers
from non-NATO nations.
</P>
<P>
   On the war in Kosovo, Draskovic is speaking sense, many Serbs
say, and he may embolden what remains of the democratic opposition
here to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people must know reality, and our small nation, very brave
and very proud, must respect reality,'' he said on Monday. ``We
cannot defeat NATO. We must recognize the fact that the world today
is often ruled by the rule of power, and not the rule of law. We
must be very brave and approach compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that an armed U.N. force to monitor a Kosovo
deal and the return of refugees would not be a violation of Serbian
or Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Belgrade newsletter VIP suggested that Draskovic
was playing for high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``More likely than not, Draskovic will fail in his plans to
establish an alternative to the regime, but he has opened cracks in
what has so far been a monolithic political structure in Serbia,
which has allowed Milosevic to claim that his policy in Kosovo is
supported by both the ruling parties and the opposition,'' the
newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
   In a darker note to the day, more than 1,000 people gathered in
front of the city morgue to honor and bury six employees at the
state television facility who were killed last Friday in a NATO
airstrike. The dead were technicians, a make-up artist and security
guards working the night shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unprecedented atrocity was committed against all 7,000
television staff,'' editor-in-chief Dragoljub Milanovic told the
mourners.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As he planned the assault on Columbine High
School, Eric Harris wrote in a diary that he envisioned killing as
many as 500 students, going on to attack neighboring homes and then
hijacking a jet and crashing it in New York City, police
investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Harris or his accomplice, Dylan
Klebold, took any steps to carry out this grander scheme, but Steve
Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department,
said, ``If in fact they were able to carry out their entire plan,
there could have been quite a bit more damage and quite a few more
fatalities.'' The officials did not release the contents of the
diary.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a week after Harris and Dylan Klebold brought guns and as
many as 30 pipe bombs to school, killing 12 students and one
teacher before taking their own lives, the police on Monday
questioned and later released an 18-year-old girlfriend of one of
the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a female who I believe had access to this weapon
prior to Tuesday,'' Dave Thomas, the Jefferson County district
attorney said, referring to a semiautomatic TEC-9 pistol recovered
with the suspects' bodies. ``We are looking into how she got access
to that weapon, and what involvement she may have had.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney and the police spokesman emphasized that
no arrests were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not called her a suspect at the time, by any means _
there is no arrest warrant either,'' Davis said. Responding to a
reporter's question about the four guns found in the school, he
answered, ``She was questioned on the handgun and the rifle, not
the shotguns.'' The authorities here say most of the victims'
wounds were appear to have been caused by two sawed-off shotguns
the pair carried rather than the TEC-9 or a 9-millimeter
semiautomatic carbine rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four guns recovered, Davis has said that the two shotguns
appear to have been manufactured more 25 years ago. He added that
records indicate the pistol and the carbine were purchased recently
from a Colorado gun dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Under Colorado and federal law, a minor cannot own a handgun,
and it is illegal to give or sell a handgun to someone under 18. It
is legal for someone 18 or older to buy a handgun through a private
sale, reached through a classified advertisement or a gun show. In
contrast, federally licensed dealers are not allowed to sell
handguns to someone under 21.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, where surveys indicate that almost half of
households have guns, there are gun fairs almost every weekend. At
these shows, private sellers do not have to conduct background
checks on buyers. Bob Glass, a federally licensed firearms dealer
in Boulder, said of the fairs, ``It's cash and a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continued into last week's rampage,
funerals were held Monday for the teacher and three of the students
slain. The teacher, William Sanders, 47, was shot twice in the
chest as he led students down a hallway to safety. Services were
also held for Lauren Townsend, 18, the captain of the girls'
varsity volleyball; Daniel Rohrbough, 15, who was shot while
holding a door open for fleeing students; and Cassie Bernall, 17.
</P>
<P>
   With bomb squad investigators continuing to search the grounds,
Davis spoke to reporters outside the cordoned-off school. There
remain ``many, many lockers to go through, many, many backpacks to
go through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold, who were both seniors at Columbine, had
apparently pinned their hopes on blowing up their school to a
25-pound propane bomb in the school's kitchen that they had planned
to detonate. When the timing device failed, Davis said, ``there
were indications that they had possibly tried to fire on that
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office said
Monday that toxicology tests on the bodies of the two youths did
not show traces of drugs or alcohol. In addition, Davis said that
investigators had not found any illicit drugs or drug paraphernalia
at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the parents of the two youths had hired lawyers and had
not spoken with investigators since last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Tuesday's attack, the parents of Brooks Brown, a
classmate of the suspects, have disclosed that they notified the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department eight times last year with
complaints that Harris, a neighbor, had threatened their son. The
couple, Randy and Judy Brown, said that after Harris chipped the
windshield of their son's car, he created a computer game that
revolved around destroying the Brown house and created a web site
that featured a death threat against their son and accounts of
manufacturing and exploding pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harris and Klebold were on probation at the time,
Jefferson County detectives never followed up on the complaints,
the Browns have said. On Monday, Davis said that a ``suspicious
incident'' report had been located. Later, he added, ``This is part
of the ongoing investigation and I do not want to make any comments
about that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said, ``As far as I know, nothing was ever brought to my
office.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While trading at the nation's four busiest stock exchanges came
to a halt for one minute at noon Monday in memory of the 13
victims, this Denver suburb endured a numbing marathon of funerals.
About 2,500 people turned out for the funeral of Sander's, who had
taught and coached at the school for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday as shots rang out at lunch, Sanders, a grandfather,
jumped on a table in the school cafeteria and shouted for students
to duck, and then to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running around, and I remember seeing him jumping over
the chairs and yelling `Everybody get down!''' Lindsay Dowling, a
student recalled. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many other
people's.''
</P>
<P>
   As he ran through the halls, herding students to safety, the
teacher was shot twice in the chest. After taking him into a
barricaded classroom, students tried to keep his spirits up by
showing him wallet photos of his wife and three daughters. But he
died shortly after being freed by the police, the only teacher to
die in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank him for saving my life,'' Laurel Salerno,
another student who escaped the cafeteria, said in a church
overflowing with students. ``Mr. Sanders, I thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at the same time, another 1,000 mourners attended the
funeral of Bernall, a junior, who often wore a bracelet inscribed
``WWJD'' _ shorthand for `What would Jesus do?'
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, one of the attackers cornered her in the library,
trained a gun on her, looked in her blue eyes, and asked if she
believed in God. After a pause, surviving students have recounted,
Bernall, a born-again Christian, answered deliberately, ``Yes, I
believe in God.'' He then shot her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cassie died a martyr's death,'' Pastor George Kristen, of the
West Bowled Community Church said. ``She went to the martyr's hall
of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, a funeral was held for Townsend, a National
Honor Society scholar, She was to have been the class valedictorian
at graduation ceremonies next month.
</P>
<P>
   The last funeral of the day was for Rohrbough, a freshman. He
was last seen alive running from his stalkers and screaming for his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures warmed in Denver, hundreds of people continued
to make somber pilgrimages to a memorial site in a park near the
high school. Many parked a half-mile away to add flowers to the
thousands of bouquets already there.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 students from other high schools marched up to nine
miles to the site. Referring to the killers, one held a placard to
passing cars, ``There are more of us than there are of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a teen-ager,'' said one marcher, Morgen Warner, a junior
from Jefferson County Open School. ``This affects me more deeply
than any adult could even begin to comprehend.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. Army Apache attack helicopter crashed and
burned in Albania Monday night during a training flight in
preparation for combat missions inside neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and co-pilot escaped serious injury, were rescued and
flown in an army medical helicopter to a temporary military
hospital at an airport near the Albanian capital of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial reports indicate that they're in good condition,''
said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. He did not release the names
of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The $60-million Apache, built to fly low and fast in the pursuit
of tanks, was the second U.S. aircraft to be lost since NATO
launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred two miles north of the base built over the
past week for the Apaches at an airfield near the Albanian capital
of Tirana, said Whitman. He said he had no details on the cause of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches have been assembling in Tirana in recent days. They
have yet to fly combat missions inside the embattled Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, but were expected to be ordered soon to strike
at Serb troops deployed across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches are part of the latest escalation in the NATO air
campaign against Yugoslavia. The Pentagon announced Monday that it
is poised to call up thousands of reservists as early as this
weekend to bolster U.S. forces in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the reservists would be
called up ``very quickly.'' He also said an additional 30 large
refueling tankers would be flown to NATO bases this weekend, as
what he called a ``down payment,'' on a total of 300 warplanes and
support craft requested by the NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tankers will help NATO step up attacks on
bridges, oil and ammunition storage facilities, Serb troops and
tanks in the field and other military targets, said Bacon, part of
a campaign designed to coerce Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Yugoslavia, into agreeing to NATO's terms for peace
with Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to press that goal forward through diplomacy, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is in Moscow for a Tuesday
meeting with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin held extensive talks
with Milosevic last week in Belgrade, amid signs that the Serb
leader might be prepared to make some concessions to end the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In a faint but welcomed ray of hopeful news, Milosevic allowed
International Committee of the Red Cross chief Cornelio Sommaruga
to meet for 15 minutes with three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia since March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into each other's eyes and shook hands very
warmly,'' Sommaruga told reporters. A Red Cross doctor and
representative were scheduled to meet for a longer period with the
three Americans on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the Red Cross meeting was welcomed, but
still did not meet the standards set forth in the Geneva Convention
for the treatment of troops captured amid hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty five days late, they have had a chance to review the
Geneva Convention and have found a way to, in however bare and
minimum form, start the process of doing what it demands,'' said
White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart. ``It is our expectation that
they will be seen by doctors in the coming days.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of possible cracks in Milosevic's regime, Yugoslav
Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic called on the government to ``stop
lying to the people in Serbia,'' and admit that it can no longer
sustain further NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people should be told that NATO is not facing a breakdown,
that Russia will not help Yugoslavia militarily and that the world
public opinion is against us,'' Draskovic, a former opposition
leader co-opted by Milosevic, said on local Studio B television.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference later Monday, Draskovic said his country
should accept the presence of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
if it is approved by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of such a force is a key NATO demand for halting
the bombing. So far, Milosevic has refused to permit such a force,
saying it would amount to a military occupation and a violation of
Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal right is to wish no participation of NATO
countries in U.N. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,'' Draskovic said.
``But if the Security Council of the U.N. says the U.N. mission
must composed on the basis of part of NATO countries, we must
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials were skeptical and unsure whether the
remarks were meant to signal that Milosevic was seeking a
face-saving way out of the conflict or whether they meant nothing
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk Draskovic is no friend of NATO,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea. ``But at least, the statements that he made . . . show
that there are senior members of the Yugoslav government that are
beginning to recognize the reality of the situation that Yugoslavia
is in.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said it was Talbott's
mission to try to ferret out any possible diplomatic openings --
provided the solution meets NATO's key demands. Those are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  an end to Serb repression in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the admission of an international peacekeeping force with NATO
at its ``core'';
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the guarantee of safe return for more than one million ethnic
Albanians estimated to have been run from their homes by Serb
forces;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and a political settlement that guarantees autonomy for
Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and Russia have agreed on many of the objectives . . . they
basically entail getting the refugees who were expelled back and
creating a situation where the Serb forces, the military police and
paramilitary forces are out,'' said Rubin. ``With respect to what
an international force would look like, we have not yet agreed with
Russia. We believe that it must be a credible international force
with NATO at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent that, said Rubin, ``we do not believe the Kosovar
Albanians will return.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   The Apache that crashed Monday followed the loss of an F-117
Nighthawk stealth fighter-bomber -- the Pentagon has yet to state
the cause -- on March 27 outside of Belgrade. The pilot was rescued
and wasn't seriously harmed.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly 10,500 sorties, the NATO air campaign has had an
overall loss rate ``well below what we've sustained in training
missions,'' Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told reporters at the
Pentagon on Monday, several hours before the crash of the Apache.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at around 10:30 p.m. local time, Whitman
said, as the helicopter -- the army's most advanced -- was
returning from what he described as ``a routine training mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter went down roughly two miles short of the Tirana
airport, where 22 other Apaches are based as part of Task Force
Hawk. The Apaches are built to fly fast and low -- training
exercises are often carried out at tree-top level and below -- to
enable them to destroy tanks, artillery and military forces in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The additional refueling tankers the Pentagon announced Monday
will bring to roughly 650 the number of U.S. aircraft involved in
Operation Allied Force, the air campaign that began March 24 to
combat Serb repression targeting the majority ethnic Albanians of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tankers will immediately help increase the tempo of air
operations, allow us to keep planes on station for longer periods
of time, and increase the number of hours of the day in which we're
actually flying over or near Yugoslavia and Kosovo,'' said Bacon.
``A reserve call-up will come very quickly, and it will cover this
and other things as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark has requested the activation of some 30,000 reservists --
experienced military personnel who no longer serve full-time but
are retained and kept at a high level of proficiency to emergency
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the need for aircraft crews and support staff, the
Pentagon has not specified what sorts of reservists might be called
up, but there is also a broad array of Army capability that relies
heavily on reservists.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces struck up and down the length and breadth of
Yugoslavia on Monday, dropping the last of five major bridge across
the Danube River at the country's second largest city, Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bridge is now destroyed, and there is no longer any
traffic across the Danube there,'' said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NATO forces attacked the Sombor airfield in
northeast Yugoslavia, two early-warning radar systems near Belgrade
and roughly a dozen Serb tanks, armored personnel carriers and
military trucks deployed across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Wald showed military imagery of a full range of U.S. warplanes
lambasting targets across Yugoslavia over the past several days --
an F-117 destroying a television and radio transmission tower in
southern Serbia; and F-15 dropping the last railroad and highway
bridge in Novi Sad into the Danube with an optically-guided bomb;
an F-16 blasting a building at the Pristina military air field with
a laser-guided bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (Milosevic's) forces are starting to take a pretty good
hit in the field, particularly,'' Wald said. ``But you add that up
to the fact that he can't sustain the force, he has no ammunition,
his command and control is going down -- all, in the meantime,
while we add forces -- it's starting to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite nearly five weeks of NATO bombing, however, Serb troops
and police continued to be active across much of the Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military spokesman, Col. Konrad Freytag of Germany, told
reporters here that Serb troops shelled civilians and homes in
southwest Kosovo on Sunday, and continued to loot villages and
terrorize ethnic Albanians elsewhere across the province.

INTERNET AUCTIONEER EBAY TO BUY LAND-BASED RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the first cases of an Internet company buying its
traditional competitor, the electronic auction service Ebay Inc.
agreed Monday to acquire Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield Auctioneers
Corp., San Francisco's largest auction house, for $260 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay has been one of the most explosive growth companies on the
Internet, with a service that lets both individuals and businesses
auction off everything from stuffed animals to rare stamps. It also
is one of the few profitable Internet concerns. On Monday, Ebay
said it earned $5.9 million in the first quarter, up tenfold from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have become so enamored of the company that it
currently has a market value of $26 billion, giving it the ability
to make acquisitions using its stock with little dilution to its
existing shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the deal represented a huge payoff for the privately held
Butterfield, which had been set to go public this week at $14 to
$16 a share. Ebay has offered to pay nearly $50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Whitman, chief executive of Ebay, said the company was
buying Butterfield to expand from small items into those priced
from $500 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ebay did for garage sales and collectibles we now want to
do for higher-end items,'' she said. ``We can grow the market and
make it a lot more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield, which was founded in 1865, says it is the
third-largest auction house in the country, after Sotheby's
Holdings Inc. and the Christie's International PLC unit of the
French holding company Artemis. It specializes in more moderately
priced art, collectibles and furniture. It has been involved in a
number of high-profile auctions, like one involving items belonging
to O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield also has a staff of curators who can provide
services, like appraisals, that Ebay currently does not offer.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ebay and Butterfield announced an agreement to
set up jointly a new auction site for art and collectibles. Just
after the announcement, while Butterfield's management was meeting
with potential investors to promote its planned stock offering,
Ebay offered to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is changing drastically,'' said John Gallo,
Butterfield's president. ``We need technology, we need marketing
and we need customer service. Ebay brings us all three.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Gallo said, Ebay can help the company reach
customers that no auction house does. ``If you take the top 10
auctioneering firms in the world, they have a total customer base
of under 500,000 people,'' he said. ``Ebay has 2.4 million buyers
and 6.5 million users.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the companies plan to proceed largely as they would
have under their earlier joint venture. They say they will create a
site, called Internationalgallery.com, that will let people watch
live audio and video broadcasts from participating auction houses
and submit bids to them. It will also offer items in online-only
auctions, but unlike Ebay's regular auctions, these will guarantee
the authenticity of the items.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers pay a fee of 5 percent to 10 percent of the purchase
price for these auctions. That is more than the 2 percent to 5
percent charged by Ebay, but far less than the fees involved in a
traditional auction, where the seller pays a fee of 10 percent to
25 percent and the buyer also pays a ``buyers premium'' of 10
percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The online auctions, Gallo said, can have lower fees because
they are vastly more efficient than traditional auctions. ``The
dealer doesn't have to move the painting from the wall _ they just
catalog the item and send us a photograph,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kaplan, the chief executive of Onsale Inc., an Internet
company that auctions off surplus computer goods, said: ``It looks
like a great move for Ebay. They can take resources being
underutilized in a land-based auction company and offer them to a
larger audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebay has competition from all sides. Amazon.com, the largest
online store, has just opened an auction service. Meanwhile, both
Sotheby's and Christie's say they are developing online auctions of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   None of these moves has yet to slow Ebay's growth. Some $541
million in goods were sold on Ebay's site in the last quarter, up
76 percent from the fourth quarter of 1998. The number of
registered users increased 75 percent, to 3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was $34 million, up 469 percent from a year earlier. The
company's gross profit margin was 85 percent, down from 89 percent
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman cautioned that unlike traditional retailers that do
best during the Christmas months, Ebay has its strongest quarter in
its first quarter. ``The winter months are far more robust, because
our buyers and sellers are not outside and people are selling a lot
of their Christmas gifts,'' she said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. Army Apache attack helicopter crashed and
burned in Albania Monday night during a training flight in
preparation for combat missions inside neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and co-pilot escaped serious injury, were rescued and
flown in an army medical helicopter to a temporary military
hospital at an airport near the Albanian capital of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial reports indicate that they're in good condition,''
said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. He did not release the names
of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The $60-million Apache, built to fly low and fast in the pursuit
of tanks, was the second U.S. aircraft to be lost since NATO
launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred two miles north of the base built over the
past week for the Apaches at an airfield near the Albanian capital
of Tirana, said Whitman. He said he had no details on the cause of
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches have been assembling in Tirana in recent days. They
have yet to fly combat missions inside the embattled Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, but were expected to be ordered soon to strike
at Serb troops deployed across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches are part of the latest escalation in the NATO air
campaign against Yugoslavia. The Pentagon announced Monday that it
is poised to call up thousands of reservists as early as this
weekend to bolster U.S. forces in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the reservists would be
called up ``very quickly.'' He also said an additional 30 large
refueling tankers would be flown to NATO bases this weekend, as
what he called a ``down payment,'' on a total of 300 warplanes and
support craft requested by the NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tankers will help NATO step up attacks on
bridges, oil and ammunition storage facilities, Serb troops and
tanks in the field and other military targets, said Bacon, part of
a campaign designed to coerce Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Yugoslavia, into agreeing to NATO's terms for peace
with Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to press that goal forward through diplomacy, Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is in Moscow for a Tuesday
meeting with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin held extensive talks
with Milosevic last week in Belgrade, amid signs that the Serb
leader might be prepared to make some concessions to end the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In a faint but welcomed ray of hopeful news, Milosevic allowed
International Committee of the Red Cross chief Cornelio Sommaruga
to meet for 15 minutes with three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia since March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into each other's eyes and shook hands very
warmly,'' Sommaruga told reporters. A Red Cross doctor and
representative were scheduled to meet for a longer period with the
three Americans on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the Red Cross meeting was welcomed, but
still did not meet the standards set forth in the Geneva Convention
for the treatment of troops captured amid hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty five days late, they have had a chance to review the
Geneva Convention and have found a way to, in however bare and
minimum form, start the process of doing what it demands,'' said
White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart. ``It is our expectation that
they will be seen by doctors in the coming days.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of possible cracks in Milosevic's regime, Yugoslav
Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic called on the government to ``stop
lying to the people in Serbia,'' and admit that it can no longer
sustain further NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people should be told that NATO is not facing a breakdown,
that Russia will not help Yugoslavia militarily and that the world
public opinion is against us,'' Draskovic, a former opposition
leader co-opted by Milosevic, said on local Studio B television.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference later Monday, Draskovic said his country
should accept the presence of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
if it is approved by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of such a force is a key NATO demand for halting
the bombing. So far, Milosevic has refused to permit such a force,
saying it would amount to a military occupation and a violation of
Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>

countries in U.N. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,'' Draskovic said.
``But if the Security Council of the U.N. says the U.N. mission
must composed on the basis of part of NATO countries, we must
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials were skeptical and unsure whether the
remarks were meant to signal that Milosevic was seeking a
face-saving way out of the conflict or whether they meant nothing
at all.

<P>
   ``That bridge is now destroyed, and there is no longer any

   In addition, NATO forces attacked the Sombor airfield in

THREAT OF OIL EMBARGO CREATING BLACK MARKET FOR YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATO's planned oil embargo of Yugoslavia has already created a
black market in which Serb-backed buyers pay up to a 50 percent
premium for gasoline and other refined products, European petroleum
traders and other sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the embargo is not expected to stop the flow of
petroleum to Yugoslavia, it has greatly aggravated what already was
a grave supply crisis. China, one of Yugoslavia's main providers of
fuel and an opponent of NATO's campaign, recently terminated its
oil contract with Yugoslavia because of $195 million in delinquent
bills. And since practically all of Yugoslavia's refineries have
been bombed, it has no use for crude oil and must now import all
fuel in refined condition.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which last year supplied 40 percent of Yugoslavia's oil
needs, is its only major remaining source of petroleum, said Chris
Kushlis, an analyst with PlanEcon Inc., a Washington-based energy
consulting firm that monitors Eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Chinese, Kushlis said, the Russians are willing to
sell Yugoslavia oil even though the country hasn't paid $170
million in overdue Russian bills. Traders reached in Europe Monday
said Lukoil, one of the biggest Russian suppliers, has extended new
lines of credit to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   How much fuel the Russians will be able or willing to sell to
Yugoslavia remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But the embargo, which is expected to be enforced starting this
week, means that deliveries by sea could stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest volume of smuggled oil will come over
land,'' said Milan Vego, a former Yugoslav naval officer who is a
professor in the operations department of the Naval War College in
Newport, R.I. ``Air power is good for some things, but surveillance
of smugglers operating at night is not one of them,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   A Geneva-based banker who extends credits to oil traders said he
and other bankers had been contacted in recent days by wealthy
Serbs, whom he declined to identify, who are opening letters of
credit to finance purchases of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   Traders in Europe said that smuggled petroleum cargo can change
hands many times during the course of shipment so it would be
difficult to tell where the cargo originated. But they said some of
it could easily come from refineries in countries that have pledged
to honor the embargo, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders said they already had seen evidence that buyers
acting on behalf of Yugoslavia are purchasing refined petroleum at
prices 20 percent to 50 percent higher than the market price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have an embargo, you have a lucrative business,''
said the president of a middle-sized oil trading firm in London
which until last week was involved in selling to Yugoslavia. ``All
you can do is make it expensive to get the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This executive, who did not want to be identified because of the
subject's sensitivity, said ``There are a lot of Yugoslavs among
traders who have been doing this for a long time and they are
everywhere in Europe. They are very good at it, particularly now
that their mission is to get the oil at any cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Russia, Yugoslavia has purchased oil from Croatia,
Bulgaria, Libya, and Romania. Yugoslavia had produced 20,000
barrels of oil a day at home, equivalent to a third of its daily
consumption in normal times.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO embargo was not a surprise to Yugoslavia, which had
already taken measures to squirrel away supplies of refined
petroleum for its tanks, armored vehicles and transportation
system.
</P>

<P>
   ``Remember, the Serbs were among those who built many of Saddam
Hussein's deepest underground bunkers and storage facilities,''
said another London-based oil-trading industry executive who has
done extensive business with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Greece remains the weakest link in the NATO
alliance. There is great sympathy for the Serb cause in Greece,
which has one of the biggest tanker fleets in the world. Although
the embargo could stop them from supplying Yugoslavia by sea,
traders said, it was likely that at least some Greek vessels could
be the conduits for smuggled oil that eventually makes it into
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would very difficult to supply them with enough oil
to run the economy,'' said Andrew Avramides, an independent
London-based oil consultant with extensive experience in the Balkan
region. ``But a small tanker here and a few trucks there will keep
the army going if the will to fight can be maintained, which is a
big if.''

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Since the days of Prohibition, the Peace Bridge
has been the infrastructural equivalent of a warm handshake between
Canada and the United States: an economic, recreational and
cultural lifeline for people on both sides of the Niagara River.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bridge, Canadians do not think twice about
crossing over to Buffalo Sabres hockey games or buying winter homes
in the Cattaraugus Mountains. Americans routinely hop over to
Toronto for dinner, and stay in summer cottages on the Canadian
side of Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, there is anything but peace at the Peace Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, a 3,600-foot steel truss built in 1927, is past its
prime and is barely adequate for the traffic that has surged in
recent years at the crossing, where the wait can exceed an hour and
a half.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians are pushing to build a three-lane bridge next to
the existing one, a mirror-image ``twin span'' that they say would
honor history and symbolize American-Canadian friendship. The
Americans, though, want to demolish the old bridge and build a
six-lane structure that they envision as so impressive that they
are calling it a ``signature bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash over the Peace Bridge is not just a battle of function
versus form, engineering versus aesthetics. It has become a
political football in Ottawa and Washington, with Canadian
officials accusing the Americans of Manifest Destiny arrogance, and
U.S. officials dismissing the Canadians as parochial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an American bridge; it's an international bridge,''
sighed John Maloney, who represents the Fort Erie district in the
Canadian Parliament. ``The Canadian interests and desires appear to
be ignored. It's very disappointing, and quite frankly, very
difficult to believe that this could be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash has been transformed into a fight of millennial
magnitude. The new bridge, quite simply, is the biggest project to
come down the pike in many years, a huge endeavor that could cost
$90 million and take more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``While nobody thinks that a bridge will revitalize a city,
public symbols are important, especially here, because a lot of
people feel beat up,'' said Bruce Jackson, a professor of American
culture at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is now at a crucial stage. With the support of the
Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority, the quasi-public
binational authority that operates the bridge, Canadian officials
have approved all of the requisite permits to begin work on the
twin-bridge proposal. All that remains is a decision by the U.S.
Coast Guard on whether the project has any negative impact on the
Niagara River.
</P>
<P>
   But already, Buffalo's mayor, Anthony Masiello, has threatened
to sue if the Coast Guard approves the permit. And except for Gov.
George Pataki, who has sidestepped the issue, all of New York's
major politicians, including Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
Charles Schumer and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, have thrown
their weight behind the signature bridge.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one point of agreement: something must be
done to improve the flow of traffic on the existing bridge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Commercial traffic via the Peace Bridge has skyrocketed in
recent years. In 1991, $23 billion worth of goods passed through;
now, the annual figure is $40 billion to $45 billion, said Stephen
F. Mayer, the bridge's operations manager on the American side.
</P>
<P>
   For years, truckers, commuters and vacationers have complained
about the lack of customs agents and immigration officials at the
border, creating bottlenecks that are especially pronounced during
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   So in the early 1990s, the bridge authority began studying
options for a new bridge.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed that the twin bridge, combined with a
plan to renovate the existing one, would be a fait accompli: the
authority's 10-member board of directors, comprising five Canadians
and five Americans unanimously approved the project, which would be
financed by bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But after the winning bid came in at $90 million, much higher
than previously projected, public opinion on the American side
began to shift, led by Pitts of the Common Council, Moynihan and a
citizens' group of mostly young professionals in Buffalo called the
New Millennium Group.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, they unveiled a concrete cable-stayed bridge,
in which cables flare out from a central tower, sketched by the
noted bridge designers Bruno Freschi and T.Y. Lin, that they said
would be better, cheaper and faster to build.
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, their bridge plan would restore land to a Frederick
Law Olmsted park along the waterfront and help revitalize a
downtown that is now a shell of its proud industrial past, said
Bill Banas, 28, a software engineer who is the group's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they build that ugly, mismatched companion bridge, we're
going to spend the next 100 years apologizing for it,'' said Jeff
Belt, 36, an entrepreneur in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, bridge authorities defended the twin structure,
saying they had studied about a dozen options, cataloged all the
environmental permutations and spent more than $10 million in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Their mandate, they said repeatedly, was to collect tolls as
efficiently as possible to compete with the top border crossing,
Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. It was, Mayer said, asking perhaps
just a tad too much of the authority to ``hang the economic
rejuvenation and renaissance of Buffalo on the appearance of this
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   But even on the bridge authority, there are signs of strain. In
a recent vote on whether to delay the project for an further study,
the tally was a 5-5 split along national lines, with the Americans
saying yes to the delay and the Canadians saying no.
</P>
<P>
   There are few signs that the issue will fade soon. In Fort Erie,
almost every person interviewed seemed to be reading from the same
script, saying that it was most important to ``get on with it,''
that their American counterparts were acting selfishly.
</P>
<P>
   The twin bridge, the Canadians added, could be built more
quickly, pumping life into Fort Erie's sagging economy. It would
also preserve a beloved symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peace Bridge in Fort Erie is significant because many of
us grew up in the shadow of the bridge,'' said Wayne Redekop, the
mayor of Fort Erie, population 28,000. ``For many of the people in
Buffalo, the Peace Bridge has no real emotional connotation. For
them to suggest, `Well, just tear it down,' doesn't respond to the
sensitivities on this side of Buffalo. For them, Fort Erie is an
afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, meanwhile, almost every person interviewed endorsed
the signature bridge. The fact that Canadians are not seeing things
their way remains a source of bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are frustrated, they look for a bad guy,'' said
Jackson of the University of Buffalo, speaking, of course, about
the American perspective. ``So all of a sudden, Canada became the
bad guy to people.''

PENTAGON SET TO BEGIN CALLING UP RESERVISTS, OFFICIAL SAYS
</HEADLINE>

 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon will begin calling up reservists as
early as Tuesday, a top official said on Monday, and will
immediately send in 30 refueling aircraft to support the air
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the first training accident of the campaign, an Army Apache
helicopter crashed on landing at the airfield in Tirana, Albania.
Both crewmen escaped, according to a Pentagon spokesman, but it was
not known whether they were injured. There were no reports of
hostile fire and no information on damage to the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The training accident came just as all but one of the 24 Apache
helicopters, including the troops and ground-based rocket launchers
needed for their operations, had arrived in Tirana. Preparations
were under way for the helicopters to begin action against the
Yugoslav army in Kosovo, which the Pentagon said could begin at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning Belgrade time, one of the NATO-launched
cruise missiles struck the headquarters of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party, one of the tallest buildings
in central Belgrade, blowing off part of the roof. Repairs were
under way on the building, which was hit last week and houses
television studios and transmission facilities as well as political
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at the USCE Business Center failed to stop Serbian
television from broadcasting. The transmitters for Radio and
Television Kosava are owned by Milosevic's daughter, Marija.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 24 hours, NATO forces also hit a third bridge
across the Danube River and stepped up attacks on the Yugoslav
forces in the field with combat jets destroying several tanks,
trucks and armored personnel carriers in Kosovo, according to the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also said on Monday that it is building camps in
Fier, Albania, to house 20,000 Kosovo refugees now living in
neighboring Macedonia. The United States has already said it will
bring 20,000 Kosovo refugees to this country from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In asking President Clinton to authorize the use of as many as
33,000 reservists, the Pentagon said on Monday it would stagger the
call-up in phases, to avoid too great a disruption across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be as accurate as possible so we don't have all the
reservists hanging by a thread worrying whether they will be
next,'' said Col. Richard Bridges, a Defense Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But with a call up of this size, disruption is inevitable,
especially in the aviation industry because most of the reservists
will be pilots or aircraft crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, the Air Force was able to rely on volunteer
reservists to provide the crews needed for the air operations,
especially for the increasingly valuable refueling tankers. There
are already 120 tanker aircraft in Europe supporting NATO
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 300 planes requested by Clark, at least 100 will be
refueling tankers, according to Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 200 planes will be combat jets to expand the air
attacks and suppress the Yugoslav air defense system. The pilots
and crews for these planes will be drawn largely from the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been small reserve call-ups in recent years for
the Bosnia peacekeeping operation and the air patrols over Iraq,
the 33,000 reservists called up for Kosovo will be the largest
since the 1990 call up for the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 refueling tankers are the most urgently needed of the 300
American aircraft requested by NATO's supreme commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, earlier this month to intensify the air war in the
Kosovo conflict, according to Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers from the U.S. Army will be detailed to build the new
refugee camp in Fier, Albania, near the port of Durres. They expect
to have the camps ready for the first several thousand refugees
within 10 days, according to Lt. Gen. John McDuffie.
</P>
<P>
   These are the refugees who would have been sent from Macedonia
to the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But after fierce protests
from aid and refugee groups, the Clinton administration scrapped
that plan in favor of setting up a camp within the region to house
these refugees, all of whom have said they want to return to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie said the U.S. military will build the camp and manage
it for about one month before it is turned over to the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, which is charged with the care of all of
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vice President Al Gore announced that the United
States would bring 20,000 Kosovars to this country for temporary
placement with their families. There are many Albanian-American
communities here, with especially large groups in Detroit and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is one of more than 16 countries that have
agreed to give asylum to these refugees now housed in Macedonia,
always with the intention of returning them to Kosovo once the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, retreats from their
province.

THREE RING'S SPEED TO TEST THE DERBY COLTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ With only two days left before the draw for
the Kentucky Derby, only one filly on the backstretch at Churchill
Downs remained an announced candidate Monday to challenge the 19
best 3-year-olds in America in a race that only three fillies have
won in 124 years.
</P>
<P>
   She is Three Ring, who has won five of her eight starts but has
never raced against colts. And in the big leagues of horse racing,
few places are more exclusive than the starting gate at Churchill
Downs on Derby Day, especially for a filly: Only 36 have made it
that far, and none have reached the winner's circle in the last 11
years.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, no truly dominant 3-year-old colt has surfaced,
and the gates to the Derby are being besieged by traveling horses,
mystery horses and 30-1 long shots. And one star-gazing owner has
been willing to put up the $36,000 in entry fees to get his prize
filly into the gate: Barry Schwartz, the longtime friend and
business partner of Calvin Klein, the fashion designer, and a
trustee of the New York Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring galloped a mile and a half this morning over the
Churchill Downs track, but she was accompanied by some Derby
intrigue. Would she, in fact, be the only filly entered on
Wednesday? Or would she be joined by a filly from the richly
stocked barn of Bob Baffert?
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has won the last two runnings of the Derby and may be
starting the favorites this year, General Challenge and Prime
Timber. He also has the favorite for the Kentucky Oaks for fillies
the day before, Silverbulletday. He also trains Excellent Meeting,
another prize filly, who will probably run in the Oaks but may be
switched instead to run in the Derby as half of a powerful entry
with General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz says that regardless of the competition, he will
face the Derby fire with Three Ring, a chestnut daughter of
Notebook and the mare My Nichole. She is a striking horse, with
$653,000 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is so special,'' he said the other day, ``that they
recently postponed the construction work at Calder in Florida for
one week so that she could work out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring came up to Churchill Downs last week from Calder, not
from Gulfstream Park, where she raced into prominence last winter
by winning two big stakes for fillies. She had raced with
distinction as a 2-year-old by winning three of her five starts,
and even finished third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies last
November behind Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if she'll be the only filly in the Derby,''
Schwartz said of Three Ring. ``But I think she couldn't be any
better. I wouldn't be in it if she weren't special.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while at Gulfstream Park, it seemed likely that Three Ring
would test colts in the Florida Derby, particularly after a
powerful performance against fillies in February, when she blitzed
the field in winning the Davona Dale by nearly 15 lengths. But
after Three Ring drew an outside post for the Florida Derby, making
an already tough task tougher, Schwartz and the trainer Eddie Plesa
Jr. decided to hold her out of the race. Instead, they placed her
in the March 16 Bonnie Miss, which she won by more than six
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filly ran two phenomenal races, three weeks apart,''
Schwartz said. ``She showed that she's just as fast as these
colts.''
</P>
<P>
   And suppose she draws the outside spot in a 20-horse Kentucky
Derby?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever I draw, it's OK,'' Schwartz said. ``We're paying
$6,000 to supplement her to the Triple Crown, and $30,000 to enter
her in the Derby, and that's OK, too. This filly has been real good
to me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Plesa, who has never had a horse in the Kentucky Derby, put it
tersely, ``We're committed to the Kentucky Derby even if we get
Post 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Many trainers agree that Three Ring is fast, but they have
doubts about racing any filly against colts, particularly in the
springtime. Later in the year, the fillies get bigger and stronger
and become less vulnerable. Colts tend to throw their weight around
the track, and even a fast filly can come unraveled. The only
fillies who lasted the mile and one-quarter and won the Derby were
Regret in 1915, Genuine Risk in 1980 and Winning Colors in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant fillies can pay a lot of bills for a stable,'' said
Jimmy Jones, who won the Kentucky Derby eight times with his
father, B.A. Jones of Calumet Farm. ``But almost always, it's
better to run them against other fillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said he doesn't think he has been smitten with Derby
fever, which happens to many owners at this time of year. He has no
intention of running Three Ring in the Preakness, the second race
in the Triple Crown, since it is just two weeks after the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I might run her in the Belmont in June,'' he said. ``She
could make a mile and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Schwartz knows that he has a filly who can run and,
just possibly, stay the course against colts in America's most
prestigious and exclusive race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you,'' he said, ``she's smart and gentle. And I
think kindness is important. Some horses aren't kind, and they take
it out on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES:
</P>
<P>
   After a week of generally dry weather, rain fell Monday and
caused some disruption in Kentucky Derby training schedules. Still,
there were some workouts, with the trainer D. Wayne Lukas getting
both Cat Thief and Charismatic on the track. Cat Thief ran five
furlongs in 1:02; Charismatic, recent winner of the Lexington
Stakes, was clocked in 1:02 4/5. Of Charismatic, Lukas said:
``There is no horse doing better than he is. Whether that equates
to 12th place, 18th or first, I don't know.'' Also sneaking in his
workout was Elliott Walden's Ecton Park, whose five-furlong run was
timed in 1:02.

WATSON MAY GET ANOTHER FIRST: TEAM OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (kd) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Watson is proud of his accomplishments in baseball, but he
has grown weary of one aspect. ``I would like to get rid of the
distinction of being first,'' he said. ``I am really tired of being
the first of anything in baseball _ first assistant general
manager, first general manager, first African American to win a
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, of course, will never shed the distinctions because
first is first. From the day in 1988 when John McMullen, then the
owner of the Houston Astros, hired him as his assistant general
manager, Watson has worked his way through a series of firsts. He
was the first black general manager, and no one can take that
distinction from him. What he really wants, though, is not to be
the only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see all those firsts turned into second, third,
fourth and fifth,'' Watson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the former general manager of the Yankees and the Houston
Astros has yet another first he could attain. He could become the
first member of a minority group to be a club owner who is involved
in the day-to-day operation of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, out of baseball since he left the Yankees 15 months ago,
is part of one of two groups that are trying to buy the Oakland
Athletics. Each group has submitted a $12 million down payment on
the designated purchase price of $122.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority will select one of
the groups by May 11 as the Athletics' owner, subject to approval
of Major League Baseball and its club owners. Watson and Steve
Stone, the former Cy Young award winner, are members of one group;
Joe Morgan, the Hall of Fame second baseman who is also black, is
involved with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been talking to Steve for some time,'' Watson related by
telephone from Houston. ``About three weeks ago, he called and said
he had something he wanted to run by me. It was the Oakland
situation. I told him I'd be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Their group, Watson said, wants to expand its partnership, which
is currently led by Lyle Campbell, a Phoenix banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to bring in a number of other investors, mainly
local minorities,'' Watson said. He mentioned those who are
Hispanic, Asian, black. ``That's basically the fan base in
Oakland,'' said Watson, a former coach with the Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   While baseball has lacked black and Hispanic officials in
decision-making positions, it has experienced an even greater void
in ownership. There is a difference, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the proliferation of black and Hispanic players, there
are very few black and Hispanic general managers, managers or
directors of player development and scouting because white owners
don't hire them. There are no black and Hispanic owners because
they don't step forward with $122.4 million or $173 million or
whatever a franchise costs.
</P>
<P>
   But are there members of minority groups in Oakland who will
join an ownership group as minority partners? ``We're going to find
out,'' Watson said. ``We'd like to see that work in Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better question to pose is, will the Athletics work in
Oakland, no matter who owns them? Steve Schott (no relation to
Marge Schott) and Ken Hofmann have owned the team for less than
four years. Under their agreement with the coliseum authority, if
the authority cannot broker a deal for the team, Schott and Hofmann
are free to sell the team for a move elsewhere or move it
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose has been mentioned as a location, but it is in the
Giants' territory. Sacramento is not and would be a possibility.
But the two competing groups for the Athletics are serious, and a
deal with one of them is likely. A new owner would have to keep the
team in Oakland through the 2004 season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Giants and another half-dozen teams, the Athletics do
not have a new revenue-raising park in their future. New owners
wouldn't have any easier time making it than past or current owners
and in fact would face the existence of a brand-new park across the
bay in San Francisco beginning next season.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 15,733 fans a game, the Athletics are at the bottom
end of the attendance totals. They compete in a division whose
other teams average at least 10,000 more fans a game.
</P>
<P>
   The bright side for a new owner is the rich player development
program the Athletics have. This season's lineup is filled with
homegrown products _ Jason Giambi, Scott Spiezio, Miguel Tejada,
Eric Chavez, A.J. Hinch, Jason McDonald and Ben Grieve. It's a crop
that would make a new owner buy the team with an optimistic
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range planning has Watson running the baseball operation if
he and his colleagues get the team, but Watson said it's premature
to make plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were fortunate enough to get the club, we'd sit down
with the current administration and do a complete evaluation,'' he
said. ``The bottom line is to get the right people in the right
jobs. I don't want to stand here today and tell you I'm going to be
doing X, Y, Z.''
</P>
<P>
   It would only be fitting, though, for Watson, as a minority
owner, to head the baseball operation. It would be another first
that would crown his career and enable him to extend his role as a
baseball pioneer. &QL;

HARRICK MASTERS THE BAD GOODBYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mineral baths and massages and stress-reduction therapy, that's
what you figured Jim Harrick would be looking for after a job offer
at a prestigious institution had unglued him.
</P>
<P>
   For two excruciating days, his pathos played out in public. He
was a baseball player caught in a rundown, a driver lurching into
the intersection as the light turned yellow, a suitor torn between
the one who loves him and the one he loves.
</P>
<P>
   His indecision paralyzed two college basketball programs and
tacked on another bizarre chapter to his travelogue.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Harrick quit his hemming and hawing, and absolutely,
positively accepted the University of Georgia men's basketball job,
he had created a tributary of hard feelings that flowed from
Kingston, R.I., to Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick's not the first coach to change his mind, merely the
latest. Harrick's former UCLA cohort Terry Donahue did it, when the
Atlanta Falcons courted him in the late 1980s. And just the other
week Buzz Peterson left Southwest Missouri State at the altar,
accepting its basketball head-coaching job one day and changing his
mind the next, but not before a news conference had been announced
to trumpet his move from Appalachian State.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is in the details.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue reconsidered the Falcons' head-coaching job after
sleeping on his initial decision, leaving no one the wiser outside
his intimate circle. And Peterson didn't have a few hundred
appreciative boosters on campus, waiting for him to keep the
appointment he had scheduled so they could applaud his decision to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Say this about Harrick: From his precipitous fall from grace at
UCLA in 1996 to his messy breakup not quite three years later from
a Rhode Island program that worshiped him, he has become the master
of the memorable exit.
</P>
<P>
   In a dizzying span of 48 hours during Easter week, Harrick, 60,
announced he was leaving the University of Rhode Island for the
University of Georgia, called a press conference in Rhode Island to
proclaim he had changed his mind and then, egregiously, left his
players and 300 excited boosters in the lurch, a no-show at his own
party because he was on the midnight train to Georgia (or something
like that) after another change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while for you to catch up with Harrick, but when you
finally track him down at his office in Athens he said: ``I'm sure
I left some people in Rhode Island feeling betrayed. I went back
there, I was going to meet with them. I was just very emotional at
the time. It was very difficult to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about family (he left behind a Rams coaching staff
that includes his son and namesake, whom he won't be able to hire
at Georgia because of nepotism rules). And family, you know,
supersedes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after taking the Georgia job, Harrick was out of town all
week but not regrouping at some chichi spa as you suspected. The
signing period arrived the week after Harrick arrived in Georgia.
So he had been hard on the recruiting trail, trying to make up for
lost time.
</P>
<P>
   The trail led him to the tiny burg of Cuthbert, a one-stoplight
town tucked away in the southwestern part of the state, not far
from the Alabama border. A 6-foot-8 manchild resides there who
Harrick's gotta have. Donnell Harvey is the best player in the
state _ and, arguably, the country.
</P>
<P>
   After some initial waffling _ Lord knows Harrick can relate to
that _ Harvey considered Georgia but chose Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick could have used him; four of Georgia's six primary
players this past season were seniors and the Bulldogs' best
player, sophomore forward Jumaine Jones, also is expected to leave
for the NBA, though Harrick has appealed to him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harrick's got two scholarships to give, unless some of
the recruits who've already committed can't get their grades and
test scores up. In which case, he said, ``I don't know what I'm
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When he said that, there's a fervor in his voice rather than
frustration. Understand this: Harrick could have lived happily ever
after in Kingston. His players respected him and responded to him
and, in a vast departure from his UCLA days, so did the athletic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick coached Rhode Island to one Atlantic-10 Conference title
and guided the Rams to two NCAA appearances, including an Elite
Eight showing in 1998. It certainly wasn't security or subsidies
that lured him away from Kingston (when he got the Georgia offer,
Rhode Island countered with an offer that he said blew him away).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the opportunity to coach in one of the most
competitive conferences in the country that proved irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going up against Kentucky, Tennessee, Auburn and Alabama every
week is a challenge,'' Harrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it might have been a thrill to stay in Kingston to
usher through the building of a new, privately financed arena.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick bristles when you ask if he's motivated by a desire to
prove himself on the big stage, the inference being that his
appetite for approval is so voracious his successful stints at
Pepperdine and UCLA and Rhode Island somehow weren't filling
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I don't feel like I have anything left to prove,'' he
said. ``I've just always been the kind of person that likes to
compete against the best. The excitement for me is in the chase.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good. It's only bad when your pursuit leaves
good people behind, hugging air.

<P>
   CICERO, Ill. _ This is the place that welcomed Al Capone, along
with his bootlegging, betting parlors and bordellos, after Chicago
gave him the boot.
</P>
<P>
   It is the place where federal investigators have had their hands
full, looking into allegations of sweetheart deals, misuse of
municipal funds and police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the place where the husband of the town president
pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges and acknowledged being
a bookmaker for the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Now, without an ounce of irony, Cicero has an idea for tackling
organized crime of a different sort. This working-class city of
70,000 just southwest of Chicago is drafting an ordinance that
would evict all gang members _ and punish them if they returned,
even to visit their families.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first gang-eviction law in the country, and if,
as expected, it is passed by the town board on April 27, it might
be only a matter of time before it faces a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds you of the Wild West,'' said Jay Miller, executive
director of the Chicago chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union. ``It's like a bumper sticker: Gang-Free City. It sounds
wonderful. But where do they go? Are they going to send them all to
New York?''
</P>
<P>
   While Cicero's proposal is severe, it is just the latest in a
spate of anti-gang ordinances cropping up nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Los Angeles, San Jose and other California
communities have made it illegal for people identified as gang
members to congregate on certain streets. In some cases, they are
barred from whistling, making gang hand signals or carrying
bottles, baseball bats or flashlights in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is considering a similar approach. And Chicago
instituted an anti-loitering law authorizing arrests of suspected
gang members who defy police orders to leave a street.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the San Jose law and is reviewing
the Chicago law, which resulted in tens of thousands of arrests in
the three years before it was declared unconstitutional by an
Illinois court in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero officials say they have a list of 600 ``known gang
members,'' including some minors, who would have 60 days to get out
of town. Officials say some on the list have been convicted of
violent assaults and weapons charges, while others are simply
``self-admitted gang members,'' having told the police under
questioning that they belonged to a gang. Those on the list, which
has not been made public, are not serving jail sentences, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero officials say their gang problem has increased in recent
years. The town said gangs were responsible for a drive-by shooting
in 1995 in which a young girl was killed, and another in 1996. Last
year, there were 64 shootings and 15 homicides, Bernard Harrison,
the deputy police superintendent, said. This year, there have been
24 shootings and 2 homicides. Harrison said all of the shootings
and most of the homicides had been gang-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACLU says gang members have rights,'' said the town
president, Betty Loren-Maltese. ``How about our civil rights? That
we cannot live in a peaceful community.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent driving tour of the town, she pointed out gang
houses and graffiti and told stories about gang members: the one
whose legs were broken when he was run over by a rival, the day one
gang dynamited another gang's house (``Unfortunately, nobody got
hurt,'' she said), and the gang member who was shot in the
testicles. Pointing out her own bungalow, she said a gang member
lives on her street, a teen-ager who, among other things, threw a
cherry bomb at her car and tried to set roofs on fire with
fireworks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Cicero's proposal is in questionable
constitutional territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem of punishing people for their status as a
gang member,'' said Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law professor at
Georgetown University. ``You can punish people for what they do,
but you can't punish people for what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if Cicero banished people who had completed
criminal sentences, it could be accused of punishing people twice
for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities would love to be able to say, `We don't want child
molesters released back in our community,''' said Erwin
Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at the University of
Southern California. ``But they can't. And what if every city
adopted that? Does that mean they wouldn't be allowed to go every
place?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese, a blunt-spoken Republican, said that was not
her problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry if they go to Berwyn or Oak Park or Chicago,''
said Ms. Loren-Maltese, who has been president since 1993 and once
proposed making gang members wear pink aprons and clean up
graffiti, an idea that went nowhere. ``My concern is to protect the
people of Cicero.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The people of Cicero would seem to approve, overwhelmingly
voting for a nonbinding referendum on the gang-free proposal this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of Cicero's Hispanic population, which has
mushroomed in the last two decades and transformed an all-white
enclave into a city that is about half Hispanic, fear the ordinance
might single out Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   While many Hispanic residents apparently voted for the
referendum, Hispanic leaders say those results are deceptive.
Dolores Ponce de Leon, a community organizer for a group called the
Interfaith Leadership Project, said the ballot question was so
broad that many people had interpreted it as saying, `` `Vote yes
if you are against the gangs.' Well, who's going to vote against
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they better understand the proposal _ and that about
three-quarters of the gang list is Hispanic names _ some Latinos
are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an injustice to the Latino families,'' said Delia
Barajas, an Interfaith Leadership Project member with six children,
including two teen-agers. ``We would like something done with the
gangs, but we want more prevention, intervention. ''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos have been irked by other policies of Ms. Loren-Maltese's
administration, including efforts to force a bank with many
Mexican-American customers to take down a Mexican flag. They
complain that she is not committed to hiring Hispanic police
officers and say she supported a police practice of reporting
suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese says her policies are not discriminatory,
points to Hispanic employees she appointed to town jobs and says
her critics are simply political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, accusations of discrimination are a thorn for Cicero,
once such a symbol of racism that Martin Luther King Jr. called it
the Selma of the North.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero has also drawn the attention of Federal investigators,
with allegations including irregularities in towing practices and
unorthodox payments to municipal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese denies allegations of government corruption.
She has made accusations of police misconduct, and has purged
nearly a third of the police force.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese said the gang ordinance might give suspected
gang members a banishment hearing and the right to appeal. If those
evicted came back to town, they would be fined, charged and have
their vehicles confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a 10-square-mile city with roughly 135 police officers
would enforce such a law, Ms. Loren-Maltese said she might consider
gating neighborhoods and establishing police checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Given that her late husband, Frank Maltese, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy charges in 1991, Ms. Loren-Maltese has been asked if the
ordinance would apply to people in organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get involved in drive-by shootings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said it would certainly apply to minors, even if their
families stayed in Cicero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of call it tough love, and a parent's got to make that
choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the driving tour, Ms. Loren-Maltese and Harrison pointed out
buildings they said were hangouts of some of Cicero's 16 active
gangs, including the Latin Kings, the Sin City Boys, the Latin
Angels and the Two Six Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loren-Maltese has tried other tactics, like fining landlords
$500 a day for failing to evict gang tenants. She said the town
planned to file a suit against gangs, seeking reimbursement for
cleaning five-pointed stars, crowns and other gang graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said he believed word of the ordinance had caused three
gang members to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   But a man who identified himself as Pablo, 24, a member of the
Maniac Latin Disciples, scoffed at the idea that gangs could be
banished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're never going to get rid of gangs,'' said Pablo, perched
on the stoop of his house across from an elementary school. ``They
don't have that much power.''

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The owner of Valhol filed suit in Arkansas
Monday demanding that the state's racing commission release the
$300,000 purse his horse earned for winning the Arkansas Derby,
money that may determine whether the 3-year-old qualifies to run in
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, lawyers for the owner, Jim Jackson, contend that
the Arkansas Racing Commission was required by state law to
distribute the purse within 96 hours of the race on April 10 at
Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark. The commission has directed track
officials to withhold the money while the racing stewards
investigate whether the jockey Billy Patin used an illegal
electrical device on Valhol during the race.
</P>
<P>
   The stewards have set a hearing for Patin on May 5, which is
four days after the Kentucky Derby. Pulaski County Circuit Judge
John Plegge will hold a hearing on Jackson's petition Tuesday at 1
p.m. in Little Rock, Ark.

CONTROVERSIAL `BATISTA PROCEDURE' HEART SURGERY PERFORMED IN
SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bigger isn't really better when it comes to hearts.
</P>
<P>
   So Dr. Randas Batista, a controversial Brazilian cardiac
surgeon, cut a chunk out of Donald Stringfellow's heart Monday to
make it a smaller and more efficient pump.
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow, who had an enlarged heart and congestive heart
failure, is the first person in the Pacific Northwest to have the
``Batista procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided I was a good candidate,'' the 76-year-old Marin
County and former Chehalis resident said the day before surgery.
``I have a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The experimental operation, performed at Providence Medical
Center in Seattle, was broadcast live on the Internet to at least
300 physicians worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Batista and Dr. Kim Jett, a cardiovascular surgeon at
Providence, answered questions while performing the surgery on
Stringfellow. The focus of the operation was the heart's left
ventricle, the largest and most powerful pumping chamber in the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the ventricle smaller,'' Batista said.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that simple, he repeatedly told the audience. The
medical profession tends to seek hi-tech and complicated solutions,
Batista said, but he was forced out of necessity to find low-tech
and simpler alternatives for his patients in rural Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing his medical motto to President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Batista said: ``You do what you can with what you have
where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Batista procedure is of interest
because more than 3.5 million people have congestive heart failure.
About 400,000 Americans die of congestive heart failure annually.
Some 50,000 people with the condition qualify for a heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are only about 2,000 heart donors per year,'' Jett
said. Jett said the alternatives to transplantation include drug
therapy, heart valve repair, mechanical devices that assist the
heart in pumping or the heart-reduction surgery approach pioneered
by Batista.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reducing the workload on the heart,'' the Brazilian
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after Jett and the Providence cardiac surgery team
opened Stringfellow's chest, Batista cut into the left ventricle of
the beating heart with his scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the surgery, a heart-lung machine took over the
task of pumping Stringfellow's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Batista and Jett discovered a weak area in the septum _ the wall
that separates the four chambers of the heart _ which prompted a
small change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply cut a large piece out of Stringfellow's
ventricle, Batista opted to cut and remove a smaller section near
the weak area and fold out or ``exclude'' the faulty portion of the
ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons also repaired a defective mitral valve _ the valve
between the upper left atrium and the lower left ventricle in the
heart that is supposed to regulate blood flow in one direction.
Stringfellow's valve had been allowing some ``regurgitation,'' or
back flow.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of about an hour, the Brazilian and the Providence
cardiothoracic team had cut out a piece of Stringfellow's
ventricle, repaired a faulty heart valve, fixed a weak spot in the
septum and sutured it all back up.
</P>
<P>
   So why's this guy so controversial?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like what I'm doing because it's so simple,''
Batista said after the surgery in the Providence operating room
locker. ``I developed this in a small village in the jungles of
Brazil. These people in the universities say I'm crazy rather than
admit that what I'm doing actually works.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the question. Even some of Batista's supporters say
it's not clear how often this works and why it works for some but
not others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients do well and others don't do well,'' said Dr.
Robert Lazzara, Jett's colleague in cardiac surgery at Providence.
``The results are equivocal so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Lazzara said, after Batista and his surgical
procedure were featured on a television show, ``A lot of surgeons
jumped on to this and started doing the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't done as a formalized clinical study, he said,
and some surgeons were discouraged that they weren't getting the
results Batista said he gets in Brazil with his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Icenogle, a heart surgeon at Sacred Heart Hospital in
Spokane, was taught how to do the Batista procedure but he doesn't
offer it to his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, most of these procedures have been done at
the Cleveland Clinic,'' Icenogle said. ``The results there so far
have been questionable so I've decided not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacred Heart, like the University of Washington Medical Center,
does heart transplants for some patients with heart failure. For
those who don't get transplants, Icenogle has been implanting
left-ventrical assist devices to improve the heart's pumping
ability.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association provides information on the
Batista procedure but takes no position on its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Jett and Lazzara said the Providence Foundation decided to
sponsor a clinical study of the Batista procedure in 10 patients
because of the need to offer better alternatives for people with
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stringfellow had no other option,'' Jett said.
</P>
<P>
   He was too old for a transplant and he has not been able to
tolerate the drugs often used to treat congestive heart failure.
These drugs improve blood flow by inhibiting a hormone that
constricts arteries and raises blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Batista said he has performed about 700 of these surgeries in
the past 15 years. He said survival is about 60 percent after two
years and 57 percent after three years.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he didn't offer any specifics on longer-term survival
rates. In the past, he's said these are difficult numbers to obtain
because many of his patients move out of the area and don't
maintain contact with his hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very poor environment,'' Batista said. ``I began doing
this because these patients had nothing else, nothing to lose.''

 Column: Air Jordan's Agent Offers `3-Pointers' on Building
a  Winning Brand 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The ballrooms and salons of the Westin St. Francis hotel yesterday
were teeming with cell-phone-toting institutional investors,
hunting for the next great brand &UR;  &LR; _ such as America Online,
Amazon.com or Yahoo _ &UR;  &LR; in which to invest.
</P>
<P>
   But while the armies of Italian-crafted, midnight blue suits
buzzed around the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist technology stock conference,
uber-agent David Falk was up the hill at the Ritz Carlton Hotel
revealing the secrets behind a brand more dominant than those
darlings of the Net: Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordan's agent, Falk has been largely responsible for helping
the former Bulls superstar forge a brand that is arguably one of
the most pervasive in the world. And Falk thinks some of the
lessons he and Mike have learned since his client was drafted out
of the University of North Carolina in 1984 can be deftly applied
to corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   But first let's put the evolution of Jordan as a global brand
into context. The then-skinny kid from Carolina arrived on the
scene just as the National Basketball Association was starting to
rise, shoe contracts were paltry and, lastly, Jordan was different.
He could fly.
</P>
<P>
   His emergence as a brand name ``had more preponderance than just
its financial impact. It was almost a cultural phenomenon,'' said
Falk in an interview. Falk was in town to speak at the Venture
Strategy Group's annual brand building conference at the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is worshipped like a rock star. His endorsements and
personal preferences shape fashion and pop culture. What's more,
marketers and social scientists haven't seen mass popularity like
his since the Beatles left Liverpool, Falk says.
</P>
<P>
   Falk hasn't been too shabby as an adviser. Nike, McDonald's and
Oakley are just a few of the companies that pay Jordan millions to
tout their products. In fact, Fortune magazine estimated that
Jordan's branding power is worth around $10 billion. Of course,
such an intangible value is nearly impossible to determine. But,
heck, if online auctioneer eBay has a market value of $261.44
billion, then why can't Jordan's brand be worth $10 billion?
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even Falk, could have anticipated that Jordan would
become as great of a basketball player as he is. If the agent could
have been more prescient, he says, ``we probably would have done
some things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   While Michael Inc. was quite careful in selecting Jordan's
corporate alliances, Falk says he and his client might have picked
companies and products with more synergy. ``I think I would have
done a better job of integrating the companies'' and cross-branding
their products using promotional tie-ins with the other
Jordan-backed products, Falk says.
</P>
<P>
   The agent is still getting a chance to try such things. ``That
has been our game plan we've tried to bring to (Detroit Pistons
star) Grant Hill,'' Falk says.
</P>
<P>
   Falk thinks that technology companies and the rest of corporate
America could take pointers from his experience as an architect of
Michael Inc. Here are his three tenets to successful brand
building:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quality products.  &LR; ``You have to have a great product to have a
great brand.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Consistent message.  &LR; ``You can't be all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Be genuine.  &LR; ``You can't gussy up a Chevrolet and sell it as a
Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jordan's dogged pursuit of excellence earned him top
personal accomplishments, a national collegiate championship, two
Olympic gold medals and six NBA championships. So I guess that
takes care of the quality part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the second point, Jordan was the epitome of consistency.
He earned top scoring and defense honors year in and year out. He
simply never coasted.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be the third point that catapulted Jordan to
international fame and fortune. He has been himself. He has
delivered on most of his promise, which is what you expect from any
great name. For instance, consumers pay more for Sony because the
name is synonymous with high quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with Los Angeles Lakers star Shaquille
O'Neal, who Falk cites as a ``great guy,'' is that his too-cool
rapper persona comes off as disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has made a lot of money, but the products (he endorses)
haven't sold well,'' Falk points out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his retirement from basketball earlier this year, Jordan
still sells.
</P>
<P>
   And the hyper-competitive athlete is reportedly looking to buy a
stake in an NBA franchise, namely the Charlotte Hornets. Jordan
wants to buy roughly half of the franchise, but he doesn't want to
pay half of what the team is supposedly worth. Instead, he wants
the amount that his brand value will add to the business to be
deducted from the price tag.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the Hornets are worth $160 million now, they
could be worth $180 million or more once Jordan's brand becomes
associated with the team. That's the argument Falk is making.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has increased the value of most any product he has
endorsed or has been affiliated with, whether they are Chevys,
hamburgers, telephone services or shoes, Falk says.
</P>
<P>
   ``His track record (as a value builder) is unprecedented,'' says
Falk, who declined comment on the status of Jordan's bid for a
stake in the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   But he did offer this observation about many of today's
professional athletes: ``Every player is too worried about trying
to be a brand and not concentrating on being a product first.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds similar to half of the Internet companies out there
racing to go public.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; YOU'VE GOT EARNINGS: &LR;  If America Online's absence from the H&AMP;Q
stock conference this week is a precursor to some sort of earnings
surprise, the market is oblivious to such prospects. Last week,
Street Smarts pointed out that AOL was skipping the conference and
that it planned to report quarterly earnings after the market
closes today. AOL soared almost $13 to close yesterday at $159.88
as news wires reported that investors anticipated the Internet
portal to beat Wall Street consensus earnings estimates for the
sixth quarter in a row.

 EBay Will Purchase Butterfield
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jamie Beckett &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
EBay, the online auctioneer that got its start selling Pez
dispensers, yesterday agreed to acquire venerable fine arts auction
house Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield for about $260 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, eBay announced first-quarter earnings yesterday.
Profits rose more than twelvefold, beating analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   EBay said the acquisition of Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield allows it
to expand to pricier offerings and a more affluent target market.
Just as importantly, the deal gives eBay the cache of the
134-year-old San Francisco auction house, which has sold everything
from 17th century armor to Elvis Presley's American Express card to
rare art pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to take eBay out of the Waldorf Astoria
parking lot and into the lobby,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul
Kagan Associates. ``The $260 million price may be cheap when you
consider the impact (an association with Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield)
will have on its public image.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also helps eBay keep pace with Amazon.com, which
recently launched its own online auction service.
</P>
<P>
   For Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, joining forces with the San Jose
Internet commerce pioneer provides instant, electronic access to
eBay's 3.8 million users.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than the top 10 auction houses put together,''
said John Gallo, president and chief executive of Butterfield &AMP;
Butterfield. ``EBay is redefining the auction industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield is the nation's No.3 fine arts
auctioneer but trails far behind leaders Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
and Christies International Plc. Gallo said the company will
continue its existing auction business at houses in San Francisco,
Los Angeles and Chicago. EBay plans to keep current management at
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield in place, Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Butterfield was set to go public, selling 1.5 million shares
for about $15 each. That would have valued the entire company at
about $94 million _ less than half of what eBay will likely pay.
The exact purchase price will be based on the average price of
eBay's high-flying stock before the transaction is completed, which
it expects this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's stock closed yesterday up $8.88 at $209 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies recently revealed plans to team to offer
online fine arts bidding.
</P>
<P>
   While eBay auctions typically result in winning bids of $200 or
less, Butterfield's auctions focuses on items selling from $300 to
$10,000, with some items selling for more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield had net revenues of $21 million last year and profit
of $1.5 million, according to a statement filed with federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended March 31, eBay said its profit rose to $7
million (5 cents a share) from $569,000 (1 cent) a year earlier.
Analysts expected eBay to earn 2 cents, according to First Call
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose more than fivefold to $34 million from $6 million.
Analysts said they'd expected revenues of about $25 million to $27
million.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's number of registered users rose to more than 3.8 million
at the end of the quarter, up from more than 2.1 million on
December 31. In addition, eBay hosted more than 22.9 million
auctions, up from 13.6 million in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will be accounted for as a tax-free pooling of
interests, the companies said, with the number of eBay shares
issued to be determined by its average stock price in a period
prior to the closing of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   EBay also said it might take a one-time charge in the quarter
related to the deal. It said the size of the charge had not yet
been determined.

 Amazon.com To Acquire 3 Online Firms
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Further polishing its e-commerce site, Amazon.com yesterday agreed
to buy three online companies, including Alexa Internet, a free Web
navigation service in San Francisco, and Redwood City e-commerce
firm Accept.com for $645 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The other company is Exchange.com, an online retailer of rare
books and music.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions are the latest in a shopping spree by
Amazon.com chief executive Jeff Bezos to expand the Seattle
retailer's selection of products and services and to attract more
consumers to its Web site. Earlier this year, the seller of books
and CDs announced plans to purchase virtual auctioneer LiveBid.com
and made investments in Drugstore.com and Pets.com.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com announced its newest purchases after the market
closed. Its stock _ which slid $2.94, to $207.19, earlier in the
day _ rose as high as $211 in after-hours trading. The acquisitions
are expected to close before June 30; Amazon.com officials wouldn't
break out how much they paid for each company.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are jazzed. There are few cooler companies on the
Internet than Amazon.com,'' said Brewster Kahle, co-founder and CEO
of Alexa Internet, which employs 50. ``It allows us to replace
high-octane fuel with rocket fuel in our gas tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com will employ Alexa Internet's technology to help its
users comparison shop and receive recommendations about other Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Accept.com, which is developing ways to simplify
business-to-consumer and person-to-person transactions over the
Net, should play a key role in making Amazon.com even easier to use
for its 8 million online shoppers, according to officials of both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining with them, we can &UR;  &LR; do things we never imagined,''
said Daniel Shader, chief executive of Accept.com, which employs
25. ``They have tremendous consumer reach, plenty of resources and
brand-name recognition. We're really fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   While Alexa Internet will function as a wholly owned subsidiary
in San Francisco, Accept.com is moving operations to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's most important pickup may be Exchange.com,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass., startup operates an Internet
``marketplace'' that matches buyers and sellers of hard-to-find
books and music at two Web sites,  &LR; www.bibliofind.com &LR;  and
 &LR; www.musicfile.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Bibliofind.com has a database of more than 9 million
hard-to-find books. MusicFile.com has more than 3 million items for
sale by retailers, dealers and private collectors.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Amazon.com boasts a selection of 4.7 million
books, records and videotapes. Its site drew 11 million visitors
last month, making it the 10th most-visited &UR;  &LR; destination on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win for Amazon.com customers because it further
increases our selection of rare and obscure items,'' Amazon.com CEO
Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

NATO REPORTS SOME YUGOSLAVS VOICE DISCONTENT WITH MILOSEVIC'S
POLICIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO leaders reported growing ``rumblings of
discontent'' Monday within Yugsolavia, as one of the country's top
officials sought a peace deal, warning that the bomb-ravaged Serb
republic soon ``will look like Hiroshima and Nagasaki'' after the
nuclear strikes on Japan in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon prepared to call up as many as 33,000 reservists
this week to bolster NATO's aerial siege of Yugoslavia, one of the
country's deputy prime ministers, Vuk Draskovic, said his
government is ready to accept a UN peacekeeping force that would
include NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal came as a US Army Apache helicopter, poised for
combat in Kosovo, crashed and burst into flames near an airfield in
Tirana, Albania. The two crewmen escaped without serious injuries.
The Pentagon said the aircraft was on a training mission and was
not hit by enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter is the second US aircraft to be destroyed in the
conflict, the other being an F-117 Stealth fighter shot down last
month near Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crashed on the day the Pentagon announced that
all 23 Apaches in Albania are ready to launch a risky offensive
against Serb ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, meanwhile, Draskovic said he believed his call for
peace reflected the views of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
though there was no evidence to support his assertion. There also
was no support among allied leaders for a peacekeeping operation
run by the United Nations rather than NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But the plea for peace was enough in itself to buoy NATO
leaders, whose airstrikes have failed to prevent Milosevic's forces
from killing, raping, or driving more than 1.4 million Albanians
from their homes in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that inside the system the facade of unity is
cracking wide open,'' said British Defense Secretary George
Robertson. He said there is ``deep discontent inside the military
high command'' in Yugoslavia and ``deep concern'' in the business
community ``about where Milosevic is dragging the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as Red Cross officials were permitted
to visit for the first time three US soldiers who have been held in
Yugoslavia since March 31. Escorted by Serb authorities, members of
the International Committee of the Red Cross met briefly with the
soldiers in Belgrade and reported that all three appeared to be in
good condition.
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments Monday and early Tuesday in
the Kosovo conflict:
</P>
<P>
   --The Pentagon deployed 30 Air Force refueling jets, the first
wave of 300 US aircraft that will join the massive air campaign.
More than 600 US warplanes are already engaged in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Tuesday, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen is
expected to order tens of thousands of Air Force reservists to
active duty to support the NATO effort, the largest call-up since
the war with Iraq in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   --Vice President Al Gore spoke for an hour by telephone with
Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is trying
to mediate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Chernomyrdin,
Russia's former prime minister, met last week in Belgrade with
Milosevic and is scheduled to meet Tuesday in Moscow with US Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Chernomyrdin reached no accord but agreed to talk again
about the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   --As many as 30,000 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were fleeing
toward the Macedonia border, an exodus that is expected to
aggravate the humanitarian crisis in the region's clogged refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 refugees, mostly Albanians, have fled Kosovo,
whose population was 2 million before Milosevic launched his
campaign of ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the exodus Monday, there were reports that Serb troops were
using ethnic Albanian women and children as human shields at an
ammunition depot in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO forces early Tuesday destroyed a TV transmitter at the
business center housing Milosevic's party headquarters in Belgrade,
residents said. The transmitter collapsed on top of the badly
damaged building housing the headquarters of Milosevic's Socialist
Party of Serbia, which was hit by NATO last Wednesday. Some debris
had hit the nearby Hyatt Hotel where some foreign journalists,
including employees of CNN, were staying.
</P>
<P>
   --The Rev. Jesse Jackson said he will lead a delegation of
religious leaders to Belgrade to issue a direct ``moral appeal'' to
Milosevic to release the captured US soldiers. Jackson said he
hoped to leave as early as Tuesday, even though the White House
said NATO could not guarantee his safety and expressed little
support for his mission.
</P>
<P>
   As a Democratic presidential candidate in 1984, Jackson traveled
to Syria and secured the release of Navy Lieutenant Robert O.
Goodman Jr., whose jet was shot down during a raid over Syrian
antiaircraft positions in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, when asked about Jackson's
``freelance diplomacy,'' said, ``There are certainly those who are
moving forward outside the context of the United States government
and NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Red Cross officials were not allowed to speak
privately with the captive American soldiers or to fully assess
their mental and physical health, as the Geneva Convention
requires. ``I was able to talk to them only a few minutes,'' said
Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International Committee of the
Red Cross. ``We looked into each other's eyes and shook hands very
warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross delivered letters from home to each soldier: Staff
Sergeant Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Specialist Steven
M. Gonzalez, 21, of Huntsville, Texas; and Staff Sergeant
Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But Sommaruga said the Yugoslav government blocked ``a
full-fledged ICRC visit in accord with the provisions of the Geneva
Convention.'' He said Milosevic promised to permit such a visit
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO's crackdown on Milosevic was bolstered by the
European Union's ban Monday on fuel shipments to Yugoslavia. NATO
military leaders also were devising a plan aimed at cutting off
most other oil shipments to Yugoslavia, although they said they
would not use force to halt the deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to not use force was seen as a concession to
Russia, which opposes a military blockade of oil and other goods to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, where Serb troops continue to clash with the
Albanian Army along the Kosovo border, the foreign minister, Paskal
Milo, called on NATO to send in ground forces. ``We support the
idea that it's necessary now to start ground operations from
NATO,'' Milo said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson, the British defense secretary, reiterated NATO's
opposition to a ground war. ``There is no intention to mount a
wholesale, organized, opposed invasion of Kosovo,'' he said.

   SUPREME COURT TO CONSIDER FDA RULES ON TOBACCO
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said it would decide whether the Food and Drug
Administration has authority to regulate tobacco products as drugs
and cigarettes as ``drug delivery devices.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting an appeal by the Clinton administration, the court
kept alive the prospect that restrictions the federal agency issued
in 1996 aimed at deterring smoking by minors may still take effect.
A federal appeals court had rejected the restrictions on the
grounds that Congress had not given the FDA the authority to
regulate tobacco.

   EBAY TO ACQUIRE AUCTION HOUSE

   Walt Disney created a secret ``Project Snowball'' in 1991 to

 New Life Pumped Into Energy Sector
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Nobody has ridden the stock market bronco with more gusto than
``new economy'' stocks like Microsoft, America Online or Yahoo. And
no ``old economy'' stocks have gotten bucked off more often than
energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   But, with crude oil prices up 60 percent this year and electric
and natural gas industry prospects brightening due to deregulation,
the energy sector is back in the saddle again.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say if it will be a stable ride, but some stock
analysts and mutual &LR;   &LR; fund managers are cheered by what they see
some 97 months into a bull market when many other industries appear
overvalued and due a comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these facts:
</P>
<P>
   _Crude oil futures surged past $18 a barrel last week, up from a
market price of $11.37 just two months ago. OPEC's decision last
month to cut production is a key reason for the surge.
</P>
<P>
   _There are signs that Asia is emerging from recession, a trend
favoring oil companies and firms that sell energy to businesses
with goods to export.
</P>
<P>
   _Natural gas prices, depressed by two warm winters that produced
slack demand, are rising again. The futures price, for delivery of
contracts next February, is up 15 percent indicating the market
expects firming demand.
</P>
<P>
   _Interest rates remain low, making dividend yields of 7.7
percent for Sempra Energy, formed through the merger of San Diego
Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Gas Co., attractive.
They also are enticing when compared with the zero-dividend (and,
sometimes, zero-profit) profiles of many Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   _Stock prices for energy sector companies look reasonable by
historic measures. In general, the energy sector has a collective
price-to-earnings ratio (a yardstick of value calculated by
dividing the stock price by earnings per share) that's
three-fourths the size of the P/E ratio for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. Currently, it's only half as great as the P/E
ratio of the broader index.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say this may be a good time to put money in a grizzled
sector that, until now, has looked very uncertain. It's not for
everyone, of course. It likely will appeal primarily to ``value''
investors who fear technology stocks are a bubble about to burst
and who are content with returns of 10 to 15 percent per year from
companies in basic, understandable industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many investors got caught up in the Internet frenzy that
there was a lack of excitement last year about anything that didn't
end with `dot.com,''' said Doug Christopher, energy analyst for
Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles. ``What I like about this
industry is that what it sells is a necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others sense a shift in the market. In the past two
weeks, some investors have been moving out of technology stocks and
into ``value'' stocks, including those in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
   For most investors, there are three options: Buy stock in
individual companies; buy mutual funds owning some energy stocks;
or buy shares in mutual funds focused exclusively on the oil, gas
or utility sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the energy sector is a tremendous investment right
now,'' says David Kiefer, manager of the nation's largest utility
mutual fund, the Prudential Utility Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer stuck his neck out last year, repositioning the $4.4
billion fund by putting two-thirds of its assets in electric and
natural gas companies and de-emphasizing telecommunications stocks
even though they &UR;  &LR; have performed well. The fund finished the year
with an anemic 8 percent return. Kiefer is disappointed but not
apologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly that the positioning is correct though I made
the shift a little too early,'' says Kiefer. ``There's tremendous
value there.''
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 is on track to grow 8.5 percent this year, compared
with 6.9 percent for electric utilities and 13.9 percent for
natural gas companies. But electric and gas company stocks sell for
much lower multiples of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund managers agree there's a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy has been a contrarian investment until now,'' says
Lawrence Rakers, director of energy funds for mutual fund giant
Fidelity Investments of Boston. ``We're in the early stage of a
rally now.''
</P>
<P>
   His group manages three natural resources and energy mutual
funds that show solid growth this year after a terrible 1998. The
best performing fund _ Fidelity Energy Service Fund _ is up 40
percent so far this year after losing 32 percent of its value last
year. Other Fidelity energy and natural resources funds are up 22
to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the sector rebounds this year, it will create momentum that
will attract index fund investments. More than $600 billion is
invested in index funds pegged to the S&AMP;P 500, whose stocks
includes most major U.S. energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, energy companies comprised 26 percent of the
value of the S&AMP;P 500. But as stock prices and market
capitalizations fell, the energy sector lost ground in the S&AMP;P 500.
Today, energy stocks make up only 5 percent of the value of the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   What significance does this have for energy sector investors?
</P>
<P>
   If the sector rebounds, market valuations will rise and index
dollars will flow back into the stocks, propelling them forward.
That will happen because index funds don't spread their dollars
evenly across a market. They replicate market capitalization.
Companies with high stock prices and lots of shares outstanding get
more attention than companies with lesser market capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, technology stocks have benefited from the
market-weighted purchases of index funds. America Online, whose
stock gained more than 700 percent last year, joined the S&AMP;P 500
last year.
</P>
<P>
   It now has a market capitalization of $150.5 billion _ nearly
triple that of General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The index fund phenomenon cuts in both directions. It lifts
rising stocks and kicks down falling stocks. For example, PG&AMP;E
Corp.'s stock dropped from a peak of $36.75 in fall 1993 to a low
of $22 in fall 1994 amid uncertainty about deregulation. As its
market capitalization fell 38 percent, index funds reduced their
holdings, adding to PG&AMP;E's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   As PG&AMP;E's price has risen _ it closed yesterday at $31.31 _ it
has attracted more investment from index funds as well as active
fund investors that are looking for good values.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see room for further growth, though many consider
Sempra Energy or Edison International, the Rosemead (Los Angeles
County) parent of Southern California Edison, a better value right
now.
</P>
<P>
   For all three California companies, the deregulation strategy is
similar. Make the highest return permitted by the California Public
Utilities Commission on their regulated utilities. (A PUC decision,
expected May 13, will set that rate of return at somewhere between
8.6 and 10.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   And expand other energy subsidiaries as aggressively as possible
to take advantage of a natural gas market deregulated a decade ago
and an electric generation business only recently deregulated in
many states.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 percent of PG&AMP;E's revenues now come from nonregulated
businesses. It wants the unregulated side of the house to supply 30
percent of revenues in five years since there's no limitation on
their profit.
</P>
<P>
   For the oil industry, rising crude prices mean better profits.
Equally significant, it is coming in an industry that operates much
more efficiently than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Chevron spent $15 to $17 to replace each
barrel of oil it took out of the ground. Today, technological
improvements mean it costs only $5 to add a barrel of oil to
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Based on total return, the natural resources sector is up 18.9
percent so far  &LR; this year, second only to the science and
technology sector that's up 23.5 percent. That's a startling
reversal of last year when natural resources _ oil, timber and
paper products, metals and natural gas _ lost 16.3 percent of their
value, propelling marriages like the Amoco-British Petroleum merger
and the Exxon-Mobil merger.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities are lagging as a sector, up 2.6 percent this year,
compared with 10.9 percent growth last year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone thinks an uptick in energy will be
lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kepes, a research director at the energy consulting firm
of Petroleum Finance Group in Washington, D.C., thinks oil prices
are unsustainable at $18 a barrel and will slip to $14 to $17. He
thinks the ``cheater syndrome'' will set in fairly soon, with OPEC
members breaking production limits to reap windfall profits.

U.S. DECLARES IT CAN'T BE SOLE ENGINE OF GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States told Germany and Japan Monday
that the world economy could not run for long on only one engine:
An American economy that keeps expanding as Europe slows and Tokyo
prays that a seven-year recession is ending.
</P>
<P>
   But after a daylong meeting of the finance ministers and central
bankers of the world's seven largest industrialized economies, it
became clear that even two years of global financial turmoil had
done little to forge a consensus about reviving economic growth. In
fact, several participants in the meetings described the return of
an atmosphere of calm about the state of the world economy, a calm
that one official said ``might make you think we had not just been
through a devastating world economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the meetings were filled with talk of a modest agenda of
changes for the International Monetary Fund and its member states,
mostly requiring greater disclosure by countries about their
finances, in hopes of preventing the kinds of surprises that fueled
the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no urgent talk, as there was six months ago, about
the risks of deflation. European officials offered no new agenda
for turning around a slowdown that has already led to a slide in
the value of the new European currency, the euro. And a clear
divide emerged between the United States and Japan over whether
Tokyo had already done enough.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the Group of Seven nations issued their
traditional communique Monday afternoon than Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and his Japanese counterpart, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, began to interpret the deliberately vague wording about
Japan's economic strategy in strikingly different terms.
</P>
<P>
   The communique, agreed upon by all the nations well before the
start of Monday's meeting, stated that Japan should ``implement
stimulus measures until growth is restored, using all available
tools to support strong domestic-demand-led growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, a former prime minister and one of Tokyo's canniest
politicians, told a news conference here Monday evening that the
wording ``has nothing to do with anything new.'' It should not be
read to suggest, he said, that Japan was ready to take further
steps to stimulate its economy. The IMF predicts that Japan's gross
national product will shrink 1.4 percent this year, while the
Japanese government officially insists that there will be modest
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin appeared to have a different view from that of Miyazawa.
Speaking at the Treasury, he insisted that the communique, in his
interpretation, committed Japan to ``continue to take important
measures'' until ``solid, domestic-demand-led growth is resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an enormous political gap laid bare by their
statements. Miyazawa knows that the government of Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, who visits here next week, has no political capital
left to persuade Japanese lawmakers to spend more on stimulating
the economy and bailing out failed banks. But Rubin has repeatedly
said that the United States cannot continue to soak up exports from
Japan and the rest of Asia, sending the American trade deficit
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not indefinitely sustainable economically,'' Rubin
said Monday, ``and certainly not politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin referred to the divergent positions as a ``slight
difference of emphasis.'' But it was a difference that had been
kept well below the surface for nearly a year until it re-emerged
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1997 and the first half of 1998 Rubin rarely missed
an opportunity to criticize Japan's slowness to react to its
troubles, despite overwhelming evidence that the country's
recession was worsening the angst in Asia. But after the Japanese
protested that he was undercutting confidence, Rubin muted those
comments and often praised Obuchi for pushing through bailouts of
Japan's private banks.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear now is that Japan is not ready with a second phase
of measures if the first run out of steam. That is exactly what
happened three years ago, when Japan briefly showed signs of
recovery only to fall into its deepest recession since the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, though, was hardly the only shrinking economy that
commanded the group's attentions Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministers stopped well short of publicly endorsing
new loans to Russia to keep the country from defaulting in coming
months on payments due to the IMF and the World Bank. Nonetheless,
officials say they expect a $4.2 billion loan will be delivered by
June, the first aid to Russia since it devalued its currency and
President Boris Yeltsin dismissed an economic reform team last
August.
</P>
<P>
   In their communique, the ministers said they remained
``concerned about the country's ongoing financial and macroeconomic
instability,'' and, in the typically understated wording of such
documents, urged Russia to adopt ``a credible economic program.''
But Rubin clearly remains skeptical about the ability of Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to deliver on Russia's commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming that the actions agreed to are real,'' Rubin said,
referring to Russia's promises to the IMF to rein in its government
spending, ``then I think that would be a substantial fiscal
accomplishment.'' But he quickly warned that ``agreement is one
thing; implementation is another,'' a clear reference to Russia's
past promises.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that the ministers spent very little time discussing
exchange rates. There was some discussion of the economic impact of
the air war in Kosovo, but no agreement on how the cost of
rebuilding the region might be shared. Most of the session was
devoted to questions of increased financial disclosure, with hints
that all the countries would soon adopt new rules regarding hedge
funds, the huge pools of money that some blame for accelerating the
Asian crisis and the flight of cash from Russia and Brazil.

Need reasons to ink Batesole? Here are 152 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the four years Mike Batesole has been the head
baseball coach at Cal State Northridge, the Matadors have averaged
almost 44 wins per season. He almost took CSUN to the College World
Series in 1996 and he regularly lands some of the area's top prep
players despite playing on a field that is below the standards of
some top high school programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Batesole doesn't have a contract beyond this season. By the
middle of June, the man who has guided CSUN to a 152-83-1 record in
almost four seasons could be coaching somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Senior pitcher Jim DeBiase said he doesn't really understand how
this could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a huge mistake,'' DeBiase said. ``(Batesole) has
given this school national exposure. I don't know why he would want
to put up with this headache anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Batesole is more diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some pretty big things on this university's plate,''
he said, mentioning the search for a new president, athletic
director and a site for a football stadium. ``I think it would be
pretty selfish for me to start waving Mike Batesole's _ or the
baseball program's _ flag.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN interim athletic director Sam Jankovich said he is
confident Batesole will have a new contract by the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we want to get done,'' Jankovich said. ``It's
something we're working on and hopefully we'll get it done. I don't
see a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If CSUN doesn't keep Batesole beyond June, he will be on a lot
of school's lists for head-coaching vacancies. Fresno State and Cal
might be searching after this season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole was working on a new contract last November when
athletic director Paul Bubb was forced to resign. The Matadors have
won 58 games since the program was cut in 1997, then hastily
reinstated four months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be working for free for a few months this summer,''
Batesole said. ``I hope my contract is done before then because
I'll be working here for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Batesole's first season, CSUN was 52-18 and won the
Western Athletic Conference. A loss to perennial powerhouse Florida
State in the regional final cost him a trip to the College World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were 42-20-1 in '97 and then 37-19 last year
despite the transfers of top pitchers Erasmo Ramirez, Benny Flores
and outfielder Termmel Sledge. Ramirez and Flores were a combined
23-5 for Cal State Fullerton last year. Sledge was the Big West
Player of the Year at Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole also lost the commitment of top recruit Michael
Schultz. The Cleveland High right-hander signed with Loyola
Marymount instead and went on to earn freshman All-America honors
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Collegiate Baseball magazine recognized Batesole's
accomplishment and picked him its coach of the year in '98. Even
though the Matadors are under .500 (22-26) entering today's home
game against Cal Lutheran, his team has overachieved.
</P>
<P>
   __ CSUN has played a strong schedule; last week's win over Cal
State Los Angeles was its first game of the season against a
non-Division I program. Because it is an independent, CSUN has
played against USC, UCLA, Loyola Marymount and Washington in
scheduled series and faced Michigan, UNLV and Texas A&AMP;M in a
tournament in March.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Matadors' losses have come to three of the country's
top pitchers: Washington's Jeff Heaverlo (twice), Texas A&AMP;M's Casey
Fossum and USC's Barry Zito.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Matadors are inexperienced. Batesole started three
freshmen infielders against Cal State L.A., and the two pitchers
who threw that day _ Michael Rainer and Mike Frick _ are both
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Marymount head coach Frank Cruz said Batesole's success
should mean a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think they would want to keep Mike around,'' Cruz
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oozing talent: One reason Batesole would love to stay at CSUN
is the talent coming out of the San Fernando Valley and its
surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball America recently published its All-America checklist,
and four former high school standouts from the area were listed:
UCLA's Bill Scott (Alemany) was a sophomore first-team selection,
Pepperdine's Woody Cliffords (El Camino Real) was named to the
freshman second team, Stanford's Joe Borchard (Camarillo) was named
to the sophomore second team and Sledge (Granada Hills) was on the
senior second team.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN alumni can only wonder where the program would be if the
Matadors played in a better facility and even half the top recruits
stayed in the Valley. (Batesole did land Granada Hills pitcher
Kameron Loe, ranked by Baseball America as one of its top 100
recruits.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a stadium and they take us from eight scholarships
to 11.7,'' Batesole said. ``That's kind of what keeps you hanging
on. We don't need the fourth-best stadium in America, but how about
the 100th? How about something you can be proud of?''

GUNMAN'S DIARY REVEALS PLOT TO KILL 500 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The two gunmen in the Columbine High School
massacre intended to kill 500 schoolmates, then take their killing
spree into the neighborhood before commandeering an airplane to
crash into New York City, journal entries indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Police, revealing only some details of the plot, said a diary
kept by gunman Eric Harris described plans that were a year in the
making and called for an extended rampage. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Investigators also said Monday they have questioned and
released an 18-year-old girl who may have helped Harris, 18, and
Dylan Klebold, 17, obtain two of the guns used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a carbine rifle, a TEC-DC9 assault pistol, two
shotguns and more than 30 homemade bombs, Harris and Klebold
stormed the school April 20. They apparently killed themselves as
SWAT teams surrounded the suburban school southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   During the attack, the two killed 12 students and a teacher and
injured 23 others.
</P>
<P>
   Complete autopsy reports have not been released, but the
Jefferson County coroner said Monday that neither Harris nor
Klebold was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of memorials in the community, the mourning
continued Monday with funerals for the teacher and three students.
Mourners gathered at the Trinity Christian Center for teacher
William ``Dave'' Sanders, 47, who was shot twice in the chest as he
helped students to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Services also were held for Lauren Townsend, 18, captain of the
girls' varsity volleyball team; Daniel Rohrbough, 15; and Cassie
Bernall, 17.
</P>
<P>
   According to the handwritten diary investigators found in
Harris' home, the two students, members of a social group called
the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' planned their attack for about a year.
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone described the journal entries
as ``calculated and cold-blooded plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris fantasized in the diary that he and Klebold would kill as
many as 500 students by beginning their attack during lunch when
most students would be in the cafeteria or studying in the library.
About half of the school's 1,900 students were in the cafeteria
when the pair began spraying gunfire and detonating bombs at 11:15
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But their grander plans were thwarted by the fast action of
police officers in the area, said Jefferson County Sheriff's
spokesman Steve Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have indications in the diary that make us believe that if
in fact they were able to carry out their entire plan there could
have been quite a lot more damage and quite a few more
fatalities,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   He lauded the police response, suggesting ``perhaps some major,
major catastrophies were averted by the action that was taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were met with return fire from a sheriff's deputy,
Neil Gardner, who was working security at the school. Other
officers responded to the scene quickly, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a perimeter set up around that school literally
within minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not release specific excerpts from the diary
showing how Harris and Klebold intended to escape the school campus
to continue with their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my understanding there was plenty of ammunition with
them,'' Davis said. ``That (killing themselves because they had no
more firepower) wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators believe Harris and Klebold acted alone
during the attack, they have said others may have been involved in
the planning and possibly helped the pair obtain weapons or make
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old girl, described as the girlfriend of Klebold,
was questioned by authorities because they believe she may have
helped the pair get the carbine rifle and semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   She was released without charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not enough evidence that we're aware of to classify
her as a suspect,'' Davis said. ``There is no arrest imminent
either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If, through our investigation, it is shown that she, or anyone
else for that matter, either supplied those weapons to the
suspects, especially with knowledge of their intent, the district
attorney has informed us that certainly he's leaving open the
possibility of charging not only her but anyone for that matter
that could be shown that they knew,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said Monday his office had not ruled out the
possibility that one of the gunmen may have shot the other, then
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great possibility,'' Davis said. ``Obviously we want
to do some ballistic tests, especially with the number of officers
that were returning fire. But none of the officers that returned
fire, at this point, have indicated to us that they actually felt
like they hit any of the suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Jefferson County deputies and at least one Denver officer
shot at the suspects, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said it has not been determined if a 20-pound propane tank
bomb found in the cafeteria had been deliberately fired at by the
gunmen in an attempt to detonate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were indications that they had possibly tried to fire on
that bomb,'' Davis said. ``Whether it was a coincidence that some
of the rounds hit close to it or whether they were trying to
detonate it by firing at it, we may never know.''

CLONED GOATS MAY SPUR PRODUCTION OF BETTER, CHEAPER MEDICINES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three unnamed dairy goats born last year on a farm in
Charlton, Mass., became the latest symbol Monday in the worldwide
scramble to produce better, cheaper pharmaceuticals by cloning
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The goats are exact genetic copies of a goat whose DNA was
altered to produce milk laced with an anti-clotting protein that
could be used to treat heart attack and stroke victims, scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine
and Genzyme Transgenics Corporation, who announced the cloning
Monday, said their experiment also proved that more efficient
methods of cloning could be achieved, significantly reducing the
number of eggs needed to successfully produce one cloned animal.
The method could mean that complex biopharmaceutical drugs can be
produced less expensively and at a much faster rate than
traditional manufacturing methods.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being reported in the May 1 issue of the journal
Nature Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is here,'' says Mark Westhusin, an animal
scientist at Texas A&AMP;M University. ``Every one of these
breakthroughs brings the goals closer to reality. It may not be all
that efficient, but it's getting closer.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's first cloned goats are part of a growing menagerie
of genetically created animals that began when Scottish scientists
announced they had cloned the first sheep in 1996, named Dolly.
Since then the methods and practical benefits of cloning animals
has progressed at sonic speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three calves were born with genetically engineered
traits, a breakthrough for scientists from the University of
Massachusetts. In that case, researchers inserted two genes into
the donor cell's nucleus, and then inserted the material into the
cow egg. The genes were markers, which scientists could detect
after birth to show the experiment was successful.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest Tufts/Genzyme work, the marker was the gene for
producing Antithrombin III (ATIII), a protein found naturally in
human plasma which regulates blood clotting. The substance is
currently undergoing government clinical trials as a treatment for
strokes and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three goats was produced using earlier-developed
methods that required 140 eggs to produce one cloned goat.animal.
But the Massachusetts scientists said using new techniques they
developed 92 eggs yielded two live offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric W. Overstrom, a developmental biologist at Tufts, says
one of the benefits of cloning is that the results are known
immediately in the lab. Using standard non-cloning methods to
produce transgenic farm animals, there's less control, and
scientists don't see the results of their labor, until after the
mother animal has given birth. And if the point of all this
engineering is to quickly and efficiently produce a special protein
in milk, it's the females you're after. With cloning, you can get
all females.
</P>
<P>
   James Serpell, a professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine
at the University of Pennsylvania, sees no problem from an animal
welfare prospective. Because they are so valuable, the research
animals are typically well cared for and the environmental impact
in this case, he said, is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might it unleash something nasty on the world?'' he said. ``In
the case of these goats, the product is taken in a relatively
noninvasive way _ the animals are milked.''
</P>
<P>
   And they may be milked for quite a lot. Sandra Nusinoff Lehrman,
president and CEO of Genzyme Transgenics estimates that the annual
European market for ATIII, which uses the protein in wider
applications currently than the United States, is worth $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the cloning of transgenic animals could lead to the
production of a variety of protein therapies for a wide array of
illnesses, including arthritis and cancer. And, as may be the case
of ATIII, the farm produced version could be safer from viruses
than that harvested from human plasma.
</P>
<P>
   Many complex proteins, Lehrman says, simply cannot be produced
synthetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Layering the cloning on top of the transgenics work is
important in getting the therapeutic proteins to the patients in
the most efficient manner possible,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Westhusin agrees. He said being able to use cloning techniques
in transgenics is infinitely more precise and therefore efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever people in the field are successful,'' hesaid, ``it
makes it easier for the rest of us to get funding.''

<HEADLINE>
CLINTON TO PROPOSE CHARGING PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO COMMIT GUN
CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to announce a package of
anti-gun proposals on Tuesday, including measures to halt the
importation of clips that allow assault weapons to fire more than
10 shots at once and to charge parents with a felony if their
children commit crimes with guns.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which would require approval by a Congress that has
fiercely spurned efforts at gun control, would also require people
who sell explosives to conduct the same kind of background check on
buyers that gun dealers must now conduct. Current law prohibits the
sale of explosive devices and ingredients to convicted felons,
fugitives and stalkers, but it does not require the kind of check
that might turn up such a history. The ingredients include TNT,
dynamite, blasting caps and the black powder that is often used in
pipe bombs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president is also proposing to extend such checks to people
who buy guns at gun shows. He would make it a felony for adults to
knowingly or recklessly allow children to have guns, and he would
ban violent juveniles from ever being able to buy guns, even when
they turn 21.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes measures that the president has discussed
publicly before, including reinstituting a waiting period before
someone could buy a gun. A five-day wait had been required under
the Brady Act, but it expired last November. The administration is
now calling for a three-day cooling off period, even though most
checks now are instant. He will also propose that gun manufactures
be required to include child-safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's proposed legislation comes a week after
the deaths of 15 people in Littleton, Colo., in the biggest school
shooting in the nation's history, administration officials said its
announcement had been been planned for weeks and was not in direct
response.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concern expressed by many in Congress about the
shootings, it is not at all clear that the president's package will
be welcomed on Capitol Hill. Republicans and even some Democrats
have indicated that the emotional gun-control issue is too hot to
handle, particularly as the parties brace for an intense struggle
next year over control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, are
planning to announce on Tuesday that they want to hold a national
conversation on youth and culture, a clear indication that they
want to focus less on guns and more on social factors that can lead
children to shoot children.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,
threw cold water Monday on a focus on guns. ``I'm not sure that gun
legislation is what we need,'' he told reporters. Citing the
Internet, the media and a lack of attention paid to students, he
said: ``I think those are the kinds of things we'd better be
looking at if we're going to try to solve what is an increasingly
serious societal problem today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the president's many comments on the Colorado shootings since
last week, he has generally avoided discussing what role the
availability of weapons _ and his long-time nemesis, the National
Rifle Association _ might have played in Littleton. He too has
ruminated over several other possible factors, including the
American culture of violence and the role of the Internet, the
media and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Monday how much Clinton held the gun lobby responsible
for the Littleton shootings, Joe Lockhart, the president's
spokesman, said it was ``premature to somehow try to assign
blame.'' But he went on to say: ``I think there is a consensus in
this country that we need to do more. The president will propose
doing more. And it's time for the NRA to get out of the past and
get on the right side of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the president's advisers had urged him to hold
back on a discussion of guns in the immediate aftermath of the
Littleton shootings. ``To turn a human tragedy into a political
debate was a mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is as aware as anyone of the political risks in taking
on the gun lobby. In 1994, after he forced a ban on assault weapons
through Congress, the Democrats lost control of the House and
Clinton subsequently ascribed the loss to the gun lobby's campaign
against those Democrats who had supported the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight for the assault-weapons ban cost 20 members their
seats in Congress,'' Clinton said at the time. ``The NRA is the
reason the Republicans control the House.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban on assault weapons included a ban on the importation of
the clips, but had grandfathered in those manufactured before

most imported clips, so it wanted to end the exemption.

IN JONESBORO, FROM AN EARLIER SHOOTING, THE ECHOES HAVE YET TO DIE

<P>
   JONESBORO, Ark. _ When Gretchen Woodard heard about the two boys
in Colorado who had shot 12 classmates and a teacher to death, some
of her reactions were those of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   She thought, ``Where were these boys' parents? How could they
not have known these kids were building bombs in their garage? Why
didn't they pay attention to the trench coats and other warning
signs of trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Woodard had to stop short of taking comfort in the next
thought on most people's minds, ``My child would never do anything
like that.'' Because, in fact, Ms. Woodard's child did, just last
year, here in Jonesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Her older son, Mitchell Johnson, then 13, was the older of the
two friends who murdered four classmates and a teacher in the
Jonesboro school massacre on March 24, 1998. In the year and a
month since that day, she has had to stop short a lot, learning to
monitor herself at every turn, trying not to say, do or even think
anything that might cause anyone any more pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has made me very humble,'' the 43-year-old Woodard said in
the living room of her tidy, modest home at the end of a country
road, about a mile from Westside Middle School, where her son and
Andrew Golden, 11, staged a false fire alarm and then began
shooting from nearby woods as children exited the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the last person to sit in judgment of other people,'' Ms.
Woodard said, her 3-year-old daughter, Jessie, beside her, playing
with a ladybug. But she knows it would be easy for others to judge
her, because ``it is human nature to have questions and point your
finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Her younger son, Monte, 12, has also had to learn to live in the
shadow of his brother's deed. When Monte, a sixth-grader, walks
down the halls at Westside, where pictures of the shooting victims
adorn the walls, he carries all his books and supplies in his arms,
in full view. He decided soon after the shooting not to wear a
backpack, because he thought it would scare the other students
every time he reached inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, Monte was angry at his brother for doing something
so stupid, so senseless,'' Ms. Woodard said. ``He cried and I just
held him and he kept asking why. I couldn't begin to explain. I was
too overwhelmed with the horror of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry, a youth minister at Central Baptist Church, where
Monte attends a youth group meeting every Wednesday night, has seen
Ms. Woodard and her sons through some of that horror. Often in the
last year, he has counseled Mitchell Johnson in jail, both here and
at the juvenile detention center in the town of Alexander, a
three-hour drive to the southwest, where both Mitchell and Andrew,
convicted of murder in a juvenile court, may be held until they are
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``That family feels a whole buffet of emotions,'' he said.
``Fear of retaliation. Social shame. A struggle to maintain their
own dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard said she does not try to defend or explain her son's
behavior. ``For so long afterward I blamed myself,'' she said.
``You question everything _ your sense of right and wrong, even
your TV. And all of a sudden, your whole life, whether it be good
or bad, is put under a microscope and everybody is saying, `Well,
you watched that television show two months ago, and it's because
you played a video game, it's because your son listens to rap
music.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Who amongst us can hold up for very long under that pressure?
That is something I know those parents in Littleton will have to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard has heard people blame her son's participation in
the shooting on her divorce from his father after a 15-year
marriage. Soon afterward, she remarried. She has been faulted for
teaching her son to shoot a rifle so he could go hunting, just as
she did when she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the sexual abuse of her son and his brother by a
neighborhood teen-ager when they lived in Minnesota, which she
learned about only when her ex-husband revealed it to Barbara
Walters on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too easy to point your finger and blame the family,''
Perry, the youth minister, said. ``Is Gretchen a good parent? Yes.
Is she flawless? No. Is she evil? No. Does she care for and love
her kids? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, both Monte and his mother have been buoyed and a
little surprised by the kindness of the Westside students and
teachers. ``I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised if people had
wanted to spit on me or yell at me,'' Ms. Woodard said. ``But that
hasn't ever happened. It has been our blessing that this community
has let us go on.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of school this fall, 12-year-old Candace
Porter, 12, who survived a bullet that ballistics tests proved came
from the gun of Monte's brother, sat down next to Monte in the
cafeteria, hugged him, and told him she would always be his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Another person wounded in the shooting, Lynette Thetford, is
Monte's social studies teacher. ``I really thought at first, `Why
doesn't his mother take him away from here?''' she said. ``Now I
know why she didn't. He fits in well with the kids here and they
accept him. And he seems to be handling it well. He is a strong
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte is learning to play the trumpet and Ms. Woodard is vice
president of the band boosters at Westside. On his last report
card, Monte got all A's. And for a citywide Saturday honors program
for which each school in the Jonesboro area can sponsor one pupil,
Westside picked Monte.
</P>
<P>
   Still, each good thing feels bittersweet. Whenever Ms. Woodard
referred to the day of the shooting, her normally warm and open
face froze into a stunned, pained look and she whispered, ``March
24th of '98.
</P>
<P>
   As she talked, Ms. Woodard struggled to hold back tears. Her
daughter, Jessie seemed used to that. She put down the French fries
she was eating, hopped onto her mother's lap, gave her a huge hug,
took her mother's face in her hands and said, ``Please mama, don't
be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodard is careful to point out that even her daughter's
love reminds her that the families of her son's victims cannot hold
their children that way. ``No amount of `I'm sorry's' can make up
for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynette Thetford, the teacher who was shot, said she felt for
Ms. Woodard. ``There is no closure for her, and not many people to
comfort her,'' she said. ``I truly believe I would rather have my
child die than do something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Ms. Woodard and Monte have learned to do, Ms.
Thetford stopped herself short, and then tempered her words: ``Of
course, if I had lost my child, I might feel a different way.''

<P>
   As quarterback for the Denver Broncos for the last 16 years,
John Elway has lost two miles and maybe three city blocks during
football games, or 3,780 yards. This is a National Football League
record for going backward.
</P>
<P>
   He has had more people pounce on him more frequently than any
other quarterback in NFL history, having been sacked 516 times.
Another record. This means that no one wearing the livery of an NFL
team has ever had to rise _ head inside his helmet ringing like the
Liberty Bell, bones jiggling like a Halloween skeleton in the wind
_ and wobble to the huddle to try again, and again.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the notorious Super Bowls. His first was in
1987, when the Broncos lost to the Giants. His second was in 1988,
when the Broncos lost to Washington. His third was in 1990, when
the Broncos lost to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been excused for thinking at times, ``I should have
stayed with baseball.'' He was the Yankees' first draft choice in
June 1981. He played one year in the Yankee minor league system,
after his junior year at Stanford, and surely learned valuable pro
lessons about disappointment and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway, who will be 39 years old on June 28, has announced
that he will officially retire Sunday. It would have come already
but for the high school tragedy in the Denver suburb of Littleton.
He believed rightly and sensitively that his announcement might
draw attention at a totally inappropriate time.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, not only did Elway return to games in which he was
repeatedly knocked down, physically and otherwise, but he also
became the winningest quarterback in history, with a record of 148
victories, 82 losses and 1 tie, a .643 winning percentage, just
ahead of the Dolphins' Dan Marino in victories and percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not always play my best,'' he said after the third Super
Bowl, and looking for some light at the end of the tunnel, ``but I
always play my hardest. I'm competing all the way until the
scoreboard clock reads zero-zero-zero.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is no secret that he returned for a fourth time to the
Super Bowl, in 1998, and won it, at the tender age of 37, risking
loin and limb, to scramble and dive for a crucial first down late
in the 31-24 victory over highly favored Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, was so moved by Elway's
professionalism, resilience and, well, dotage, that when handed the
1998 Super Bowl trophy after the game, he said, ``This one's for
John.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder if you're going to run out of years,'' Elway said.
``But fortunately I hung on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Elway came back to lead Denver to a second straight Super
Bowl championship over Atlanta in January.
</P>
<P>
   If a sports figure can legitimately be viewed as a model of
something positive _ an increasingly difficult stance in today's
sports world _ John Elway is a prime candidate. Elway has become a
living symbol of refusing to be defeated by defeat. As a pro, it
began in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was an outstanding outfielder and hitter for Stanford, and
with, not surprisingly, a bazooka for an arm. In the summer of '82,
after his junior year in college, he signed with the Yankees for a
$140,000 bonus. He would return that fall to again play football at
Stanford. But at Oneonta, N.Y., the 6-foot-3-inch, 205-pound
all-America quarterback wondered early on what he had got into, a
kind of harbinger for his football career.
</P>
<P>
   For the first week and a half he had just 1 hit in his first 22
at-bats. ``And the fans were on him _ some of it was pretty
vicious,'' Suzanne Nader, then the team general manager, said,
``and the paper here, The Daily Star, each day had a `Where's Our
Golden Boy?' story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Boy showed up. He played an excellent right field,
throwing runners out with the accuracy of his touchdown tosses. And
he wound up batting a a promising .318 in 42 games, with 4 homers
and 25 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The question after his senior year was: Would it be baseball or
football? ``It's a thrill to throw a touchdown pass,'' he said,
``but there's nothing like hitting a home run.'' He was the No. 1
pick in the 1983 NFL draft, and decided on football. Perhaps that
was where his heart was, and his dad's _ Jack Elway was head
football coach at San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hated to lose John,'' George Steinbrenner recalled
yesterday. ``He was a good ballplayer and a good citizen. While he
didn't have all the tools of a Derek Jeter, he had the right ethics
and the right understanding, and he would have made himself a star
in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he believe Elway made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding!?'' Steinbrenner asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes.

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It began innocuously enough, with a media
relations assistant asking a rookie point guard if he had a
nickname yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about White Chocolate?'' Stephanie Shepard said while
putting together a player biography in January for the Sacramento
Kings media guide.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams laughed. He is white. His game had been called
sweet. Why not? he figured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with that name because of his style,'' Shepard, who
is black, said. ``He has flash and pizazz. The way he does things
with the ball is incredible to me. It reminds me of, like,
schoolyard street ball when I go to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of some footage I've seen of Pistol Pete
Maravich, I've never seen any white kid play like Jason. John
Stockton is wonderful in his way. But Jason is like every kid I've
seen on the playground.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point, the phenomenon of the flashy playmaker and the
not-so-subtle nickname took off and created their own little
two-on-one break against stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Everything has not unfolded smoothly, though. Williams, who
embraced the nickname early on, has lately come to regard it more
warily, worried that the attention surrounding the nickname has
become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' organization, made uncomfortable by the nickname's
highlighting that a white player has what is perceived as a black
game, has discouraged it. And Williams' agent prays for it to fade
away altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Still, White Chocolate is out there, growing to be as much a
part of the National Basketball Association lexicon as Mailman or
Magic. And so Williams' nickname as much as his game _ complete
with stutter steps, no-look passes, behind-the-back flourishes _
has the league buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   Many young black youngsters who turn up to see Williams play _
youngsters who might not have seen Maravich play before he retired
in 1980 _ say he is the coolest white player they have ever seen,
and they view White Chocolate as evidence of Williams' embrace of,
and acceptance in, the hip-hop culture. The Kings, through their
public relations director, have recommended that local broadcasters
not use it, and the team's play-by-play announcer has generally
done so.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the unease was a contest to replace the name
conducted on ESPN's Web site. The winner? Thrilla in Vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, that did not solve the matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Williams' game, though, is not merely about flair. He is
averaging 13 points, 6 assists and 3 rebounds a game, and his
production as a first-year player is rivaled only by Toronto's
Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Full of confidence, Williams, the seventh selection in last
year's draft, often launches 3-pointers within two dribbles after
he crosses midcourt. He takes flight and then does not decide what
to do until he begins to come down. According to a recent sales
survey of NBA apparel, Williams' No. 55 jersey is among the
league's top five sellers this season.
</P>
<P>
   And in a lockout-ruptured season, the Kings have experienced a
13 percent increase in attendance _ tops in the NBA _ and the club
is currently in position to make the playoffs for only the third
time since the franchise moved to Sacramento from Kansas City in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   And so it might be reasonable to ask how a 23-year-old from
Belle, W.Va., has keyed a team's revival and unintentionally
initiated a kind of informal, often uncomfortable conversation
regarding long-held assumptions about basketball and race.
</P>
<P>
   Inventing passes and shots that seem to materialize more out of
his imagination than his body, Williams effectively parachuted into
the NBA from nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up in rural Belle (pop. 1,421), which is adjacent
to the predominantly black town of Rand. To get the best
competition growing up, he ventured to the Rand playground and to
the Charleston recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say I've got a game like a black person,''
Williams said. ``Guarding those guys was more of a challenge to me
'cause they talked more trash, especially with me being the only
white player on the court playing with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I went out, I was scared. I'm not going to lie
to you. There was a different person coming at me, picking on me,
every day. People said so many things to me. There was a couple
other white guys that would show up, but they struggled to get on
the court, so I was pretty much the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Two memorable plays this season are at the heart of the hype
around Williams.
</P>
<P>
   There was his cross-over dribble to get by a stunned Gary Payton
of the Seattle SuperSonics earlier in the season, a move endlessly
replayed on the highlight shows.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the move he executed on Feb. 25. At the MCI
Center in Washington, Williams drove to the basket and faked a
behind-the-back pass in midair. With the defense frozen, he brought
the ball back around to the front of his body and lofted a soft
layup toward the rim. The shot rolled out, but the crowd ultimately
gave Williams a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason deserves the attention because he's one of best
ballplayers out there, regardless of color,'' Chris Webber,
Williams' teammate, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Allen did it his rookie year, he was viewed as a
thug,'' Webber said, referring to Allen Iverson, the NBA's leading
scorer and most improvisational player. ``That's all I'll say. It's
just society. I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has tried not to spend too much time analyzing it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if it bothers me,'' Williams said of his
nickname. ``It doesn't bother me because I've been stuck with
nicknames all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever look at a person because of their color. I judge
a person on who you are, how you act.''
</P>
<P>
   Others feel differently. Some worry that the nickname reinforces
the stereotype of black athleticism. Others think it is doing to
whites what hurtful racial stereotyping has long done to blacks in
this country: broadly implying what a racial group is supposed to
be capable of doing and what it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as Williams warmed up before a game against the
Clippers at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, several young black
teen-agers shouted his name.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Mitchell, 15, of Ontario, Calif., said, ``He got game.''

NOW THE NFL IS LOSING A LEGEND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League is about to go where it has not
been in almost two decades _ to life without John Elway. First
Jordan retires, then Gretzky, and now football's No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, the Denver Bronco quarterback who is one of the most
athletic and productive players in league history, is expected to
make his retirement official on Sunday. Elway made up his mind to
retire several weeks ago after consulting with close friends and
then his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you officially that we're going to do it on
Sunday,'' the team owner, Pat Bowlen, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elway delayed the announcement because of the shootings at
Columbine High School in the Denver suburb of Littleton last week
and because he had second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I'm retired,'' he was quoted as saying in Monday's
Denver Post. ``One of the reasons I held off saying anything was to
make sure it's what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who has worn a brace on his knee for the last several
years, added: ``I seriously considered coming back, but I just
couldn't make it because of my knee. I've never liked it when an
athlete says he's retired and then comes back. Once I've decided, I
am certain.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors apparently went into Elway's decision to
retire after 16 seasons. First, Elway, 38, felt his body was
beginning to break down. It is likely, for instance, that he will
need a replacement for his left knee, which was reconstructed
earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even though he was the most valuable player in Super Bowl
XXXIII in January, he missed all or part of six games last season
with hamstring, back and rib injuries. He took 10 painkilling
injections around his rib area in November in the wake of a brutal
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Elway felt there was little else to prove. After losing
three Super Bowls with Denver under the former coach Dan Reeves,
Elway won two straight with Mike Shanahan as coach.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Elway was concerned about his legacy, that
he would be seen as a quarterback with great individual statistics
but no championship trophies. But Giants Coach Jim Fassel, one of
Elway's closest friends, said, ``John doesn't have to worry about
any of that stuff now. There is no one who would challenge the fact
he is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The last factor for Elway was more personal. Elway wanted to
spend more time with his family, especially his wife, Linda, who at
the start of last season became critically ill after colon surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL loses more than a quarterback when Elway leaves the
game. Like Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky in their sports, Elway
was an ambassador for football who became heavily involved in
charity work in the Denver area and across the country. He never
embarrassed the league with any off-the-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, friends of the quarterback said that Elway
often contemplated how many titles he would have won if Shanahan
had been his coach throughout his professional career. Elway had a
rocky relationship with Reeves, but was close to Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Elway leaves the game as the quarterback with the most
victories, 148. Elway had 47 game-winning or game-tying
fourth-quarter drives.
</P>
<P>
   Elway finishes with 51,475 passing yards, and he and Miami's Dan
Marino (58,913) are the only two quarterbacks to amass more than
50,000. Elway, Marino and Fran Tarkenton are the only quarterbacks
to throw more than 300 touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his arm strength and mobility, he was a rare combination
of talents,'' New York Jets Coach Bill Parcells said Monday at the
media day for the Cadillac-NFL Golf Classic at the Upper Montclair
Country Club in Clifton, N.J. ``I don't know if I've seen a
quarterback who had the ability to run and the ability to throw in
one package like John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly a player that will be missed in the NFL. He
was a great asset to our league.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine the Broncos truly replacing Elway, but
they will try with Elway's backup last year, Bubby Brister. The
good news for Denver is that Brister was 4-0 in the games Elway
missed last season. The bad news is that Brister turns 37 in August
and has not started more than eight consecutive games since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is considered one of the best offensive strategists in
the NFL, but few believe even he can make Brister into an elite
quarterback who is even one-fifth of what Elway was.  &QL;

 PACKAGE CONTAINING NUCLEAR MATERIAL GETS LOST, LANDS IN eNGLAND 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten days ago, a worker at a Burlington, Mass., high-tech firm
mailed off a 200-pound package containing enough irradium to kill
anyone who came near it.
</P>
<P>
   The package was supposed to arrive by Federal Express at a
Mexican construction firm the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   It never got there.
</P>
<P>
   For days, frantic regulators, Federal Express staffers and
executives of AEA Technology QSA searched the region _ including a
mile-by-mile surveillance of the route from Burlington to Logan
Airport for signs of any radiation leakage. The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission went on special alert, just as though there had been an
accident at a nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the package was found, intact, in a hangar at a small
airport outside London. Just a routine mix-up, said Federal
Express.
</P>
<P>
   But to others, the long, mysterious journey of the radioactive
package casts sharp new light on the estimated 500,000 packages
containing nuclear materials that get mailed every year through
Logan alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have something potentially dangerous and you lose
it, it could be stolen or put someplace where people could be
hurt,'' insisted Scott Portzline, a Harrisburg, Pa., nuclear
watchdog who opposes sending such materials via common carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express, for its part, said the package was simply lost,
like a misaddressed letter. And FedEx officials said it would have
posed no risk to the public because it was properly packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, government regulators said the parcel would have
been deadly to anyone who penetrated the thick packaging.
</P>
<P>
   And a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which may
levy fines if it finds that regulations were violated, had declared
an alert similar to the type used for accidents at nuclear plants
after the package was reported missing on April 21. Regulators
followed a prescribed search-and-report routine during the time the
package was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger concern is that someone who is not a qualified
handler of this could obtain it, take it home, and cause damage,''
said Neil Sheehan, Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   By law, weapons-grade radioactive material cannot be sent by
common carriers. But some critics say that the sheer volume of
other radioactive materials shipped commercially poses intolerable
risks.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated half-a-million shipments of radioactive material
pass through Logan each year, many of them from nuclear medicine
producers such as Dupont in Billerica, said Robert Hallisey,
director of the radiation control program of the state Department
of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC says that nationwide, misplacement of nuclear materials
similar to the AEA incident this month occurs about once a year.
NRC records indicate that a Dupont package of radioactive medicine
was temporarily lost in February, and later recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But Hallisey said activists and others overreact to the
potential danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always someone with `Chicken Little' syndrome,''
Hallisey said. ``But we think there are adequate controls in place
for shipments of radioactive materials.''
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Express spokesman said radioactive materials account
for only one half of one percent of the material the company
handles. Shippers pay extra to send dangerous materials by private
courier, but spokesman Jesse Bunn declined to say how much of a
surcharge is added or how frequently dangerous materials turn up
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The journey of AEA's irradium parcel, which held materials used
to detect weaknesses in bridges and structures, started on April 16
from the company's plant.
</P>
<P>
   The lead cylinder holding the irradium is supposed to be durable
enough to resist breakage even if dropped from a four-story
building. ``These packages are built better than tanks,'' said
William McDaniel, AEA's director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the extra care and handling implied by FedEx's nuclear
surcharge did not prevent the parcel from being shipped to England
rather than Toluca, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the delivery date had passed, the company in
Mexico called Burlington to say it had received a bill of lading,
but no bundle. The call sparked an intense search.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express checked its logs and its hazardous materials
team scoured hangars and trucks in Boston, Memphis, and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the NRC held a briefing for senior regional
officials on the incident, according to records. By Friday, those
tracking the parcel had determined that it definitely left Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But until 6:19 a.m. Monday, when someone found the package in
Stansted Airport outside London, no one knew where it was.

BILL WOULD CURB ONLINE WEAPONS SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As an aide sitting at a computer clicked through Web
sites showing automatic handguns, assault rifles and other weapons
for sale on the Internet, Sen. Charles Schumer on Monday urged
Congress to enact a law to further regulate the online gun trade.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a New York Democrat, introduced the bill, The Internet
Gun Trafficking Act of 1999, in March and received little
attention. But Monday he said the high school shooting in
Littleton, Colo., had given urgency to the bill, and he hoped it
would win swift support.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that two students responsible for the
Colorado shooting purchased their guns online, but Schumer said he
believed the Internet offered children the easiest means for
circumventing state and federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two glaring loopholes that allow kids and criminals
to get guns,'' Schumer said, ``and those are gun shows and the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require Web sites dedicated to gun sales to be
maintained by a federally licensed firearms dealer. The sites would
have to be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, and would prohibit the sites from transmitting
information that might encourage transactions without a licensed
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law was denounced Monday by gun dealers who said
that nearly all of Schumer's concerns were addressed by existing
laws. Richard Feinberg, a licensed dealer in Norton, Mass., who
operates We Are Guns, one of the Web sites discussed by Schumer
Monday, said he was required to follow all state and federal laws
for sales by computer and in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws are already in place,'' Feinberg said, adding that
the lack of consistent laws nationwide was a more important
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law is also likely to come under attack from free
speech and free trade advocates who do not see any difference
between a gun sold online and a gun sold through a newspaper or
magazine advertisement or by mail-order catalog. ``It's hard for me
to understand why the Internet would make in essence an illegal
transaction easier or harder to do,'' said Eric J. Johnson, the
director of the Forum for Electronic Commerce at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer said his measure would insure that licensed dealers
and gun purchasers meet in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are 14 years old and you want to buy a gun directly
through the Internet, right now, no one is going to know your
age,'' Schumer said. ``But under my legislation, you would have to
show up at the gun shop and a licensed dealer would have to give
you the gun.''

NOTORIETY NOW FOR EXILED LEADER OF CHINESE MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sunday, followers of Buddhist Law staged the
largest protest in Beijing since the Tiananmen Square movement 10
years ago, but the New York-based spiritual leader who developed
the doctrine rarely shows his face.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Li Hongzhi, a 47-year-old native of Changchun in
northeastern China who now calls New York home, keeps a low public
profile even as his books, audio and video tapes and Web sites
spread his message to tens of million of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Close associates say they do not know where he is now. They
assert that he has no formal organization. Like a rebel leader on
the run, he sometimes appears at conferences his followers sponsor
in Asia, North America or Europe, but with little advance notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no organization,'' said Yi Rong, an associate of Li
based in New York. ``No one talks to him regularly except maybe his
family. We had a research society in China once but this has been
abolished.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that elusiveness, or maybe because of it, Li has become
a guru of a movement that even by Chinese government estimates has
more members than the Communist Party. Beijing puts the tally of
followers in his mystical movement at 70 million. Its practitioners
say they do not dispute those numbers. But they say they have no
way of knowing for sure, in part because they have no central
membership lists.
</P>
<P>
   Amorphousness makes practical sense. The Communist Party
suppresses unauthorized organizations of any kind, whether they
explicitly oppose communist rule or not.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration on Sunday in Beijing involved more than 10,000
followers. But Ms. Yi insisted that Li did not know about the
demonstration beforehand. ``I'm quite sure that not only did he not
organize this, but he did not even know about it. We all learned
about it just yesterday,'' she said, but she acknowledged that her
certainty was tempered by her inability to contact Li or to
pinpoint his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Li has fashioned a mind and body spiritual exercise program
intended to allow adherents to live a moral life, remain free of
disease and achieve enlightenment. He is a master of what the
Chinese call qigong, an ancient practice than spans a spectrum from
martial arts to soothsaying.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, people who follow Li said, he built up a
network of students around China, lecturing thousands at a time.
Last year, under pressure from the government, he left China for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Exile appeared to do nothing to limit his popularity in China,
even as he spread his gospel to Americans and Europeans. Li, who
followers say is always on the road, was the guest of honor at a
recent qigong conference in Sweden, where most of the practitioners
were locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is like qigong masters everywhere but claims to be one
level above them,'' said Chen Maiping, who is Chinese and attended
a seminar with Li in Sweden but does not follow Li's teaching. ``He
treats it like religion. He has a complete philosophy of life and
death.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the movement resembles a religion. It has a central
treatise, called the Zhuan Falun. Like some ancient Chinese
philosophy, the text is a little obtuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why cultivation can be called cultivation is that
there is a way for cultivation, a road for you to walk on,'' begins
a chapter entitled ``Not Cultivating the Dao'' (Dao means the way
and is sometimes spelled Tao). ``There was such a saying in the
past: The man does not cultivate the Dao, yet he is already in the
Dao. Such a man abides by the small way and pays attention to
Nothingness or Emptiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these quasireligious overtones, followers of Li insist
that his movement is not religious. It has no churches, no ordained
priests, no hierarchy of any kind, says Ms. Yi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no conditions for membership, and people can come or
go at any time,'' she said. ``We have no structure or hierarchy.
That's why we strongly state that we are not a religion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is expected to announce Tuesday
the call-up of 30,000 reservists from all services of the military
in the single largest escalation yet of NATO's attack on
Yugoslavia, now in its fifth week.
</P>
<P>
   It would likely be several days before the first of the
reservists receive formal orders to report for duty, but Clinton
was poised to announce his backing for a request from the NATO
commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, for the reservists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing will be signed, sealed and delivered,'' on
Tuesday, said a senior Pentagon official, speaking on background.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the need for aircraft crews and support staff, the
Pentagon has not specified what sorts of reservists might be called
up, but there is also a broad array of Army capability that relies
heavily on reservists -- experienced military personnel no longer
serving full-time but retained for contingency purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In a harrowing reminder of the perils the continuing campaign
poses, a U.S. Army Apache attack helicopter crashed and burned in
Albania Monday night during a training flight in preparation for
combat missions inside neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and co-pilot escaped serious injury, were rescued and
flown in an army medical helicopter to a temporary military
hospital at the makeshift NATO airfield near the Albanian capital
of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial reports indicate that they're in good condition,''
said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. He did not release the names
of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The $60-million Apache, built to fly low and fast in the pursuit
of tanks, was the second U.S. aircraft to be lost since NATO
launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred two miles north of the base built over the
past week for the Apaches at the Rinas Air Field outside Tirana,
said Whitman. He said he had no details on the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 24 Apaches has been assembling in Tirana in recent
days as Task Force Hawk. They have yet to fly combat missions
inside the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, but were expected
to be ordered soon to strike at Serb troops deployed there.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Monday that an additional 30 large
refueling tankers would be flown to NATO bases this weekend. They
are the first of a total of 300 warplanes and support craft Clark
requested earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tankers will help NATO step up attacks on
bridges, oil and ammunition storage facilities, Serb troops and
tanks in the field and other military targets, all part of a
campaign designed to coerce Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Yugoslavia, into agreeing to NATO's terms for peace
with Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to press that goal forward through diplomacy, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is in Moscow for a Tuesday
meeting with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's special envoy to Yugoslavia and former prime minister
Victor Chernomyrdin held extensive talks with Milosevic last week
in Belgrade, amid signs that the Serb leader might be prepared to
make some concessions to end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In a faint but welcomed ray of hopeful news, Milosevic allowed
International Committee of the Red Cross chief Cornelio Sommaruga
to meet for 15 minutes with three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia since March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into each other's eyes and shook hands very
warmly,'' Sommaruga told reporters. A Red Cross doctor and
representative were scheduled to meet for a longer period with the
three Americans on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the Red Cross meeting was welcomed, but
still did not meet the standards set forth in the Geneva Convention
for the treatment of troops captured amid hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty five days late, they have had a chance to review the
Geneva Convention and have found a way to, in however bare and
minimum form, start the process of doing what the Geneva Convention
demands,'' said White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of possible cracks in Milosevic's regime, Yugoslav
Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic called on the government to ``stop
lying to the people in Serbia,'' and admit that it can no longer
sustain further NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people should be told that NATO is not facing a breakdown,
that Russia will not help Yugoslavia militarily and that the world
public opinion is against us,'' Draskovic, a former opposition
leader co-opted by Milosevic, said on local Studio B television.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference later Monday, Draskovic said his country
should accept the presence of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
if it is approved by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of such a force is a key NATO demand for halting
the bombing. So far, Milosevic has refused to permit such a force,
saying it would amount to a military occupation and a violation of
Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal right is to wish no participation of NATO
countries in U.N. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,'' Draskovic said.
``But if the Security Council of the U.N. says the U.N. mission
must composed on the basis of part of NATO countries, we must
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials were skeptical and unsure whether the
remarks were meant to signal that Milosevic was seeking a
face-saving way out of the conflict or whether they meant nothing
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk Draskovic is no friend of NATO,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea. ``But at least, the statements that he made . . . show
that there are senior members of the Yugoslav government that are
beginning to recognize the reality of the situation that Yugoslavia
is in.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said it was Talbott's
mission to try to ferret out any possible diplomatic openings --
provided the solution meets NATO's key demands. Those are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  an end to Serb repression in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the admission of an international peacekeeping force with NATO
at its ``core'';
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the guarantee of safe return for more than one million ethnic
Albanians estimated to have been run from their homes by Serb
forces;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  a political settlement that guarantees autonomy for Kosovo's
majority ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and Russia have agreed on many of the objectives . . . they
basically entail getting the refugees who were expelled back and
creating a situation where the Serb forces, the military police and
paramilitary forces are out,'' said Rubin. ``With respect to what
an international force would look like, we have not yet agreed with
Russia. We believe that it must be a credible international force
with NATO at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent that, said Rubin, ``we do not believe the Kosovar
Albanians will return.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   The Apache that crashed Monday followed the loss of an American
F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter-bomber -- the Pentagon has yet to
state the cause -- on March 27 outside of Belgrade. The pilot was
rescued and wasn't seriously harmed.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly 10,500 sorties, the NATO air campaign has had an
overall loss rate ``well below what we've sustained in training
missions,'' Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald told reporters at the
Pentagon on Monday, several hours before the crash of the Apache.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at around 10:30 p.m. local time, Whitman
said, as the helicopter -- the army's most advanced -- was
returning from what he described as ``a routine training mission.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 22 other Apaches based in Albania as part of Task
Force Hawk. Another Apache -- the 24th -- developed mechanical
problems en route to Albania from its base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches are built to fly fast and low -- training exercises
are often carried out at treetop level and below -- to enable them
to destroy tanks, artillery and military forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The additional refueling tankers the Pentagon announced Monday
will bring to roughly 650 the number of U.S. aircraft involved in
Operation Allied Force, the air campaign that began more than a
month ago to combat Serb repression targeting the majority ethnic
Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces struck up and down the length and breadth of
Yugoslavia on Monday, dropping the last of five major bridge across
the Danube River at the country's second largest city, Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bridge is now destroyed, and there is no longer any
traffic across the Danube there,'' said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NATO forces attacked the Sombor airfield in
northeast Yugoslavia, two early-warning radar systems near Belgrade
and roughly a dozen Serb tanks, armored personnel carriers and
military trucks deployed across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Wald showed military imagery of a full range of U.S. warplanes
lambasting targets across Yugoslavia over the past several days,
including an F-117 destroying a television and radio transmission
tower in southern Serbia and an F-15 dropping the last railroad and
highway bridge in Novi Sad into the Danube with an optically-guided
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Milosevic's) forces are starting to take a pretty good hit in
the field, particularly,'' Wald said. ``But you add that up to the
fact that he can't sustain the force, he has no ammunition, his
command and control is going down -- all, in the meantime, while we
add forces -- it's
</P>
<P>
   starting to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite nearly five weeks of NATO bombing, however, Serb troops
and police continued to be active across much of Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military spokesman, Col. Konrad Freytag of Germany, told
reporters here that Serb troops shelled civilians and homes in
southwest Kosovo on Sunday, and continued to loot villages and
terrorize ethnic Albanians elsewhere across the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is expected to announce Tuesday
the call-up of 30,000 reservists from all services of the military
in the single largest escalation yet of NATO's attack on
Yugoslavia, now in its fifth week.
</P>
<P>
   It would likely be several days before the first of the
reservists receive formal orders to report for duty, but Clinton
was poised to announce his backing for a request from the NATO
commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, for the reservists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing will be signed, sealed and delivered,'' on
Tuesday, said a senior Pentagon official, speaking on background.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the need for aircraft crews and support staff, the
Pentagon has not specified what sorts of reservists might be called
up, but there is also a broad array of Army capability that relies
heavily on reservists -- experienced military personnel no longer
serving full-time but retained for contingency purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In a harrowing reminder of the perils the continuing campaign
poses, a U.S. Army Apache attack helicopter crashed and burned in
Albania Monday night during a training flight in preparation for
combat missions inside neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and co-pilot escaped serious injury, were rescued and
flown in an army medical helicopter to a temporary military
hospital at the makeshift NATO airfield near the Albanian capital
of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial reports indicate that they're in good condition,''
said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. He did not release the names
of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The $60-million Apache, built to fly low and fast in the pursuit
of tanks, was the second U.S. aircraft to be lost since NATO
launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred two miles north of the base built over the
past week for the Apaches at the Rinas Air Field outside Tirana,
said Whitman. He said he had no details on the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 24 Apaches has been assembling in Tirana in recent
days as Task Force Hawk. They have yet to fly combat missions
inside the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, but were expected
to be ordered soon to strike at Serb troops deployed there.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Monday that an additional 30 large
refueling tankers would be flown to NATO bases this weekend. They
are the first of a total of 300 warplanes and support craft Clark
requested earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tankers will help NATO step up attacks on
bridges, oil and ammunition storage facilities, Serb troops and
tanks in the field and other military targets, all part of a
campaign designed to coerce Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Yugoslavia, into agreeing to NATO's terms for peace
with Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to press that goal forward through diplomacy, U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is in Moscow for a Tuesday
meeting with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's special envoy to Yugoslavia and former prime minister
Victor Chernomyrdin held extensive talks with Milosevic last week
in Belgrade, amid signs that the Serb leader might be prepared to
make some concessions to end the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In a faint but welcomed ray of hopeful news, Milosevic allowed
International Committee of the Red Cross chief Cornelio Sommaruga
to meet for 15 minutes with three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia since March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into each other's eyes and shook hands very
warmly,'' Sommaruga told reporters. A Red Cross doctor and
representative were scheduled to meet for a longer period with the
three Americans on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the Red Cross meeting was welcomed, but
still did not meet the standards set forth in the Geneva Convention
for the treatment of troops captured amid hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty five days late, they have had a chance to review the
Geneva Convention and have found a way to, in however bare and
minimum form, start the process of doing what the Geneva Convention
demands,'' said White House spokesman Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of possible cracks in Milosevic's regime, Yugoslav
Deputy Premier Vuk Draskovic called on the government to ``stop
lying to the people in Serbia,'' and admit that it can no longer
sustain further NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people should be told that NATO is not facing a breakdown,
that Russia will not help Yugoslavia militarily and that the world
public opinion is against us,'' Draskovic, a former opposition
leader co-opted by Milosevic, said on local Studio B television.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference later Monday, Draskovic said his country
should accept the presence of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
if it is approved by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of such a force is a key NATO demand for halting
the bombing. So far, Milosevic has refused to permit such a force,
saying it would amount to a military occupation and a violation of
Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal right is to wish no participation of NATO
countries in U.N. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,'' Draskovic said.
``But if the Security Council of the U.N. says the U.N. mission

respect that.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shoes and bags, not clothes, are the status symbols
of the moment. Think Fendi. Think Gucci. Think Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Think J.P. Tod's, another line of leather goods from Italy that
has entered the fashion consciousness much more recently than those
venerable brands. Although the Della Valle shoe company was founded
75 years ago by a cobbler named Filippo Della Valle, it took his
grandson Diego to build it into an international presence.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 15 years ago that Diego Della Valle came to New
York with shoe samples in a trunk and set up a temporary showroom
in a hotel room. He spoke not a word of English, but the shoes
spoke for themselves, and soon stores like Bergdorf Goodman and
Bloomingdale's were selling them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he opened a store and showroom in SoHo for his own
shoes and those he manufactured for designers like Gianfranco Ferre
and Azzedine Alaia. A small table in the store displayed a driving
shoe _ a soft leather moccasin with rubber pebbles on the sole that
continued up the heel. He christened it with the American-sounding
name J.P. Tod's.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, the Tod's were so successful, spawning imitations, that
they overshadowed the classic Della Valle shoes. The original line
was phased out and the driving shoe inspired offshoots. The SoHo
store was closed and replaced with one just for J.P. Tod's at 41
East 57th St. Two years later there was a Tod's on Rodeo Drive to
cater to a growing contingent of Hollywood stars like Sharon Stone,
Denzel Washington and Michael Douglas who had become customers
after having been given pairs.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, a J.P. Tod's bag that resembled an elegant
leather shopping tote appeared, and soon it was draped over the
arms of Catherine Deneuve, Princess Caroline of Monaco, Kristin
Scott Thomas and Diana, Princess of Wales (further examples of
``Send it and they will wear it''). The bag, too, soon inspired
copies, and other styles were added.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years or so, Bergdorf's, Neiman Marcus and Saks
Fifth Avenue have found their customers requesting Tod's products.
``It's a new kind of status,'' said Nicole Fischelis, the fashion
director of Saks. ``It's about quiet luxury and comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kaner, vice president and fashion director of Neiman's,
said Tod's was a key source. ``I think it's typical of what's
happening in fashion at Neiman Marcus,'' she said. ``Our customer
insists on luxury, and Tod's are luxury. The products have an
off-handed elegance and timelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the celebrity quotient, not to be ignored
today. Both the shoes and evening versions of the bags make regular
trips to the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes _ the shoes on
men like Matt Damon and Tom Hanks, the bags on Madonna, Candice
Bergen and Charlize Theron. The shoes themselves have appeared on
screen in ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``Great Expectations'' and will
be seen in the forthcoming ``Entrapment,'' with Sean Connery, and
in the remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Della Valle has never been shy about promoting his products.
The company's public relations staff includes people whose job it
is to court celebrities and stylists, offering to make them shoes
or bags for special occasions and to work with movie studios for
product placement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the driving shoe is the cornerstone of the company,
Della Valle doesn't claim to have invented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty, 35 years ago, there were shoes people used for
driving,'' he said. ``They were similar to Tod's. We studied all
the technicalities to make the shoes very good for walking. For
driving it's like a joke, but people know them for walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Valle recently bought another handbag factory because, he
said, he can't keep up with demand. The popular tote, which starts
at $1,200, has waiting lists of customers: both the tanning process
and the manufacture are time consuming. Those waiting lists, of
course, add to the mystique and increase desirability. Shoulder
bags in other shapes have been added for fall in a range of colors
and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Small leather goods and belts are recent additions, with a line
of luggage in the works. (The company also makes less expensive
casual shoes called Hogan, which have their own stores in 20
cities, but not yet in New York.) Annual wholesale volume last year
for all Della Valle's products was about $500 million, the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   Della Valle recently turned over the day-to-day operation of the
business to Andrea, his younger brother, leaving him free to think
big for the future. The easing of some responsibilities has given
him more time to enjoy the homes he owns in the Italian countryside
and on Capri, not to mention his yacht, helicopter and airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Tod's isn't the only company he is involved with. A few years
ago Della Valle entered into partnership with a friend, Luca di
Montezemolo, the president of Ferrari. Together, they have bought
Web eyewear and, more noteworthy, Acqua di Parma, which they
transformed from an obscure line of luxury bath products to an
international success story. ``It's No. 1 in our men's store,'' Ms.
Mello reported.
</P>
<P>
   Every other major leather goods company has entered the
ready-to-wear field in recent years, but Della Valle said he had no
such plans. But he does own Fay Outerwear, a line of coats and
jackets that is sold only in Europe. So far, anyway. As Ms. Mello
said, he's never standing still.

G.E. OF BRITAIN IN $4.5 BILLION ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The General Electric Co. PLC of Britain, accelerating the
European rush into the data networking business, said Monday that
it had agreed to acquire Fore Systems Inc. for $4.5 billion in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Fore, which is based in Warrendale, Pa., is a leading developer
of an advanced technology that many big communications carriers and
multinational corporations are beginning to use to carry voice,
data and sometimes video traffic on a single network.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric PLC, which is not affiliated with General
Electric Co. in Fairfield, Conn., is one of Britain's largest
diversified manufacturers. Now, though, it is shedding its other
businesses to focus increasingly on what is often called the
communications revolution _ the explosive proliferation of
electronic communications propelled by deregulation and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In its biggest realignment, General Electric announced in
January that it had agreed to sell its military systems unit to
British Aerospace PLC for $9.5 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for General Electric, as for old-line makers of
communications equipment around the world, is that the big phone
companies that generate the bulk of its communications sales are
trying to upgrade their systems to carry Internet and corporate
data traffic as easily as they carry traditional phone calls. The
old-line communications manufacturers have had to scramble,
generally though acquisitions, to keep up with their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest such deal was the January agreement by Lucent
Technologies Inc., the former equipment arm of AT&AMP;T Corp., to
acquire Ascend Communications Inc., a big data networking company,
for $20 billion. Last year, Northern Telecom of Canada, North
America's No. 2 maker of traditional communications gear after
Lucent, agreed to acquire Bay Networks for $9.1 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   More recently it has been the European telephone equipment
giants that have been making big moves into data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in fact, General Electric PLC spent $2.1 billion to
acquire Reltec Corp., which makes equipment that helps consumers
link to fiber optic communications networks. That came as Siemens
of Germany was agreeing to acquire a handful of private data
networking companies and as Alcatel of France agreed to acquire
Xylan Corp., a maker of data switches, for $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those companies had as high a profile in the data
networking business as Fore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition reinforces our position as a leading supplier
of voice and data networking technology,'' Lord George Simpson,
chief executive of General Electric, said in a statement. ``We will
now be in a position to capture the full benefits of the impact of
the explosive growth of Internet and other data traffic on the
demand for communications equipment and systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Fore was one of the first companies to exploit an advanced
communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode, or
ATM, which is similar to the language of the Internet in that it
breaks communications into small pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, General Electric will pay $35 in
cash for each Fore share. That is a 43 percent premium over Fore's
closing price on Friday, $24.50. In parts of 1996, Fore shares
consistently traded above $40 but for much of the last two years
have traded below $20 as the company has contended with increased
competition from companies like Ascend and Newbridge Networks of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem for General Electric is that much of
Fore's business comes from selling to institutional clients like
the U.S. government, and that business is growing relatively
slowly. General Electric, though, is focused on selling to
communications carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Monday that the relative undesirability of
Fore's institutional sales unit could be seen in the stock
movements Monday of a third company, Tellabs Inc., which makes
telephone equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors were concerned that Tellabs might agree to
acquire Fore, and shortly after trading in Fore shares was halted
at 9:47 a.m. pending undisclosed news, Tellabs shares dropped as
low as $111.875, far below its Friday close of $115.375. But around
10:24 the first word of the General Electric deal appeared on news
services, and by 11 o'clock Tellabs shares had hit $120.25, an
increase of about 7.5 percent in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Tellabs shares closed at $117.5625, up $2.1875. Fore shares rose
$9.25, to $33.75. American depository receipts of General Electric
closed at $10.125 each, up 75 cents.

HUNDLEY FEELS GREAT, BUT HIS NUMBERS ARE HURTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hundley aches and it has nothing to do with
his surgically reconstructed right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers catcher's pain comes from his
performance, not his health, which was the biggest question coming
into the season.
</P>
<P>
   The question now centers on Hundley's ability. He's hitting just
.160 and as bad as that is, he's even worse when it comes to
throwing out runners (9.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got bad mojo working right now,'' Hundley said. ``Every
year I start kind of slow. But to be honest with you, physically, I
haven't felt this good in years. That's the frustrating part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley remains businesslike on the field, but the personality
that's made him one of the most popular players has been muted by
his slump. He's not as active in the clubhouse and he's quieter
around the batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little brief chat (Sunday),'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``He wanted to let me know he was feeling really good
physically, and not to worry about the problems he's having behind
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too early for the team to panic, but when one of the team's
primary power sources isn't producing and the defense is slipping,
eyebrows become raised.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it all dates back to Hundley not being available
most of the spring. He said Hundley was in ``terrible'' shape when
spring training began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably 50 percent or 60 percent at the start of the
season _ baseball, timing and skill-wise,'' Johnson said. ``I just
couldn't give him any innings (in the spring). He had to get it in
at the start of the season. That's not the way you want to do it,
but we had no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the team could have kept him in extended spring
training or sent him on a minor-league rehab assignment. Neither
the Dodgers nor Hundley wanted to do either, so Hundley began the
year in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers pitchers said Hundley is calling games well and he's
blocking pitches in the dirt. But his throwing is an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   He's thrown out two of 22 base stealers, and both of those were
San Diego Padres who overslid second base. Often, his throws sail
into center field _ he's already made four errors in 13 games. In
his prime with the New York Mets, he averaged less than seven
errors a season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hundley isn't being aggressive enough throwing the
ball, waiting back for the ball instead of moving forward to meet
the pitch and make the throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's pressing,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``I feel for him because I know how much he cares. He's
working his butt off. Catching and calling a game, I think he's as
good as anybody. We also have to hold runners better. I see arm
strength, but it's more mechanical when he throws.''
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, he hasn't been much better. The switch-hitter who
set the major-league record for homers by a catcher with 41 in
1996, has two homers and four RBI. When he was acquired from the
Mets in December, there was talk about Hundley hitting in the
cleanup spot and how his left-handed bat would break up the row of
righties that's been part of the Dodgers' lineup seemingly forever.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's fallen to eighth in the batting order. He hasn't
started against a left-hander since opening day and is 0 for 7 from
the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, there have been signs Hundley is close to breaking out
of his batting funk. He's working pitchers deep into the count,
fouling pitches straight back (a sign his timing is better) and
he's hitting the ball hard more often. All of which gives Hundley
hope that the end of the slump is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of baseball can be very humbling and right now I'm
being humbled,'' Hundley said. ``When you're going through bad
stretches like I am, you have to keep your head up. It's
frustrating, but with what's going on in Colorado and what's going
on in Kosovo, there's a lot worse things in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Put in those terms, it seems trivial to wonder why Hundley can't
hit a horsehide-covered ball or throw someone out at second.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's what he is supposed to do. And he knows he's not
performing well right now.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Top of order not sorry to leave April behind
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hidden beneath a heap of runs the Braves offense has
been scoring is a bad vibe at the top of the order. Leadoff hitter
Otis Nixon has had another rough April and No. 2 man Bret Boone has
been the unlucky hitter in the Braves order.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is hitting .170 and Boone is hitting .235 and together
that adds up to a .206 batting average and an on-base percentage of
.290, which is not the kind of setting up that will keep this
offense chugging.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon is figuring he just needs to get out of April, a month in
which he's hitting .232 in his career. That and as hitting coach
Don Baylor is suggesting, don't be in such a hurry to get out of
the batter's box as he finishes his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants me to keep the ball out of the air,'' Nixon said.
``As long as I can keep hitting hard groundballs, I'll be OK...I've
played long enough to know what's going to happen, to trust
yourself, stay within yourself and you'll be all right. You play
good defense and manufacture some runs and it's as good as getting
a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon has still found ways to be productive, like on Sunday when
he reached twice an error, stole two bases and scored a run and in
Tuesday's game in L.A. when he drew a pair of bases loaded walks.
</P>
<P>
   Boone has been the bad luck hitter of the order, starting the
first couple days of the season. It's resurfaced lately, like in
the 5-4 April 20 loss in L.A., when with Gerald Williams at third
base, Boone would have tied the game had his line drive been just
about anywhere but right at third baseman Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   So Boone's not making any big adjustments at the plate, he's
just trying to stay patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know with this approach (at the plate) and if I continue to
work, it's just a matter of time,'' Boone said. ``It's hard, but
I'm not going to walk around moping. It happens to everybody. It
just so happened to me it happened at the start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury Update
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones missed his first start of the year on Monday with
a strained adductor muscle in his left thigh, which he injured
running from first to third on an error in Sunday's game. Keith
Lockhart replaced him at third base Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I improve as much between today and tomorrow as I did
yesterday to today, I can play, but I can't do anything today,''
Jones said before Monday's game. ``Yesterday I was about 40-50
percent. Today I'm probably 70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko said he's nearly ready after being out for almost
two weeks with a high hamstring pull. Manager Bobby Cox wasn't
ready to put him in the lineup on Monday. Klesko's last time in as
a pinch hitter, he pulled up hurt after running out an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be 100 percent probably for another few weeks,''
Klesko said. ``Maybe giving it extra time will be good for
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing touches
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Rocker took his work on Sunday _ recording four
outs against four batters in a non-save situation against the
Marlins _ and used it to continue regaining his confidence after
the blown save in Colorado. Rocker said he figured out in Denver
that he can't count on blowing his fastball by hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I learned no matter how hard you throw, you can't
throw stuff down the middle,'' Rocker said. ``Guys are looking for
one pitch (the 97-plus MPH fastball)....I'll have to be a little
smarter with it. I won't just try to blow a fastball right down the
middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The most consistent reliever the Braves have had so far this
season is Rudy Seanez, who's pitched scoreless ball in six of his
first seven outings with good hard stuff and even better control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pinpoint, but it's better than it's ever been,''
Seanez said. ``I've never been able to paint the black or divide
the plate up into thirds...I'm not trying to throw hard, not trying
to make the perfect pitch all the time.''

ROMAN L. HRUSKA DIES AT 94; LEADING SENATE CONSERVATIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Fla.)   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roman L. Hruska, who served 22 years as a conservative
Republican senator from Nebraska, died on Sunday at Clarkson
Hospital in Omaha. He was 94 and had wielded considerable influence
on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hruska was the ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee when he retired in 1976. In 1974, he was one of the
leaders in the Senate who engineered restoration of the death
penalty for certain federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fierce opponent of what he regarded as excessive
violence and pornography in films and on television and sponsored
many bills to curb them. He also took the lead in opposition to gun
control. Together with Sen. Sam Ervin, D-N.C., he pressed to
establish a national board, representing elements of the entire
criminal justice system, to regulate the handling of all
computerized criminal history information .
</P>
<P>
   He fought to maintain criminal penalties for marijuana. His
record on labor and social policy earned him a zero rating from the
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his defense of President Richard Nixon's nominee to
the Supreme Court, Judge G. Harrold Carswell of Tallahassee, Fla.,
that brought him some uncomfortable celebrity in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats had mounted a strong campaign against
Carswell, a member of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Florida, contending that he was too ``mediocre'' to deserve a seat
on the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   When Hruska addressed the Senate in March 1970, speaking on
Carswell's behalf, he asked why mediocrity should be a
disqualification for high office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he were mediocre,'' Hruska declared, ``there are a lot
of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a
little representation, aren't they, and a little chance? We can't
have all Brandeises, Frankfurters and Cardozos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats gleefully jumped on Hruska's argument, reducing it
to ``What's wrong with a little mediocrity?''
</P>
<P>
   Hruska defended his remarks, arguing that the negative reaction
had been inspired by hostility to Carswell as a Southerner, not as
a mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The Carswell nomination was defeated, and the Supreme Court seat
went to Harry S. Blackmun.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Lee Hruska was born in David City, Neb., the son of an
immigrant from Bohemia. He graduated from the University of Omaha,
the University of Chicago Law School and received his L.L.B in 1929
from the Creighton University College of Law in Omaha. He built a
successful law practice in Omaha, but turned to politics and was
elected to the House of Representatives in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   His strong record in support of the Eisenhower administration
gained attention and when Sen. Hugh Butler died in July 1954, he
was chosen by the Republicans as their candidate to replace him.
Hruska easily defeated his Democratic opponent in a special
election and went on to serve the remaining four years of Butler's
term. He was re-elected in 1958, 1964 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Hruska's wife, the former Victoria E. Kuncl, predeceased him. He
is survived by two sons, Roman Hruska Jr. and Quentin Hruska, both
of Omaha; a daughter, Jana Fagan of Royal Oak, Md; a brother,
Richard Hruska of Fresno, Calif.; two sisters, Irma Kolar of
Springfield, Ill., and Carolyn Chapek of Omaha, and five
grandchildren.

TO KILL A SCRUB JAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, April 28)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have always been a big fan of mockingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1, they are one of the few birds I can identify without the
help of a bird book. Trim. Gray. Conspicuous white wing patches
visible in flight. (Actually, I got that last part out of a bird
book, but let us not quibble.)
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, mockingbirds often build nests in one or more of the low
trees in my yard, which gets me out of the chores of pruning and
mowing, at least for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3, and most important, mockingbirds have more voices than a
U.N. debate. I have heard the sounds of a piano, siren, squeaky
gate and barking dog emerge from the same mockingbird at different
times.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a mockingbird reminded me of the conversations I
often have with my car mechanic. It was going, ``Doohicky!
Doohicky! Doohicky!''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that all these voices inside their heads make
mockingbirds a little crazy. Despite its slender build, a
mockingbird is fearless and will wade in with a blue jay, crow or
even a cat. If you are careless or unwise enough to disturb its
nest, a mockingbird will attack you, too. I have seen smokers throw
down their cigarettes to escape a dive-bombing mockingbird, which
should tell you all you need to know about their ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   I come in praise of mockingbirds because there was a move afoot
(aflight?) to dethrone the mockingbird as the official state bird
of Florida, an office it has occupied competently if not
necessarily quietly since 1927. The proposed change does not have
the support needed to pass in either the House or the Senate this
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   The upstart challenger was the Florida scrub jay, a threatened
species and poster bird for environmentalists. (There are only
about 2,100 scrub jays in Florida today, or approximately one scrub
jay for every mockingbird voice impersonation.)
</P>
<P>
   Many Floridians, myself included, have never seen a scrub jay,
most of which live in the central part of the state and on land
surrounding the Kennedy Space Center. Mockingbirds, on the other
hand, can be found in every back yard from Key West to Pensacola.
When the grandchildren come to visit, you can just stab your
liver-spotted finger in the direction of the ficus tree and croak,
``Lookee there, kiddies! It's the mockingbird! The state bird of
Florida!'' (This will be of no interest to your grandchildren, of
course. But I still think abundance and widespread distribution
work in favor of the incumbent.) Score one point for the
mockingbird.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of the scrub jay show it to be smaller and less boldly
colored than its cousin, the blue jay, but still more flashy than
the mockingbird, which has all the eye appeal of a trench coat.
Score half a point for the scrub jay.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the scrub jay say it is a friendly bird that will
light on your shoulder and even eat a seed out of your hand. I do
not take this as a particularly good quality in a wild bird; it
could help explain why the species is threatened. I know people who
have made friends with a mockingbird, but most of the time the only
reason a mockingbird will land on your shoulder is to get a clearer
shot at your eyes. Point: mockingbird.
</P>
<P>
   Insects, berries and seeds comprise the diet of both birds. But,
since mockingbirds outnumber scrub jays a zillion to one,
mockingbirds eat a zillion times more insects. Point: mockingbird.
</P>
<P>
   The mockingbird is the state bird in four states besides Florida
(Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas). Enthusiasts of the
scrub jay, which is found only in Florida, see this as a bad thing.
To me, it just shows that a lot of other states recognize a great
state bird when they see one. Point: mockingbird.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the song part. (See ya, scrub jay.) I have listened to a
recording of a scrub jay's song and it sounds, to me, like the
tines of a rake scratching on a sidewalk. A mockingbird could copy
the sound, and probably do it better, while taking a drink of water
or coughing up an acorn. Game, set, match: mockingbird.
</P>
<P>
   I wish the scrub jay nothing but the best of luck. It will need
that and more if it is to survive. But it's people, not
mockingbirds, that are the cause of the scrub jay's plight. Let the
mockingbird remain the official state bird of Florida. It is, after
all, the only bird that can imitate the sound of a bulldozer.

DEAL SETS STAGE FOR MOVING SECOND JASPER TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Texas) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ In a surprise development Monday, the
prosecutor and defense attorneys involved in the second capital
murder trial in the brutal dragging death of a black man agreed on
moving the trial, possibly to the Central Texas town of Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Although a judge ruled last Thursday that the trial of Russell
Brewer Jr., 32, of Sulphur Springs, would not be moved, Jasper
County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Monday he is agreeing
to move the trial out of an abundance of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reversible issue they have in this thing is the
change of venue,'' Gray said. He said he favored the move as long
as it didn't significantly delay the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's trial was set last week for May 17, but Gray said it
would be put off until July or August if moved to Georgetown,
because that is when a courtroom would be available there.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the trial to Georgetown, 25 miles north of Austin, would
offer a significantly larger jury pool. It is the county seat of
Williamson County, one of the nation's fastest-growing counties
with a population of more than 190,000, compared to Jasper County's
population of 33,000. Both counties are predominantly white, 80
percent in Jasper County, and 87 percent in Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jasper offers a larger percentage of black residents _
nearly 20 percent _ compared to Williamson County's black
population of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Monte Lawlis has scheduled a hearing on the
proposed change for Wednesday in Jasper. Gray said the matter won't
be settled until the judge rules on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential sites being considered, Gray said, are New
Braunfels and Kerrville, small towns also near the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's attorneys, Douglas Barlow and Layne Walker of Beaumont,
had argued that many residents of Jasper County believe that the
best way to show the world that Jasper is not racist would be to
secure convictions of the three white men accused of killing James
Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony and evidence in the first trial showed that Byrd, 49,
who was intoxicated and walking home from a party, accepted a ride
from three white men in a pickup in the early morning hours of June
7. He was beaten, his face spray-painted black, and his ankles
chained to the back of a pickup. He was dragged for almost three
miles on back roads outside Jasper until he was decapitated.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a jury in Jasper handed a death sentence to Bill
King, 24, of Jasper, the first defendant to go on trial. A third
man, Shawn Berry, also 24, of Jasper, still awaits a trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said his decision to accept a change of venue for Brewer
should not affect King's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's lawyers would prefer the trial in Beaumont, where the
defendant could be brought in and out of court through a secure
corridor from the former Jefferson County Jail. He would not have
to be paraded in handcuffs and a bulletproof vest as King was
during his trial in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care where it is tried, just so it is out of
Jasper County,'' Barlow said. He said that while jurors in Jasper
County may believe they are being fair, they may feel pressured to
secure a conviction to redeem their community.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he wouldn't agree to move the trial to Beaumont
because the local television stations serving Jasper are
headquartered there, as is The Beaumont Enterprise newspaper, which
is also widely circulated in Jasper County.
</P>
<P>
   After Byrd's death, Jasper was visited by the Ku Klux Klan and
armed black militia groups, and some civic leaders worried that
outside troublemakers would pour in to their town of 8,000 during
the murder trials.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the appearance of one black group's leader during
about two hours of King's trial, none of the groups appeared while
the trial was under way.
</P>
<P>
   The East Texas town, however, did experience an influx of news
reporters from around the world.

DISNEY'S BREACH-OF-CONTRACT TRIAL BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Walt Disney Co. created a secret ``Project
Snowball'' in 1991 to deprive Jeffrey Katzenberg, its former film
studio chief, of a huge bonus if he left the company when his
contract ended, a lawyer for Katzenberg said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In opening statements in the $250 million breach-of-contract
lawsuit brought by Katzenberg against Disney, the lawyer, Bertram
Fields, offered a series of letters and memorandums to bolster his
contention that Disney had sought through subterfuge to deny
Katzenberg his bonus.
</P>
<P>
   A top Disney lawyer, Lou Meisinger, vigorously denied the
accusations. ``If we were in a movie theater, I think this would be
the point where a responsible film maker would put up a disclosure:
the story you have just heard is fiction.'' He said there was
``nothing sinister'' about the project.
</P>
<P>
   During Katzenberg's decade as chairman of Walt Disney Studios,
which ended bitterly in 1994 when Michael D. Eisner, the company's
chairman and chief executive, passed him over for the No. 2 job at
the company, operating income rose to $186.3 million in 1988 from
$2.3 million in 1984. He oversaw the development of about 700
projects, including television shows and films like the lucrative
animated hits ``The Lion King,'' ``Aladdin'' and ``Beauty and the
Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields argued that Katzenberg was entitled to 2 percent of the
estimated income generated by the projects he developed at Disney,
including music and merchandising spinoffs. The money _ estimates
run as high as $250 million or more _ was to be paid in a lump sum
two years after he left the company.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner initially contended that Katzenberg had essentially
forfeited his bonus if he left in 1994 or if Disney dismissed him.
But Disney and Katzenberg reached a partial settlement in November
1997 in which Disney conceded that Katzenberg was owed something.
</P>
<P>
   Since then both sides have failed to reach an agreement. Fields
said that Eisner's ``personal animus'' toward Katzenberg had
thwarted any agreement. Meisinger, the Disney lawyer, dismissed the
assertion before Judge John W. Ouderkirk of Los Angeles Superior
Court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arguments in the case could run for several weeks. Within
Hollywood there has been surprise that the case, which has the
potential to embarrass Disney and perhaps Katzenberg, has not been
settled. It is highly unusual for two moguls like Eisner and
Katzenberg to publicly air a dispute over money and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   At issue, Meisinger said, was Katzenberg's contention that the
bonus owed to him was not limited to the years he ran Disney
studios but after that, too. Accordingly, the financial differences
could be huge. Katzenberg, for example, could seek a portion of the
receipts of the Broadway hit ``The Lion King,'' which opened after
he left Disney and was based on the film that he helped shape.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Fields said that the ``secret project''
involving top corporate executives, including Eisner, was designed
to ``discuss and investigate the possibility of claiming that
Katzenberg is forfeiting his contract if he leaves in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Fields, a top Hollywood litigator, said, ``We've got a
real credibility problem with this fellow,'' referring to Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Fields said that Eisner, Sanford M. Litvack,
Disney's senior vice president, and Irwin E. Russell, a board
member and Eisner's personal lawyer, told ``palpably untrue''
stories about what Katzenberg was entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Meisinger said heatedly, ``The notion that there was some
form of deceit visited on Katzenberg is totally and utterly
fatuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Meisinger added, ``Contrary to the statement by counsel,
`Project Snowball' wasn't how we could figure out how to gyp
Katzenberg out of his payments.'' Rather, he said, the term was
coined by an accountant who was assigned to calculate Katzenberg's
bonus. Meisinger said the term was meant to show how the project
was getting bigger and bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The session was held in the law offices of Greenberg, Glusker,
Fields, Claman &AMP; Machtinger in Century City, Calif. Fields, who
represents numerous movie stars, is a partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner was not at the session. But Katzenberg sat and listened
intently all day, flanked by his wife, Marilyn Katzenberg, and
Helene Hahn, the top lawyer at Dreamworks, who worked for him at
Disney. After leaving Disney, Katzenberg helped establish
Dreamworks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: HIGHS AND LOWS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at some of the highlights, lowlights and
sidelights of the 1999 management conference and annual meeting of
the American Association of Advertising Agencies, held last week in
Amelia Island, Fla.:
</P>
<P>
   BE A PEPPER: One of the best parts of the conference was an
enthusiastic speech by John E. Pepper Jr., chairman of Procter &AMP;
Gamble Co., the world's largest advertiser. P&AMP;G has recently
modified its ultrastrict rules on account conflicts, raising the
hopes of agencies that have worked for companies that compete
against P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   Just how relaxed is P&AMP;G these days? Twice, Pepper praised Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather Worldwide, the unit of WPP Group PLC that has long handled
accounts for P&AMP;G's principal rival, Unilever. At one point, in
recounting how he learned about advertising when he joined P&AMP;G in
1963, Pepper said he had read the writings of David Ogilvy, the
founder of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished he'd worked for us,'' Pepper declared.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in asserting that ``superior product
performance'' is as important as ``great advertising campaigns,''
Pepper cited Unilever's Dove soap, long promoted by Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't we think of that?'' Pepper asked.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper also drew laughs when he mused that after he retires from
P&AMP;G on Sept. 1, he would ``start my own advertising agency'' with
an especially timely name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've learned something over the last year about
increasing market capitalization,'' Pepper said, his imaginary
agency would bear the name ``Pepper.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ADTALK: In keeping with the spirit of the conference, the
parlance of Madison Avenue found its way into other forms of
communication. For instance, during a flight down to the conference
from New York with many top agency executives as passengers, a
flight attendant announced that a pager had been found ``in the
forward part of the cabin'' _ i.e., in first class, where the
executives were congregated.
</P>
<P>
   And a restroom at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, the site of the
conference, boasted a ``Colgate-Palmolive Liquid Soap System.''
</P>
<P>
   FLIGHT OF FANCY: At one general session, attendees watched
excerpts from a taped conversation with Herbert D. Kelleher, the
outspoken chairman, president and chief executive of Southwest
Airlines, who discussed the value of advertising. Kelleher modified
an old joke, much to the delight of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to make a small fortune?'' Kelleher asked. ``Start with a
large fortune _ and then hire an advertising agency.''
</P>
<P>
   OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS: A discussion on Friday, devoted to
``running a profitable independent agency,'' had three panelists,
but one turned out to be a ringer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put the panel together,'' said the moderator, John F.
Mennis, senior vice president for management services at the
association, ``all of them were independent.'' But in a change
indicative of the industry's merger mania, one had since been taken
over: Citron Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco is now Citron
Haligman Bedecarre/Euro RSCG, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit
of Havas Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Mennis turned his lemon into lemonade, promising that Tom
Bedecarre, the agency's chairman, would discuss what he and his
colleagues did ``to make themselves attractive to Euro RSCG.''
</P>
<P>
   CULTURE CLASH: The Ritz-Carlton was busy with other functions
besides the conference. One, prominently promoted on signs around
the hotel, was the subject of many japes: an Anti-Fungal Regional
Advisory Meeting sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceutica on behalf of
its Sporanox brand of capsules. (No doubt the podiatrists had their
own jokes about advertising hucksters.)
</P>
<P>
   Another function was a ``bachelorette'' party whose attendees
mingled with attendees of the conference late one night. One young
woman invited Donny Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at
Deutsch Inc. in New York, to join her party as the, um,
entertainment. Though Deutsch has a newly toned physique, thanks to
workouts with a personal trainer, he declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   KEY DETAIL: The annual Washington report of the association was
presented at breakfast by Hal Shoup, executive vice president and
director of the Washington office. He began the breakfast by asking
if anyone present had lost a hotel room key, which he held aloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Washington report,'' one attendee said to
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   OH OH! Larry Miller, the comedian, who performed at the annual
dinner on Friday, prepared for his gig by reading biographies of
the top executives of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up a sheet of paper about O. Burtch Drake, president and
chief executive, Miller asked: ``What's the deal with the `O'? How
bad could the `O' be?'' Debbie Drake, Drake's wife, called out from
the audience that it stood for ``Owen''; Drake said later that it
was the first time the meaning of the ``O'' had been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   After the ``O'' was outed, as it were, Miller called Drake ``a k
a Owen.''

ONCE-TROUBLED FLORES HAS RIDING TITLE, DERBY HOPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years after drug and alcohol problems almost
cost him his career, David Flores is on top of the racing world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's his world. And when you've scraped the bottom
of the barrel, climbing to the top means so much more.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1996, Flores' substance-abuse problems almost
caused the Tijuana native to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those times when I thought I was out of the
game,'' Flores, 31, said. ``There were a lot of people around me
who helped. I believe there is a lot of love in this sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my reputation was going to be bad for a long time. I
thought I would never get it totally back. After working at my own
life, things started changing as the months went on. I was like a
baby starting to walk again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he seeks his first Kentucky Derby victory, aboard
the Bob Baffert-trained Prime Timber, one of the top contenders.
Baffert is one who Flores credits for helping his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baffert has been one of the guys who helped put me on a lot of
winners,'' Flores said. ``I'm glad trainers like him don't mind my
life in the past. All he asked was that I work hard and listen,
listen, listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores listened all right _ so well that he won the riding
championship he had coveted for so long. He led the recently
concluded Santa Anita winter meeting with 71 winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) is one of the greatest meetings in the world,'' Flores
said. ``My dad always said, `This is the greatest. Every jockey in
the world wants to be here.' Man, it's hard to explain how much it
means to me. Being the top here, it's a dream. That's all I can
say, it's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Flores long enough and you'll hear about his dad.
Through his past problems, whenever he needed someone to help get
him through a tough day, all he had to do was look to his
91-year-old father, David Don Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him happy every time I visit the winner's circle,''
Flores said. ``He's my dad and he's my biggest friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores recalls the story his father has told him about his
birth. He was so small his crib was a shoebox. It was then that
Flores' dad knew his son would be a jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew I was going to be a jockey. All his dreams came
true,'' Flores said. ``He's had so many kids (approximately 30),
and I was one of his last. I know this means a lot to him and he's
my motivation every time I ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores' father split with David's mother when he was young. As
he sat in his usual seat at Santa Anita recently with a TV monitor
overhead, the elder Flores explained how he reared his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was 7, I used to ride him in two-horse match races and
he would beat the older boys,'' he said. ``I knew in my heart he
would be a rider. That's exactly what I said when I held him in my
arms the first time. I told him I'm going to give you my name.
You're going to be David Flores and you're going to be a jockey and
a champion when you grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Flores almost became a Derby champion. He rode Free
House to a third-place finish in the 1997 Kentucky Derby _ a memory
he holds dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I remember first?'' Flores asked. ``I remember
that Kentucky song. It gives you chills. I enjoyed that race in
every way. I got beat by Silver Charm, but I remember the trip like
it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   And he would love to give his father and family in Mexico a
Kentucky Derby victory _ just the thought causes Flores to swell
with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's every jock's dream,'' Flores said. ``A lot of jocks
have been there and they keep hoping they're going to win it
someday, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief pause, he finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding? A little kid from Tijuana winning that
race,'' he said. ``Wow. It's really hard to imagine.''

VINTAGE FABRICS MAKE THEIR WAY EAST  
 CUSTOM-MADE SANDALS  
 ROCK 'N' ROLL STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Style From Vintage Fabrics
</P>
<P>
   Her name is so wholesome and fake-sounding that you'd think
Libbie Lane was a columnist for the love-stricken, not a Beverly
Hills, Calif., designer to the chic and restless. Rare is the week
that an actress doesn't wander into her Burton Way boutique, pore
over the organza blouses and rare vintage prints and die a little.
Madonna and Helena Bonham Carter are fans. So is Roseanne.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not dwell on celebrity. Ms. Lane's clothes suggest a
garden party where the guests go crazy and turn the chintz
draperies into cool car coats. Many of her fabrics are vintage. She
does everything herself, from designing and scouting flea markets
to running her four-year-old business. ``I'm not one of these
designers who says they're doing it for art,'' Ms. Lane said with a
laugh. ``I like the money.'' She has help, of course _ namely, her
husband, Andy, a writer and producer of the 1983 film ``Valley
Girl,'' and a team of workers, including a few of James Galanos'
former beaders.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast editors have picked up on Ms. Lane's style. (Elle's
fashion director, Marin Hopper, wore her red pony coat during the
March shows.) This spring, Saks Fifth Avenue is selling Ms. Lane's
clothes. ``They're different, collectible, seasonless,'' said
Nicole Fischelis, the fashion director of Saks. ``It's about
individual pieces that are not part of a trend.'' Prices range from
$300 to $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   That Ms. Lane uses scarce vintage fabrics doesn't seem a problem
for stores like Saks or Harvey Nichols, in London, which has placed
an order for fall. ``They just ask me how many pieces I can make,''
she said. Next up: shoes and maybe handbags.
</P>
<P>
   One-of-a-Kind Sandals
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It goes with the atmosphere of the East Village that
when people go to Jutta Neumann's shop on Ninth Street, near First
Avenue, for custom-made sandals, they step barefoot on white paper
while she traces around their toes. It tickles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neumann has been making sandals for 11 years, the last five
in her tiny shop. She stocks sizes, but it's the fit and novelty of
her custom sandals that have drawn the attention of designers like
Anna Sui and Marc Jacobs. Last summer, Isaac Mizrahi wore a pair of
her thong sandals on ``The Tonight Show,'' and though Mizrahi
mentioned only that they were from the East Village, it was enough
of a clue to cause Ms. Neumann's phone to ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandals have to fit,'' Ms. Neumann said, explaining the virtue
of custom, ``because they don't have the support of shoes.'' Her
styles are basic, from Mizrahi's slip-on thong to thick slides with
a wide band across the top. She and her staff of eight work in all
kinds of leather and exotic skins, including snake and sting ray.
Custom sandals range from $140 to $300 and take about three weeks
for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   It's Only Rock 'n' Fashion
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art announced last week that it plans to recognize the influence of
rock 'n' roll _ and none too soon. ``Icons of Rock Style,'' as the
exhibition is tentatively called, is to open on Dec. 9, three days
after the institute's annual dinner-dance. The exhibition will pay
homage to about 20 rock artists from the 1950s to the present, with
clothes mainly from the Metropolitan and the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of
Fame and Museum in Cleveland. Tommy Hilfiger, who's never made a
secret of his fascination with rock and hip-hop _ or the attention
they bring his label _ is the chairman of the gala. Anna Wintour,
the editor in chief of Vogue, and Aerin Lauder, the director of
creative productive development at Estee Lauder, are the
co-chairwomen.
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of designers have been way ahead of Hilfiger
and the institute in acknowledging the influence of rock 'n' roll
on fashion, the exhibition may do for the Met what motorcycles did
for the Guggenheim Museum last year _ bring in the people.

ELWAY'S GREAT BUT MONTANA WAS BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BOB PADECKY   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Absence may make the heart grow fonder, but when it comes to
remembering who was the best quarterback in NFL history, it also
dulled the shine, yellowed the scrapbook and dropped what once was
clear out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game was on the line,'' said Atlanta Falcons coach
Dan Reeves, ``John Elway was like Michael Jordan. He wanted the
football. In those situations, I don't know if I know anyone who
did a better job of handling that than John did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Reeves does. His name is Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Montana retired five years ago. Elway is going
out now amid plenty of gush. Football coaches are like the rest of
us _ we can remember what we had for lunch today but don't ask us
to describe that trout almondine we ate last month.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves could remember back to five years ago _ when Elway was
leading the Denver Broncos to all those comeback victories. It was
Montana who still had the premier reputation. It was Montana who
set the standard. It was Montana who was the answer to this
question: ``With the game on the line and 80 yards to go for a
touchdown, what quarterback you would pick?'' There was no debate.
Sure, Elway had great skills but when it came to choosing someone
to make a team supremely confident, it was Montana. We all bowed in
that direction, even the great Elway did.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear the argument about Elway's ``tools.'' He could
throw harder than Montana. He could run farther. He was more
durable.
</P>
<P>
   So? Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham is probably a
better athlete than either of them, and look where his ``tools''
got him.
</P>
<P>
   You will hear the argument that Montana had better teams behind
him than Elway. Then how do you explain Joe winning the 49ers'
first Super Bowl with Ricky Patton as the running back and Earl
Cooper as the tight end? When it comes to an offensive supporting
cast, no Super Bowl winner ever had a weaker one than Montana had
that year.
</P>
<P>
   You also will hear the argument that if Elway had been the
quarterback of the 49ers instead of Montana, Elway would have
enjoyed more success than Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and if Mickey Mantle didn't drink and have two bum knees,
he might have hit more home runs than Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Or if Paul Warfield, Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick hadn't left the
undefeated Dolphins in 1975, Miami would have won more Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Or if Jordan hadn't left the NBA for baseball, the Bulls would
have won more championships.
</P>
<P>
   Or if hockey could score more goals and the puck could be seen,
the game would be more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   If. If. If. You could drown in a sea of ``if's.'' It's wonderful
to speculate. Makes a beer go down faster down at the neighborhood
bar. Whittles away a slow afternoon. And that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of wasting time wondering what might have happened,
remember what did happen. Montana won four Super Bowls; Elway
participated in two Super Bowl victories. Montana was the key
ingredient in all four Super Bowls; Elway used running back Terrell
Davis masterfully to take control of both Bronco victories.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw also won four Super Bowls, but Bradshaw will be
the first to tell you that Lynn Swann and John Stallworth and
Franco Harris made him a great quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take everything into consideration,'' said New York
Giants coach Jim Fassel, ``the Super Bowls, the arm strength and
the length of his career, you can build a case that John's the best
that ever played the position.''
</P>
<P>
   But that Elway played a long time and played in five Super Bowls
and that he could throw the ball through Dennis Rodman's thick
head, well, so what? I have a lot of chest hair, too, and that
doesn't make me the best quarterback who ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   This is what matters: When it came to seeing the entire field,
when it came to instinctively making the right play, when it came
to playing through pressure, when it came to finding a way to win,
no one did it better than Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it has been five years since Montana last did that.
In sports that might as well be 1930.

NOW THE NFL IS LOSING A LEGEND
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS graf that begins, The last factor ..., to CORRECT,
Elway's wife is named Janet, sted Linda.) 
 (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League is about to go where it has not
been in almost two decades _ to life without John Elway. First
Jordan retires, then Gretzky, and now football's No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, the Denver Bronco quarterback who is one of the most
athletic and productive players in league history, is expected to
make his retirement official on Sunday. Elway made up his mind to
retire several weeks ago after consulting with close friends and
then his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you officially that we're going to do it on
Sunday,'' the team owner, Pat Bowlen, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elway delayed the announcement because of the shootings at
Columbine High School in the Denver suburb of Littleton last week
and because he had second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I'm retired,'' he was quoted as saying in Monday's
Denver Post. ``One of the reasons I held off saying anything was to
make sure it's what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who has worn a brace on his knee for the last several
years, added: ``I seriously considered coming back, but I just
couldn't make it because of my knee. I've never liked it when an
athlete says he's retired and then comes back. Once I've decided, I
am certain.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors apparently went into Elway's decision to
retire after 16 seasons. First, Elway, 38, felt his body was
beginning to break down. It is likely, for instance, that he will
need a replacement for his left knee, which was reconstructed
earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even though he was the most valuable player in Super Bowl
XXXIII in January, he missed all or part of six games last season
with hamstring, back and rib injuries. He took 10 painkilling
injections around his rib area in November in the wake of a brutal
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Elway felt there was little else to prove. After losing
three Super Bowls with Denver under the former coach Dan Reeves,
Elway won two straight with Mike Shanahan as coach.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Elway was concerned about his legacy, that
he would be seen as a quarterback with great individual statistics
but no championship trophies. But Giants Coach Jim Fassel, one of
Elway's closest friends, said, ``John doesn't have to worry about
any of that stuff now. There is no one who would challenge the fact
he is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The last factor for Elway was more personal. Elway wanted to
spend more time with his family, especially his wife, Janet, who at
the start of last season became critically ill after colon surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL loses more than a quarterback when Elway leaves the
game. Like Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky in their sports, Elway
was an ambassador for football who became heavily involved in
charity work in the Denver area and across the country. He never
embarrassed the league with any off-the-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, friends of the quarterback said that Elway
often contemplated how many titles he would have won if Shanahan
had been his coach throughout his professional career. Elway had a
rocky relationship with Reeves, but was close to Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Elway leaves the game as the quarterback with the most
victories, 148. Elway had 47 game-winning or game-tying
fourth-quarter drives.
</P>
<P>
   Elway finishes with 51,475 passing yards, and he and Miami's Dan
Marino (58,913) are the only two quarterbacks to amass more than
50,000. Elway, Marino and Fran Tarkenton are the only quarterbacks
to throw more than 300 touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his arm strength and mobility, he was a rare combination
of talents,'' New York Jets Coach Bill Parcells said Monday at the
media day for the Cadillac-NFL Golf Classic at the Upper Montclair
Country Club in Clifton, N.J. ``I don't know if I've seen a
quarterback who had the ability to run and the ability to throw in
one package like John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly a player that will be missed in the NFL. He
was a great asset to our league.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine the Broncos truly replacing Elway, but
they will try with Elway's backup last year, Bubby Brister. The
good news for Denver is that Brister was 4-0 in the games Elway
missed last season. The bad news is that Brister turns 37 in August
and has not started more than eight consecutive games since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is considered one of the best offensive strategists in
the NFL, but few believe even he can make Brister into an elite
quarterback who is even one-fifth of what Elway was.  &QL;

DOCTOR'S PERSISTENCE LANDS HER A JOB: IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (kd) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Freed briefly from the rigors of the emergency room
at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, Dr. Jennifer Walser was
anticipating fishing around Lake Tahoe a couple of weekends ago,
passing part of her flight there with a detached read through a
magazine cover story about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the words from an essay about NATO's intervention leapt
off the page. ``It was a Biblical injunction: `Thou shalt not stand
idly by,''' said Dr. Walser, 30, a fourth-year resident in
emergency medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suddenly occurred to me that there was something I could
do,'' she said. ``I'm a doctor. I'm young. I don't have a husband.
I don't have children. I don't have a fish tank. I don't even have
plants in my apartment at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to try to do something was the easy part. Finding an
organization that would send her took a little more persistence.
</P>
<P>
   When she got back from the fishing weekend, she started calling
relief agencies. Doctors without Borders said it only wanted people
with previous refugee experience and a minimum commitment of six
months. Doctors of the World did not return numerous calls. The
International Medical Corps said it might add her to a team at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever an international crisis involving refugees unfolds on
the scale of Kosovo , every major relief agency fields hundreds of
calls from would-be volunteers hoping to work in the camps. Most
callers, relief agency officials say, harbor the illusion that they
can pop over for a weekend and hand out bread.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agencies prefer that concerned people stick to
sending donations and leave to them the challenge of finding the
technically savvy professionals who meet specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors of the World said it had a backlog of 400 doctors
offering to go to Kosovo, many more than were needed, while the
International Medical Corps said that it had a database of about
5,000 doctors willing to do refugee work, and that is usually picks
volunteers off that list.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Baltimore, Dr. Walser had never done volunteer work
before, and her longest exposure to poor people in another country
was a few months she spent in Peru during her childhood, when her
father, a kidney specialist, worked at a hospital there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her decision to go to Kosovo did not entirely surprise
her parents _ her mother is a nurse _ or her siblings. They said
she had always had a certain drive and intensity that would push
her to seek out an experience like working in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Her older sister, Karin, 32, said that Dr. Walser, after
graduating medical school at Johns Hopkins, had seemed restless
working in internal medicine at a Boston hospital. So a few years
ago she switched to the Bronx emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   In her emergency room triage work at Jacobi Medical Center, Dr.
Walser said, she has treated everything from a 50-year-old man
beaten to death with a baseball bat to strokes and countless
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   She was not quite sure what to expect in the refugee camps. But
she will have to learn quickly. Monday, she started a 24-hour
journey to Macedonia. .
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On April 19, less than a week after she made her first call
looking for an opportunity to volunteer, Dr. Walser heard from the
recruitment officer from the International Medical Corps, who
called back and asked how soon she could join one of six new mobile
clinics traversing Macedonia to serve clusters of 200 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, she told them.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every hour that followed was a frenetic seminar on how to
become a volunteer. She was constantly yanking out the pile of
papers out of her pocket that constituted her ``to do'' list. One
packet contained an extremely condensed course in Balkan politics.
``Macedonia was part of Yugoslavia,'' it said, ``and Kosovo is 90
percent Albanian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' groaned Gjek Gjonlekaj, an activist in the Bronx
Albanian community, just back from the Kosovo region, as he met
with Dr. Walser for lunch at an Albanian-owned Italian restaurant
in the borough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to hell,'' Gjonlekaj said. ``Nothing bad is
going to happen to you. But you will see hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all of Dr. Walser's frantic errands last week, she found
time for a haircut. The concern was not entirely aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really need to get my hair cut, so I don't get lice, or at
least so I get less lice,'' she said, sitting in her chair in an
East Side salon.'
</P>
<P>
   While the stylist snipped her hair, Dr. Walser was busy trying
to remember key sentences from her new Albanian phrase book, like
how to ask a patient where it hurts. ``Ku shoo thiem?'' she
ventured after struggling with each word for about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it won't take me this long once I get there, or the
refugee will probably be dead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration at her hospital agreed to treat the trip as
an elective course in her residency and will keep paying her
salary. Other residents will cover her shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just covering one of her shifts for now, but I know she is
about to milk me for one more,'' a fellow resident, said Dr. Shideh
I. Parsa, grinning as he jabbed Dr. Walser with a hepatitis B
booster shot. ``I wish I could go with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walser ricocheted between unnerving discoveries of how
little she knew about what to expect _ a nurse told her to bring
her own lamp because hospital tents often don't have them _ to a
fairly sober view of what she could accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us can fathom what it's like to have a
future as uncertain as the refugees,'' she said. ``I probably won't
have a huge impact over there. Maybe three refugee kids will
remember playing with me.''

FRANK PASQUERILLA, 72, BUILDER AND PHILANTHROPIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Pasquerilla, 72, a builder and philanthropist who started
as a state highway clerk and became one of the richest men in
Pennsylvania, died last Wednesday in a Johnstown, Pa., hospital. He
made a fortune in shopping malls, department stores and hotels and
gave away millions to support schools, churches and the performing
arts, from western Pennsylvania to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman and chief executive of Crown American Realty
Trust, a publicly traded owner of 27 shopping malls, as well as
chairman and chief executive of Crown American Hotels, a
family-owned chain that is operated under franchises from Holiday
Inn, Comfort Inn and the Wyndham hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Crown American said Pasquerilla died following
a stroke at the Memorial Medical Center in Johnstown, where he had
been admitted on April 15 after a mild heart attack following a
root canal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   A number of public buildings were named for members of the
Pasquerilla family, including three at the University of Notre Dame
in South Bend, Ind.; one at the Georgetown University Medical
Center; a library at St. Francis College in Loretto, Pa., and the
performing arts center of the University of Pittsburgh in
Johnstown.
</P>
<P>
   Pasquerilla, who was born in Johnstown and never moved away,
gave $6.8 million to the Johnstown arts center, and $1 million to
help create a heritage discovery center in the city. He also gave
$2 million to the Pittsburgh Opera. In addition, the family helped
build a religious center at Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
   He was honored as a commander of the Order of St. Gregory and a
steward of St. Peter by Pope John Paul II, who also appointed him
to the Vatican committee on debt reduction. He was also honored by
the Altoona Johnstown Roman Catholic Diocese and headed the
diocesan fund drive in 1995. He received government medals from
Israel and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine estimated Pasquerilla's assets at $350 million
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Crown Construction Co. in the early 1950s and was
named president in 1953, the year he built his first shopping
center. He bought the company in 1961 and built one of the first
enclosed shopping malls two years later in Altoona, Pa. The Crown
malls, which typically include several department stores, are in or
near medium-sized cities in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown Construction name was changed to Crown American in
1972, and the company bought the Hess department store chain in
1979. Crown American-Hess made an unsuccessful $1 billion bid for
the Bloomingdale's stores in 1989. Crown American became a publicly
traded company in 1993. It sold or closed a number of its
department stores and in 1995 sold its last 30 Hess stores _ 10 to
May and 20 to Bon Ton of York, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The Crown American board on Monday elected Pasquerilla's son,
Mark Pasquerilla, as chairman and chief executive of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors also include Sylvia, his wife of 42 years; a
daughter, Leah; a brother, Nicholas, and two sisters, Pauline
Speranza and Stella Diest, all of Johnstown.

CODE-SHARING: CLUING IN FLIERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want a view of the world turned upside down and inside
out, study the airline practice known as code-sharing. The general
theory of relativity is not too much more complex.
</P>
<P>
   The short of it is that you can buy a ticket from Chicago to
Warsaw on American Airlines and you will fly the whole nonstop trip
on LOT, the Polish airline, because American does not have
Chicago-Warsaw service and LOT is its partner in a code-sharing
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Your ticket will show your flight as American Airlines 6102, but
the itinerary attached to the ticket or provided by the travel
agent should indicate that the flight is being operated by LOT,
which lists it as Flight 2. The code being shared is the airline's
own code name, in this case ``AA'' for American and ``LO'' for LOT.
</P>
<P>
   Listings in airline guides and on computer screens, depending
where the travel agent looks, can either show the code of the real
airline and its flight number, or the code of the sharing airline,
plus an asterisk or other mark, plus its number.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines sell tickets on each other's flights, either by
buying a block or by simply dipping into the other line's
inventory. And each can sell the ticket at whatever price it
elects. It means that an airline can advertise destinations it does
not fly to, and at the least, get the passenger's business for any
flights that feed into the other line's flight.
</P>
<P>
   On the trip to Warsaw, getting to the right place at O'Hare
Airport in Chicago, Terminal 5, probably depends on how well your
travel agent prepared you. If you began your trip in Des Moines on
American, you would fly to Chicago on another code-shared flight,
this one operated by American Eagle, an American subsidiary. It
would bring you into O'Hare Terminal 4, where American has domestic
gates, and the monitor would show the departure from Terminal 5,
and you would take the airport train.
</P>
<P>
   All major United States airlines now share codes with other
lines. It is hard to get an airline to denounce the practice these
days although less than 10 years ago, some of them considered it
deceptive _ paying for Airline A's suave service while receiving
Airline Z's frightful service.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as is the case now, you can be expecting a domestic
airline's nonsmoking trip and find yourself in a cabin filled with
smoke, as would be the case if you wound up an Alitalia code-shared
flight to Rome from Kennedy in New York when you booked
Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Code-sharing is of particular concern right now because the
Department of Transportation, after years of poking at the issue,
has enacted regulations to improve the likelihood that consumers
learn which line will carry them. These regulations affect not just
code-sharing, but also a practice obscurely known as ``change of
gauge,'' which is what happens when you take a one-stop flight and
discover that at the stop you also have to change planes, even
though your travel agent said you could sleep through.
</P>
<P>
   These flights are often described as ``direct'' flights, which
sounds like nonstop, but they are far from it. Now, passengers must
be told if they are to be shifted to another plane, even if it is
the same model.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations take effect July 13, although the airlines
themselves have long been directed to disclose code-sharing
arrangements to customers. The new regulations require travel
agents as well as foreign airlines to get this information to the
traveler before the sale is complete, and require the notice of
``change of gauge.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating a shared code requires negotiation between the
airlines, but not necessarily a lot more. New names are not painted
on airplanes, departure terminals are not necessarily changed,
menus are not adapted. In the word of David Messing, spokesman for
Continental Airlines, shared flights that were formerly flights
where passengers could make a connection on their own are simply
``relabeled.''
</P>
<P>
   A substantial change may appear if the passenger misses the
code-shared connection. Meals and accommodations at a midpoint are
nominally the responsibility of the airline that arrived late,
whereas on a connection selected by the passenger or an agent, the
problem is the passenger's own.
</P>
<P>
   However, I am among the legions who have taken flights that
connected to the same airline, only to be told my night's
accommodation, meals and the rest are my problem. So there is no
guarantee of being coddled on a code-shared flight either.
</P>
<P>
   There are some other benefits: frequent-flier miles can usually
be earned or spent on the flights of the partner airline, although
the award may be less than 100 percent of the miles on the original
airline. If passengers have memberships in a lounge club of one
partner, they can have access to the lounges of the other.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A single ticket, albeit with more than one coupon, is provided,
and boarding passes with seat assignments for each segment can be
printed out at the first boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Code-sharing partners may not consult and fix ticket prices
between them. The partner airlines thus may not necessarily sell
their tickets on the same flight for the same price. For example,
the Chicago-Warsaw flight, on a 21-day advance purchase valid to
the end of last month, was offered at $409 by LOT, $469 by
American. This is the kind of thing probably only a travel agent
has the patience to sort out.
</P>
<P>
   And as in the Chicago example, sometimes the partners do not
have conveniently arranged departure gates, although they all work
toward it. In a recently created code-sharing, Delta joined hands
with China Southern, a major airline that has been flying into Los
Angeles from Guangzhou since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 28, China Southern has been taking Delta pasengers
to Guangzhou on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday from Delta's Terminal
5 at Los Angeles. The flight also returns to this terminal, where
Customs agents are available. Part of the reason for this
convenience is that Delta provided ground service for China
Southern before they shared codes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is a major code-sharer. Of its 5,316 daily flights,
according to Todd Clay, a spokesman, 1,638, or about 30 percent,
are code-shared. In addition to China Southern, it has 13 partners.
This number is in constant change: the airline has now asked the
United States government for permission to put the Delta code on
Finnair flights to Moscow and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Delta does something that not all airlines do: It shares codes
with other airlines even when it serves the same city. It has a
flight from Atlanta to Zurich at 7 p.m., and it also offers
Swissair's flight at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent reigning champion in getting partners is American
and its subsidiary American Eagle; together they have 22. United
now has 18.
</P>
<P>
   USAirways, which was a lion in the field when it shared codes
with British Airways, now has only one partner, Deutsche BA, an
internal German line.
</P>
<P>
   The government believes that code-sharing will continue to
increase. At least once a week, an airline applies for approval of
another code-shared flight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the government made an investigation by anonymously
calling airlines and agencies and reported that on a third of the
calls, the caller got no information that the flight would be flown
by another line. That started the work on the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   The major changes from the earlier rules require that travel
agents and foreign airlines, as well as domestic airlines, tell
clients in advance that the flight is a code-shared flight and the
name of the other airline. Written notice with the ticket is also
required, although the rule does not require that the ticket itself
give this information. Part of the reason for that is the advent of
the electronic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   No penalties are specified in the new regulation; the department
already has the authority to issue restraining orders and to fine
offenders up to $1,100.
</P>
<P>
   How this rule is enforced will depend upon complaints. The
Department of Transportation receives complaints _ not very many at
the moment _ at this address: Aviation Consumer Protection
Division, Room 4107, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh
Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony in Congress by Nancy E. McFadden, the
department's general counsel, the department may get only one
complaint for the many that the airlines get, which they are not
compelled to pass along, except for mishandled-luggage complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McFadden said that one airline got 400 complaints of various
sorts for every one the department received about the line.
Complaints about lack of information, violation of rules, failure
to deliver what was promised or discrimination are all received by
the department.

AT&AMP;T IS SAID TO JOIN NTT IN A JAPANESE PHONE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appearing to hedge its bets for a planned expansion into Japan,
AT&AMP;T Corp. intends to announce a partnership on Tuesday with Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's dominant telephone company, to
manage the communications networks of big multinational companies,
executives close to the deal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications PLC, which have
formed an international joint venture, announced an agreement to
acquire 30 percent stake of Japan Telecom, one of NTT's domestic
rivals, for more than $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the arrangement between AT&AMP;T and NTT, which
does not include British Telecom, focused on the global data
communications network that AT&AMP;T last year agreed to acquire from
IBM for $5 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The main assets of the IBM network are its access points in
dozens of countries worldwide. That helps AT&AMP;T, the network's new
owner, appeal to corporate globe-trotters.
</P>
<P>
   But to connect its various ``points of presence,'' the former
IBM network uses long-distance communications capacity leased from
international carriers, including NTT.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement to be announced Tuesday, NTT will continue
to provide the underlying backbone for the data network in Japan,
the executives said. More importantly, NTT will help AT&AMP;T market
comprehensive packages of communications services to big companies
in Japan and possibly elsewhere in the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and NTT declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   It was not entirely clear Monday how AT&AMP;T intended to reconcile
the NTT and Japan Telecom deals. Japan Telecom appears to have
agreed to provide raw communications capacity to the AT&AMP;T-British
Telecom venture.
</P>
<P>
   NTT's deal, however, appears focused on meeting the global
communications needs of large corporations, many of which seek to
link their far-flung offices with seamless voice, video and data
networks.

EXOTIC SULAWESI AWAITS THE WORLD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sulawesi, a disheveled starfish of an island that came to rest
on cerulean seas between Borneo and the Moluccas, has long been
home to people at ease with the wider world. But lacking expansive
beaches and great historical monuments, Sulawesi has not had much
chance to demonstrate its uncomplicated worldliness to tourists,
who flock instead to other Indonesian islands: mystical,
introverted Java or the nonstop arts festival that is Bali.
</P>
<P>
   Sulawesi _ once known as the Celebes _ is the homeland of
Indonesia's boldest sailors, the Bugis and Makassarese, who roamed
Southeast Asian seas long before explorers from the West nosed into
the territory. Since the 16th century, the island's people have
also welcomed outsiders and adopted their diverse religions _
Shiite Islam in the south and Christianity on the Minahasa
Peninsula in the north, where Dutch colonialists also enjoyed their
most congenial sojourn in the age of empire.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Indochinese and
Chinese _ adventurers, soldiers, traders, naturalists and
missionaries _ came and marveled at Sulawesi's natural beauty,
dense green hills reaching down to bays and lagoons edged in coral
reefs of astonishing variety and color, abundant with marine life.
Valleys and plateaus were richly fertile.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains and rain forests were birds and animals unknown
anywhere else in the world. Enormous butterflies in psychedelic
colors roamed the glens, attracting the great 19th-century British
naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, who made meticulous studies in
the East Indies, evolving a theory of evolution similar to
Darwin's.
</P>
<P>
   Sulawesi, especially South Sulawesi, commanded the lucrative
spice trade routes, making its major port, Makassar _ now Ujung
Pandang _ an important, much-fought-over place. Pepper, cloves,
nutmeg, vanilla and the many useful derivatives of coconuts still
build fortunes here.
</P>
<P>
   Though anthropologists and adventure-seekers made their way into
the island's interior, Tanatoraja (Toraja land), and divers came to
explore still-pristine reefs, Sulawesi remained largely unknown.
When the island finally got around to thinking of tourism a couple
of years ago, the Asian financial crisis struck, followed by riots
in Jakarta and the fall of the Suharto government.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists fled the country, and only Bali has since recovered.
The future had to be postponed. As a result, travel in Sulawesi is
a bargain and service is very attentive in the new, large hotels in
Ujung Pandang in the south and Manado in the far northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Ujung Pandang, capital of South Sulawesi province _ Sulawesi
Selatan or Sulsel to Indonesians, who love to short-circuit proper
nouns _ is an acquired taste. At first view, the city, strung out
along the Makassar Strait, seems relentlessly ugly. Two dirty,
traffic-clogged commercial streets converge along the scraggly
seafront.
</P>
<P>
   But after dark, an unkempt waterside promenade comes to life, as
dozens of wheeled food stalls arrive and set up shop, end to end,
creating a necklace of lights along the water. Fish sizzles, beer
flows and Ujung Pandang takes on a different air.
</P>
<P>
   South Sulawesi's coastal people, Mandarese, Makassarese and
Bugis (or Buginese) are overwhelmingly Muslim, but their relaxed
attitude toward religion and modernization belies Western
stereotypes. In Ujung Pandang, young women prefer short skirts and
those who wear Muslim headscarves may also cover the rest of
themselves in T-shirts and jeans.
</P>
<P>
   South of the city, at Somba Opu, an old fort and park for
displaying regional architecture, my husband, David, and I, on a
visit in March, met an artist, Bachtiar Hafid, whom local Shiah
leaders recognize as a mystic. Unencumbered by strictures against
figurative art, Bachtiar paints historical or mythical people _
kings and queens, some pre-Islamic _ directed by a shadow or spirit
that guides his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Great kingdoms flourished here. It was near Ujung Pandang that
the Dutch finally defeated the last of them, Gowa, under Sultan
Hasanuddin, in the late 1660s.
</P>
<P>
   The tomb of Hasanuddin, in a small grassy cemetery that also
contains a pre-Islamic royal mausoleum, can be visited on the
southern outskirts of Ujung Pandang, on the way to Sungguminasa. At
Sungguminasa, the reconstructed royal palace of Gowa, a huge
rectangular wooden building on stilts, looms over a small park.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, a small museum displays royal regalia and
memorabilia, along with a detailed ``family tree'' of Gowa rulers
leading back to a marvelous woman, Tomanurunga, who descended from
heaven equipped with a golden crown to begin the royal line. There
is no entry fee, but a contribution is expected. A gift of at least
10,000 rupiah (about $1.15, at 8,650 rupiah to the dollar) to the
enthusiastic caretaker would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Ujung Pandang is Fort Rotterdam, the best
preserved Dutch fort in Asia. It belonged to the kings of Gowa when
the Dutch arrived and enhanced its large interior space with a
collection of Dutch-style buildings, including an austere church
(now a conference center). A climb onto the sturdy ramparts is
rewarded with views of the low-slung city and its magnificent
harbor. Again, at the fort a contribution is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Of some interest inside the walls is the La Galigo museum, named
for an epic poem telling the story of the early Buginese. The
museum is not well lighted, ventilated or labeled other than in
Indonesian, but it contains good models explaining the construction
of the complex, some fascinating pre-Islamic, pre-colonial statuary
and a small collection of old Chinese and Indochinese celadon and
porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark of the more recent past is the town of Malino, about
45 miles east of Ujung Pandang along a pleasant winding road
through farming villages into the cool hills. Here in the 1920s,
the Dutch created a hill station for themselves, planted with
flowering shrubs and fruit trees. In 1946, a conference was held
here to discuss creating a federation of Indonesian islands linked
to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, rejected by the Indonesians, who had proclaimed
independence the previous year, is enjoying a revival _ minus the
Dutch _ as the nation looks for ways to keep its diverse
populations together under one flag.
</P>
<P>
   In Ujung Pandang, everyone considers it essential to visit the
Bantimurung waterfall, about an hour northeast of town. Here, the
naturalist Wallace fell into raptures over the butterflies that
flourished in a gorge formed by limestone cliffs. The area is a
nature reserve but, alas, that doesn't always mean much in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fenced areas set aside for butterfly breeding have been
vandalized, and visitors are besieged by peddlers offering glorious
specimens pressed into cellophane envelopes. It is a horrible
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Ujung Pandang, we visited Paotare quay, where the
seagoing vessels known as pinisi dock. The prahu pinisi, the
signature Bugis sailing vessel, can be a soaring three-masted craft
for hauling timber, like those whose prows arc dramatically over
Jakarta's Sunda Kelapa harbor, or smaller ones, with a single mast
and engine.
</P>
<P>
   Pinisi, modeled originally on Portuguese schooners, are still
built on Sulawesi's southern coast, near Bira, where a small beach
resort is taking shape. Sea voyages inspire timeless folk music and
romantic myths about sailors and the women they leave behind to
send their love on the winds that propel the ships.
</P>
<P>
   But at Paotare, the pinisi are tethered like workhorses to be
loaded with tons of flour, grains or other cargoes for outer
islands. Men, young and old, hoist sacks weighing 50 or 100 pounds
or more and stagger up narrow gangplanks. They are paid less than
$1 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Fly almost anywhere in Indonesia for a hour or two, and there is
another world to discover. From Ujung Pandang, a flight of less
than 90 minutes brings the traveler to Manado, a much slower-paced
town, where church steeples dominate the skyline and the brilliant
aquamarine sea belongs to fishermen in outrigger canoes. Ujung
Pandang is urban. Manado, and the Minahasa region, is all outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Most Westerners come to Manado, capital of North Sulawesi _
Sulawesi Utara, or Sulut _ to dive or snorkel along its exceptional
reefs. This is serious diving territory, with underwater cliffs
that drop 1,000 feet or more. But so abundant is the sea life here,
that even a lazy afternoon on a jetty is enlivened by a parade of
marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Santika Manado, where we stayed, is built at the edge of a
tidal mangrove swamp, through which a long pier has been
constructed to connect the low-rise hotel with the sea. Millions of
crabs and dense schools of small fish arrive with the tide to
forage among the mangroves rooted in mud.
</P>
<P>
   Farther out, a sandy bottom provides pools for countless
starfish and brightly colored zebra angel fish, dramatic batfish,
trigger fish, sea snakes and other species, along with an
astounding variety of coral formations and shells. At low tide, a
reef emerges just offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The Santika is the base for a Dutch-run diving center and
school, Thalassa, which can also arrange glass-bottom boat trips
along the reefs near Bunaken Island, about 25 minutes away and the
heart of much of the diving activity in the Celebes Sea. As an
alternative, the hotel will find a local boatman to make a less
strenuous tour of the outer reefs and islands, not only Bunaken,
but also Manado Tua (a dormant volcanic cone) and Siladen, an
island of narrow but empty white beaches and fishing hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   This coast, its offshore islands and hundred of thousands of
acres inland are all nature reserves, and here there is some
measure of protection, though local environmentalists say that
patrols are inadequate, especially to deter spear-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   In the forest reserves of North Sulawesi, some of the island's
unique animals and birds still survive, but precariously, as nature
reserves open to tourists and local people expand hunting into
areas that are only lightly guarded. The rare maleo bird, which
buries its eggs in the sand, has no defense against villagers who
collect and sell the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of bird species are found only in Sulawesi, where forests
also shelter the remaining endangered anoa, a small buffalo no
bigger than a large dog, and the babirusa ``pig deer,'' with tusks
that curl back above its eyes. There are tailless monkeys, tiny
tarsiers and huge snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the Victorian naturalist, noted the dramatic changes in
flora and fauna between this island and Borneo, Indonesian
Kalimantan, to the west. On the map, he drew a scientific line,
still called the Wallace Line, between these islands, and also
between Bali and Lombok to the south.
</P>
<P>
   North Sulawesi is the homeland of the Minahasa people, who are
culturally Malay, have a language related to those of the
Philippines and a strong Protestant religious faith _ which
contributes to their great love of singing. A Minahasa male chorus
is a robust sound.
</P>
<P>
   Manado town mixes a number of racial and cultural groups, with a
considerable Chinese population, most of them Christians or
Buddhists. During attacks on the Chinese in Java last year, many
families fled to Manado, resident say, pointing to new homes being
built with the money the fearful migrants brought with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the interior hill towns, each with at least a church or two _
lately more of them Pentecostal or Seventh Day Adventist than Dutch
Reformed _ the Minahasa farm upland valleys and plateaus and build
their distinctive wooden houses high on stilts. Coconut and spice
plantations provide a good livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pleasant forays to be made in North Sulawesi is
a trip to Tomohon, a hill town nestled between two still-active
volcanoes. Tomohon is famous for its flower markets and fresh
foods, as well as a good hospital and the Christian University of
Indonesia. It also has the nicest hill station hotel in Indonesia,
the Gardenia, a rambling collection of cottages among flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   From the coast around Manado, an easy day trip into the hills
can include Lake Tondano, North Sulawesi's largest freshwater lake;
World War II Japanese caves nearby, and a 1,000-year old collection
of stone tombs at Sawangan. That tour would still leave time for a
late lunch at the Gardenia, and a trip of less than an hour back to
the coast in time for a fiery Manado sunset. &QL;

<P>
   Americans traveling as tourists in Indonesia do not need visas
for visits of up to 60 days. The best months for Sulawesi are April
to October, the dry season. Temperatures are in the 80s and 90s all
year, cooler in hill towns.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia holds a national assembly election on June 7, preceded
by weeks of intense political activity and followed by a
presidential election in the fall. The State Department advises
caution when traveling to Indonesia during the political
transition.

</P>
<P>
   Places to Stay
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 1998 economic crisis and continuing fluctuation
in value of the Indonesian currency _ the rupiah is now worth only
about a quarter of its 1996 value _ international-standard hotels
are bargains. Prices below, based on 8,650 rupiah to the dollar,
include 21 percent service charge and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Ujung Pandang, where most hotels are on the Makassar Strait,
the Radisson, at 235 Jalan Somba Opu, (62-411) 333-111, fax
(62-411) 333-222, charged $35 a night for a double room normally
priced at $150. The Sedona, at 297 Jalan Somba Opu, (62-411)
870-555, (62-411) 870-222, was asking $145, but discounts are
available.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Makassar Golden, at 50-52 Jalan Pasar Ikan; (62-411)
314-408, fax (62-411) 320-951, is an old establishment undergoing
renovations; $25 to $40 double. The Hotel Pantai Gapura, 10 Jalan
Pasar Ikan; (62-411) 325-791, fax (62-411) 316-303, in addition to
discounted standard rooms (at about $25 to $40 double), has
handsome wooden cottages built on stilts over the sea, with luxury
interiors and small outdoor porches, for $41.
</P>
<P>
   In the hill town of Malino, the Resort Hotel and Villa Celebes,
1 Jalan Hasanuddin; (62-417) 21023, fax (62-417) 21388, has basic
rooms for about $20 double, or a family-size villa for $60.
</P>
<P>
   In Manado, the two-year-old Hotel Santika Manado, Post Office
Box 1644, Manado 95000; (62-431) 858-222, fax (62-431) 858-666, is
about 15 miles northeast of town in a sheltered seaside valley in
the village of Tongkeina. By far the best place to stay, it had
reduced a $100 room to about $49, double, including breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In Manado town, there is a Novotel on Jalan Piere Tendean,
(62-431) 855-555, fax (62-431) 851-245, with doubles for $60 to
$75.
</P>
<P>
   The Singapore-based Sedona chain expects to open a luxury beach
hotel next year southwest of Manado, near the Manado Beach Hotel, a
once-grand resort that is deteriorating. Rates have not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Bunaken Island, the center of the offshore marine reserve, has a
few very cheap but also very, very basic cottage hotels. The Papa
Boa Cottages, (62-431) 850-434, has twin-bedded cottages without
toilets at $4; with private toilets, about $5.20.
</P>
<P>
   Inland from Manado in the hilly Minahasa heartland, the Gardenia
Hotel, Kakaskasen II, Tomohon, (62-431) 351-282, fax (62-431)
351-363, has wood-paneled cottages set in flower and herb gardens
facing the Lokon volcano. A two-room chalet is $65 for twin beds
and a small dining-sitting area.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Around
</P>
<P>
   In Ujung Pandang, a car with part-time guide and excellent
driver cost $160 for three days, arranged through Bagus Indonesia,
at 30-34 Jalan Haji Bau; (62-411) 872-324. There are metered taxis,
and fares to most places in town rarely rise above $1 to $2. Manado
also has taxis, but fewer of them, and the drivers may want to
bargain rather than charge the meter rate, which begins at 21
cents. Manado and Tomohon also have horse-drawn taxis, known as
bendis. A rental car with driver in Manado cost $29 a day.
</P>
<P>
   What to Eat
</P>
<P>
   Intestinal parasites and waterborne bacterial diseases are
endemic in Indonesia. Ask a doctor for advice on what medications
to take, just in case. No unbottled water is safe. Soft drinks are
available and Indonesia makes good beer, a legacy of Dutch
colonialism. Bir Bintang and Anker are the best known; Carlsberg is
also produced.
</P>
<P>
   Fish _ including garoupa, red snapper and tuna _ is probably
safe to eat grilled along the beach. But with hotel dishes not
likely to cost over $4 or $5, saving money by eating in the street
may not make sense. Meals for two, with beer, juice or soft drinks
and dessert, rarely reach $20, including tax and service.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian specialities include a rice porridge called bubur _
bubur ayam if cooked with chicken. Indonesian fried rice, nasi
goreng, is available everywhere, usually for about $1 to $1.50. At
its best, nasi goreng is served as a mound of plain or aromatically
flavored steamed rice crowned with a fried egg and surrounded by a
piece of fried chicken, a stick or two of satay (beef, chicken or
fish) and some spicy sauces and condiments.
</P>
<P>
   In North Sulawesi, a local dish is ayam tuturuga, chicken cooked
in a spiced coconut milk sauce. Desserts often feature bananas,
fried as pisang goreng or pureed into puddings and cakes. Pizza is
very popular, and mixes well with spicy Indonesian garnishes. At
the Santika, a 12-inch pizza with mushrooms, ham, cheese and a
thick tomato sauce cost about $3.30.

PATAKI SEEKS STRONGER PENALTIES FOR VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Citing the Colorado school killings in his effort
to push for new laws in New York, Gov. George E. Pataki presented a
package of proposals Monday that would stiffen penalties for
violence in schools and make it easier to remove disruptive
students from classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require school districts to draw up codes of
conduct, establish a statewide system for collecting information on
violent incidents in schools and step up public education campaigns
intended to reduce student violence.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has often spoken about the importance of improving
school safety, and many of his proposals were not new. The State
Senate, which is led by his Republican allies, has approved
legislation in recent years that includes several of the proposals
but the bills have died in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats have their own school safety plan, which
does not go as far as the Republicans' proposal in toughening
punishment and also focuses on setting up programs that its
sponsors say will help prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Pataki took a conciliatory approach
to the Assembly Democrats and emphasized that he was not trying to
use the high school shootings in Littleton, Colo., for political
advantage. He said that after years of impasse, he hoped that the
two sides could reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time for politics and partisanship,'' he said.
``This is not the time for pointing fingers or passing blame. This
is the time for us to come together as New Yorkers and parents.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He added that he would probably announce further proposals in
the coming months based on the work of a task force that he
created, which is led by Lt. Gov. Mary O. Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats responded that they, too, would like to
arrive at a compromise, but such deferential comments do not
necessarily suggest that a deal is at hand. In previous years, the
bargaining over school safety has become entangled in the
horse-trading over other measures, including the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both the assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate
majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, signaled that they were ready to
form a conference committee to negotiate legislation, a step that
did not occur last year.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislative leaders were able to agree last
year on a law that allows 14- and 15-year-old students who have
loaded firearms in school to be prosecuted as adults in criminal
court and subjected to greater penalties.
</P>
<P>
   This year, while there is some agreement on new legislation,
there are three major areas of disagreement. Pataki and the Senate
Republicans want some crimes that are now misdemeanors, like
possession of unloaded firearms on school property, to become
felonies. The Democrats favor increasing penalties, but not as much
as the Republicans do.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are seeking to give teachers more authority to
remove disruptive students from classrooms, while the Democrats
express concern that such a move would lead to students in the same
schools receiving different penalties for similar offenses. They
want this authority to remain largely with principals.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republicans call for no new financing, the Democrats
want to allocate money for counseling and other programs that they
say will help limit school violence, though they decline to give
exact amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does the families of the victims little good to know that
after the fact, we have taken harsh steps against the
perpetrators,'' said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan
Democrat who is chairman of the Education Committee. ``We need to,
to the extent possible, have resources in the schools to identify
youngsters who are at risk and intervene before the tragedies
occur.''

ON SPORTS BUSINESS: TAGLIABUE FAKES OUT THE PATRIOTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Pa., Calif.)   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From November through last week, the National Football League
did nothing publicly to upset the proposition that the New England
Patriots would move from the team's creaky old home in Foxboro,
Mass., to a $375 million stadium in Hartford, Conn., that would be
fully subsidized by Connecticut taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue met in Boston
with Massachusetts business leaders, now energized by the urgency
of the Patriots' situation. Tagliabue said he wanted to take a look
at how the team might remain in Foxboro, in a new $225 million
stadium paid for by the league and the team, with up to $75 million
being provided by Massachusetts for roads, exit ramps and parking
lots.
</P>
<P>
   What a fancy stutter-step the lanky commissioner executed,
letting Hartford think it had snagged the Patriots with a giveaway
so rich that it made sweetheart deals nationwide seem modest by
comparison. In fact, the timing of Tagliabue's trip to Boston
seemed calculated to stir up a crisis: On the day of his visit, the
Patriots filed an official application to move to Hartford, which
owners will consider at NFL meetings in Atlanta on May 25 and 26.
Approval of the move requires a yes vote from three-quarters of the
32 owners.
</P>
<P>
   By resurrecting Foxboro as an option, the league has set the
stage for the possible undoing of a signed agreement between Robert
Kraft, the Patriots' owner, and the state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the league makes its presentation about the Patriots to
the owners, we have to be able to say that we've explored every
alternative in Massachusetts,'' said Joe Browne, a league
spokesman. ``We have to be able to tell owners, even if they don't
like it, that there is no option but Hartford. We're doing what the
owners authorized us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The league did not consult Kraft about Foxboro, Browne said.
``Kraft can't talk about anything but Connecticut,'' Browne
explained. ``He has an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can escape his Connecticut deal if he does not sign a site
status report by May 2. But Dean Pagani, a spokesman for
Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, said, ``We've been assured it's not
an out option.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft surely knows what is cooking in Massachusetts, but how can
he not have developed a deep affection for Connecticut, which
presented him with a deal he never asked for but would have been
crazy to reject? In an era of whopping government subsidies for
privately owned teams, Kraft won the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Except that now, maybe he hasn't, because the NFL, after
focusing on the still unfinished Washington Redskins sale and the
potential placement of a new franchise in Los Angeles, has clearly
lost its shyness about intervening in the Patriots' move. What
happened?
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on Dan Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers' owner. Last
December, Rooney and Paul Kirk Jr., former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, were at a reception honoring the
Irish winners of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize. They spoke about
``what a tragedy it would be if the Patriots left the area,''
Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it didn't look like anybody was doing anything,'' he
added, ``and Paul said it looked like a foregone conclusion that
they're gone. I said, `They still have to take it to the league.'
Paul took it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne said, ``Kirk had a job to do to gauge enthusiasm and to
question whether the Patriots' move to Connecticut was a bluff or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk knew Tagliabue and once worked with him on antitrust
legislation. Kirk assembled a group of business leaders who went
public with their Foxboro plan on April 16, after which Tagliabue's
public enlistment was made possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made very clear our seriousness of purpose,'' Kirk said.
``Many people feel it's very helpful if the NFL commissioner says
what he hears is good. The timing of his visit was great. I feel it
made a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But there would be a difference between how much richer Kraft
would get in Hartford than in Foxboro. ``We're not coming up with a
plan with the same economic benefits for the owner,'' Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   You never know what owners will do at an owners' meeting. Will
they vote for what Kraft wants, which is Hartford? Will Kraft, a
league insider and chairman of its finance committee, surrender his
fight for Hartford if Tagliabue twists arms to consider Foxboro?
Are owners truly fearful of losing another large-market team, after
losing teams in Los Angeles and Houston?
</P>
<P>
   Rooney showed little awkwardness in having laid the early
groundwork that might undo the Patriots' deal in Hartford. ``I'm
not saying it's easy, but we have to do the right thing and what's
in the best interest of the NFL and our television partners,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With 2.2 million television households, Boston is the
sixth-largest television market in the United States. Hartford, the
27th-largest market, has 909,930 TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's Boston visit fostered a public-perception problem
for Hartford, not a real one, Pagani said. The burst of positive
talk in Massachusetts is no different from what Kraft heard in the
past, Pagani said, while there is legislation and site preparation
going on in Hartford. ``Our deal hasn't changed,'' he said. ``In
Massachusetts, it's all talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Tagliabue is the guest emcee of the talk, Hartford
cannot feel entirely safe.

PATRICIA BOWMAN, A BALLERINA WHO LINKED TWO ERAS OF DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   (kd) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Bowman, a founding member of American Ballet Theater, a
ballerina of the Radio City Music Hall and the first American
ballerina to win critical acclaim and wide popularity as a
Classical and a musical-theater dancer, died on March 18 in Las
Vegas, her home since 1977. She was believed to be in her early to
mid 90s.
</P>
<P>
   A link between two eras of dance, Ms. Bowman began her career
when there were no major American ballet companies. She performed
on Broadway and in the elaborate live shows offered at
motion-picture palaces of the 1920s and 30s. Her sparkling stage
personality won her many fans. Yet when American ballet companies
began to flourish, she gave authoritative performances in some of
the great classics.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Washington, Ms. Bowman studied with various teachers
there and in New York and Europe. She became a protegee of Michel
Fokine, the Russian ballet choreographer of ``Les Sylphides,''
``Petrouchka'' and other works, who settled in New York in 1923.
Fokine choreographed solos for her, among them ``Tennis,'' a witty
sketch she offered in vaudeville shows and as a guest artist with
ballet troupes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowman made her New York debut in the 1920 edition of the
revue ``George White's Scandals.'' For many years, she went back
and forth between dance forms, touring with the Fokine Ballet,
forming a ballroom dance team with Tony de Marco, appearing in
pioneering television productions in 1931 and 1939 and serving as
ballerina of the Roxy Theater. When Radio City Music Hall opened in
1932, she was appointed its prima ballerina and she continued to
perform there occasionally until the early 1950's. She also
appeared in the ``Ziegfeld Follies'' of 1934 and with the Mordkin
Ballet in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   During the first season of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet
Theater) in 1940, she starred in ``Swan Lake,'' ``Giselle,'' ``Les
Sylphides'' and other works. Reviewing Ms. Bowman in ``Giselle,''
John Martin wrote in The New York Times that ``besides dancing with
complete authority she achieves a dramatic credibility in the
difficult first act that very few Giselles can match.'' She
returned as guest artist during Ballet Theater's 15th-anniversary
season in 1955 and was partnered by Erik Bruhn in ``Les
Sylphides.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Ballet Theater in 1941, she appeared on Broadway
in ``Rhapsody'' in 1944, performed nationwide with opera companies
and was a guest dancer at orchestral concerts. She was hostess for
the ``Patricia Bowman Show,'' a 13-week CBS television series in
1951. Ms. Bowman directed a ballet school in New York from 1957
until 1977, when she married Albert Kaye and moved to Las Vegas,
where she served as a consultant to local dance groups.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate survivors. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a 59-year-old bachelor who is also a Wall Street
titan puts up $50 million of his own to help 40,000 poor children
attend private school, it seems only reasonable to ask, Why is he
doing this?
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling on a couch recently in his 44th-floor office
overlooking Central Park, Theodore Forstmann _ silvery helmet hair,
fresh tan _ gleams. The financier, who was a co-chairman of George
Bush's presidential re-election campaign, says he has no desire to
run for office. But he is basking in the acclaim received for the
program he founded a year ago with the philanthropist John Walton.
Last week it awarded $160 million in partial scholarships for
grade-school children, in what many see as thinly disguised school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, a long-time scholarship donor, is unapologetic. He
holds forth about how public education is a monopoly that must be
challenged by competition.
</P>
<P>
   Enough. What's in it for you, Teddy?
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, a founder of the multi-billion-dollar investment firm
Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., is known as a blunt, forceful
perfectionist. But unlike most financiers, he betrays an uncool
streak of passionate earnestness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what a lonely child feels like,'' he says. ``It's a
desperate feeling. You have no self-esteem. You think you've been
dealt this hand because it's your fault. I experienced this as a
child.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not obvious how a man whose personal fortune Forbes
magazine estimates at $525 million can empathize with
poverty-stricken children, but in a two-hour conversation,
Forstmann speaks haltingly about his own strife-torn childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was the second of six children in a family of great wealth,
but he and his branch of a woolen-manufacturing dynasty were social
outcasts. His relatives, German Lutherans, lived in adjoining
mansions in Upper Montclair, N.J. His grandfather, a 300-pound
patriarch, briefly disowned his father, Julius, for marrying
Dorothy, an Italian Catholic. So Julius fled to Greenwich, Conn.,
where Teddy and his siblings grew up with amenities like a private
baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   The Forstmann clan disdained them, says Forstmann, as did
old-line Greenwich. Even today, the man who persuaded leaders in
Hollywood, the Senate and the corporate world to support his
program, the Children's Scholarship Fund, calls himself an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann remembers Julius as ``an intellectual, generous,
gentle guy who had no belief in himself.'' But Julius, ordered to
run the empire, was also a vicious alcoholic of the Jekyll-Hyde
type who was in and out of sanitariums. ``Definitely abusive, and
then very apologetic,'' Forstmann says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is the competitor,'' he adds. ``She had some idea
that one of us should win Wimbledon. She pushed me at tennis.'' So
he quit the game for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his father's plan, Forstmann was to become the family lawyer.
He says, ``I grew up calm on the outside, but I wasn't too calm on
the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Julius died when Teddy Forstmann was 21. The family fortune was
gone. He graduated from Columbia Law School and began playing
high-stakes bridge, a penniless rich kid fumbling for an identity.
Heading into his mid-30s, he finally realized: ``It was not my
fault. That was my epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   He gained the confidence to inspire investors. Throughout the
1980s, his ruthless competitiveness, sanctimonious but prescient
anti-junk-bond crusade and 23 leveraged buyouts, which included
Gulfstream Aerospace and Dr Pepper, became the stuff of business
school textbooks. The rewards include four homes, works by Picasso,
Matisse and Van Gogh (``it's just a drawing, but it's a famous
drawing''), and rumors of a romance with Princess Diana, which he
politely denied. This is the stuff of a self-esteem that became
exceedingly robust. (Forstmann, alone among his oft-wedded siblings
never to risk marriage, is emerging from a five-year relationship,
but seems wanly hopeful.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 35 years to visit my Dad's grave,'' Forstmann says,
``and now I go once a year. I had an insight: It's tough not to
have a father, but if you're a father and you don't have a son,
that's tough, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So for 25 years, he has been traveling and writing checks,
hoping to rescue damaged childhoods. He has visited Bosnia and has
helped to finance a ranch for sick children in Colorado. There was
even a near-incredulous Daddy Warbucks moment in Johannesburg,
South Africa, when Forstmann met one youngster who yanked at his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid is for me, that's it,'' he remembers thinking. ``So I
called the guy who runs my tournament'' _ a tennis benefit for
children _ ``and I told him to bring over the kid.'' That is how a
child named Everest traveled from a South African orphanage to a
Southampton gala. Everest, 12, and his friend Siya, 15, spend
vacations with Forstmann, who pays for boarding school back home.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys have been playing computer games in the outer
office. Everest cuffs Forstmann fondly and says: ``We just came
back from the Bahamas. We go water-skiing and play golf. We go to
dinners with Teddy and meet famous people like Henry Kissinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann seems abashed by the depth of his devotion to the
boys, who are a reminder that he has bested Julius in every way but
one. ``I'd love to be a father,'' Teddy Forstmann says.

EDITORIAL: ABOLISH THE BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Education issues have now risen to the top of the agenda for
some of New York's most powerful and ambitious politicians,
offering an opportunity both to strengthen New York City's school
system and reform it for the future. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gov.
George Pataki and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone have all
decided that public schools, especially in the city, are in a state
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The most important long-term reform has been proposed by
Giuliani and Vallone, who are now crafting state legislation to
abolish the city's Board of Education and give the next mayor
direct control of city schools. The bill faces strong opposition in
Albany, but the concept is sound. The current board is a
semi-autonomous body with a representative from each borough and
two mayoral appointees. It approves budgets, sets general policy
and technically picks the schools chancellor, although mayors have
traditionally muscled the board into choosing someone of their
liking.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the schools are of central importance to the city and
the current system has failed to fix their chronic problems, it
makes sense to lodge responsibility for their performance in some
future mayor's office rather than in an entrenched education
bureaucracy. Voters would still exert political control through
citywide elections. Chicago has already made its mayor responsible
for the schools, with promising early results, and Detroit has
followed the same path.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Chancellor Rudy Crew, who has criticized the
mayor's unfortunate comment that the school system should be
``blown up,'' should be a part of this discussion. Crew has
suggested that any new system should work more like a university.
But whatever a new system looks like, Giuliani, Vallone and Pataki,
whose positions on education reflect their various political
ambitions, must recognize that such a long-term reform does not
absolve them of responsibility for today's schools.

PLANS FOR NEW POWER PLANTS LURE INVESTORS, BUT ALSO OPPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time in more than two decades,
companies are asking permission to build large power plants in New
York City and the Hudson River Valley, all spurred by the
deregulation of the electric power industry.
</P>
<P>
   Eight proposals have been filed with the New York state Public
Service Commission since August. They include plans for a
520-megawatt, 800-foot-long floating power plant to be moored along
the waterfront in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, two separate
1,100-megawatt plants in Ramapo, in Rockland County, and _ furthest
along _ a 1,080-megawatt plant in Athens, 30 miles south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   A 1,000-megawatt plant produces roughly enough power for 1
million small homes. The plants, to be built with money from
private investors instead of ratepayers, are projected to cost from
$350 million to $500 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the plants would cut power bills by increasing
supplies of electricity and generating it more efficiently, fueled
by natural gas, which produce little pollution, instead of oil or
coal, the dirtier fuels burned at the state's older plants.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the power is not needed, the giant structures
would mar the landscape, and cooling systems would threaten water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as part of the statewide restructuring of the
industry over the past few years, existing older power plants are
being sold by utilities like Consolidated Edison Co. and Central
Hudson Gas &AMP; Electric to independent companies that plan to compete
with the new plants. Some environmental groups say that by
modernizing or expanding the existing plants, the air and water
would be protected without pocking the horizon with new smokestacks
and steam plumes.

   All this activity is part of a broader effort to encourage
competition in an industry dominated by local monopolies for a
century. ``While not trying to pre-decide the environmental issues
involved in some of these sites, I think having eight plants here
with applications to build is very good news for customers,'' said
Frank Herbert, the director of the office overseeing the
restructuring of the power industry in the state's Department of
Public Service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first proposal under consideration is by US Generating Co.,
an arm of Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric, to build a plant powered by
natural gas in Athens. The plant is supported by most elected
officials in Greene County, who say it would be in a lot zoned for
industrial use and would generate taxes and jobs. It is opposed by
private historic preservation and environmental groups, who say it
would ruin the view from several parks and historic homes across
the river in Columbia County.
</P>
<P>
   One view that would be affected is that from Olana, the ornate
Moorish mansion built by Frederic E. Church, a 19th century artist
whose work epitomized the Hudson River School of landscape
painting.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the proximity of the plant to the state-owned mansion,
the state parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, wrote a letter in
February to the Public Service Commission opposing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the plant, set back two miles from the Hudson,
would be largely hidden from view and many times cleaner than
nearby oil-fired plants. The plume of steam from its cooling
systems would be limited with special equipment, said Daniel J.
Whyte, the director of government relations in the Northeast for US
Generating.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plant would help improve both the river and the air.
Niagara Mohawk, a power company with older plants nearby, projects
that it would have to reduce the amount of power generated at its
plants because of the cheaper power coming from the new competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Scenic Hudson and Riverkeeper Inc., two environmental groups,
dispute the predictions of cuts in pollution and say the plant has
the right technology, but is planned for the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials expressed frustration with the continued
opposition on environmental grounds. ``If there's not a problem
with the air and not a problem with the fish, you've got to find a
problem,'' Whyte said of the environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a floating plant on the Brooklyn waterfront is so
new that it has not become an issue yet. It is being developed by
Sunset Energy Inc., a Manhattan company that is also building a
small gas-fired plant at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to put the power plant on huge barges was easy,
said Jerry Montrose, chairman and chief executive officer of Sunset
Energy. There are simply no tracts of industrially zoned land
inside the city big enough to house a plant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at companies that are buying some of the old power
plants say they should not be counted out in the race to sell
power. For around $480 million, Southern Energy is buying a group
of old Hudson Valley power plants totaling 1,776 megawatts in
generating capacity from Orange and Rockland Utilities Inc. The
company is going to spend $390 million at the existing sites to
increase efficiency, cut pollution and add more natural-gas
generators, Mould said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not predict which strategy would win, saying that they
were all experimental. ``They're different paths to the same end,''
Mould said. ``Price will drive everything.''

WELL-SUITED FOR A MUSEUM LUNCH 
NO-SHOW FORGIVEN 
JACKSON UNMASKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 BY JAMES BARRON with COREY KILGANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for a friend,'' said Mary Stewart Allen, who was
on the committee that organized Monday's lunch for the Museum of
the City of New York, ``and we all look alike.'' She was right
about that: There were a lot of women in pastel Chanel (or
Chanel-like) suits in the auditorium at the Academy of Medicine, on
Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   After a lecture by the art historian Olivier Bernier, the Chanel
(or Chanel-like) suits were seen heading across the street for
lunch at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   At one table, Mario Buatta, one of eight designers who received
awards from the museum, said that his latest project had been a
``big motor yacht in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now on the high seas, where, I hear, the lamps are
falling over, even though they're screwed down,'' he said. ``Those
must have been some swell swells.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he handed David C. Clapp, the president of the museum, a
fake $1 million bill, as if he were making a donation. Zibby Tozer,
a trustee of the museum, and Wendy Moonan, an editor at large at
House &AMP; Garden magazine, both said simultaneously, ``Oh, look, it's
a million-dollar bill'' _ and went back to their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd was leaving, Suzette de Marigny Smith, another
organizer of the event, found a corner and changed out of her
high-heeled shoes. ``I brought flats, so I can go across the street
and walk,'' she said, referring to the conservatory garden in
Central Park. ``The flowers are at their peak right now.''
</P>
<P>
   No-Show Forgiven
</P>
<P>
   His name was on the invitations, but Mike Espy, the former
Secretary of Agriculture, will not be at a dinner Tuesday night at
Tavern on the Green for the Black Leadership Forum, a confederation
of 26 civil rights and public-service groups that will toast
cabinet members, including Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman and
Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gen. Togo D. West Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Espy bowed out two weeks ago, saying that he would be on on his
honeymoon. The executive director of the Black Leadership Forum,
Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, did not complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage is a very important commitment,'' she said Monday.
``People who have been there before, as I think he has, at least
want to start out doing it better.''
</P>
<P>
   At Espy's law firm in Jackson, Miss., an aide said that the
wedding took place on April 17. He married Portia D. Ballard, who
had been a senior human resources analyst for Shell Chemical Co.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Unmasked
</P>
<P>
   In case you have ever wondered about the surgical mask that
Michael Jackson wears in public, he wears it in private too.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Rudy Gonzalez says that Jackson was wearing it when he
arrived for dinner in Jackson's suite at the Waldorf-Astoria on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only took it off when we started eating,'' said Gonzalez,
who added that he got to know Jackson while working as a bodyguard
for Mike Tyson in the early 1990s, an experience he described in
his book, ``The Inner Ring'' (Oliver Publishing Group, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said that Jackson offered support for Tyson and even
took down the address of the jail in Maryland where Tyson is an
inmate, along with his release date.
</P>
<P>
   During the dinner Jackson's two young children romped with their
nannies in the suite, which Gonzalez said was heavily guarded.
``You'd think the president was in there,'' he said. ``I don't
think Mike ever leaves the hotel.''

 &HT;    Braves get two in 9th to finish trip at 8-3
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Braves have been through everything else this road
trip _ rain-out, snow-out, a 20-5 pummeling, a 12-inning marathon
in Los Angeles, East Coast, West Coast, a mile high and sea level.
</P>
<P>
   So why not something a little out of the ordinary Monday night,
the last of the 15-day adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Like the knuckleball. And a failed squeeze play that didn't fail
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Springer, the Marlins' fifth starter, was floating it the
Braves' way, keeping them off balance for most of the game, before
Atlanta scored twice in the ninth inning to beat Florida 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss' RBI single broke a 3-3 tie in the ninth, and Andruw
Jones scored another run when he escaped a rundown with the help of
a Marlins misplay after a botched suicide squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez got the last four outs for his second save as the
Braves completed an 8-3 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Springer, 34, making his first career start against the Braves,
had lost each of his first three starts, allowing three, four and
five runs. He puzzled most of the Braves through 7 1/3 innings, but
not their two natives of Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones, who has used this trip to practice patience at the
plate and find his stroke, connected for a triple and a home run,
the latter a two-run shot in the seventh that gave the Braves a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   And countryman Randall Simon started the seventh-inning rally
with a double to right center, his third hit of the game in three
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood was looking for a lift in his fourth start of the
season, after allowing four runs in each of his first four starts.
He was much sharper in this one, allowing four hits in 7 1/3
innings and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood left with two runners on and a 3-2 lead in the eighth,
and reliever Mike Remlinger got the second out before giving way to
rookie Kevin McGlinchy. But McGlinchy walked pinch hitter Derrek
Lee and Kevin Orie to force in the tying run before Seanez got the
final out.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' second triple of the year, a line drive to right center
leading off the third inning, set up the Braves' first run. Otis
Nixon, hitless in his previous eight at-bats, drove him in with a
two-out chopper up the middle to give the Braves a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was on his game from the start, holding the Marlins to
an infield hit and one walk the first three innings. His shakiness
resurfaced in the fourth when he walked Mark Kotsay to start the
inning, then gave up a triple by Todd Dunwoody to the right-center
field wall. Orie followed with a hard single up the middle, giving
Florida a 2-1 lead.Carroll Rogers writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

ROSE PAYNE, 89, RESEARCHER WHO ADVANCED ORGAN TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Rose Payne, whose research into tissue compatibility at
Stanford University over more than three decades helped advance the
field of organ transplants, died on April 18 at Kaiser Permanente
Medical Center in Santa Clara, Calif. She was 89 and had been
living in Cupertino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Payne, an expert in tissue-typing, was credited with helping
to identify proteins that play an important role in how well
patients accept a graft of tissue, or a blood transfusion, from
another person. The proteins, part of the human leukocyte antigen
system, may also lend insights into why some people are more
susceptible than others to a range of autoimmune diseases,
including diabetes and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Before the work of Dr. Payne and other scientists who studied
the proteins, doctors who transplanted organs had to base their
determination of compatibility only on whether the donor and
recipient had the same blood type.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Payne was born on Aug. 5, 1909, in Lake Bay, Wash. She
attended the University of Washington, where in 1937 she earned a
doctorate in bacteriology.
</P>
<P>
   She was hired by Stanford as a research assistant after World
War II, one of the few women there at the time. A new career began
when Dr. Payne, in her mid-40s, was encouraged by a new
administration to pursue her own studies.
</P>
<P>
   She began focusing on leukocytes, trying to establish what
caused incompatibility problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Stanford named Dr. Payne a professor of medicine. Three
years later, her status changed again, to professor emerita.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the American Society for Histocompatibility and
Immunogenetics named an award in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview posted on the society's Web site, Dr. Payne
recalled what led up to her appointment as professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never asked for anything,'' she said. ``Then, one day, I
decided I was old enough and established enough. So I marched right
in and asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Payne, who is survived by a sister, Violet Russell, of
Seattle, and a nephew, said that, in the end, the appointment did
not change her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already had an international reputation and had done what I
wanted to do,'' she said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 27.
</P>
<P>
   The one idea that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani should not be pursuing
is school vouchers. In last week's budget he proposed spending $12
million over the next two years to establish the administrative
structure for a voucher program in a volunteer school district. The
money would be distributed through his office to avoid involving
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who opposes the idea. But once the
structure was in place, the money for vouchers to be used at
private and parochial schools would presumably come out of the
regular Board of Education budget.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is a bad one on any number of counts. It probably
violates the state Constitution. It would cause more friction
between the mayor and Crew. Most important, it would drain both
money and attention from the public school system at a time the
schools are struggling desperately to meet the strict new education
standards imposed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The prize at the end of this distracting and probably hopeless
quest is a program that has not yet proved itself in cities where
it is being tried on a wide scale. It would be better to fix the
system than to waste time and money on a proposal that will leave
Giuliani open to accusations that his main education priority is
scoring points with the Republican Party rather than the city's
schools.

   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, April, 27:
</P>
<P>
   Like President Kennedy's naval quarantine of Cuba during the
1962 missile crisis, NATO's planned embargo on oil shipments to
Serbia is not called a blockade by diplomats, for fear that term of
war could widen the conflict. But the intent is clear _ use a naval
armada in the Adriatic Sea to deny Slobodan Milosevic's forces the
fuel they need to operate in Kosovo. If executed with a healthy
regard for Russian sensibilities, it can sap Serbian strength and
speed the way to a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As the war in Yugoslavia enters its second month, NATO is
searching for a combination of force and diplomacy that will induce
Milosevic to reach for a peace deal. Last weekend's NATO summit
meeting in Washington endorsed several potentially productive steps
in that direction, including the naval action, intensification of
the air war and a subtle but significant shift in the alliance's
conditions for a cease-fire. All of these can support a critical
round of diplomacy that will begin today in Moscow, where Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott will meet with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The interdiction of oil tankers will not cut off petroleum
supplies to Serbia. Smugglers will be eager to collect the premium
fees that come with running a blockade, and some overland shipments
are likely to continue. But after bombing Serbian refineries, it
would be a mistake not to try to limit the flow of oil through
Yugoslav ports.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been sending oil to Serbia, and NATO must work with
Moscow to avoid a confrontation with tankers carrying Russian fuel.
The alliance cannot afford to provoke military tensions with Russia
or drive the Kremlin from the peacemaking role that Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said Monday his country is now playing. The
best way to avoid either possibility is to persuade the Russians
not to send further shipments to Serbia. The subject should be on
Talbott's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ivanov made clear in an interview that NATO and Milosevic
remain far apart on peace terms, Talbott is carrying an important
concession from the alliance. NATO is now prepared to suspend
bombing when Serbian forces begin to leave Kosovo, rather than
waiting for a withdrawal to be completed. NATO also signaled some
flexibility over the weekend about the composition and command of
an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, saying it would seek
a U.N. Security Council mandate for the troops. That would require
Russian assent.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that the NATO meeting dodged whether to start
assembling ground forces in the Balkans to keep open the option of
a land campaign. The additional pressure might help move Milosevic.
For now, the best strategy is to press ahead with bombing, organize
the blockade and be imaginative in the pursuit of diplomacy. &QL;

CALIFORNIA SOUNDS GOOD TO MARTIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Having survived 500 miles at Talladega
Superspeedway on Sunday without a major crash, Mark Martin is
heading west, which is just fine with him. After all, he is the
defending champion of the NAPA California 500 set for Sunday at the
California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The race will mark the 400th career NASCAR Winston Cup Series
start for the Batesville, Ark., native. Thanks to Sunday's
third-place finish in the DieHard 500 at the Alabama track, Martin
has moved into the third spot in Winston Cup points. He trails only
Roush Racing teammate Jeff Burton, by 84 points, and fellow Ford
driver Dale Jarrett, by 44.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has never won a Winston championship but has finished
second three times, including last year when he won seven races.
Failure to score major points at Talladega cost him last year in
the scramble with Jeff Gordon for the title and accompanying $2
million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to lose points going into Martinsville (Va.) and
Talladega, and I especially expected to lose points at Talladega,''
said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   He earned 170 points Sunday, more than the 152 he earned in two
races over the same speedway in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel like I've been let out of a cage now,'' Martin said.
``I know that my car will be fairly competitive, in a worst-case
scenario, and if it's as good as it usually is, then we should be a
contender to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has excelled over the two-mile speedway in Fontana. He
dominated the field in 1998, leading 159 of 250 laps en route to a
1.287-second victory over Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   In the inaugural race at Fontana, Martin was leading until he
ran out of gas with 11 laps to go and had to be pushed into the
pits. Gordon took the victory and Martin returned after refueling
to finish 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't exactly put my finger on it,'' the 40-year-old Martin
said about his success at Fontana. ``It's a situation that we have
a beautiful, nice, big, open speedway, and it suits my driving
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to have adapted to it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Martin has three total wins. In addition to the
California 500 victory last year, he's also won two International
Race of Champion (IROC) races at Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a race track that you can go out there and let it
all out,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Which was not the case over the weekend in Alabama. NASCAR
mandates restrictor plates on carburetors at Talladega, which tends
to bunch up the pack and often results in spectacular crashes. In
1998, Martin was involved in such wrecks in both races there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly a relief to not only get out of Talladega without
getting hurt at all but with a race car in one piece,'' said
Martin, who has won 30 Cup events since he started racing in 1981.
``We scored some points, we did well. Some of the competitors that
seem to be fortunate to not get caught up in that stuff, it seems
like bad luck went their way instead of our way this time. So I'm
relieved and ready to go racing, real racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's confident the Roush crew will have his car set to go.
In the nine Winston Cup races thus far, Martin has scored seven
top-10 finishes, including a win at Rockingham (N.C.), and six
top-five showings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say that I know going to California that we're
going to run good,'' said Martin. ``I know that. If that mentally
helps me run good, then it does. But when we go to Michigan or
California or Charlotte or Las Vegas, there's no question in my
mind that we're going to be very competitive because those are
tracks we do real well on.''
</P>
<P>
   But just don't tell him that winning at Fontana is more special
than any other venue on the Winston Cup schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that you can just say one race (stands above
another). You have to realize how hard it is to win a race,'' said
Martin. ``I mean, they're all huge. They're all incredibly hard to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming to California and there are gonna be 50 cars
there and the only race in the whole wide world to them is
California, until the checkered flag flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's over, there's going to be a winner and all the rest
are going to pack up and focus on the next race.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 27:
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with vouchers and governance, New York City's
schools most urgently need to gain their fair share of funding from
the state. The annual battle over state school spending is
aggravated this year by Gov. Pataki's reneging on an earlier
commitment, made when he was running for re-election, to increase
aid for preschool and reading programs. The city and other large
urban school districts were counting on the money to pay for
teachers, remedial programs and new classrooms. Now those plans are
in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki backtracked because he and the Legislature enacted not
only big school-aid increases but also big property tax cuts. Now
the governor is worried that the money may not be there to pay for
both programs as they grow. But by cutting school aid, while
leaving the property tax cuts intact, he is once again hurting
cities and helping residents of the wealthier suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's schools have been punished enough. With 38
percent of the state's pupils, they would get only 35 percent of
overall state aid under the latest Pataki budget proposal. The
governor had pledged to correct that imbalance, but his new budget
is moving in the opposite direction. His effort to collapse myriad
state programs into block grants has been put forward as a
smokescreen to cut aid to the students who need it most. The
Legislature, the governor and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani should set
aside their disputes over other matters and enact school aid
programs that would help the urban school systems that need it the
most.

CHANCELLOR ASSAILS MAYOR'S REMARKS ON SCHOOL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew on Monday accused Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of dismissing the city's school system and
everyone in it ``as no good and beyond redemption,'' sharply
escalating the recent series of disagreements between the two men
and raising questions anew about whether the chancellor intends to
remain in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent late Monday to 600 political, civic and
educational leaders in New York and Albany, Crew replied in tones
of anger and dismay to the mayor's comment last week that the
school system was ``dysfunctional'' and should be ``blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the mayor declares that the whole school system should be
blown up, he tells 1.1 million children and thousands of parents,
teachers and administrators that they are wasting their time,'' the
chancellor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Giuliani had urged him not to take last week's
remarks personally, Crew added, ``It is hard to tell these
thousands of people not to take it personally when the mayor is
implying that their achievements have amounted to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Crew felt compelled to defend his record and the
school system in light of Giuliani's determination during the last
five days to press ahead with his campaign for vouchers and for the
abolition of the Board of Education in favor of a commissioner who
would report directly to the mayor. The chancellor's office faxed
copies of the letter to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Giuliani, apparently unaware that the letter
was being faxed as he spoke, repeated that he did not mean his
criticism of the system to be interpreted as a personal insult to
the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't say anything about our relationship other than I
don't understand it,'' Giuliani told reporters at a police
graduation ceremony. ``I mean, the things that I've said last week,
I've said over and over again, and I've said to Rudy Crew
directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has proposed a voucher program using tax dollars to pay
the private school tuition of 3,000 children from low income
families. He says the plan would provide an escape from failing
public schools and create competition that would improve the public
school system.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous mayors, Giuliani has argued that the Board of
Education serves the political interests of the five borough
presidents more than the schoolchildren it should represent. He has
proposed putting the schools directly under the control of the
mayor and the council.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals face an uncertain future in the City Council and
the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Chiara Coletti, the chancellor's spokeswoman, said Crew
agreed that the seven-member Board of Education is overly
political, but believed that a commissioner appointed by the mayor
would be even more subject to political whims. On Saturday, Crew
said he would resign if the board was replaced with a city
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not return telephone requests Monday seeking
comment on Crew's letter. Crew was returning from a conference in
Roanoke, Va., on Monday, his spokeswoman said, and did not want to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Coletti said that although Crew had been mentioned as a
candidate for the superintendent's job in San Francisco, which is
vacant, she denied that he was interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not on the way out,'' she said. ``When he really thinks
his honor is at stake, and the honor of public schools _ he sees
New York as the symbol of the country _ he's the kind of person who
digs in his heels.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said Crew's vehemently public reaction to the mayor's
comments hardly seemed calculated to dampen speculation about his
commitment to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually these things are worked out behind closed doors,''
said Frank J. Macchiarola, the schools chancellor from 1978 to
1983, who is now president of St. Francis College in Brooklyn.
``What does it mean? It may mean the chancellor will be looking for
another job. I wouldn't put that out of the realm of the
possible.''

BENSON PENALIZED FOR HIS BAD TIMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ When the NASCAR Winston Cup drivers finally
get on the track at the California Speedway on Friday morning,
don't look for the No. 26 Cheerios Ford driven by Johnny Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Benson has been given the NASCAR equivalent of a timeout. He
will miss the first 20 minutes of the opening practice session for
the NAPA California 500 on Friday as a penalty for being late to
the pre-race inspection last Sunday at Alabama's Talladega
Superspeedway for the DieHard 500.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the second straight race in which Benson has missed
practice time because of a rules infraction. Friday's initial
practice for Winston Cup drivers starts at 10:30 a.m. and runs 55
minutes. A second session, an hour in length, will begin at 12:30
p.m. and will precede the Bud Pole qualifying runs at 2:30.
</P>
<P>
   The late arrival of a rear gear caused the Roush Racing team to
be late. The team waited for the part Sunday morning, but the plane
carrying the part was late. Benson's team pulled out of the
inspection line when the part arrived and took the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the first practice for the DieHard race, Benson sat out the
first 10 minutes for not having his car at the cut-off point for
pre-race inspection the week before in Martinsville, Va., for the
Goody's 500.
</P>
<P>
   __ Back to Fontana: Stanton Barrett, a Hollywood stuntman, is
returning to Southern California, this time behind the wheel of the
Busch Grand National series ChanneLock Chevrolet. He competed in
the inaugural Busch race in 1997, qualifying seventh before a
series of problems dropped him to 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far this season, the 26-year-old Bishop native has driven
for two different Winston Cup teams, including his own and one for
veteran car owner Junie Donlavey. He was hired as a full-time
driver for the ChanneLock car just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran at California two years ago and it was a strange but
kind of rewarding experience. If nothing else, I learned how to
pass there,'' said Barrett, who has appeared in such films as
``Batman,'' ``Free Jack,'' ``Mars Attacks'' and ``Last of the
Mohicans,'' in addition to television shows ``Beverly Hills 90210''
and ``Baywatch.'' ``I passed a lot of cars all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been able to add them all together and counted that,
it might have been a heck of a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's banking on his past for Saturday's Auto Club 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has the experience I have at California. I don't know
of anybody who has been in every single different position during a
race there,'' he said. ``I've been in every single different
position two or three times in a lot of cases. I've been in the
back, I've been in the front and I've been in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front is a lot better, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ NASCAR channel? The recent announcement by NASCAR that the
sanctioning body would consolidate its future television rights has
created plenty of speculation as to how much the package would be
worth and who's interested.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there were estimates the entire package could be
worth around $200-400 million per year. The money would be split 60
(track promoters), 25 (drivers), 15 (NASCAR).
</P>
<P>
   Televising races has long been the domain of ESPN, Turner and
TNN, with occasional races on CBS and ABC. NBC joined the party
this year after losing football and picked up the Homestead race.
Other possibilities include Fox and an all-NASCAR Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a work in progress; we're working hard on the whole
program,'' NASCAR president and CEO Mike Helton said recently.
``It's not something we're prepared to talk a whole lot about.
There are many details to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do the right thing. We hope it'll be fun,
exciting and a lot of new elements that come out of it.''

<P>
   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ Each time a busload of refugees rumbles into
the dusty refugee camp here, Murat Beqiri, 14, scans the faces
peering from the windows. One day, when he heard his family name
called over a bullhorn by an aid worker searching for a specific
refugee, he scrambled expectantly out of his tent hoping that he
might find his mother or father. Every day he tries to call home to
Pristina, even though the line has been dead for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are trapped in Pristina,'' Kosovo's capital, said
Murat, a drawn and distracted look on his youthful face. ``I think
they can't get out now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic hours when ethnic Albanians were forced from
their Kosovo homes, hundreds of parents and children lost track of
one another. Some of the children, who range from toddlers to
teen-agers, crossed the border here alone or with relatives. Others
were separated when Macedonian police officers forced 50,000 Kosovo
Albanians out of a makeshift refugee camp near the border three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murat last saw his father when his father told him and his
sister to leave home and take a train to Macedonia as word spread
in Pristina that Yugoslav forces were ordering people to leave. His
parents said they would soon follow, but never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Lost children have been a tragic by-product of many refugee
crises. But the chaotic nature of the exodus from Kosovo, the
actions of the Macedonian government, and a complicated
international evacuation program have made efforts to reunite
families particularly daunting. Adding to the potential problem, 70
percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanians were under 30.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Albania, Macedonia has been urging refugees to move on,
and calling for more to be evacuated to other countries. And when
Macedonian police rousted the 50,000 Kosovo refugees from the camp
in the town of Blace, it further scattered families. Macedonian
officials flew 2,000 refugees to Turkey, bused 15,000 to Albania
and divided the rest among six camps here.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun came up, Jehona Aliu, a 5-year-old girl, was found
wandering alone in the remains of the camp. Aid workers have posted
her photograph in the larger refugee camps in Macedonia and are
trying to determine if her parents were sent to Turkey or Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks have passed, but Jehona's parents have not emerged.
British NATO soldiers at first cared for her, but she is now living
with a refugee family in Macedonia. They are missing children of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   By one count, Murat and Jehona are two of 253 ethnic Albanian
children in Macedonia refugee camps separated from their parents,
the International Committee of the Red Cross says. But there are
other children unaccounted for because 776 parents have reported
that their children are missing and are not on the Red Cross lists.
</P>
<P>
   Of lost children aid workers know about, few have been
completely abandoned and most are being cared for by relatives. The
Red Cross is posting the names of children it has located on
bulletin boards in the camps here, hoping parents or relatives will
come forward. But with refugees here being evacuated to a dozen
countries in Europe, it could prove difficult to find them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, only 54 children have been reunited with their
parents through the efforts of the Red Cross and Save the Children.
Aid workers predict that parents and children are not likely to be
reunited for weeks, possibly months, and countless other relatives
_ siblings, aunts, uncles and grandparents _ are also missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we are just dealing now with the tip of the
iceberg,'' said Francois Zen-Ruffinin, a Red Cross spokesman.
``We're starting with children. They are the priority. But just
about every single family is missing a relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Families started scattering even before the NATO airstrikes.
Many parents hustled their children out of larger towns and cities
to the rural homes of relatives for safekeeping. But when Yugoslav
forces launched a major offensive after the bombing began, hundreds
of parents were blocked from retrieving their children.
</P>
<P>
   Even families that began the flight from Kosovo together were
sometimes separated. Panicked crowds swarmed aboard trains headed
for the border and the Serbian police cut off convoys of cars,
ordering some to the border, and others back into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Murat, who lives in a tent with his 25-year-old sister and her
husband in the sprawling refugee camp of 27,000 in Brazda, went to
the train station in Pristina after his aunt burst into in his home
in tears a week after the bombing began. Serbs had just expelled
her from her nearby home, she said, and Murat and his sister were
told to go to the train station immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said, `You go, we'll catch up with you,''' Murat
said. ``We waited for three hours. They never came.'' He managed to
reach his parents at a neighbor's house a week ago, but has heard
nothing since.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents said they were forcibly separated from their
children. Hyzri Gaytani, 24, and his wife, Imrani, 20, said the
Serbian police expelled them from their home in Pristina and then
blocked them from going to the hospital where their premature baby
was still in an incubator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 17 days,'' Gaytani said, holding his first, and
only, child's birth certificate. ``We don't know where he is.''
Phone calls to the doctor in Pristina have not been answered. They
have asked the Red Cross to see if they can send someone to the
hospital to find their infant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Families that had already been split up in Kosovo have been
divided yet again. Fatmira Mehmeti, 15, said she, her sister and
two brothers were separated from their parents after being taken to
their uncle's home in Pristina for safekeeping. After the NATO
bombing began, the children fled with their uncle to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   When Macedonian police officers cleared out the Blace camp, the
two girls and one of their brothers managed to stay with their
uncle. Their other brother, aunt, grandmother and three cousins
disappeared. ``Somebody told us they went to Turkey,'' Fatmira
said. ``But nothing is confirmed. We don't know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with children, elderly and mentally ill people have been
found wandering alone in Brazda. A dozen people in their 60s, 70s
and 80s and two mentally retarded teen-age boys are being cared for
in a tent run by the International Catholic Migration Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the boys can offer a hint as to who they are, their
age, their home or who cared for them. When strangers appear in
their tent, one offers a warm smile, waves his hand in the air and
blurts out garbled words. The other stares blankly at a wall of the
tent, seemingly traumatized by the tragedies that brought them to
Brazda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite likely we're not ever going to find their
families,'' said Albert Ramirez, a social worker from Austin,
Texas, who has been caring for the boys. ``They can't communicate
with us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In another tent, Benin Kukiqi and his college-age friends
represent one more group, teen-agers and young adults separated
from their parents. Kukiqi, 20, is the oldest of five students
sharing a tent in Brazda. None of them know where their parents
are.
</P>
<P>
   All five are childhood friends from the town of Glogovac in
northern Kosovo. Taking classes at Pristina University, they were
dozens of miles from their families when the NATO airstrikes began
a month ago. Kukiqi, a mechanical engineering student, said the
last time he spoke to his parents was from a phone booth in the
main post office in Pristina the day the strikes began.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, he said, lectured him for taking the risk of walking
through the center of town to make the call. Since then, phone
lines to Glogovac have been dead and no refugees from the town have
emerged. He has no idea where his parents and 17-year-old sister
are. ``There has been nothing at all,'' he said, ``just rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his tent-mates keep busy working with relief
organizations in the camp, a seeming distraction from thinking
incessantly about the missing. Kukiqi, steeling himself from what
could be weeks of doubt and worry, said the best thing he can do is
stay in one place and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am staying here to wait for some kind of contact,'' he said
resolutely. ``If my parents are alive, and I hope they are, they
will find me here.''

EDITORIAL: AN ILL-TIMED NRA MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 27:
</P>
<P>
   After the Littleton school shootings, the National Rifle
Association said it would shorten its annual meeting in Denver next
weekend from three days to one, and cancel exhibits by gun dealers
and manufacturers. The NRA should listen to Denver's mayor and
cancel the conference altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, which is fiercely opposed to sensible gun laws, has
urged its members to attend as a show of unity, if only for a day.
On a purely emotional level, this is an insult to grieving families
and to a city still shaken by tragedy. Mayor Wellington Webb
bluntly told the group last week, ``We don't want you here.''
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, the mayor worries that anger over the
shootings may cause confrontations between the gun group and local
residents. A large anti-gun protest is planned during the NRA
meeting. Although the protest is expected to be peaceful, the
convention raises security concerns that the city should not have
to deal with right now.
</P>
<P>
   About the only good thing that can be said for the NRA's
insensitivity is that it has reinforced the opposition already
generated by the Littleton shootings to the NRA agenda in the
Colorado legislature. Several NRA-supported bills that were
expected to become law just days before the shootings have been
derailed. Among other things, these bills would have gutted
municipal gun-control ordinances and made it easier for citizens to
carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby can hardly be counted out. In the past it has
shamelessly bounced back after devastating events to continue
fighting even modest laws, like those requiring safety devices on
weapons. But for now, the NRA should at least allow Denver to mourn
in peace.

TOWN IN TEXAS DISCUSSES OWN SCHOOL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBERLEY, Texas _ Three days after four eighth graders were
charged with plotting to blow up Danforth Junior High School here,
more than 400 teachers, parents and students crowded into the
school cafeteria on Monday night to ask law-enforcement officials
about the case.
</P>
<P>
   But with the presiding judge having prohibited lawyers and
officials from talking about the case, the meeting became a
discussion of the community and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Morales, who came with his eighth-grade daughter, Desiree,
said: ``We moved here six months ago from McAllen because of the
crime situation with gangs down there. We were even home schooling
her to keep her away from that situation. The news of this blew us
away.''
</P>
<P>
   But several parents said the crisis should be an impetus to get
more involved in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had only been the shooting in Littleton, we might not
have had the motivation to act,'' said Lee Williams, the mother of
two students in the district, referring to the attack last week on
a school in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth reopened on Monday with 90 percent of its 400 students
attending, said David Simmons, superintendent of the Wimberley
Independent School District.
</P>
<P>
   The four boys, who were taken into custody on Friday after other
students told school officials they had heard them talking about
their plan, appeared on Monday afternoon before Judge Howard Warner
of County Court at Law. Warner ordered them held until a later
detention hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators think that the boys, who are being held on
juvenile charges of conspiracy to commit murder and arson and to
manufacture explosives, began planning the attack in January and
that the plot was not connected to the shootings in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Searches of the homes of the boys, all 14, turned up several
explosive devices, gunpowder and bomb-making instructions that had
been downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates described them as ``good kids'' who played football
and ran track. Gary S. Smith, an eighth grader who said he was a
friend of the four boys, sat at a folding table in the cafeteria on
Monday night shaking his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this thing has been blown out of proportion,'' Smith
said. ``I didn't think they would have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was clearly in the minority.

 &HT;    Officers talk to man who was with Cornelius
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Williamson County sheriff's investigators on
Monday interrogated a man who says he was with the missing mother
of two slain children hours before their bodies were pulled from
Brushy Creek near Hutto.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Austin man, who claims Tina Marie Cornelius told
him her son and daughter fell to their death from a cliff while
visiting one of their fathers, is cooperating with the
investigation, sheriff's Capt. Linda Bunte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did come up here,'' Bunte said Monday afternoon. ``He's
talking to us now.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, who asked to remain anonymous because he says he fears
for his safety, contacted an American-Statesman reporter last
Thursday just before midnight and said he had information about
Cornelius. Investigators spent the weekend looking for the man, who
agreed Monday to talk to deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The man, an El Paso native who works as a glass installer, says
he met Cornelius on Saturday, April 17 at the Bob Marley Festival
at Auditorium Shores and that he shared a weekend fling with the
topless dancer. He said that the next day he was with Cornelius at
Mansfield Dam on Lake Travis when she told him her children had
died.
</P>
<P>
   A Round Rock couple found the bodies of 3-year-old Amanda Lee
Miller and Dominick Logan Cornelius, 2, shortly before 5 p.m. on
April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe Miller, who died of suffocation, and her
brother, who suffered a fatal skull fracture, were dumped in the
creek near County Road 137 just hours before the discovery.
Officers have been trying to locate Cornelius, but by Monday night
had not been able to find her. Several sources have said she was
last seen a week ago today dancing at Expose, an adult
entertainment club on South Congress Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials have said Cornelius is not a suspect in her
children's slayings and that they fear for her safety.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have obtained a receipt from a Ramada Limited
hotel that indicates someone using Cornelius' name stayed in the
hotel a week ago Sunday. The man who claims he spent the weekend
with Cornelius has said he was with her at the hotel until around
7:30 the following Monday morning _ the day the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Smith, a Round Rock woman who says she baby-sat
Cornelius' children from October 1997 until January, said she fears
Cornelius may be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's not alive. I think something happened to her
also,'' Smith said. ``I don't think she's somewhere hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she has not seen Cornelius in the past two months and
called Cornelius a ``very good mom,'' who worked several jobs to
take care of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Smith remembers Dominick and Amanda getting excited each day
when their mother picked them up after working at the Wal-Mart
automotive center on RM 620 near U.S. 183.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd come in and they could see her from the window and
they'd get very excited,'' Smith said. ``She'd pick them up and
she'd take them to the park and play with them.''

 &HT;    Man, 78, held in bank robbery
 &HT;    By Matt Mossman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A 78-year-old Pompano Beach man who once
kayaked his way to freedom from prison and picked his way out of
leg irons in a hospital was captured on a bank robbery charge last
week after deputies forced him to drive into a palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest, after a Jupiter bank robbery, is the latest chapter
in the criminal epic of Forrest Silva Tucker, a lifelong bank
robber and escape artist and once the head of a silver-haired band
of South Florida crooks dubbed the ``Over-the-Hill Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuckerlast made headlines in 1983 when he led authorities on a
spectacular chase and shootout on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   He was seen last Thursday leaving the Republic Security Bank on
S. U.S. 1 with about $6,000, Broward County sheriff's Detective
James Chinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, acting on a tip, deputies parked near his
girlfriend's home. They watched him leave and tried to pull him
over, but he wouldn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his earlier escapes, this one ended quickly. Deputies
forced him into the parking lot of an elementary school west of
Pompano Beach and made him crash into a palm tree. They found guns,
burglary tools, police scanners and a large amount of cash in his
vehicle, the sheriff's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker remained Monday without bond in the Broward County Jail
on a federal bank robbery charge. Chinn said he suspects Tucker in
at least four bank robberies in Broward County. The FBI also is
investigating Tucker for other Palm Beach County bank robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The chase Thursday was less of a spectacle than the wild ride on
June 10, 1983. Tucker, a suspect in several robberies, opened fire
on FBI agents approaching his Buick Riviera near Palm Beach Lakes
Boulevard. The car sputtered during the getaway, so Tucker took the
car of a mother driving with her two children, according to news
reports. The chase down Palm Beach Lakes evolved into gunfire, and
eventually Tucker and partner Ted Green, then 69, were caught.
Tucker was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was first arrested in 1935 as a 15-year-old bicycle
thief. In 1951 he picked the lock on leg irons holding him in
Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, then strolled away unnoticed. He
was there recovering from appendicitis before he was to start
serving a five-year prison sentence for robbing a Miami bank of
$475. He was caught two years later after a Berkeley, Calif., bank
robbery. He's been in and out of prison since then.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's most daring escape came at the maximum-security prison
at San Quentin, Calif., in 1979. Tucker and two other inmates built
a 14-foot kayak from wood scraps and rowed to freedom from the
peninsula. They painted the craft with the logo of the Marin County
Yacht Club, and named it the Rub-a-Dub-Dub.
</P>
<P>
   After the escape, Tucker resurfaced in South Florida, leading
the Over-the-Hill Gang, which specialized in robbing banks. Victims
described Tucker and Green as polite and sharply dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Often resourceful, Tucker disguised a police radio as a hearing
aid and once got a reduced sentence after representing himself
before the U.S. Supreme Court, according to a 1983 story in The
Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker hasn't lost his driving edge, either, Detective Chinn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really impressed with his driving, since it was
rush-hour traffic,'' Chinn said. Nonetheless, Tucker got a citation
for reckless driving.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As he planned the assault on Columbine High
School, Eric Harris wrote in a diary that he envisioned killing as
many as 500 students, going on to attack neighboring homes and then
hijacking a jet and crashing it in New York City, police
investigators said Monday after reviewing a diary that he had kept
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Harris or his accomplice, Dylan
Klebold, took any steps to carry out the full scheme, but Steve
Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department,
said, ``If in fact they were able to carry out their entire plan,
there could have been quite a bit more damage and quite a few more
fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he had ``no idea'' why Harris ahd New York in mind.
The officials did not release the contents of the diary.
</P>
<P>
   As funerals were held Monday for four of the 13 victims of the
suicide assault last Tuesday by the two seniors, who apparently
brought four guns and as many as 30 pipe bombs to school,
detectives questioned an 18-year-old girlfriend of one of the
gunmen in an effort to determine whether anyone else knew of the
plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a female who I believe had access to this weapon
prior to Tuesday,'' Dave Thomas, the Jefferson County district
attorney said, referring to a semiautomatic TEC-9 pistol recovered
with the suspects' bodies. The manufacture of the assault-style
semiautomatic pistol has been banned since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into how she got access to that weapon, and
what involvement she may have had,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney and the sheriff's spokesman emphasized
that no arrests were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not called her a suspect at the time, by any means,''
Davis said. ``There is no arrest warrant either.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a reporter's question about the four guns found in
the school, Davis said, ``She was questioned on the handgun and the
rifle, not the shotguns. Nothing has been confirmed as far as her
supplying those weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that of the four guns recovered, the two shotguns
appear to have been manufactured more 25 years ago. Records
indicate the pistol and the rifle were purchased recently from a
Colorado gun dealer, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Colorado and federal law, a minor cannot own a handgun,
and it is illegal to give or sell a handgun to someone under 18. It
is legal for someone 18 or older to buy a handgun through a private
sale, reached through a classified advertisement or a gun show. In
contrast, federally licensed dealers are not allowed to sell
handguns to someone under 21.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, where surveys indicate that almost half of
households have guns, there are gun fairs almost every weekend. At
these shows, private sellers do not have to conduct background
checks on buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb squad investigators continued to search the grounds Monday.
Speaking with the cordoned-off school behind him, Davis said there
remained ``many, many lockers to go through, many, many backpacks
to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold, who were both seniors at Columbine, had
apparently pinned their hopes on blowing up their school to a
25-pound propane bomb in the school's kitchen that they had planned
to detonate. When the timing device failed, Davis said ``there were
indications that they had possibly tried to fire on that bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology tests on the bodies of the two youths did not show
traces of drugs or alcohol, the coroner's office said Monday. Davis
also said that investigators had not found any illicit drugs or
drug paraphernalia at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the two youths had hired lawyers and had not
spoken with investigators since last Wednesday, Davis said..
</P>
<P>
   Officials Monday also briefly addressed complaints that the
authorities had been made aware of threats by Harris, but did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Brooks Brown, a classmate of the suspects, have
disclosed that they notified the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department eight times last year with complaints that Harris, a
neighbor, had threatened their son. The couple, Randy and Judy
Brown, said that after Harris chipped the windshield of their son's
car, he created a computer game that revolved around destroying the
Brown house and created a web site that featured a death threat
against their son and accounts of manufacturing and exploding pipe
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harris and Klebold were on probation at the time,
Jefferson County detectives never followed up on the complaints,
the Browns have said. On Monday, Davis said that a ``suspicious
incident'' report had been located. Later, he added, ``This is part
of the ongoing investigation and I do not want to make any comments
about that right now.''

   Thomas said, ``As far as I know, nothing was ever brought to my
office.''

   While trading at the nation's four busiest stock exchanges came
to a halt for one minute at noon Monday in memory of the 13
victims, this Denver suburb endured a numbing marathon of funerals.
Three students and the one teacher who was killed, William Sanders,
were buried.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 people turned out for the funeral of Sander's, who
had taught and coached at the school for 25 years. Last Tuesday as
shots rang out at lunch, Sanders, a grandfather, jumped on a table
in the school cafeteria and shouted for students to duck, and then
to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running around, and I remember seeing him jumping over
the chairs and yelling `Everybody get down!''' Lindsay Dowling, a
student recalled. ``I truly believe he saved my life and many other
people's.''
</P>
<P>
   As he ran through the halls, herding students to safety, the
teacher was shot twice in the chest. After taking him into a
barricaded classroom, students tried to keep his spirits up by
showing him wallet photos of his wife and three daughters. A
teacher spent hours on a cell phone getting advice for how to care
for him, and many students have said they took off their shirts to
help mop up blood. But he died shortly after being freed by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank him for saving my life,'' Laurel Salerno,
another student who escaped the cafeteria, said in a church
overflowing with students. ``Mr. Sanders, I thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at the same time, another 1,000 mourners attended the
funeral of Cassie Bernall, a 17-year-old junior, who often wore a
bracelet inscribed ``WWJD'' _ shorthand for `What would Jesus do?'
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, one of the attackers cornered her in the library,
trained a gun on her, looked in her blue eyes, and asked if she
believed in God. After a pause, surviving students have recounted,
Miss Bernall, a born-again Christian, answered deliberately, ``Yes,
I believe in God.'' He then shot her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cassie died a martyr's death,'' the Rev. George Kristen of the
West Bowles Community Church said. ``She went to the martyr's hall
of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, a funeral was held for Lauren Townsend, an
18-year-old senior who was captain of the girls varsity volleyball
team and a National Honor Society scholar. She was to have been the
class valedictorian at graduation ceremonies next month. Monday, a
letter arrived at her home here, offering her a college
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The last funeral of the day was for Daniel Rohrbough, a
15-year-old freshman who was shot holding an exit door open for
other students. He was last seen alive running and screaming for
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures warmed in Denver, hundreds of people continued
to make somber pilgrimages to a memorial site in a park near the
high school. Many parked a half-mile away to add to the thousands
of bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 students from other high schools marched up to nine
miles to the site. Referring to the killers, one held a placard to
passing cars, ``There are more of us than there are of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a teen-ager,'' said one marcher, Morgen Warner, a junior
from Jefferson County Open School. ``This affects me more deeply
than any adult could even begin to comprehend.''

HARTSBURG IMPRESSES PLAYERS, MANAGEMENT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For four seasons, the Mighty Ducks followed
Ron Wilson down his Yellow Brick Road. In the 1997-98 season,
Pierre Page's ramblings left them on the road to nowhere. But the
team is back on the straight and narrow under coach Craig
Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Ducks stand one game away from elimination at the
hands of the Detroit Red Wings, Hartsburg's competitive juices
continue to flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have shown a lot of pride all year and we want to go
out battling and fighting,'' Hartsburg said Monday of tonight's
game. ``We have built some things with our work ethic and I don't
want anything to slip. We want to make it tough on Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, 39, won't settle for anything but a maximum effort
tonight, but then again that's what he's demanded of the Ducks
since day one of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was all business and we knew there's nothing wrong
with that,'' said Anaheim center Steve Rucchin. ``All he wants is
the best out of his team and that basically comes down to hard work
and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Directness and a good work ethic are among the traits that
Hartsburg said he learned early on from his father Bill and his
mother Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do your best, don't accept anything but your best,'' Hartsburg
said when asked their influence. ``If you can't do something to the
best of your ability, then you are cheating yourself. It doesn't
matter what it is, coaching, playing or raising my own kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks floundered to a 26-43-13 record in a confusing '97-98
season that featured numerous system changes by Page, along with
Paul Kariya's holdout and concussion. They were picked to be among
the worst teams in the league this season but surprised many by
finishing 35-34-13 and qualifying for the playoffs despite a
late-season slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be blamed for last year,'' said goalie Guy
Hebert. ``But I don't know if it would have got any better (by
maintaining the status quo).''
</P>
<P>
   Having Kariya healthy for 82 games certainly helped the cause,
as did a lack of serious injuries, but Hartsburg's simple, direct
approach was a big factor as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to win, everybody has to be on the same page
and that comes from Craig and the coaching staff (assistants Newell
Brown and George Burnett),'' said Rucchin. ``He's done a great job
of drilling into our heads how we want to play as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wilson was a media darling and big on motivational
speeches _ like the Wizard of Oz one he used late in the '96-97
season _ and Page struggled for answers from the time he was hired,
Hartsburg has stoically gone about his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team comes first (with Hartsburg),'' said Ducks general
manager Pierre Gauthier, who inherited Hartsburg after former GM
Jack Ferreira hired him on July 21, 1998. ``I'm not a big fan of
prima donna coaches because sometimes they come first. He's an
organization guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg was a loyal organization guy in Chicago, but that
didn't prevent him from being fired after the less-than-talented
Blackhawks failed to make the playoffs last season for the first
time in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not much fun because you feel you've let a lot of people
down,'' he said of being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg said he went through stages of anger and
self-evaluation, but in keeping with his approach to life, he tried
to turn a negative into a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stay angry too long, you won't progress and learn the
lesson you need to learn,'' he explained. ``Anytime you go through
adversity you learn a lot. But it's not like I had any doubts about
myself.''

BOEING STRESSES ITS VALUE TO STOCKHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The top leadership of The Boeing Co. sounded what
has become a very familiar theme here Monday when they faced
shareholders at the company's annual meeting _ value, value value.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of struggling to build a lot of airplanes and
make money at the same time, executives said Boeing is committed to
a new way of doing business that will return the aerospace giant to
the ranks of the most profitable manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new team totally focused on creating value for you,
our shareholders, for our customers, for our employees,'' Chairman
Phil Condit told shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing is a very different company from one year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But apparently many shareholders, well aware that Boeing's stock
was the worst performer on the Dow last year, are impatient with
the pace of change. That sentiment was reflected in a vote on a
shareholder proposal that called for the annual election of
Boeing's entire 12-member board.
</P>
<P>
   The same proposal was voted down by shareholders at the last two
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the proposal was supported by 49.9 percent of shares
voted, with 47.8 percent against. The remainder abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing management said later that the proposal was not approved
because it did not receive more than 50 percent of the vote. Even
if it had, Boeing said, shareholder proposals are not binding. That
would require a 75 percent approval vote to change company bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the annual meeting, Condit did say
the issue was something the company would ``look at'' in light of
the vote. But he stressed Boeing's long-held position that it is
important to have continuity on the board, and annual elections
would interfere with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business that has a very important long-term piece
to it,'' he said. ``Continuity on the board has a real advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Other shareholder proposals were soundly defeated, including one
that would have required Boeing to adopt human rights criteria
before doing business with China, and another that would have
established criteria in bidding for military contracts. Both were
submitted by church groups and both have been defeated at past
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the somewhat surprising vote on the proposal for
election of board members, the mood of shareholders also was
reflected in the applause that several received from fellow
shareholders when they stood to ask Condit questions during a
question-and-answer portion of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They asked tough questions, but most were generally supportive
of the company's new focus on value.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder Joe Bishop was applauded as much as anyone who spoke
when he told Condit:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I'm not alone in being disappointed with the
performance of the company's stock the last couple of years. But
the reason I'm still here today and haven't bailed out yet is that
I still hold the same promise for Boeing that I did when I invested
a couple years ago. From a pure business standpoint, Boeing has the
best business opportunity of any company in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   That message of value also was stressed by Debby Hopkins,
Boeing's new chief financial officer. She was the only other
executive to address shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made changes. We've moved forward with new business
opportunities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Boeing has posted a solid first quarter and
its stock is up 21 percent, which is better than the Dow averages.
But Condit and Hopkins said the company must do even better.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives announced early this year they would eliminate
``value destroying'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   One of those programs that is getting a close look is the 717,
Boeing's new 100-seater passenger jet that is built in Long Beach,
just down the road from the site of Monday's annual meeting at Los
Angeles International Airport's Westin Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is ending production in Long Beach of the McDonnell
Douglas line of planes _ the MD-90, MD-80 and MD-11. That leaves
only the 717 and the C-17, the Air Force cargo plane. The C-17 is
one of Boeing's most profitable programs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is growing concern in Long Beach the company will kill
the 717 because orders have so far been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Condit said there is a good market for a
100-seat plane, but the question remains whether the 717 program
can be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make it up as you go,'' Condit said. ``Either you
are able to sell the airplane or you are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must attack costs on the 717, he said. ``It is one of
those programs where we need to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong emphasis on value and cutting costs did raise
concerns with the leaders of the union that represents many Boeing
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its cost-cutting measures, Boeing plans to reduce
companywide employment by 50,000 by the end of next year. The
company later this year must negotiate new contracts with its two
largest unions _ the 51,000-member Machinists union and the
24,000-member Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, or SPEEA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must balance the interest of shareholders, customers and
employees if we are to retain our position as aerospace leader,''
Stan Sorscher, SPEEA chairman, told Condit.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bofferding, the union's executive director, said it is
time for the union to have a seat on Boeing's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to battle shareholders or customers for
limited resources,'' he said. ``Our goal is to fight hard to
finally balance the interests of all stakeholders (employees,
customers and shareholders.)''
</P>
<P>
   During the question-and-answer session, Condit was asked about
the upcoming union negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   He said he remains optimistic agreements can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   This marked only the second time Boeing's annual meeting has
been held outside of Seattle. It was held in St. Louis last year.
It will be held in Seattle next year. Boeing is rotating the
meeting sites to better reflect the breadth of the new Boeing Co.
following the 1997 merger with defense giant McDonnell Douglas. In
1996, Boeing also acquired the aerospace business of Rockwell
International.
