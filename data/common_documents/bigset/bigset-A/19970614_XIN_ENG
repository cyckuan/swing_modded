ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African Foreign
Minister Alfred B. Nzo emphasized here today the need for more
closer political and economic relations between Pakistan and South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the National Institute of Strategic Studies on
the topic of "Development in South and Southern Africa and the
Challenges of the 21st Century, a Perspective", Nzo said, "the
relations between Pakistan and South Africa are growing and there
is still much potential for them to grow further".
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who is on a four-day visit to Pakistan at the invitation
of his Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan, described his visit
as part of the process of strengthening the existing friendly
relations between Pakistan and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said that his visit would help further cement the cordial
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would extend its support to Pakistan to become the
member of the proposed "Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional
Cooperation".
</P>
<P>
Nzo expressed his thanks to Pakistan for extending support to
the South African people during their struggle for independence
against apartheid rule.
</P>
<P>
He said, his country believes in nuclear non-proliferation and
would extend its support to all the struggles aimed at getting rid
of this menace. He hoped that the efforts for disarmament must go
ahead.

<HEADLINE> US Producer Prices Drops for 5th Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The producer prices in the U.S.
declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in May, the fifth
consecutive month, U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drop in U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) in May followed a
0.6 percent decrease in April and marked the first time since the
gauge has declined for five months in a row in 1952.
</P>
<P>
For the year so far, U.S. producer prices have been falling at
an annual rate of 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop of PPI in May was led by a 2.1 percent fall in energy
prices, also the fifth in a row, followed a 2.6 percent decrease
in April. And decreasing energy prices also helped offset a 0.4
percent rise in food prices.
</P>
<P>
The so-called core prices -- excluding the volatile food and
energy sectors -- also declined by 0.3 percent, the largest
decrease since October 1994, resulting from price drops for autos
and trucks and computers.
</P>
<P>
Today's report was the latest evidence that inflation pressures
in the U.S. are scarcely to be found in goods-producing industries
and offered more support for a record-setting rally in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
That offers some reassurance to economists and markets that
torrid economic growth in the first three months of the year, the
fastest in a decade, has moderated.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserver (Fed) will hold a policy-making
meeting July 1-2 and some analysts now predict that the Fed may
not raise the interest rate as the economy is slowing down with
little inflation presure.

<HEADLINE> Downer Defends Australia's Hong Kong Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer issued statement today, pledging support to Hong
Kong's smooth return to China.
</P>
<P>
Australia was no longer dependent on Britain and the United
States for its foreign policy and had made up its own mind about
Hong Kong, Downer said in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is independent and is proudly independent," Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
"Gone are the days when we just simply did what the U.S. and
the U.K. said. We now stand up for our own interests in our
region.... We have to make our own name and make our own future,"
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that he had taken this attitude to underline the
support of the Australian government for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"It is not in anybody's interests that the HKSAR begins its
life in controversy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia, a country with an extensive stake in Hong Kong, will
do all it can to ensure a successful and smooth transition in Hong
Kong, so as to show its support and understanding at this
important time, Downer added.

<HEADLINE> US Business Inventories Up 0.3 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. business inventories
increased by 0.3 percent in April after a revised 0.2 percent gain
in March, The U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that auto inventories were up by 1.2 percent in
the month following a 0.2 percent gain in March. Excluding autos,
retail inventories increased by 0.6 percent in April following a
decline of 0.3 percent the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing inventories rose by 0.6 percent in April after
rising 0.2 percent a month earlier. And wholesale inventories fell
0.7 percent during April after rising 0.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that business sales also rose by
0.3 percent in April after falling 0.2 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
That was a sign of stability. If inventories were failing to
keep up with sales, it could be an inflation signal.
</P>
<P>
The combination of inventories and sales produced an
inventories-to-sales ratio of 1.37 in April, the same as in March.
It means that it would take 1.37 months to exhaust the backlog at
the April sales pace.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has appealled to the business community to make
contributions to assist former exiled youths who are unemployed
and not elegible for special struggle pensions, said a source
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement by the President's Office in Cape Town,
Mandela, who has taken the plight of South Africa's children into
heart and set up a special fund for them, had raised the
condition of former exiled youths in his recent talks with
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"This should be a matter of serious concern to society as a
whole: to ensure that these young patriots are fully integrated
into society and themselves have a stake in ensuring that South
Africa succeeds in building a better life for all," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
A leader of one large corporation, requested that the name of
the company should not be made public for the moment, had pledged
one million Rand (about 225000 US Dollar) to help the President
in this endeavour.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had asked Acting African National Congress
Secretary-General Cheryl Carolus to consult with organisations to
begin the process of establishing appropriate structures,
identifying the individuals concerned and the projects that would
need to be undertaken, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The President is confident that this small and humble step
will go some way in addressing one of the peculiar social
problems facing our society," it added.

ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African Foreign
Minister Alfred B. Nzo today called on Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari and the two exchanged views on a wide range of subjects.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Leghari emphasized the need to
further expand trade and economic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that Pakistan was a major window of opportunity to
the resource-rich Central Asian nations and invited entrepreneurs
from South Africa to take advantage of the enormous economic
potential which the region offered through joint ventures with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In the regional context, Leghari spoke about Pakistan's desire
to have tension-free and good-neighborly relations with India.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, could only be possible if the core issue of
Kashmir which bedeviled relations between the two countries was
resolved in a peaceful manner and in accordance with the U.N.
Security Council Resolutions and the wishes of the people of Jammu
and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Leghari emphasized Pakistan's strong
commitment to peace and stability in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Nzo expressed the hope that exchange of visits would strengthen
the existing relations between the two countries. He said South
Africa hoped that Pakistan and India will be able to resolve the
problems between them through peaceful manners.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Proposal on Fish Thrown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States today lost its
proposal to have a working group on marine fish species
established at the ongoing conference of the Convention on
International Trade in Endagered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
In a closely contested election, the U.S. lost by 49 to 50
votes with most countries saying it was premature to establish
the working group.
</P>
<P>
The working group, which would have been responsible for
marine fish and invertebrate species subject to international
trade, would have included small and large fishing nations that
were parties to the CITES, the Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO), regional fisheries management and conservation
organisations to champion issues concerning marine fishing.
</P>
<P>
Hiromisa Isa, who headed the Japanese delegation on marine
fisheries, said, "it's premature and unnecessary to establish the
working group now because that is already being looked after by
FAO and not CITES."

<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook says Hong Kong should be a bridge and not a barrier between
Britain and China after its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
With only 17 days left for Hong Kong's return to China, Cook,
in his article carried in The Times newspaper today, said the
return of Hong Kong to China "marks no end of Britain's engagement
with Hong Kong and China, but a new beginning."
</P>
<P>
"I have made it clear that Hong Kong should be a bridge, not a
barrier, between Britain and China. A stable and prosperous Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region would then be at the center of
a more constructive relationship with China," said Cook, who is to
accompany Prince Charles and Prime Minister Tony Blair to Hong
Kong for the return ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We saw a successful transition of Hong Kong, on the basis of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, as one of our highest
priorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that Britain has substantial economic interests
in Hong Kong and China's inland areas which the new Labor
government is pledged to promote.
</P>

"It is both in Britain's and China's interests that Hong Kong
should remain prosperous," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Supports Controlled Trade in Rhino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today voiced support
for a strictly controlled legal trade in rhino horn and other
products saying that would reduce illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
George Hughes, chief executive of the natal parks board in the
South African province of Kwazulu-Natal, gave a lengthy
presentation at the ongoing 10th conference of the CITES in
Harare, arguing that the availability of a legal source of rhino
horn would provide a strong disincentive to consumers to purchase
horn on the black market.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has a southern white rhino population of
between 7,200 and 7,500, is proposing that restrictions
preventing international trade in rhino and other products be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade ban had not been effective in providing
protection for rhinos.
</P>
<P>
He added only those populations that have been effectively
protected and managed have maintained their numbers or increased.
</P>
<P>
But, the International Environmental Investigation Agency
(EIA) has called for the outright rejection of the proposal by
South Africa, saying it would have a number of negative
consequences, including directly threatening all other species of
rhino both in Africa and Asia.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Multimedia Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The lower house of the German
parliament, the Bundestag, today approved a controversial
multimedia law designed to govern commercial on-line services
through the international computer network Internet.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians of the Bonn's ruling parties said the law
would provide a useful legal tool to strengthen data protection
and block the distribution of pornography and material that
glorifies violence over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
What is unique internationally is that the law would provide
protection for the so-called digital signature to ensure personal
identities vital for on-line services like home-banking and
home-shopping.
</P>
<P>
Private certification units under state supervision would be
charged with the tasks to prove the genuineness of the digital
seals on demand.
</P>
<P>
The law also makes it more clear who is legally liable when
forbidden material, like pornography or propaganda provoking
ethnic hatred, becomes available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Internet services providers will shoulder full
responsibility for the content of their own services. And if their
services were used by customers to provides the forbidden
material, the providers would only be held responsible when they
know the content in advance and do nothing to block the material
when it is technically possible.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members of the main opposition in Bonn, the Social
Democratic Party (SPD), abstained from voting on the law, saying
that it is not powerful enough to put private enterprises under
control. Another opposition party, the Greens, voted against the
law, saying that it would undermine the international
competitiveness of German enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The law also faces strong opposition from German Internet
services providers who warn that the legislation could put their
business in even greater legal danger and force them to move their
operations to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The multimedia law is still scheduled to be voted on July 4 in
the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, where the
SPD controls a majority.

<P>
Eleven speakers from Australia, China, South Korea, Malaysia

marketing mix, creates benefits for all. Business improves the

<HEADLINE> Attack and Capture of Towns Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Somali factions have expressed
mixed reactions over yesterday's invasion by Ethiopian forces
in the border region of Gedom.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hussein Mohamed Aidid's government has
condemned the attack and the capture of Luq and Bulo Hawo towns
today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Mr Abikar Sheikh Hussein Qallim has
characterized the invasion as intolerable and a deliberate
violation on the territorial integrity of Somalia. Mr Qalli has
called the United Nations and the JOAU to take the necessary
actions against the Ethiopian aggression.
</P>
<P>
In a different statement, the deputy chairman of Ali Mahdi's
faction has ruled out any foreign involvement in the Gedo region
affairs. Dr Hussein Haji Ahmed Bod said the fighting has occurred
between the forces of Al-Itihad and the local militiamen loyal to
the Somali National Front (SNF) belonging to Marehan clan.
</P>
<P>
Dr Dob has faulted the Al-Itihad Al-Islam for distabilizing
Gedo region and displacing many civilians. He also said that
there are foreign Muslim militants accompanying the Al-Itihad men
in what he called the distabilization of the region.
</P>
<P>
However, initial reports coming from the occupied towns of Luq
and Bulo Hawo spoke about some casualties during the raid. At
least 12 people were killed of whom 8 were women in Jalabib
Islamic gowns during the first clashes in Bulo Hawo yesterday.
Loyalists of Al-Itihad also reported that the Ethiopians have
carried out abduction of men wearing beards and rape in Luq town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members from the executive committee of the Somali
National Front in Mogadishu have declined that any Ethiopian
troops were involved in the fighting in Gedo region yesterday.
The members including engineer Hassan Jama Hussein and Sheikh
Ibrahim Hosh Farah told the journalists that it was the SNF
forces who took over the two towns and their surrounding
villages. The members have called the remaining members of
Al-Itihad to surrender their weapons to the forces of SNF.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the militiamen of Al-Itihad Al-Islam
have been regrouping themselves 20 km east of Luq town. A number
of lorries transporting refugees who fled the fighting in the
region have also reached Mogadishu today. The refugees have
confirmed the presence of uniformed Ethiopian soldiers and their
tanks in Luq town and have also seen jet fighter planes on
surveillance around the town, but did not spoke about any
bombardment by the planes.

<HEADLINE> Cinema Fire Toll Rises to 50 in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 50 people were killed and
about 200 injured in a stampede triggered by a devastating fire
that swept through a packed cinema hall during a matinee show in a
posh New Delhi area today, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at 17:10 hours local time.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 firemen fought for over two hours to control the
blaze suspected to have been caused by a transformer blast in the
basement of the theater.
</P>
<P>
The toll is likely to go up as a number of injured have been
taken to various hospitals in serious condition across the city.
</P>
<P>
police claimed that the toll could have been much higher but
for the fact that the ushers quickly opened the four exit gates.
</P>
<P>
Police said oil in the transformer led to rapid spread of the
blaze. Twenty-four vehicles parked in the cinema campus were
gutted in the fire.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Fail to Reach Compromise over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany today failed to
reach a compromise over the Stability Pact for the future European
single currency, three days away from the European Union (EU)
Amsterdam summit which is supposed to ratify the pact.
</P>
<P>
"A modification of the Stability Pact is excluded," said
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a press conference after the
summit held in Poitiers, southcentral France, the first since the
Socialist government of France came to power.
</P>
<P>
He said that discussions would continue "intensively" between
French and German officials this weekend, and that Bonn was
"sure" that the two sides would find a solution to the dispute
after the discussions.
</P>
<P>
France wishes to add clauses on job and economic growth into
the Stability Pact, which authorizes EU to impose heavy fines upon
any future European single currency country for excessive budget
spending.
</P>
<P>
"The Stability Pact is buckled. This is a fact," said Kohl.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac said that he would expect experts to
work out the details for solving the difference with Germany,
while French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that the ideas
presented by France on adding a social volume into the pact should
be on the table of the Amsterdam summit.
</P>
<P>
Jospin denied that France wanted to force its ideas through the
pact and said that it is necessary to "respond to the demands of
the people who make up the European Union."
</P>
<P>
"The (French) government supports the single currency. It
supports that this single currency be realized on a foreseen
date," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
But he added that "our economies cannot respond to the demands
of our people" only through monetary means.
</P>
<P>
"If one goes back to what are the foundations themselves of
the European Community which became then the European Union, the
dimensions of growth, the dimensions of employment, of fight
against unemployment, the need of concentration on the order of
economic policies, these are the demands," he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Needs Five Years to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- It will take Angola at least five
years to rid itself of poverty, Bernard Ntegeye, resident
representative in Angola of the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), said here in Luanda today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to press circles on occasion of issuing a human
development report for 1997 by the UNDP, Ntegeye said that the
human development index in Angola has increased from 0.283 in
1996 to 0.337 in 1997, and the prospect to raise social welfare
is very broad. This plus Angola's vast territory and rich natural
resources will enable the country eradicate its poverty in a
short period of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, to eradicate poverty, some prerequisites are also
required, such as the consolidation of peace, the restoration of
war damaged infrastructures, the reconstruction of the country
and an explicit policy and plan for eradicating poverty, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will work together with the Angolan statistical
bureau for the publication of a report on the poverty situation
of the country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 60 percent of the people in the
country were living in dire poverty in 1995.

<HEADLINE> UK Stonehenge Plan to Be Abandoned Due to Lack of Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Because of the lack of money, the
plan to improve the site of Britain's biggest tourist attraction,
the prehistoric monument of Stonehenge, will have to be abandoned,
a senior English Heritage official said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely disappointed" at the decision of the
Millenium Commission not to finance the plan, chairman of English
Heritage, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, said at a news conference. The
English Heritage is responsible for the Stonehenge improvement
project.
</P>
<P>
Because of the decision of The Millenium Commission, one of the
bodies which distributes lottery funds, a 43 million pound (70
million US dollars) plan to expand the site of the mysterious
monument in southwest England and build a high-tech visitor center
will not be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Stonehenge is a circle of giant stones, dating from about 2,800
BC, which stand on their ends. Some still have huge stone lintels
lying across the top and an "altar stone" at the open northeast
side of the circle faces the rising sun.
</P>
<P>
Stevens said he believed part of the reason for the
commission's decision was its unhappiness with the private
financing of part of the project by Tussauds Group, part of the
Pearson media and leisure group.
</P>
<P>
"I was led to believe the Millenium Commission was discomfited
by the private finance element because it involved a profit," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tussauds had agreed to invest 10 million pounds in the project
and to operate the visitor center which would explain the history
of Stonehenge and the many other prehistoric monuments around the
site. Tussauds had planned to make its profit from entrance fees
to the center, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Partner Countries Defense Ministers Meet at New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers of the 16 NATO
states met on Friday in Brussels for the first time with their
counterparts from the alliance's 27 partner countries in the
framework of the newly established Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council(EAPC).
</P>
<P>
The EAPC was formally launched two weeks ago in Sintra,
Portugal, at NATO's foreign ministers' meeting, with the aim of
promoting the political dialogue and military cooperation between
NATO states and their partner countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana briefed
the defense ministers from partner countries on the outcome of
NATO's defense ministers' meeting on Thursday, and the ministers
reviewed the development of the practical cooperation activities,
in the framework of Partnership for Peace(PfP) Program, taken
place in the past year.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for the ministers (from NATO and
partner countries) to discuss in depth the military cooperation in
the enhanced Partnership for Peace(PfP) Program," a NATO
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that from now on partner countries would be
actively involved in both planning and implementation of the PfP
activities, and NATO-led peacekeeping missions "right from the
beginning".
</P>
<P>
The ministers praised at the meeting the accomplishments of the
NATO-led peacekeeping force, SFOR, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to
which 15 partner nations contributed, and stressed the need fully
to implement the Bosnia peace accord.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion on the issue of NATO enlargement,
Slovenian defense minister Turnsek Tit and his Romanian
counterpart Victor Babiuc expressed their countries'
disappointment about Thursday's announcement by the United States
that it wanted only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to be
in NATO's first expansion, leaving outside Romania and Slovenia
which were strongly supported by a majority of NATO's European
alllies, including France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
"It is unlogical to exclude candidate countries which have
already met the accession criteria to joint in the first group,"
Mr Tit was quoted by a NATO official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We hope NATO's open door will open again," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The consensus on which countries will be admitted in the first
wave of the alliance's planned expansion into Eastern Europe is
expected to be reached at the end of this month, the same official
said.
</P>
<P>
Those countries will then receive the formal invitation, at
NATO's summit meeting in Madrid on July 8-9, to start accession
negotiations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the meeting, Mr Solana reaffirmed
that NATO's door would remain open after the first wave of
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"Madrid will not be about winners and losers, all those who
wish to join NATO will have many opportunities to engage actively
with NATO to prepare for the moment when they are ready to join,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to today's defense ministers' meeting, Secretary General
Solana has held a short separate meeting with the first deputy
defense minister of Russia, Mr Andrei Kokoshin.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which is described by NATO officials as "a
good one", Mr Kokoshin is said to have told Mr Solana that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was "enthusiastic" to see the early
implementation of "all the aspects" of the Russia-NATO Act signed
by the two sides last month.

ADDIS ABABA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Spraying of pesticide against
army-worm infestation which broke out in seven districts of the
Amhara region is well underway, the Ethiopian News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the regional agricultural bureau, the pesticide

protecting crops such as maize, sorghum and millet against the
pest.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said 36,800 kg of pesticide and 470 spraying
equipment will not be sufficient if the weather remains conducive
for the breeding of the army-worm.
</P>
<P>
The bureau called on administrative bodies and agricultural
professionals to actively involve in the campaign and said aid
organizations active in the region should render extra spraying
appliances and transportation facilities in the effort to
containing the plague.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Believes in Future of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here today that Hong Kong will continue to be dynamic
economic and financial center as it has been until now.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Annan said that China's
policy of "one country, two systems" toward Hong Kong is a very
wise policy, which allows Hong Kong to operate the way it has
done.
</P>
<P>
With the policy of "one country, two systems" to be applied in
Hong Kong, everybody will gain -- the people live in Hong Kong and
other parts of China and the people in the rest of the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since China's economy is dynamic and China itself goes through
progressive and dynamic changes, Hong Kong will remain a dynamic
center.
</P>
<P>
On Chinese government resuming the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong on coming July 1, he said it is a historical occasion.
He himself will be there to witness the transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
On the smooth transition of power, he said that the Chinese and
British governments have handled the issue very well and set a
good example for other regions to solve disputes through dialogue
and discussions.
</P>
<P>
"It is always better to settle the territorial question through
dialogue and negotiation rather than through military means," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
As there are a lot of conflicts over territory and over
boarder, he stressed, "It has also set a good example for other
regions of the world to realize that it is possible to solve
disputes through dialogue and discussions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that in addition to Hong Kong, Macao will also become
a part of China in a few years.
</P>
<P>
"These are historical developments managed in peaceful and

<P>
ANKARA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today announced the
withdrawal of its Ambassador to Tripoli Ates Balkan to protest
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's "provocative" statements against
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement said that this decision will not
affect the friendship with Libya, but calling Tripoli to
appreciate "the values of countries who are friends to Libya."
</P>
<P>
Addressing public in northern coastal city of Derna Wednesday,
Gaddafi said the Turkish army is ruled by Jews and Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan is not aware that the Turkish army has carried
out a cross-border military operation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Launching condemnation, Turkish deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said "Gaddafi's inappropriate
expressions are not in harmony with the rules of respect and
politeness of international relations."
</P>
<P>
"We strongly regret Gaddafi's expressions," she said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Congress' Stand on Jerusalem Sparks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. congress' vote
recognizing Jerusalem as the "undivided and permanent" capital of
Israel sparked anger and condemnation of Lebanon's religious and
politician leaders today.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding resolution, which was adopted by the House of
Representatives of the United States Wednesday, also approved the
allocation of 100 million dollars to move the U.S. embassy from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Momammed Rashid Qabani, Mufti of the Republic of
Lebanon, described the U.S. house vote as an "obvious call for war
rather than peace and a deceit for the Arab."
</P>
<P>
It "indicates the degree of the American support for the
Israeli occupation in Palestine," said the Muslim Sunni spiritual
leader.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "exposes the Israeli and American intentions
against the Arab and encourages Israel to aggravate oppression
and terrorism against the Palestinian people inside the occupied
Palestine, and escalate threat against the Arab especially
Lebanon and Syria," Qabani said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohammed Mahdi Shamsddin, spiritual leader of the
Muslim Shiite community in Lebanon, stressed that the vote made
Arabs, both Muslims and Christians, and non-Arabs "lose all their
confidence in the United States' role as a just and neutral broker
in the Arab-Israeli conflict."
</P>
<P>
"We say the Holy City (of Jerusalem) is Arab and the capital of
the Palestinian people, and the Holy City is Muslim and Christian
and is Jewish as well, but it is not Israeli," the Muslim Shiite
religious leader said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Khalil, chairman of the parliamentary committee for
foreign affairs, noted that the U.S. house resolution "destroies
the Middle East peace process and blows up what is left of hope in
a resumption of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians, who see Jerusalem as
the capital of their future state, and the Israelis have been
stalemated since three months ago when Israel began to construct a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. house's resolution "should be confronted by a real
Arab solidarity reaffirming our right of resisting the occupation
and working to eliminate it," Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the vote, Beirut's largest-circulated daily
An-Nahar accused the United States of "escalating the battle for
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's columnist described the resolution as
"shocking" because "for the first time in history it recognizes
Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Pro-Syrian daily Ash-Sharq said that "Washington has sold, to
the Jews, a capital which does not belong to the Americans in the
first place."
</P>
<P>
It said that "once again, the United States has exceeded all
limits and unfairly appointed itself as a trustee over a region
which is thousands of miles away from America," adding "the
Americans have heightened tension in the region."

<HEADLINE> California's Ties with Asia-Pacific Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 13 (Xinhua)--California, an American state
with the world's seventh largest economy, has been playing a
unique role in the country with an Atlantic-based economy shifting
to the Pacific-based, a seminar here was told.
</P>
<P>
Matt Fong, California's state treasurer, was speaking to a
group of business leaders and decision makers from the public and
private sectors attending a trade forum highlighting Hong Kong
beyond 1997.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the shifting center of gravity, Fong said that 33
percent of the country's exported goods this year went to the
Pacific region as compared with 24 percent going to Europe, while
35 percent of the imported products coming from the Pacific as
against 19 percent from Europe.
</P>
<P>
In California, he said, one out of seven or eight jobs is
related to the Pacific trade and investment. Within five years,
the ratio will become one out of four, he added.
</P>
<P>
California boasts the largest Asian-Pacific population in the
United States. This highly diverse population possessing valuable
language, entrepreneurial and cultural skills, Fong said, is a
resource of ideas and deals and brings opportunities for the
state.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer said that California has more money in the form
of pension funds than any other state, which can be transferred
into investments in Asian countries with strong returns. With the
money we have we should position California as the Wall Street for
the Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking more directly on the theme of the forum, Fong said
that Hong Kong will remain an important place for Californians to
make investments with strong returns.
</P>
<P>
Other participants at the forum shared the view that Hong
Kong's return to China will ultimately be a leveling of the
Asia-Pacific trade playing field.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a recent trip to Shanghai, Fong said that the
dream of developing the metropolitan into a world-class financial
center could come true "within our lifetime."
</P>
<P>
Voicing his support for President Clinton's move to renew
China's MFN status, Fong said that Hong Kong buys three billion US
dollar products a year from California. Failure of MFN will
directly impair California's exporters, said the treasurer, adding
that as a result many working families will lose their jobs and
consumers will have to pay more.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States today told
the Baltic state of Latvia that it had a chance of joining the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) after the first wave of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said it wanted only
the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to be NATO's first new
members.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is an integrated Europe. That goal embraces Latvia,"
said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright before meeting
Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs.
</P>
<P>
"NATO cannot advance promises of membership but we are
committed to a process that will help all aspiring nations
understand what they must do to make membership a possibility,"
Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She added that the U.S. has made it clear that NATO will remain
open to all European countries that are able to contribute to its
goals.
</P>
<P>
Birkavs expressed his country's appreciation of the U.S.
announcement. "We fully support this major step in a process that
has to remain, and we are sure will remain, inclusive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latvia "firmly" believes that NATO enlargement will not be
complete until the Baltic states are members of the alliance,
Birkavs added.
</P>
<P>
Insisting it would threaten its national security, Russia
strongly opposed the joining of the Baltic states in the alliance.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Coupists Increasingly Isolated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chang Yong)
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The military coup leader who came
to power in Sierra Leone has become increasingly isolated both
internally and internationally, the Nigerian Television Authority
(NTA) reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Denied by the United Nations, rejected by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and shunned by the
international community, the ruling junta was also opposed by the
local people.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want them (the military regime)," said a women in a
crowded street in the capital Freetown, shown by the NTA.
</P>
<P>
"The junta is threatening the country and causing bleeding,"
said Pious Foray, a local journalist being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
Parliament member Ibrahim Sorrie shared similar view, saying
he believed "at the end of some day, there will be a victory in
the country, not a victory for President Kabbah, not for the
ECOWAS, not for the military, but for the common sense of the
people."
</P>
<P>
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday
renewed his call for the Sierra Leonean military regime to step
down, saying the coup leaders cannot possibly cling to power in
the face of international isolation.
</P>
<P>
Annan hoped that the threat of force and the current efforts
to seek a negotiated resolution of the conflict would convince
them to return power to the country's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Junior Sierra Leonean army officers, allied with rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), toppled the elected civilian
government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in a coup on May
25, forcing him to flee to neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The coup, the third in the country in five years, has
attracted an unprecedented international condemnation, and the
16-member sub-regional organization ECOWAS has vowed to reverse
it by force if the coupists failed to give up power.
</P>
<P>
Military clashes are still going on between the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force and the coupists while negotiations continued
for a peaceful resolution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, government and private sector employees defied
the military's repeated calls and continued their peaceful
strike, while schools, colleges, hospitals, banks and other
commercial houses remained closed.
</P>
<P>
This was "a vivid manifestation of opposition to the military
takeover", according to Sorrie, who is also secretary of a
four-member cross-party mediation team made up of
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
The team also advocated for the formation of a broad-based
government of national unity including all political parties
represented in parliament, the RUF and other interest groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Federal jurors returned to the
courthouse in Denver, Colorado, Friday for a second day of
deliberations on whether Timothy McVeigh should be executed for
the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The panel of seven men and five women deliberated for nearly
five hours Thursday, and worked another two hours today before
attorneys were called into court for a closed-door session with
the judge.
</P>
<P>
It was unknown whether the unsequestered jury was called out of
the deliberation room or whether the judge responded in writing.
U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch has decided not to handle jury
questions in open court, as is typical, and ordered attorneys not
to discuss jury questions.
</P>
<P>
Matsch, who has tried to protect jurors' privacy by sealing
their names and putting up a wall to shield them in the courtroom,
has yet to counsel them on how to deal with the media.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's penalty-phase closing arguments, prosecutor Beth
Wilkinson called the April 19, 1995, slaughter of 168 innocent
men, women and children
</P>
<P>
The jury's options are to sentence McVeigh to death or life in
prison without parole, or to authorize the judge to come up with
any sentence besides death. The jury's vote on any of these must
be unanimous. If the jurors can't agree, the judge will sentence
McVeigh to a penalty other than death.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 165 million U.S. dollar credit to the government
of India to help fight widespread malaria.
</P>
<P>
The project introduces a new approach to malaria control which
will help reduce deaths, disability and the heavy economic and
social toll associated with the disease.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 million people in high-risk districts, especially
those living tribal and rural areas, will directly benefit from
the project.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted by certain
mosquitoes. There are more than 3 million cases in the southern
Asian country each year.
</P>
<P>
The project will help India create an enhanced and more
effective malaria control program that uses a better mix of
effective malaria control interventions, which are responsive to
local needs.
</P>
<P>
The project will begin phasing in seven states: Gujarat,
Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Bihar and Orissa, and
Andhra Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is estimated at 204 million dollars. In
addition to the World Bank's credit, which will be channeled
through the bank's concessionary lending arm -- the International
Development Association, the Indian government will finance some
39 million dollars.

<P>
ANKARA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said today that Turkey should resolve its present political crisis
within the framework of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remark at a press conference here amid
intensive and extensive criticism of the government's weakness in
checking the rapid expansion of Muslim fundamentalism in the
secular Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The president said that any political differences can be
debated in detail, but the democratic system and the state itself
must be respected.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller has
demanded Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan hand over his
post by June 18, or her True Path Party will withdraw from the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces held a press
conference Wednesday and blasted Erbakan's tolerance for
fundamentalist force in the country.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the press conference is an ultimatum to the
Erbakan-led coalition government, Demirel said that what has been
done is "just a briefing."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question regarding the anti-fundamentalist
measures adopted by the National Security Council in February, the
Turkish president said these measures should be strictly carried
out, adding "If this (Erbakan's) government does not do it,
another government will do it."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has agreed to transfer his premiership, but on
condition of a change of the election law.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who leads the junior coalition partner True Path Party,
said on Thursday that the only solution to the current dilemma is
to hold an early election.
</P>
<P>
Although rumors about a possible military coup are described as
overstated, informed sources here said that Erbakan's coalition
government's collapse is imminent.

<HEADLINE> EU, US Reach Agreement to Cut Red Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and the United
States have reached a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) which
will cut red tape, reduce costs and shorten delays in the
marketing of European products in America and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
The MRA with the U.S. covers well over 40 billion U.S. dollars
worth of trans-Atlantic trade a year in some of the most important
sectors for the future -- telecommunications equipment, medical
devices and pharmaceuticals, as well as electromagnetic
compatibility and electrical safety.
</P>
<P>
Through the MRA, a product tested and approved in Europe to
U.S. quality and safety standards will automatically be ready for
sale in the U.S. without having to undergo a second round of U.S.
certification procedures.
</P>
<P>
The EU notes that the MRA will substantially cut the time it
takes to launch new products, ranging from mobile phones and
computers to drugs and tomographic X-ray systems.
</P>
<P>
"The MRA has been one of the crowning achievements of the new
trans-Atlantic relationship so far. It has assured that in real,
concrete ways the EU and the U.S. can work together to bring
benefits to business and consumers," said Sir Leon Brittan, EU
commissioner for external trade.
</P>
<P>
The MRA between the two sides is expected to be formally
initialed next week. A separate MRA has been reached with Canada.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide 300 Mln Dlrs for Brazil's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 300 million U.S. dollar loan for Brazil's
federal highway rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
The project will transfer responsibility of the national
highways to state governments to improve their maintenance,
increase private sector participation in their management, and
strengthen the technical capacity of the states' road departments
and the National Roads Department.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed to enhance human capital and
infrastructure development, the two bottlenecks in the country's
social and economic development. It also places emphasis on the
deregulation and privatization of infrastructure services,
efficient allocation of resources in the public sector, and
rebuilding and expansion of a deteriorated and inefficient highway
network in partnership with the private sector.

LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Shares on Europe's major stock
markets hit an all-time high today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index was driven to its third record close
this week by the U.S. stock market's rise and by fresh domestic
bid activity which helped boost investor confidence. The FTSE-100
closed at 4,783.1, up 25.7 points. This was up 161.80 from last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, equities ended trade at a record closing high,
lifted by Wall Street's strongest bull run in history and after a
firm dollar propelled the equity market higher. The DAX-30 index
closed at 3,744.44, up 36.45 points. This was up 49.15 on the
week.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse surged 1.75 percent to close at an all-time
high. Traders said comments from the German-French summit, which
made progress on a European Union budget stability pact, helped
push up the market. The CAC-40 index closed up 48.25 points at
2,808.52, a rise of 89.27 from last week.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Calls for British Envoy's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash today said he is not optimistic over Britain's mediation
in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival here, Denktash expressed the hope
that British Envoy David Hannay will hold an equal attitude towards
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"Their duty is to listen to us and assist the U.N. Secretary
General (Kofi Annan), but not to give orders," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan extended his invitations to Denktash and Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides Wednesday to hold direct meeting in New
York on July 9.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Turkish Foreign Ministry Under-secretary Onur
Oymen met with Hannay, who was shuttling among Cyprus, Greece and
Turkey on mediation mission, to discuss the upcoming Cyprus peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Oymen told the press that that Turkey and
Britain share common views regarding the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Britain and Greece are the three guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of the
republic.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Hannay said that there will not be a rapid
conclusion to the New York talks, adding that the breakdown of
barriers will certainly be a slow and long process.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the Island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash had two U.N.-sponsored informal meetings
in Nicosia in October, 1994, which ended in a deadlock. The two
men have not met directly ever since.

<HEADLINE> Italy Won't Miss Single Currency Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 14 (xinhua) -- Italy will not miss entry into the
European single currency in 1999, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said today.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a serious blow for everyone if we missed that
target by the established deadline," Dini said in Venice.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that it would be easier for European
Union countries to get their accounts in order for the single
currency if they were given one year more for preparations
</P>
<P>
"As I said some time ago, if we had had an extra year, it would
have been easier on everyone. The latest developments in Italy and
France show that this would have been helpful," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union set the date for establishing the single
currency at January 1, 1999, forcing its member states to carry
out structural adjustments, principally in budgets, which Dini
said had naturally caused sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Dini said all European countries are willing to fight
unemployment. He was apparently responding to France's new
government's insistence that the stability pact, which was
intended to ensure compliance with the Maastricht parameters
following the start-up of the euro, should be accompanied by a
resolution on jobs and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Italian job market, like that of France and Germany,
suffers from too many restrictions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must eliminate the barriers to entering certain key sectors
of the economy still dominated by corporations and corporativism,"
said minister.

<HEADLINE> Michalczewski to Give up a Boxing Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Newly crowned WBO, IBF and WBA light
heavyweight champion Dariusz Michalczewski will give up one of his
titles within the week, his promoter said in Duesseldorf, Germany,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The German became the first man in history to own the WBA, IBF
and WBO titles in his weight class with a stunning 12-round upset
of Virgil Hill Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Michalczewski, the undefeated WBO champion, took away the other
two titles from Hill by pounding out a unanimious one-sided
decision over the American.
</P>
<P>
But the German's promoter, Klaus-Peter Kohl, said Michalczewski
may give up the IBF title since No. 1 challenger William Guthrie
has won a court ruling for a championship fight by July 19th.
</P>
<P>
Michalczewski also doesn't want to fight twice within 45 days,
the promoter added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Generals Moved Aside Over Somalia Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Italian generals, who were former
commanders of Italian troops on the peacekeeping mission in
Somalia, have been relieved of their current duties following
allegations that their troops tortured and killed civilian Somalis.
</P>
<P>
General Bruno Loi and General Carmine Fiore had asked to be
allowed to step down so as to "ease and speed up the investigation
underway", a statement from the office of the Army Chief of Staff
said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the Army Chief of Staff had "accepted the
request in order to contribute with the utmost determination to a
swift clarification of the affair".
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi announced Friday the
setting up of a joint civilian and military commission to launch a
full inquiry into the torture allegation raised by the news
magazine, Panorama.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the magazine first published reports about the
allegation of torture of Somalis by a former soldier.
</P>
<P>
Fresh reports, including photographs and interviews with two
more former soldiers, followed on Friday, adding two more
allegations of purported sexual violence against a Somali woman
and alleged killings of unarmed Somalis by the army.
</P>
<P>
General Loi, who headed the Italian forces in the United
States-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia from 1992 to 1993, said
today that he decided to put himself at the full disposal of the
Chief of Staff, "with the aim of easing and speeding up the work
of the commission".
</P>
<P>
Loi was replaced by General Fiore in Somalia, who led the
Italian troops there until their withdrawal in early 1994.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Asks Turkey to Withdraw Troops From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Istanbul (TURKEY), June 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal El-Ganzouri said here today that Turkey must withdraw its
troops from northern Iraq as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan in
Istanbul, Ganzouri, who is to attend the D-8 Group summit to be
held Sunday, said that Turkey should end its cross-border military
incursion in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops launched a
massive military operation on May 14 in a bid to wipe out the
rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the region.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Erbakan, said that Turkey sent troops to northern
Iraq in order to destroy the PKK camps there.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PKK rebels always infiltrate into Turkey
from northern Iraq to kill innocent Turks in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister reiterated that the Turkish
incursion followed a request for help by Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
Turkey respects Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity
both in history and now, stressed the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said: "Turkey will withdraw its troops from northern
Iraq when the target is achieved."
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that
Turkey has withdrawn some of the 50,000-strong troops, who are
still carrying out its campaign in the region.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian diplomatic sources, who declined to be named, told
Xinhua that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak did not come to
Istanbul to attend the D-8 Group summit in a protest over
Turkey's military incursion in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has repeatedly criticized Turkey for launching a
massive military operation in pursuit of the PKK guerrillas in
northern Iraq, saying Turkey's action violated Iraq's independence
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak has attempted to ask his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel to explain his country's military
operation in northern Iraq on his planned Cairo tour in April,
which was unexpectedly canceled at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Realising Egypt's dissatisfaction with Turkey' latest military
operation against PKK, Turkish State Minister Abdullah Gul, as
the presidential envoy, flew earlier to Cairo to persuade the
Egyptian leader to attend the D-8 Group summit.

<HEADLINE> Gala Charity Dinner Marks Completion of HKCEC Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A gala charity dinner catering
2,800 people was held here today to celebrate the completion of
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC) Extension,
the venue for the handover ceremony at midnight on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(HKTDC), the Community Chest of Hong Kong and the HKCEC, the
dinner was the first major event held in the extension.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the occasion, HKTDC Chairman Dr Victor Fung said,
"Little more than three years ago, where you are all sitting was a
tract of water. In those three years, under millions of pairs of
watchful eyes, we have created a new landmark for our city."
</P>
<P>
The HKTDC was entrusted by the Hong Kong government in March
1994 to develop the 4.8-billion-HK-dollar (615 million US dollars)
project, covering reclamation and construction.
</P>
<P>
The expanded HKCEC will strengthen Hong Kong's lead as the
trade fair and convention capital of Asia well into the next
century, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
"With capacity more than doubled, we can at last meet pent-up
demand for space at the HKCEC. Overnight, we can double the size
of our largest trade fairs and accommodate many new world-class
exhibitions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by an image of a bird soaring into the sky, the
low-rise complex is a dramatic contrast against the backdrop of
skyscrapers on Hong Kong Island's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
"It is no accident that the architectural design for the
Extension was inspired by the power and grace of flight, a sense
of soaring. For that, truly, is how we see Hong Kong in the coming
century -- a city on the ascent, soaring confidently into the
future," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa was invited to the 227-table
dinner, which is expected to raise some seven million HK dollars
(897,000 US dollars) for local charity services.
</P>
<P>
"Very soon, on July 1, the whole world's attention is going to
focus on this magnificent new Extension where the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region will be inaugurated," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Here is where I will be sworn in as the first Chief Executive
of HKSAR, and here is where we will witness a new dawn for Hong
Kong. This building is, indeed, a new symbol for a new era -- one
in which I believe Hong Kong will reach even greater heights,"
Tung concluded.

watchful eyes, we have created a new landmark for our city."
</P>
<P>
The HKTDC was entrusted by the Hong Kong government in March
1994 to develop the 4.8-billion-HK-dollar (615 million US dollars)
project, covering reclamation and construction.
</P>
<P>
The expanded HKCEC will strengthen Hong Kong's lead as the
trade fair and convention capital of Asia well into the next
century, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
"With capacity more than doubled, we can at last meet pent-up
demand for space at the HKCEC. Overnight, we can double the size
of our largest trade fairs and accommodate many new world-class
exhibitions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by an image of a bird soaring into the sky, the
low-rise complex is a dramatic contrast against the backdrop of
skyscrapers on Hong Kong Island's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
"It is no accident that the architectural design for the
Extension was inspired by the power and grace of flight, a sense
of soaring. For that, truly, is how we see Hong Kong in the coming
century -- a city on the ascent, soaring confidently into the
future," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa was invited to the 227-table
dinner, which is expected to raise some 7 million HK dollars
(897,000 US dollars) for local charity services.
</P>
<P>
"Very soon, on July 1, the whole world's attention is going to
focus on this magnificent new Extension where the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region will be inaugurated," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Here is where I will be sworn in as the first Chief Executive
of HKSAR, and here is where we will witness a new dawn for Hong
Kong. This building is, indeed, a new symbol for a new era -- one
in which I believe Hong Kong will reach even greater heights,"
Tung concluded.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Businessmen Criticize Proposed Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Some leading chambers and trade
bodies in Bangladesh expressed their appreciation on the steps for
poverty alleviation in the proposed budget, but were critical
about the measures for the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the Federation of Bangladesh
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) hailed some proposals,
such as housing fund for the elderly poor, old age pension and
Employment Bank, in the proposed national budget of the fiscal
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
However, the imposition of 2.5 percent surcharge on all imports
would adversely affect the pace of industrialization, said FBCCI
President Abdullah Harun in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the new tax proposal on cotton and textile machinery
should be reconsidered as it would seriously discourage the
entrepreneurs, said the President, who was also critical of the
proposals for enhancing the duty on the import of scrap ship.
</P>
<P>
In another statement, the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (MCCI) said the industrial growth showed a massive
decline in 1996-97 fiscal year, but no remedial measures were
taken and this had not been addressed in the budget.
</P>
<P>
The chamber also expressed its disappointment over the absence
of new incentives to boost export.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest shortcoming of the budget, is that it has
significantly neglected the industrial sector in spite of the fact
that this sector registered the least growth, 3.6 percent,
compared to a double digit growth two years ago," said a statement
from the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).
</P>
<P>
The agro-based industries, which have large domestic and export
potentials, have also been neglected, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Accused of Smuggling Ivory Into Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Diplomats have been accused of
smuggling ivory into Japan, the world's largest consumer of
elephant ivory, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The International Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA)
which is an active participant at the ongoing 10th conference of
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) in Harare said 46 seizures of illegal ivory imports had
been made in Japan between 1989 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Records of the seizures revealed that most of the ivory
smuggled into Japan since the CITES trade ban was imposed in 1989
was already cut into small rectangular shapes for manufacture
into what the Japanese call "hanko".
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic smuggling of ivory was yet another serious problem,
charged the EIA.
</P>
<P>
"The easiest and safest way of illegal importations is the
ivory brought into Japan by diplomats. These people are promoting
illegal trade," said the agency, quoting a Japanese government
source.
</P>
<P>
Ivory seizures outside Japan, often destined for the Japanese
market, frequently consisted of "hanko" blanks, said the EIA,
adding that since the ban, seizures of hanko blanks indicated
that their manufacture had occurred in at least 12 African range
states which include countries of the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC).

<P>
ALGIERS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
reappointed today outgoing Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia as head of
of the new government of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Ouyahia, who had been prime minister of the north African
nation since January, 1996, formally resigned Tuesday in order to
clear the way for the formation of a new government after last
week's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Ouyahia's party, the National Democratic Rally, won 155 seats
in the elections, becoming the largest group in the 380-seat
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Ouyahia has been a close associate of President Liamine Zeroual
in implementing the policies of economic reforms and suppressing
terrorist groups in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's National Liberation Front (FLN), which won 64 seats
occupying the third place in the elections, has voiced its
objection to reappointment of Ahmed Ouyahia. The front has been
considered as a coalition partner in the new government.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has been plagued by Islamic insurgency since 1992 after
the authorities canceled the multiparty elections when an Islamic
party was poised to win. During the Five-year bloody insurgency,
more than 60,000 people were killed.

SHENZHEN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Oaths and Declarations
(Amendment) Bill 1997 was tabled here today at the 11th plenary
meeting of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) for the first
and second readings.
</P>
<P>
Introduced by Michael Suen, secretary for policy coordination
of the Chief Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), the bill seeks to implement through
 local legislation the provision in Article 104 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Under that provision, when assuming office, the chief
executive, principal officials, members of the Executive and
Legislative Councils of the HKSAR and judges and other members of
the HKSAR judiciary will have to swear to uphold the Basic Law and
 swear allegiance to the HKSAR of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Suen said the bill has repealed the colonial oaths and
formulated appropriate oaths in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
According to Suen, the new oaths are based on the related
decisions made by the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR last
month.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A 34-member Iraqi trade
delegation started a week long visit yesterday to Syria headed by
chief of the Iraqi Chamber of Commerce Zohair Abdel-Ghafour Younis.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will hold talks with Syrian ministers of
finance, industry, economy and transport.
</P>
<P>
It will also meet with leading businessmen in an effort to
boost bilateral economic and trade cooperation and define
executive formulas for trade and industrial exchanges between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Crossing the Iraqi-Syrian borders yesterday, the Iraqi
delegation was warmly welcomed by Syrian businessmen led by chief
of the Syrian Chamber of Commerce Dr Rateb Al-Shallah.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the official Iraqi delegation is the first of its
kind since the disruption of diplomatic relations and closure of
borders between the two countries in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Iraqi delegation expressed their strong desire
to visit Syrian and voiced the hope that the visit would yield
more cooperation accords and serve the interests of both countries
especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will tour other Syrian provinces and industrial
cities, Syrian economic sources said.
</P>
<P>
It will sign agreements totalling some 15 million U.S. dollars,
on the Iraqi purchase of 10,000 tonnes of grain, 7,000 tonnes of
soap and detergents, and 6,000 tonnes of edible oil.
</P>
<P>
It will also conclude a deal on the purchase of Syrian
pharmaceuticals worth 1 million dollars and probe the possibility
of setting up joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Iraqi delegation to Damascus is of great
significance as it turns a new page in Syrian-Iraqi economic and
trade cooperation that may eventually bring about normalization of
their relations, observers here believe.
</P>
<P>
It coincides with important developments in the Middle East
such as the emerging Turkish-Israeli military alliance, the
Turkish military operation in northern Iraq and the complete
standstill of the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit indicates the common aspiration of Baghdad and
Damascus to gradually normalize their relations as Syria advocates
Iraq's return to the Arab ranks and its participation in the
coming Arab summits.

JAKARTA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN economic ministers'
informal meeting here today produced a set of recommendations for
the regional grouping's economic strategy in facing the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Production and
Distribution Hartarto Sastrosoenarto told the press after the
meeting that the recommendations will be taken up in the second
informal ASEAN leaders' summit in Kuala Lumpur in December.
</P>
<P>
He said today's four-hour ministerial meeting focused on how to
carry out continuous and progressive economic cooperation among
the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
The first informal ASEAN summit in Jakarta in December last
year produced the 'ASEAN Vision 2020' and the 'ASEAN Common
Investment Area.'
</P>
<P>
"This morning's meeting aimed to push for the realization of
the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the ASEAN Common Investment Area," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to formulate clear steps leading to the ASEAN Vision
2020, particularly on how to deal with the ever tightening
competition in trade, industry and investment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto also said that the economic recommendations will be
consolidated with the social and political recommendations which
will be submitted also to the next ASEAN informal summit in Kuala
Lumpur where the ASEAN 30th anniversary will be formally
celebrated.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN economic ministers will meet again in Kuala Lumpur in

<HEADLINE> A Quarter of Dutch Graduates Jobless: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- More than one in every four
recent graduates from universities in the Netherlands do not have
jobs, a report by Dutch job centers says.
</P>
<P>
The report said recent graduates of universities and secondary
schools are the most disadvantaged on the labor market. For school
leavers, this was because of government reorganizations and
limited demand for qualified school leavers in the commercial
sector.
</P>
<P>
However, those graduating from vocational secondary schools
have the greatest chance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The weak position for recent college graduates is related to
their lack of experience, the study found.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rates for recent college graduates rose two
percentage points to 29 percent last year, compared with a 17
percent rate for vocational school leavers.
</P>
<P>
Once university graduates landed their first jobs, their
situations greatly improved. This could be seen in the 5.6 percent
average unemployment rate for all university graduates, which was
well below the national average of 7.4 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior legislator said here
today that China has made big progress in the protection of its
environment and resources, but formidable challenges and hard work
lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), was speaking at a forum on
environmental and resource protection, which was held to sum up
the work on legislation and law enforcement related to the
environment and resources.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the forum will help to lay a solid legal
foundation for the country's sustainable economic growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
Since its formation in March, 1993, the Eighth NPC has stepped
up legislation on the issues, working out six laws on
environmental protection and nine laws on resources. In addition,
the State Council and local governments have enacted a large
number of rules and regulations in this regard, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the state has taken various measures to
strengthen law-enforcement, and related environmental protection
activities have had a great impact on the entire society.
</P>
<P>
However, the legislator pointed out that for a long time,
China's rapid development and backward management have put great
pressure on the country's resources and environment.
</P>
<P>
The trend of a deteriorating natural ecology continues,
environmental pollution is worsening and the conditions of
resources inspire no optimism, therefore it is urgent to stick to
the sustainable development strategy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leadership Slams U.S. Congress Resolution on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian leadership has
condemned U.S. Congress for its resolution recognizing Jerusalem
as the undivided capital of Israel, according to a report of
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem,
today.
</P>
<P>
A statement, which was released at the end of the weekly
session of the Palestinian leadership in Nablus, West Bank,
Friday night, noted that the resolution harms U.S. credibility
and contravenes the letter guarantee given to the Palestinians
on the eve of the 1991 Madrid Middle East peace conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday also voted to
provide 100 million dollars for moving the U.S. Embassy in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The resolution has met with
stern condemnation from the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat chaired the meeting which
was attended by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) cabinet
members, PLO Executive Committee members and speaker of
Palestinian Council. The participants also discussed the latest
political developments in light of the Egyptian mediation by
Presidential advisor Osama el-Baz between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Palestinian leadership blamed
Israel for the recent tension in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hundreds of Palestinian protesters clashed with
Israeli troops in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip. The soldiers
opened fire killing one Palestinian and wounding more than 20.
</P>
<P>
The statement refuted the accusations leveled by the Israeli
authorities that the PNA was behind the demonstration, noting
that it was because of the provocative construction of a fence
around the Jewish settlement of Morag and of the installation of
a memorial for an Israeli soldier killed by Palestinian fire
last September.

<P>
SHENZHEN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) today passed a motion supporting the proposal to appoint
three permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) and the
chief judge of the High Court of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The motion was tabled by Elsie Leung Oi-sie, secretary of
justice of the HKSAR, at the 11th meeting of the PLC held in
Shenzhen, a South China city adjacent to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission
(Designate) recommended that Henry Litton, Charles Ching and Kemal
 Bokhary be appointed CFA permanent judges and Patrick Chan be
appointed chief judge of the High Court of the HKSAR on July 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the PLC meeting this afternoon, Leung said that with
 PLC members' support for the proposed appointments, all five key
posts in the HKSAR judiciary would have been filled by the most
capable and suitable candidates.
</P>
<P>
The five key posts refer to CFA's chief justice and three
permanent judges as well as the chief judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
On May 24, the PLC passed a motion to support the appointment
of Andrew Li as the chief justice of the CFA.
</P>
<P>
Leung noted that Article 93 of the Basic Law provides that
judges and other members of the judiciary serving in Hong Kong
before the establishment of the HKSAR may all remain in
employment.
</P>
<P>
"Steps are being taken to ensure the continued employment of
all serving judges and judicial officers," she said, adding that
with such a line-up, the HKSAR Judiciary and Hong Kong's legal
system are not only assured of a smooth transition, but also
poised to continue the development of the common law in Hong Kong
in the new and challenging era ahead.

<HEADLINE> State Council to Ensure Smooth Purchasing of Summer Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the State
Council, China's Cabinet, has issued a circular to further ensure
the smooth purchasing of summer grain across the country.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should strictly abide by the policy
worked out by the State Council, and all summer grain within the
fixed quotas should be purchased at the same price level as that
of last year, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Once the fixed-quota purchasing is completed, the units should
go on actively organizing the purchasing of summer grain at a
negotiable price.
</P>
<P>
The grain risk funds jointly set up by the central and local
governments should play a big role in regulating and controlling
the buying. All price differences resulting from protecting
farmers' and consumers' interests should be covered by the funds.
</P>
<P>
The funds will also encourage the purchasing of summer grain at
reasonable prices for farmers, if the market prices are lower than
the ordered prices.
</P>
<P>
Plans should be made to ensure the supply and good management
of purchasing funds for summer grain and edible oil. The circular
calls for the establishment of responsibility systems in
governments at all levels to collect the purchasing fund, and none
of the purchasing fund is allowed to be spent for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
The circular also placed emphasis on the need for spacious
storehouses and the smooth transportation of the purchased summer
grain.

<HEADLINE> HK Provisional Legislature Adopts Four Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) passed the third readings of four bills at its 11th
plenary meeting here this afternoon after it resumed
second-reading debates on them.
</P>
<P>
The four bills are the National Flag and National Emblem Bill,
the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Bill, the Societies
(Amendment) Bill 1997 and the Public Order (Amendment) Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before the three-hour debates, Michael Suen, secretary for
policy coordination of the Chief Executive Office of the HKSAR,
said that the PLC's bill committees of the four bills had made
detailed study at the previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the consultations between the bill
committees and the representatives of the Chief Executive of the
HKSAR, some literary and technical adaptations had been made to
the bills.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the adaptations would make the clauses
 of the bills clearer and more accurate in expression.
</P>
<P>
On the National Flag and National Emblem Bill, he said that the
 draft of the bill aimed at implementing the Law on the National
Flag and the Law on the National Emblem of the People's Republic
of China adopted by the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress in 1990 and 1991 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, the contents of the bill should be in line with
the two national laws.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Bill aims at providing
use, manufacture and protection of the regional flag and emblem of
 the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Suen said that the Chief Executive Office had taken into
account various suggestions on the amendment to the bill.
</P>
<P>
On the Societies (Amendment) Bill 1997 and the Public Order
(Amendment) 1997, he said that the drafts of the bills were the
fruit of soliciting opinions from HK citizens and they also met
the HKSAR government's goal of seeking a balance between ensuring
citizens' freedom and maintaining social order.

<HEADLINE> US Resolution Encourages Israeli Aggression: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. resolution to recognize
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move the U.S. embassy
from Tel Aviv to the city is aimed at encouraging Israeli
aggression, the local Syrian daily Teshreen said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out in its commentary that the resolution
does not affect the identity of Jerusalem in the least but it
has adverse effects on the Middle East peace process and the
credibility of the United States as well as its interests in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was adopted by the U.S. House of
Representatives Wednesday, approved the allocation of 100
million U.S. dollars to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The paper lashed at the U.S. House of Representatives for
legalizing the Israeli occupation, terming the United States as
defender of the Jewish state and the Israeli aggressive designs
in complete violation of moral principles and conventions.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is an Arab territory that is not subject to the
decisions of the U.S. House of Representatives or the Israeli
Knesset (parliament), the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that "we have never heard of a legislative
house in a foreign country legalizing the occupation and
usurpation of the territories of another country as is the case in
the occupied Arab territories."
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is an Arab land and will remain so regardless of
Israel's whims, the daily concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis claim the controversial city of Jerusalem as its
"undivided" capital while the Palestinians want it to be the
capital of their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Pro-Rafsanjani Politicians to Form Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of high-ranking
politicians who support the liberal policies of Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani will form a political party
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian-language daily Akhbar reported that the group
known as Servants of Reconstruction (G-6) will form their party
by the middle of August.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the formation of the political party
has been high on the agenda of the 64-year-old outgoing moderate
president, who has to step down on August 3 because the
Constitution bars him from running the third consecutive term of
office.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Rafsanjani will certainly remain on the
political arena and will exercise his strong influence as
chairman of the State Expediency Council and a leader of the
political party.
</P>
<P>
Akhbar reported that the liberal group, Servants of
Reconstruction of Iran, has prepared drafts of the bylaws of the
party, which will be presented to the Iranian Judiciary for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Formed on December 31, 1995 in the run-up to the Fifth
Parliamentary Elections, the G-6 group resumed its intense
political activities this year by backing president-elect
Seyyed Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a source whose spoke on condition of anonymity, Akhbar
said that the party will be named after the group's name,
"Servants of Reconstruction of Iran."
</P>
<P>
The same source said that the group has recruited such notable
figures as Abdullah Nouri, leader of one of a powerful coalition
of the leftists and liberal MP's in the Iranian parliament, and
Faezeh Hashemi, a feminist MP and daughter of Rafsanjani.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Issues New Bill Before Planned Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has issued
the much-awaited Peaceful Assemblies Bill just before the
opposition rallies set for June 21 in nine major towns in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, political rallies and other public
gatherings will no longer need to require a government permit,
but a 14-day notification to district officers to facilitate for
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
If the district officers rejects an application for any rally,
they must notify the applicant in writing within five days before
the scheduled function.
</P>
<P>
The officers also have the right to cancel any permit so
issued or make amendments to the permits.
</P>
<P>
All other meetings of public bodies, trade unions or
professional organizations have been excluded from this
requirement.
</P>
<P>
The bill is to be tabled in the parliament next week to seek
the lawmakers' approvement to have the current Public Order Act
replaced.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing bill, any administrative officer or police
officer could stop or prevent the holding of a licence issued.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition parties tried to hold two rallies with no
permit from the government last month.
</P>
<P>
The rallies thus were broken up by Kenyan anti-riot police
amid turmoils which injured dozens of people and caused
businesses to a complete standstill in downtown Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Set up Anti-Cancer Foundation for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 14 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
will set up a special foundation to help pay for expensive medical
costs of children who have cancer.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the death rate of children under five
years old who have cancer in Guangdong is higher than the
country's average rate.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that both the cure and survival rates of these
young cancer patients can reach 70 percent -- much higher than
that of the adults.
</P>
<P>
However, about two percent of China's cancer-stricken children
don't receive treatment because their families can't afford
it. For example, the treatment for acute leukemia usually costs
200,000 (24,000 US dollars) to 300,000 yuan (36,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which was initiated by seven big hospitals in
the province with approval from the provincial Health Department,
will provide financial aid to the young patients.

doctors, lawyers, accountants and architects have also been
exempted from excise duty which would also take care of the
consumer class.
</P>
<P>
Dispelling the impression about the budget as mere industry
friendly, the finance minister said the budgetary measures aim at
cutting down inflation and create job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"The social sector is the second wheel of our economic agenda"
he said, adding allocation of 100 billion rupees (about 2.5
billion U.S. dollars) has been provided for the uplift and the
social conditions of the masses including health and education.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the poverty alleviation program, he said, it is a
medium term program with far-reaching impact towards overcoming
this menace.
</P>
<P>
The government also significantly reduced the non-development
expenditures and will have tight control over it even in the next
fiscal year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the measures taken in the budget
for 1997-98 would be implemented in true spirit.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says He Looks Forward to New Role After '98 polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
hinted today that his role after his term expires on June 30, 1998
would be to give advice and direction as a senior statesman.
</P>
<P>
"I will provide advice and direction as a senior statesman, not
in government," Ramos said in Asingan, Pangasinan Province, where
he and his wife registered as voters for next year's local and
general elections.
</P>
<P>
About 40 million Filipinos are expected to register as voters
in the four-day general registration which started today. The
general listing will continue tomorrow and on June 21-22.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine constitution, the president serves a
single six-year term. Ramos has repeatedly promised to step down
next year, but he is still pushing for charter changes.
</P>
<P>
"I have made it very clear that for me, our 1987 Constitution
must be open to amendments on the basis of the right of our people
who might have the initiative to petition for constitutional
amendments," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos said that he has nothing to do with the move by some
sectors to extend his term.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have accused Ramos of trying to lift his
term limits by amending the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Might Go to U.S. Court for F-16 Refund: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan has stated that his country might go to an American
court to seek a refund of 628 million US dollars it paid for the
purchase of F-16 aircraft, according to the official Associated
Press of Pakistan (APP) today.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan told APP two days ago that this might be the best
choice for the Pakistani government because it has fallen through
to get the refund through aircraft sale to a third country.
</P>
<P>
The position of the United States is that it cannot deliver the
aircraft due to the Pressler legislation, nor can it refund the
money before it goes to the Congress Appropriation Committee, Ayub
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that Indonesia, who was to buy the
F-16 aircraft, had disbanded the deal unilaterally in protest
against the U.S. congress' criticism of its human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
Ayub said that the Pakistani government would take a decision
within next few months if it would go to a court or not.
</P>
<P>
"We can not only claim the principal amount but also the
interest and damages from the special fund," he added.

<HEADLINE> TDC Leader Briefs on Completion of HK CEC Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Viktor Fung, chairman of the
Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), stressed here today
that Hong Kong's newest landmark is the dramatic extension to the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC).
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing held in the HKCEC this afternoon, Fung
said: "Just three years ago, where we are all standing now, was
water -- a part of the harbor. Now it is the largest, and finest,
conference and exhibition facility in Asia."
</P>
<P>
From a tract of water to a building three times the size of the
Sydney Opera House, it took the TDC just 39 months to complete
the extension project, he said, adding that the new facility, on
a man-made island off the harborfront of Wanchai, more than
doubles the capacity of the nine-year-old HKCEC.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few weeks this building will have an opportunity
to make a lasting impression on the world. As the site for the
handover ceremonies, it is destined to become one of the most
visible and recognizable structures on earth," Fung pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The expanded HKCEC was selected as the venue serving for
ceremonies marking the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and
the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. It is also scheduled to house the annual meetings of the
World Bank/IMF in September this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have met the deadline. We have completed the task on
time. And on Budget as we promised," Fung said. The reclamation
and extension project of 615-million U.S. dollars was entrusted
by the Hong Kong government to the TDC, Hong Kong's statutory
organization for promoting trade.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the efforts of many people, the world will see Hong
Kong at its best," he continued. "They will see a city already
moving confidently beyond 1997 and into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
According to him, some 400 companies from over 30 countries and
regions participated in the construction work of the extension
project.
</P>
<P>
With the HKCEC, which generates billions of dollars in direct
and indirect benefit to the economy each year, the TDC has
strengthened Hong Kong's lead as the trade fair and meetings
capital of Asia. It organizes more than 20 international trade
fairs and exhibitions in Hong Kong annually.

<P>
PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today inaugurated the annual Bourget Aeronautics and Space Saloon,
the world's biggest airspace industrial exhibition, at the Bourget
airport, northeast of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was accompanied by Defense Minister Alain Richard,
Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, head of the Dassault
Airspace Group Serge Dassault and President of the Aerospatiale
Group Yves Michot at the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
This year's Bourget airspace show coincided with a rise in sale
of planes and other airspace products in the global market, as
well as an increasingly fierce competition between European and
American airspace groups.
</P>
<P>
The merger of Boeing and Mcdonnell Douglas airspace groups sent
a wave of shock to the European airspace industries, which are
also experiencing an intensive period of restructuring and merger.
</P>
<P>
Russia is displaying a strong show of their airspace products
at this year's Bourget saloon.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Bombardier company is showing for the first time
its Gulfstream V and Global Express passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is displaying its converted B737 passenger aircraft,
while the Airbus Industrie is presenting a new version of its A319
with more than 100 seats and luxury offices and meeting rooms.
</P>

The combat aircraft on display are also expected to draw great
attention from international buyers.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Stock Price Index Rises amidst Declining Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) All
Share Price Index increased 16 points amidst declining trade both
in volume and value last trading week ending on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index of Bangladesh's largest bourse rose to
1,157.43 from the previous week's closing balance of 1,141.34,
while market capitalization also increased to 96.8 billion taka
(about 2.25 billion dollars) from 95.46 billion taka (about 2.22
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the week, however, only 1.57 million shares and
debentures valued 320.09 million taka (about 7.44 million U.S.
dollars) were traded against 1.66 million shares and debentures
worth 352.77 million (about 8.2 million dollars) of the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
Market observers attributed this decline in value and volume to
the cautious attitude of the investors for the announcement of the
budget for the 1997-98 fiscal year on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior market analyst, certain fiscal proposals
announced in the budget for the coming fiscal year would revamp
and rejuvenate the share market.
</P>
<P>
Shares of 18 state-owned enterprises were planned to be off
loaded through stock exchange, which would augment the supply of
shares on the primary market, said the analyst.
</P>
<P>
Abolition of quota system in Initial Public Offerings would
attract more retail investors in the shares while increase in
quota of non-resident Bangladeshis is also a very wise move, the
analyst said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Paper Closes down due to New Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian satirical weekly
newspaper of Abed Rabbo has decided to close after making
its last stab today, becoming the first victim of the new Press
and Publication Law introduced last month.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo's chief editor Youssef Ghishan said, in the last
issue published today, that the administrators of the paper,
after only 45 issues of publication in 10 months, have chosen
to close it because they could not afford the fines imposed by
the new press law.
</P>
<P>
"The new law is elastic, and it can be applied to almost any
article we publish. The law can be interpreted in any way," the
chief editor said.
</P>
<P>
The provisions of the new law impose fines ranging from
30,000 to 50,000 Jordanian dinars (about 42,373 to 70,621
U.S. dollars) and oblige the papers, both dailies and weeklies,
to raise their capital.
</P>
<P>
It is not the capital requirements, but the huge fines that
concerns Abed Rabbo, said Ghishan.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo's status as a satirical paper and the "elasticity"
of the law will expose it to the potential of sustaining heavy
financial penalties which it can not afford, he added.
</P>
<P>
The law offers an extended list of issues that can not be
covered in news stories, editorials or cartoons. The government
has justified the law by saying that a new law was necessary
after officials, parliamentarians, citizens and journalists
complained that the weekly press often had exceeded the limits
of public decency in dealing with many issues.
</P>
<P>
Ghishan asserted that a satirical paper is a special breed of
press which "needs a wider range of freedom than a regular
newspaper."
</P>
<P>
"But the new law does not provide that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo circulates about 20,000 copies weekly in Jordan
and an undisclosed number in countries like the United Arab
Emirates, Lebanon, Oman, Greece, Egypt and the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia have appointed a new "foreign minister" in place of
Mohammad Ghous, who is being held by the opposition in northern
Afghanistan, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the Taliban officials as saying that Abdul
Jalil, previously deputy to Ghous, has been promoted to the post
since Ghous was being taken prisoner in the northern provincial
capital of Mazar-i-Sharif late last month.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militia was forced out of the northern region by
forces of new Uzbek strongman General Abdul Malik who broke an
alliance with the Taliban, leading to fighting in which hundreds
of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ghous and some other Taliban officials, hundreds
of Taliban fighters were reportedly taken prisoner by Malik's
forces.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: D-8 Group Not Competes With World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, TURKEY, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan said here today that the eight Muslim countries
bloc, known as D-8 Group, aims to expand cooperation among its
member countries instead of competing with any international
groups.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of ministerial council of the
D-8 Group in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, Erbkan said
that the D-8 Group consisting of eight member states with a
population of 800 million is a strong power in the world,
aiming to improve their people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
He said that the D-8 Group means "peace instead of
conflict, dialogue instead of confrontation, cooperation instead of
exploitation, justice instead of double standards, equality
instead of discrimination, democracy instead of oppression."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who is an enthusiastic sponsor of the Muslim
countries organization, stressed that the D-8 bloc spares
no efforts to embrace all the countries throughout the world
and to boost global cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said
that the D-8 Group is a new belief to promote peace and
stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the Istanbul meeting will shed
new lights in dialogue and cooperation in this newly formed
world.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said: "We see in the near future a big project
will take place in this D-8 Group."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani diplomat N. Ahmet Asrar told Xinhua that Pakistan
strongly supports the D-8 Group, which was initiated by the
Turkish prime minister, saying that the D-8 Group is aimed at
cooperating economic and trade fields among the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting, which was held at the Ciragan Hotel,
was making preparations for the D-8 Group Summit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 Summit will officially announce the establishment of
the eight Muslim developing countries bloc, which was formed on
October 11, 1996 on the auspices of Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 Group consists of Turkey, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt,
Pakistan, Bangledesh, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim countries group's combined GNPs total 600 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the D-8 Group has provoked dissatisfaction
from the United States and other Western countries. They believe
that the Muslim bloc is directed against the G-7 Group of
the Western world.
</P>
<P>
Some Central Asian countries, which are also Muslim-dominated
countries, are also dissatisfied with the D-8 Group because
they are not invited to the bloc.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Take NBA Title for Fifth Time in Seven Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls won their fifth
NBA title in seven years Friday after beating the Utah Jazz 90-86
at home.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan led the Bulls with 39 points and 11 rebounds and
was named the Finals Most Valuable Player for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
Steve Kerr's shot with five seconds to go put the Bulls up for
the last time in a game Utah had led from late in the first
quarter until just under nine minutes left in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
On Utah's final possession, Chicago's Toni Kukoc tipped an
inbounds pass from Bryon Russell. Scottie Pippen completed the
steal and tossed it back toward Kukoc, whose layup loosed the now
familiar celebration in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said Pippen, who has played alongside Jordan on all of Chicago's
championship campaigns, deserved a share of the MVP honor.
</P>
<P>
"He's like a little brother to me," Jordan said of
Pippen. "That's what brothers do, we share our successes."
</P>
<P>
Pippen added 23 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people watch scorers, and Michael is one of the best
scorers in this game. But Scottie's defense was a one-man wrecking
crew," Bulls coach Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Malone led Utah with 21 points and Jeff Hornacek had 18 for the
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls had trailed from early in the first quarter when
Kerr, who has struggled with his shooting off the bench
throughout the series, sank a three-pointer with just under nine
minutes left to play, putting Chicago ahead 74-73.
</P>
<P>
The three-pointer capped a 10-0 run that erased a nine-point
deficit after the first minute of the final period. Kerr scored
five of those points and Pippen scored the other five, while
Jordan was on the bench.
</P>
<P>
Jordan returned with eight and a half minutes to go and
contributed 10 more points, making it 86-83 with a 16-foot jumper
with 2:02 to play.
</P>
<P>
Utah's Russell tied it again at 86-86 with a three-pointer with
1:44 to go.
</P>
<P>
After missed chances on either side, Chicago took the ball on
an inbounds pass.
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Bulls gave the ball to Jordan, who drew the
double team, faked a shot and passed to Kerr, who was wide open at
the top of the key and sank the deiciding basket.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have now won all five of their appearances in the NBA
finals, starting with their victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in
1991.
</P>
<P>
That was the first of their "Three-peat" run. They went on to
beat Portland in 1992 -- when they also rallied in the fourth
quarter of the final game -- and Phoenix in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Jordan missed all of the 1993-1994 season and most of the
1994-1995 campaign while retired. But he returned to form last
year when Chicago defeated Seattle to claim their fourth title.
</P>
<P>
Chicago's five titles in seven years surpasses the five in nine
years won by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Utah, who had never before reached the finals, lost the first
two games in Chicago then fought back to equalize with victories
in games three and four in Salt Lake City. They lost game five at
home, and returned to Chicago facing the formidable task of
winning two games on the Bulls' home court.

the political fall-out from his government's first serious blunder
Friday night after ministers admitted that they were considering

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import More Maize for Food Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government targets to
import 18,000 tons of maize before July for the ongoing famine
relief operation countrywide, with some 76,000 tons of maize
having been imported since February.
</P>
<P>
The maize importation is aimed at bridging a sharp drop in the
commodity's supplies after a recent severe drought that hit the
most parts of the eastern African country, the "East Africa
Standard" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The imported maize are mainly from South Africa and the United
States, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Between February and June, the country also imported a total
of 232,284 tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
Relief supplies are to be completed by July when the country
expects to register improved maize harvest, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the current unexpectedly dry weather in some areas in
northern Kenya is likely to have adverse effects on maize and
wheat yield there, experts warned.

PARIS, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- France and Germany Friday failed to adopt a common position
on the budgetary stability pact of the future European single
currency countries. Only 48 hours remained for the French and
German leaders to reach a compromise before the EU Amsterdam
summit in Madrid which is expected to ratify the pact.
</P>
<P>
-- A de facto truce began Friday between the two warring sides
of the Congo Republic due to exterior pressure. Both sides accused
each other of being responsible for the violence which devastated
Brazzaville in a feud for power. The new fighting might be caused
by the planned withdrawal of French troops, which have completed
evacuation of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite a joint will to de-dramatize their dispute over the
budgetary stability pact for the future European single currency,
France and Germany Friday failed to find a rapprochement of points
of view on the pact at the Franco-German summit in Poitiers.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, meeting with with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl respectively during the summit, hardened
his position by insisting on a social chapter in the pact and a
greater coordination in economic policies by European Union member
countries.
</P>
<P>
-- The public prosecutor's office of Paris Friday opened an
investigation against X for accused electoral fraud in the
constituency of Paris during the legislative elections.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tipped on Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya should make poverty
alleviation a priority from now as nearly half of its population
live in absolute poverty, a U.N. official was quoted by today's
"Daily Nation" newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both life expectancy and primary school enrollment rates have
declined in the eastern African country over recent years, said
Nancy Asanga, the U.N. Development Program country
representative.
</P>
<P>
She called for a re-evaluation of Kenya's past development
plans on poverty alleviation to make them more concrete and
effective.
</P>
<P>
"Comparatively, Kenya ranks lower than the average of all
developing countries. The impending questions to all of us are
whether this is the rightful ranking for a country like it, why
and what needs to be done," she said.
</P>
<P>
Except for 1994, Kenya's ranking, according to the Human
Development Indices, dropped from 113rd position in 1991 to 134th
this year. Last year it held the 128th position.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans' life expectancy fell from 59.7 in 1991 to 53.6 this
year while primary school enrollment rate dropped two percent to
55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Operation Rate of South Korea's Car Industry to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The operation rate of South Korea's
domestic auto industry is expected to keep falling throughout the
next four years, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association
and Kia Motors Corporation said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's car output rate is expected to fall from 80.1
percent last year to 72.9 percent this year and 53.9 percent by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the combined production capacity of South Korean car
manufacturers, owing to their persistent buildup, would continue
to grow from 3.5 million units last year to 6.4 million in
2001. The growth will lead to an overstock of 3.45 million units,
about five times more than the 690,000 cars in 1996, said industry
sources.
</P>
<P>
Even at the 72.9 percent operation rate, the combined output
capacity this year, seen to reach 4 million units, will cause an
oversupply of more than 1 million units for the first time, with
fierce competition among automakers further straining their
profitability, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said the increasing supply excess in South Korea's auto
industry was due to slowing demand for new car models in
industrial countries, various governmental regulations on
preventing traffic congestion, environmental pollution and large
carmakers' ambitious capacity buildup to attain global-scale
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The Economist, a Britain-based financial weekly, has recently
estimated the global auto industry's factory operation rate at
72.9 percent in 1996 with total production capacity of 68 million
units, resulting in more than 18 million cars in oversupply.
</P>
<P>
The magazine forecast that the capacity use ratio would drop to
below 55 percent by 2001, with excess supply surpassing 20 million
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
It said that the situation would lead to fierce sales
competition among international carmakers. It expected a
global-scale restructuring of the industry through merger and
acquisition, strategic alliances and readjustment of manufacturing
lines.

<HEADLINE> Suspended Hurdler Flenoy Competes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Suspended 400-meter hurdler
Stephon Flenoy Friday came out to run in the U.S. athletics
championships in Indianapolis. However, he finished last in his
preliminary race.
</P>
<P>
Flenoy's complicated situation came to a head Friday when the
IAAF waived its "contamination" rule, which could have led to the
suspension of all runners who competed against him.
</P>
<P>
Even with the IAAF backing away from its hardline stance, the
race went off only after the competitors, including world
record-holder Kevin Young, signed a waiver form from U.S. track
officials conceding that they knew about the contamination risk.
</P>
<P>
Flenoy had been suspended by the USA Track and Field (USATF)
April 4 after a drug test revealed a ratio of testosterone to
epitestosterone higher than the acceptable 6-to-1.
</P>
<P>
He took the case to arbitration and an aribtrator ruled that he
had not received a fair hearing before a USATF board and ordered
him reinstated into the U.S. championships.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF decision came after a letter from USATF president Pat
Rico to IAAF president Primo Nebiolo requested the waiver on
behalf of 400-meter hurdlers in the championships.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Dounan, in Chenggong county in
southwest China's Yunnan province, is a small village that can not
be found on a map, but it is now widely known as the home of
representative offices of several dozen companies engaged in the
beautiful business of flowers.
</P>
<P>
Within a dozen years, Dounan has developed from an obscure
small village into the largest flower trading center in southwest
China and the sole village-level flower market in the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
Everyday, large amounts of flowers are shipped to the village
from the fields nearby, and are then wholesaled to every corner of
the country and even to foreign countries. Now, more than four
million flowers are transacted in the village daily, worth over
300,000 yuan. Entering the market full of various kinds of red,
white and yellow flowers, one cannot help but feel like walking in
a very big flower garden.
</P>
<P>
In the fields outside the village some 180 ha of flower land
are covered with white plastic shelters, where the flowers bloom
all the year round.
</P>
<P>
Li Tingren, director of the Village Committee in his fifties,
said: "I am sure that most people in the flower business in China
know Dounan."
</P>
<P>
Dounan people began to grow flowers in the late 1980s, when the
business just started to grow in China.
</P>
<P>
Due to fine weather conditions, the village's flower
cultivation grew rapidly in line with high social demand.

<HEADLINE> Two WNBF Spies Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Two men accused of spying for the
West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) face the charge of treason, "The New
Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mathia Oriyo, a driver in Arua District in the north-west, and
Moses Abdallah, a photographer of the same district, yesterday
have been committed to the high court for the trial, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Betty Khisa, resident state attorney, told the court that the
two accused took part in activities aimed at overthrowing the
government of Uganda in various occasions in Arua and Morobo,
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The accused collected and delivered information to the WNBF
about the deployment of the government troops and the movement of
Colonel James Kazini, commander of the Fourth Division, the
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
Documents captured from Oriyo indicated he also monitored
activities of Sudan People's Liberation Army, a rebel group
acting in southern Sudan, and gave financial and material support
for WNBF rebels, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 alleged WNBF rebels are still in custody waiting
for charge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
WNBF is a crippled rebel group which was acting in the
north-west and had bases in southern Sudan.

<P>
By 1995 most of the village's arable land had been switched for
growing flowers. Villagers stopped growing all other crops and
changed their life habbit with more money in hand.
</P>
<P>
The flower market gradually took shape. In the beginning, some
villagers took flowers to community centers themselves for
sale. Later, a primary wholesale market developed on an open space
outside the village as the demand for flowers were increasing.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring villages followed suit quickly. They also shipped
flowers to the wholesale market in the village. More and more
wholesalers appeared.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Dounan village decided to expand the market. They
spent over three million yuan building flower wholesale
facilities, including some 1,000 trading stalls.
</P>
<P>
Every dawn sees both flower farmers and dealers throng to the
market.
</P>
<P>
The whole village has been becoming increasingly rich and
prosperous from the returns of flowers, Li Tingren revealed.
</P>
<P>
Historically Dounan villagers lived just on growing
grain. Until the end of the 1970s some ten percent of the
villagers still did not have enough to eat and wear, and the per
capita net income was 41 yuan. Most people lived in thatched
houses.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, villagers began to grow vegetables besides
grain, and sold vegetables to city dwellers. More and more
thatched houses were replaced by brick ones.

"However, the village realized prosperity it dreamed only when
it was connected with flowers," said Li.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, the per capita net income reached 3,702 yuan. More
than 1,500 families moved into concrete cement buildings, and over
300 families were equipped with telephones.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is that the flower business has
broadened people's vision, Li said. Many villagers turned into
flower traders. Asked what flowers sell well at what season, an
illiterate old man who was helping with packaging answered without
hesitation that roses sell best on Valentine's Day and carnations
on the Mother's Day. The same answer could be made even by small
school boys.
</P>
<P>
However, Li Tingren said that the flower business of Dounan has
just taken off in view of high demand, adding that the families
grow flowers still separately on small scales and the prices
sometimes go up and down by large margins.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the village is considering building a flower
market several times as large as the present one and setting up a
flower company that integrates production with sales.
</P>
<P>
"By that time we will be able to make real big money," he said.
</P>
<P>
The flower industry is now encouraged by government, he said,
and Yunnan plans to build itself into a kingdom of flowers and the
provincial capital of Kunming plans to build itself into China's
capital of flowers.

<HEADLINE> SADC Urged for United Fight Against Illegal Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Drug Enforcement Commission
(DEC) of Zambia has urged member states of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to unite in drug fighting.
</P>
<P>
The absence of an extradition treaty among SADC countries and
the silence on the protocol on combating drug trafficking have
made it difficult to fight the scourge in the region, DEC
spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sinyani noted that there is no country in the region which has
signed an extradition treaty and this makes it impossible to
prosecute drug traffickers who escape to other countries. He
warned that unless SADC countries make an effort to sign an
extradition treaty now, the war against the scourge will be an
exercise in futility.
</P>
<P>
11 of the 12 SADC member states signed a protocol on combating
illicit drug trafficking in August last year. However, only
Zambia and Mauritius have implemented the treaty, according to
Sinyani.
</P>
<P>

countries and an extradition treaty is signed, this fight against

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes UN Resolution Asking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon welcomed today a
resolution of the United Nations' general assembly blaming
Israel for the shelling of a U.N. peacekeeping force camp at
Qana in south Lebanon last year and calling on Israel to pay 1.7
million U.S. dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz was quoted by the
state-run Lebanon Radio as saying that the results of Friday's
vote in favor of the resolution was a victory in the "U.N.'s
battle to keep its credibility."
</P>
<P>
The vote confirmed an unprecedented motion in the assembly's
fifth committee which required Israel to finance the 1997-1998
budget of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) because of
its culpability in the Qana massacre.
</P>
<P>
"What happened is not Lebanon's battle. It is the U.N.'s
battle to keep its credibility as a reference of right and
justice in the world. The Lebanese cause, which was expressed
through the Qana massacre, is finally linked with other
nations," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Alluding to pressure exerted by the United States prior to
the vote to save Israel from being held responsibility, Boueiz
said the decision would portray a clear message not only by
condemning the Qana massacre, but also by condemning practices
inside the United Nations which "were and are still threatening
the world organization's cause."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister expressed the hope that the U.N. Security
Council would follow the general assembly to approve a similar
resolution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed a necessity for the U.N. to work on implementing
its decision in order to sustain its credibility.
</P>
<P>
"In this way countries would not be forced to claim their
rights by force and would not have to suffer from violence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Lebanese civilians taking refuge in the Qana
camp were killed when Israeli artillery shelled it on April 18,
1996, during Israel's "Grapes of Wrath" operation against
Lebanese guerrillas in south Lebanon.

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greene won the title in
9.90 seconds to equal the 10th fastest time ever run on Friday at
the U.S. Athletics Championships in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for an American to step up," Greene was quoted as
saying after his victory. He also warned for the world's elite
sprinters: watch out.
</P>
<P>
Americans have not won a championship 100-meter title since
Carl Lewis's 1991 world title. Canadian Donovan Bailey holds the
world record at 9.84 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time for someone to stand up, and I'll do that to
help put American sprinting back where it's supposed to be,"
Greene said.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones, the women's sensation of the USA Track and Field
Championships, ran her third straight strong race, winning the
100-meter dash, while two-time Olympic gold medalist Gail Devers
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who cloced 10.98 and 10.92 at Indiana University Track
and Field Stadium with the year's two-fastest times in Thursday
night's preliminaries and semifinals, won her first national title
in 10.97 in a race run into a headwind.
</P>
<P>
Jones had shown her potential in high school, when as a
16-year-old junior, she finished fifth in the 100 and fourth in
the 200 at the 1992 Olympic trials, reports said reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Devers, the 1993 world champion and two-time Olympic gold
medalist, pulled out the final, claiming a sore right calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
If the International Amateur Athletic Federation decides to add
"wild card" entries for the World Championships, Devers could
possibly participate, along with other world champions and Olympic
gold medalists such as Michael Johnson and Dan O'Brien.
</P>

Devers had clocked 10.99 seconds in a preliminary race on

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls off Scheduled Visit to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu has canceled his U.S. trip scheduled for late June,
according to the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted an official statement issued by the Prime
Minister's Office Friday as saying that Netanyahu decided to cancel
the visit because he wants to stay at home to deal with the highly
controversial Conversion Bill which is causing serious problems
affecting Israel's relations with millions of conservative and
reformist Jews in Diaspora.
</P>
<P>
However, the commercial Channel 2 of the state-run Israel
Television reported that the real reason is that the premier
does not want to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a low
point in the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has made no secret that it is not
satisfied with the little progress made in the Middle East peace
talks since the rightwing Likud government took office a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madelein Albright has repeatedly
declared that she will not visit the region unless the Israelis
and Palestinians make up their minds to adopt difficult
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Jordanian King Hussein
and other Arab leaders have called on Clinton to put pressure on
Netanyahu in order to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu originally planned to attend a U.N. environmental
conference in New York and then go for a summit with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy will represent Israel in
Netanyahu's place at the U.N. meeting instead, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis
broke off three months ago when Israel began construction of the
Har Homa Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians refused to resume the talks unless Israel
agreed to halt the project and other construction activities in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The latest mediation efforts by Egyptian envoy Osama el-Baz to
the Jewish state and the Palestinian self-rule areas this week
reportedly made no progress.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Break-ins, Robberies on Rise in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 14 (Xinhua) -- With recent consecutive reports
on new cases, break-ins and robberies in the residential areas of
the well-to-dos in Singapore appeared to be on the rise and more
foreigners fell victim to the knife-point of the robbers.
</P>
<P>
In the western part of Singapore, an island state with an area
of more than 600 square kilometers, at least five robberies and
nine break-ins were reported between January and May this year,
the Straits Times said today, citing police figures.
</P>
<P>
Early Monday morning, a British couple, Andrew Davis and wife,
Lesley, were tied up with a telephone line and threatened with
knives taken from their kitchen by the masked burglars, one of
whom wore only underwear. The robbers took away more than 10,000
U.S. dollars worth of jewelry, equipment and cash.
</P>
<P>
One hour later at around 2:50 AM, Clarence Chandran, a visiting
senior executive of the Canadian telecommunication giant Northern
Telecom, was stabbed during a robbery at a Bukit Timah bungalow,
not too far away from the site of the earlier case. About 12,000
U.S. dollars worth of jewelry and his credit cards were taken
away.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Jurong Police Division, which is in charge
of the western area, was quoted as saying seven of the 14 cases
had been solved. He said most of the targets were private
residences, but he could not comment on whether the recent
break-ins were the work of a single gang of robbers.
</P>
<P>
Victims, however, said there had been a striking similarity in
the way the robbers worked in several of the cases: They struck in
the early hours of the morning; they were armed with knives taken
from the kitchens of the homes they broke into; and they tied up
their victims with electrical cord or telephone wire.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the robbers used their victims' T-shirts or other
clothing to mask themselves, and several of the victims noted that
one or more of the robbers had only underwear on.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said the police had little background
information on the robbers who move in and out of Singapore, often
illegally, and who don't remain anywhere for long while in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were a total of 1,737 break-ins reported and
this was said to be the lowest figure in 19 years. Meanwhile, the
total of 768 robberies reported last year were said to be the
lowest level recorded in 38 years.

Thursday night.

<P>
From motorbike and car owners to housewives, from cities to

</P>
<P>
Some are worried that the rise in petroleum products may lead

</P>

Under the new price structure set by the Nepal Oil Corporation
(NOC), gas is now sold for 39 rupees per liter, up five rupees,
diesel for 17.5 rupees, up 3.5 rupees, and kerosene for 11 rupees,
up 1.5 rupees.
</P>
<P>
But NOC officials said they had no other choice because in the

million rupees (about 8.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Nepalese Transport Entrepreneurs (FNTE) has
also criticized the NOC's move and put forth its own demand for a

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica's banana exports in April, 9.7 million
boxes each weighing 18.14 kilograms, or 40 pounds, was an 11.4
percent increase over the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, in the previous three months, the country's
banana exports dropped 20 percent to 21.4 million boxes, because
of cold temperatures registered at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Banana exports in the first three months of 1996 were 25.6
million boxes.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chile's catch for the production and export of fish
meal and fish oil dropped 20.8 percent during the first five
months of this year, compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The five-month catch was 2,835,309 metric tons, versus the same
period of 1996's 3,580,015 tons. The drop is attributed to a ban
on the catch of yellow jack jurel in the country's center-south.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaragua ranks the world's 127th in terms of human
development, above Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas,
said a latest United Nations report.
</P>
<P>
Almost 2 million Nicaraguans, or 44 percent of the population,
survive with one U.S. dollar a day and 13.6 percent will not live
to 40, said the UN annual report on human development.
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Private investments in Colombia's
infrastructure reached 2.2 billion dollars in 1996, a 31.3 percent
increase over 1995, said the country's National Council on
Economic and Social Policies.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 1.8 billion dollars was in mining and energy
sectors, a 40 percent growth, and 140 million dollars in
transportation, a 43.5 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
QUITO -- Ecuador's foreign currency reserves, currently at a
high of 2.216 billion dollars, were some 220 million dollars more
than at the start of the year, said the country's Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the result of an "adequate" financial
operation of the Central Bank and the acceptance of the "exchange
auction" on the foreign exchange market, the bank said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The Central bank has been regulating the supply and demand of
dollars, a measure that some experts consider as a way to control
the exchange rate and prevent speculation.

BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Saving money in banks is no longer
the first choice of Shanghai residents, who are targeting more of
their earnings at the securities market and foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
A local survey by the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, showed that the growth of bank savings
deposits has been slowing down, together with a smaller increase
in their earnings.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai people are turning to a good combination of safety,
yields, and liquidity in money management, and more of them
distribute their money in a wider range of investment choices,
instead of the traditional way of relying solely on bank savings,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of the respondents said they would choose to
buy securities if the interest rates of savings deposits remain
unchanged, as against the 32 percent who would continue to take
bank savings as the first choice, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> 2,000-year-old Mint Found In Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Remains of a mint dating back to the
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD) has been found in Huxian county
in northwest China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Coins and moulds with inscriptions of date in the reign of
Emperor Wudi (140-86 BC) and a dozen different coins and moulds
from the Xin Dynasty (24-25) have been unearthed from the site,
suggesting that the mint was operational for more than a century,
Chinese archaeologists say.
</P>
<P>
They say that the find will contribute to the study of monetary
history and the development of coining technology.
</P>
<P>
The site, measuring 1500 m by 600 m, was divided into sections
of mould-making, smelting and coining, pottery-making, and that to
collected used moulds.
</P>
<P>
Also found at the site were quality tile ends and remains of
large building foundation made of rammed earth, traces of an
administrative agency for coin-making, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the site was probably where Qin Shi
Huang, China's first unifier who established the Qin Dynasty
(221-206 BC), smelt all weapons confiscated from the six other
states that he conquered.
</P>
<P>
It became a mint after Emperor Wudi of the Western Han Dynasty
re-took the coin-making power into the imperial court. In 118 BC,
the mint created coins bearing Chinese characters of "Wu Zhu"
(five zhu, one zhu equals 2.09 g).
</P>
<P>
Coins bearing "Wu Zhu" were also coined in later dynasties,
though their weight and size were different. Wu Zhu coins were the
largest in number and longest circulated money in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mang, a minister of the Western Han Dynasty who later
seized the power and set up the short-lived Xin Dynasty, continued
using the mint and created more than 20 different coins, a result
of his monetary reform.
</P>
<P>
The coins he made, such as knife-shaped ones and those bearing
Chinese characters of "Da Quan" (large spring), have long been
regarded as unique and exquisite and are sought after by scholars
and collectors.

<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China is expected to provide credit insurance to more than two
billion yuan's worth of exports in 2000, according to a senior

Dong also said his bank would continue to develop the financial
instrument for other export goods for better support to the
nation's foreign trade sector.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Criticizes Lack of Environmental Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Industrialized countries have
failed to honor the environmental commitments they made at the
Earth Summit in 1992, a senior Cuban official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Elena Simeon, Cuba's Science, Technology and Environment
Minister, made the denouncement before leaving for New York, the
United States, for a United Nations special session on environment.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Simeon said, it was clearly established at the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that the industrialized
world owes an ecological debt to the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
The indebtedness stems from the fact that industrialized
countries are the biggest polluters of the planet, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, only Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark have
fulfilled the commitment of delivering 0.7 percent of their gross
domestic product (GDP) as an assistance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, studies have shown that nearly 125 billion
U.S. dollars will be needed each year to undo the serious
environmental damage caused to mankind.
</P>
<P>
Simeon said the Cuban government defends the agreements signed
at the 1992 summit meeting and supports the unity of the
developing world behind the objectives of these documents.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. special committee will hold a special session on
environment issues on June 23-27, and preparatory meetings at the
level of experts and ministers will begin next week.

But Bjorkman found his form in the second set, breaking the
Sampras serve in the eighth game and surviving a torrid ninth game
with two break points to pull even.

Bjorkman broke Sampras in the first game of the third set. He
lost his own serve as Sampras drew level 4-4 then attacked again,
rushing the net and unsettling the world number one.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman broke to 5-4 then went in for the kill. Sampras
finally went down with a weak return on match point which the
Swede punished with a backhand volley.
</P>

Earlier Greg Rusedski became the first-ever Briton to reach the
tournmanent's semifinals. He beat French Open semifinalist Patrick
Rafter of Australia 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Cuts Borrowing, Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
has reduced further its overnight borrowing and lending rates by 1
percent in line with its goal of bringing down its short-term
rates to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
The central bank on Friday lowered its overnight borrowing rate
from 14 to 13 percent and its lending rate from 16 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rates indicate the levels at which the monetary authorities
are willing to borrow from or lend to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The further cut in the borrowing and lending rates was brought
by the relative stability of the foreign exchange market this
month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's overnight borrowing rate was at 11 percent
before it was raised to 20 percent at the height of a speculative
attack on the country's currency, the peso, last month.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials said earlier that the move to jack up
its overnight rates was just a temporary measure specifically
aimed at quashing the speculative attack against the Philippine
currency.
</P>
<P>
The peso Friday strengthened to 26.382 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is expected to further slash its rates to
levels prior to the speculative attacks last month.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Meeting to Study El Nino Phenomenon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Pacific Permanent
Commission (SPPC), made up of Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru,
has called for an emergency meeting on the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today here by SPPC secretary general Nicolas
Roncagliolo Higueras, who said the meeting will be held July 2 to
4 in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Roncagliolo said at a press conference here that oceanic and
atmospheric conditions have been registered since March in front
of the South American coasts, which correspond to the development
stages of El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
There were anomalies, he said, in the temperature of the
surface of the seas and even bigger anomalies in the coastal zones
of the SPPC member countries.
</P>
<P>
Roncagliolo said the emergency meeting is going to be attended
by scientists of the member countries, and it aims at preparing a
regional diagnostic of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also establish a mechanism for the following
of the evolution of the phenomenon and its effects, in addition to
recommending measures to be taken.
</P>
<P>
The SPPC, with headquarters in Lima, is a regional organization
created in 1952 to coordinate the maritime policies of its member
countries, with special emphasis on the conservation and the
rational use of maritime resources.
</P>
<P>
The recurrence of the El Nino phenomenon caused the SPPC to
establish the regional program for the study of the El Nino
phenomenon with the purpose of improving the region's scientific
capability to forecast and confirm the presence of the
phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Registration of Voters Starts in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The general registration of voters
for next year's local and general elections started across the
Philippines today, almost a year before the polling day.
</P>
<P>
About 40 million Filipinos are expected to be registered as
voters today, tomorrow and on June 21-22, according to the
country's Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
During the four days, registration starts at 07:00 and ends at
17:00 at 170,000 centers nationwide, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
However, the registration will continue on June 23 and will not
conclude until January 11, 1998, or 120 days before the elections
of the president, vice president, parliamentarians and local
officials. Voters who fail to register during the four-day general
listing are allowed to file registration applications with local
elections officers later.
</P>
<P>
But the Election Commission is calling on voters to register
soon to make the registration process smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, a qualified voter must have
reached the age of 18, and resided in the country for at least a
year before the elections and at least six months in the village
where he intends to vote.
</P>
<P>
Although the registration of voters has begun, both the ruling
party and opposition parties have not chosen their presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The country's Election Law provides that the official campaign
period does not begin earlier than 90 days before the day of the
election, or on February 9,1998, while the choice of presidential
candidates cannot be announced by their respective parties,
groups, or coalition earlier than 165 days before the May 19
election, or on November 26, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese navy has increased
exchanges with its counterparts throughout the world, sources with
the navy say.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's reform and opening-up in the late 1970s,
China's navy has received naval officials from more than 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
The visiting of warships between countries is becoming more
common internationally; early this year, two Chinese naval fleets
paid visits to countries in America and Southeast Asia, attracting
world attention.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, 21 Chinese naval ships, in 11 groups, have toured
14 countries, publicizing China's independent foreign policy of
peace, illustrating the navy's image and boosting ties with the
navies in visited countries.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the Chinese navy has received more than 60 visiting
warships from 20 countries since 1980. The United States sends the
most naval vessels to visit China; so far, eight warships have
come in four separate groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's navy has conducted more technological and
academic exchanges with its counterparts in other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Bombing Convict Condemned to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The federal jury in Denver,
Colorado, that found Timothy McVeigh guilty of bombing an Oklahoma
City federal building in 1995 in the worst terrorist attack in
U.S. history, today condemned him to die.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh was convicted of three counts of conspiring to blow up
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and eight counts of
murdering the eight federal agents who died in the blast that
killed 160 other people and injured hundreds.
</P>
<P>
The jury of seven men and five women heard more than two months
of testimony and deliberated four days before convicting McVeigh.
It took more than 10 hours for them to make the decision,
according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The state of Oklahoma has said it still intends to try the
29-year-old McVeigh in the 160 other deaths, which included
children at a day care center in the federal building.
</P>
<P>
A second suspect in the case, Terry Nichols, is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma City, along the fence where the bombed-out federal
building once stood, cheers erupted from people who had gathered
to learn McVeigh's fate.

<HEADLINE> Bullish Auction Mart of Arts In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Sales of artistic works in
Shanghai have been brisk this year. In this month alone,
collectors in the metropolis have witnessed a dozen satisfactory
auctions.
</P>
<P>
Leading local auction houses, such as the Shanghai Auction
Mart, Duoyunxuan Art Auction Co., Shanghai Dekang Art Auction Co.,
and Shanghai International Auction Co. Ltd. have all achieved
transaction records.
</P>
<P>
Dekang, for example, held a two-day auction attracting 500
bidders and relieving them of 17 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
One lot which aroused much interest was an oil painting of a
peasant woman by a female Chinese artist, Kang Jinmei. The work,
done in the early 1980s, eventually fetched half a million yuan
after 20 rounds of bidding. It is the highest price paid for an
artistic work by a Chinese female artist.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the Kang Jinmei canvas highlights the interest in
contemporary Chinese oil painting, which was generally neglected
in previous auctions. Eighty-five percent of the 40 oils offered
by the Shanghai International Auction Co. were sold.
</P>
<P>
However, traditional works of art still command the greatest
interest in the auction rooms. In the most successful sale, held
by Duoyunxuan, 35.5 million-yuan was spent by bidders, and 83
percent of the Chinese paintings and calligraphic works found new
owners.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that results from the auction houses in Shanghai
show the current health of art collecting, a far cry from the
depression it experienced soon after its appearance for the first
time in China in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Building Material Sector Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- China's building-material
equipment and machinery sector has made great progress during the
past 18 years, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Lian Jisan, chairman
of the China Building Material Machinery Industry Association, as
saying that the sector relied on imports until the 1980s and it
now includes scientific research, design and manufacture featuring
large scale and special technologies.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of advanced overseas technology has narrowed
the technology gap between China and other countries and has
contributed to the development of the building material industry.
</P>
<P>
The use of cement dry process production equipment with a daily
capacity of 2,000 tons and the float glass production line with a
daily capacity of 500 tons is a sign that China has reached a new
level in adjusting its production mix, Lian says.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has been exporting complete plants to produce
cement to Pakistan, Malaysia and Southeast Asian countries. The
proportion of local personnel operating the exported facilities
reached over 80 percent. China aims to enhance the localization of
the imported equipment and building machinery.
</P>
<P>
The rate for cement production equipment with a daily
production capacity of 2,000 tons will reach 90 percent and that
with a daily production capacity of 4,000 tons will reach 85
percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the exchanges between the Chinese technicians and
manufactureers and their foreign counterparts, an international
exhibition on cement technology and equipment will be held between
June 16 and 19 in Beijing, the paper says.

NEW YORK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar closed at its
strongest level against the mark in more than two years today and
ended higher in most other foreign-exchange dealings.
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7407 marks before
settling in New York at 1.7386 marks, up from 1.7300 Thursday and
the highest closing level since early February 1994. The gain left
the dollar 12.8 percent higher against the mark so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the currency's market's attention today was devoted to
the outlook for the euro. But most traders were betting that the
currency timetable would proceed.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at 114.89 yen in New York, up from 114.25
yen Thursday. The dollar ended slightly lower against the pound
due partly to the British currency's broad strength. Sterling cost
1.6363 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6316 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with late Thursday:
1.4440 Swiss francs, up from 1.4436; 5.8670 French francs, up from

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A report of a declined wholesale
price in May provided more fuel for the record-breaking stock
market here, with most index continuing to set new highs today.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 70.57 points to
7,782.04. It almost touched 7,800 one day after the blue-chip
barometer broke the 7,600 and 7,700 marks.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said prices paid to producers from farms
and factories fell in May for the fifth month straight. Today's
report was the latest evidence that inflation pressures are under
control, giving the Federal Reserve little incentive to raise
interest rates when it meets early next month.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip average is up more than 20 percent so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a more than 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 566.94
million shares as against 592.73 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also set records, including the Nasdaq
composite, which had lagged in previous sessions but rose today on
recovering technology issues.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 9.81 to 893.27, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 4.53 to 465.17.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index gained 11.81 to 1,423.13, and the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 3.98 to 630.10.
</P>
<P>
The market rose with bond prices after investors got yet another
good report on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were aided by bonds, where the 30-year benchmark
Treasury bond's yielding declined to 6.72 percent. Both markets
were also helped by a rise in the dollar as prospects faded in
Europe for a unified currency.

Madeleine Albright today expressed concerns over Turkey's
increasing tension between the government and the military.
</P>
<P>
"On the issue of Turkey, we obviously are watching and have

and about the role of Islam in a secular society," he added.
</P>

Turkey military officials have recently warned of the threat of
growing Islamist activism in the country, which they say is aimed
at making Turkey into an Islamic state, and have pledged to use

WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today it
was engaging in "telephone diplomacy" concerning the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is denying that it had been
sidelined in the peace process as Egypt stepped in to mediate,
aimed at reviving the stalled peace talks between the Palestinians
and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"We're right in the middle of it," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told reporters. He said Washington was in direct
contact with officials from Israel, the Palestinian Authority,
Jordan and Egypt through what he called "telephone diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat had "very nice meetings" Thursday
with Egyptian presidential envoy Osama al-Baz.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stepped in to mediate after U.S. efforts to get the
Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table fell flat.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Palestinians and Israelis suspended in March,
as Israel started constructions of a new Jewish neighborhood in
Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of
a future state.

UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Outstanding contributions
to the United Nations amounted to 2.448 billion dollars as of May
31, UN spokesman Fred Ackhard said here today.

<P>
Of the total, arrears to the regular budget stood at 743
million dollars and that to the peacekeeping operations at 1,693
million dollars. The International Tribunals were owed 9 million

Among the major contributors, the dues back of the United

The U.S. Congress recently discussed a bill on paying 819 million

including a string of U.N. spending cuts, a reduction in U.S.
annual contributions and other concessions.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls on Israel to Pay Qana Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly today
endorsed a resolution calling on Israel to pay nearly 1.8 million
dollars for damage resulting from its shelling of a U.N. base in
southern Lebanon last year.
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 66 in favor to 2 against (Israel, the United
States), with 59 abstentions, the assembly adopted operative
paragraph 8 of the text on financing the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which states that Israel shall bear the
responsibility for some 1.8 million dollars as the costs resulting
from the 18 April 1996 incident at UNIFIL headquarters at Qana,
Lebanon. In the incident about 100 civilians taking refuge were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The assembly then adopted the financing resolution as a whole,
by a vote of 127 in favor to 2 against (Israel, the United
States), with 1 abstention from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Israel rejected the decision, calling it "fundamentally flawed
and unprecedented," and said it was not morally or legally bound
to pay.
</P>
<P>
The UNIFIL budget for the 12-month period from July 1, 1997 to
June 30, 1998 is more than 126 million dollars, including the sum
charged to Israel. The peacekeeping operation, established in
1978, comprises some 4,500 troops and 490 civilians.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. inquiry last year found that Israel's shelling of the
Qana camp during a drive against Hizbollah guerrillas who had
fired rockets into northern Israel was unlikely to have been the
result of gross technical or procedural errors, though that could
not be completely ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly today appropriated over 850 million
dollars gross for the budgets of a dozen active peacekeeping
operations for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The amount reflects a substantial drop from the more 1.2
billion dollars sought for the previous 12 months period. All the
two dozen draft texts were approved without a vote, with exception
of that on the financing of the UNIFIL.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Jordan's Crown Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton will
meet with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan to discuss the Middle East
peace process and economic cooperation between Jordan and the
United States, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian crown prince, King Hussein's younger brother,
will also meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Defense Secretary William Cohen during his visit to Washington,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The discussion with the president and other cabinet members is
expected to include talks on the stalled Middle East peace
process, the officials said. Egypt has sought to jump-start peace
talks, but so far that effort has not been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
More U.S. aid to Jordan as a reward for its role in pushing the
peace process forward is also on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince is also expected to discuss purchases of
fighter jets and armored vehicles from the United States.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Announces New Inflation Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The British Labor government has
been accused of softening its anti-inflation stance after
Chancellor Gordeon Brown announced the new inflation target
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While setting a long-term target of 2.5 percent inflation, the
chancellor left room for it to fluctuate within 1 percent either
side.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the new target, Brown said, "Any economy at some
point can suffer from external events or temporary difficulties,
often beyond its control."
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a dinner Thursday night, Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England, expressed his approval of the
decision to abandon the old target for inflation of "2.5 percent
or less" set by former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
</P>
<P>
However, George made no reference to the fact that he would be
required to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor if
inflation rose beyond 3.5 percent or falls below 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to George to explain the new system of open
letters, Brown wrote, "The actual inflation rate will on occasions
depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances."
</P>
<P>
George also dismissed suggestions that the bank would be
over-zealous in its pursuit of low inflation, claiming that the
intention was "to aim consistently at 2.5 percent as a mid-point."
</P>
<P>
However, most City economists thought the new target was not as
tough as the previous "2.5 percent or less."
</P>
<P>
"It is a slight dilution of the existing position. I'm a bit
disappointed," said Geoffrey Dicks, chief UK economist at Natwest
Markets.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank of England used to see 2.5 percent as an upper limit
and were aiming for something less. This is a looser target," said
Jonathan Loynes at HSBC Markets.
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke claimed that Brown had relaxed
the 2.5 percent target as a direct result of the Labor
government's decision immediately upon coming into power last
month to give the Bank of England operational independence for
setting interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Clarke claimed that Brown was concerned that the bank governor
would "over-compensate" with higher interest rates in order to be
sure of meeting the chancellor's inflation target.
