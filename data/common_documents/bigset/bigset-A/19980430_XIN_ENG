<HEADLINE> U.S. Vice President to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States Vice
President Albert Al Gore is due in Saudi Arabia Friday for a
two-day visit, U.S. diplomatic sources in Saudi capital Riyadh
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency quoted the sources as saying that Gore
would meet Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz, discussing the U.S.-led efforts in reviving the
Mideast peace process and ways to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Gore would voice to Saudi leaders Washington's
keenness in advancing the Mideast peace process and breaking the
current deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross failed to persuade
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a
U.S. initiative aimed at reviving the peace process during his
recent visit to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal calls on Israel to hand back to the
Palestinians 13.1 percent more of the West Bank in its second
troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insists on handing back no more than 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gore's visit comes ahead of the May 4 London meeting during
which U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in an effort to break
the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the first leg on Gore's three-nation Mideast
tour, which also includes stops in Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government has been urging the U.S. administration
to make its utmost efforts to break the deadlock in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Gore's last visit to Saudi Arabia was in March 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers Urged to Support Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese trade union leader
today urged the country's workers to show understanding to and
support the country's reform efforts, correctly handle the
relationship between national and personal interests, and play an
exemplary role in safeguarding social stability.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, made this remark this afternoon, at a major gathering
marking the upcoming May 1 International Labor Day in the Great
Hall of the People in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"State-owned enterprises are the pillars of China's national
economy. The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
plans to help most state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises
that are suffering losses now to overcome their economic
difficulties within a period of less than three years," said Wei,
who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
To attain this goal, he said, it is indispensable to have the
enthusiastic support and active involvement of the broad masses of
the workers, who constitute the "fundamental propelling force" for
the reform.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the massive layoffs by state enterprises in
recent years to duplicated or aimless construction, poor
enterprise management and the irrational employment system and
policies under the planned economy long practiced in China.
</P>
<P>
"To raise the efficiency of enterprises by laying off their
redundant workers should be regarded as an inevitable historical
step, which, fundamentally speaking, is conducive to economic
growth and in line with the long-term interests of the working
class," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that this step has also been causing
temporary difficulties for some Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we can find a good solution to the problems in the
lives and re-employment of the laid-off workers has a bearing not
only on the success of state enterprise reforms, but also on the
consolidation of social stability and the socialist system," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Party committees and governments at all levels to make
painstaking efforts and take effective measures to ensure the
basic living standards of the laid-off workers, especially those
experiencing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Our Party's principle of wholeheartedly relying on the working
class must be unswervingly adhered to at all times and under all
circumstances," said Wei, adding that trade unions across the
country should be guaranteed full support in performing their
basic duty of safeguarding workers' legitimate rights and
interests, as well as the right to work independently according to
law.
</P>
<P>
At today's gathering, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
also announced its decision to honor 1,000 model workers and 300
model work units, which has become a regular ritual performed
around each year's Labor Day.

<HEADLINE> UK Rejects Demands for More POW Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government Wednesday
ruled out the possibility of demanding more Japanese compensation
for surviving prisoners of war (POW) camps during the Second World
War.
</P>
<P>
Some of the British surviving veterans have insisted that the
1951 peace treaty must be reopened so that they can receive more
cash payments from the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliamentary debate on the issue Wednesday
afternoon, British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett said
that in 1955 the British government had already studied the case
for challenging a 1951 treaty under which Japan paid small sums of
money to camp survivors.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said, "The preliminary legal advice that I have
received is that it is not in fact now open to the government to
reopen the provisions of the peace treaty on this basis."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the British government in 1955 had closed its
options by deciding not to reopen the British agreement with the
Japanese on the basis of the Swiss accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an
interview on the Internet that it was important that this dispute
should not damage Britain's harmonious relations with Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I understand how people might feel about this but it is
important to recognize that our relationship with Japan, which is
an extremely important one, must look forward as well as back."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Concerned at Nigerian Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Pretoria Wednesday
expressed its concern over the sentencing of 26 Nigerian military
officers and civilians found guilty by a military tribunal for
plotting a coup against the Nigerian military government.
</P>
<P>
The verdict handed down Tuesday included six death sentences,
among them the former chief of general staff, Oladipo Diya, and
two former cabinet ministers, Abdulkareem Adisa and Tajudeen
Olanrewaju, who allegedly plotted to overthrow the military
regime of Sani Abacha in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement Wednesday
that the South African government "strongly urge the Nigerian
military government to refrain from carrying out the six death
sentences handed down."
</P>
<P>
The South African government had noted that the trial had not
taken place in an open court, and that the defendants had been
represented by military lawyers, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The special military tribunal was required to submit the
sentences to the provisional ruling council for confirmation. If
they were confirmed, the accused could be executed by firing
squad.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also called on the Abacha government to consider
the effects on Nigeria "at this critical juncture in its
history."
</P>
<P>
It warned of a likely "adverse reaction, both inside Nigeria
and internationally," which would have impact on all levels of
Nigerian society and its interaction with the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Abacha has been nominated as the only candidate in Nigeria's
presidential elections set for August 1. The absence of even a
token opposition candidate has prompted international criticism.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Members Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) here today approved the list of
members of the Preparatory Committee of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee will be set up in May this year, with
its headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Five natives of Macao were elected as vice-chairmen of the
preparatory committee, among whom is Ho Hau Wah, a 43-year-old
industrialist. Ho is also a member of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that the preparatory committee, including leaders from
all walks of life in Macao, will make decisions in accordance with
the long-term interests of the people of Macao, who will surely
support the work of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's successful return to the motherland will assist the
members of the preparatory committee to carry out their duties, Ho
noted.
</P>
<P>
Macao will become a special administrative region under the
concept of "one country, two systems" after its return to
China on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The members of the committee from China's interior area are
quite familiar with Macao affairs, and have cooperated with their
counterparts from Macao in drafting the Basic Law of the Macao
SAR, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the existing friendly cooperation between
the governments of China and Portugal is a key to the smooth
transition of Macao. He expressed the hope that the two
governments would continue their sound cooperation in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Preparatory Committee will start
work right away on tackling the temporary economic difficulties
and slow progress of localization of civil servants in Macao,
problems which have aroused the serious concern of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ho said, the duty of the committee is to make
preparations for the future Macao SAR government, and Macao people
should also rely on themselves to solve some of their problems.
</P>
<P>
It is a challenge and an opportunity for Macao people to show
their wisdom and courage to work for a better future for Macao,
Ho said.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Peony Cultivation Base Plans Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Heze City in east China's Shandong
Province, already the world's largest peony growing base, plans to
further increase its peony growing area from the current 2,000
ha to 3,300 ha by the year 2000, according to Mayor Wang Hao.
</P>
<P>
Heze's peony output accounts for more than 80 percent of
the country's total, with annual sales of nearly one million
flowers, the mayor said, noting that the city exports peonies
to more than 30 countries, including Japan, the United States, the
UK, the Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said that Heze will give full play to its peony resources
and is carrying out multi-purpose utilization of the flower.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment is welcome, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Peony cultivation in the area dates back more than 600 years.
During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) its peony cultivation fields
reached 33 ha, and peony flowers sold well as far as to Guangzhou,
Tianjin and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Heze will hold its seventh peony festival May 22-28, hoping to
attract investment for the industry from both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Heze is also known as the historical setting for the classical
novel, Outlaws of the Marsh.
</P>
<P>
China has three major peony-cultivation bases; the other two
are Luoyang City in central China's Henan Province and Taiyuan,
capital of north China's Shanxi Province.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Fall in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. new home sales
plunged 5 percent in March, following healthy growth in the
previous two months of this year, the Commerce Department said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Even with the March drop, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 828,000 homes, sales for the first three months of the year
looked healthy.
</P>
<P>
They were 3.8 percent higher than the corresponding period of
1997, and 1997's total for the full year, 804,000, was a 19-year
high.
</P>
<P>
The fair strong sales have been attributed to low mortgage
rates, which make monthly payments more affordable, and strong
income growth. Sales got an extra boost in January and February
from unseasonably mild weather.
</P>
<P>
February's sales rate, 872,000, was revised down from an
initial estimate of a record 893,000.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new home sales decrease in March, existing home
resales set a record, rising 2.5 percent to a rate of 4.77
million, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
By region, new home sales fell 5.1 percent in the South to a
rate of 334,000, lowest in 17 months. They dipped 7.9 percent in
the West to a rate of 222,000 and 4.1 percent in the Midwest to
185,000. But they were unchanged in the Northeast, at 87,000.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the decline in sales allowed an increase in the
inventory of unsold homes to a 4.3-months supply. That's up from a
record-matching low of 3.9 months in February.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home was 153,900 dollars in March, up
4 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Aircraft Violate Cyprus Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military aircraft
violated Wednesday morning the Nicosia Flight Information Region
(FIR) and Cyprus' airspace on two separate occasions, Cyprus
News Agency (CNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CNA quoted National Guard sources as saying that two Turkish
F-16 military aircraft entered the Nicosia FIR for about 30
minutes, in violation of International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) regulations.
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, two turkish reconnaissance RF-4 aircraft
violated Cyprus' airspace and flew from the west to the east of
the island's Turkish-occupied northern part for about 25 minutes,
the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
The violations took place during the two Turkish military
exercises code-named "Taurus 1/98" and "Determination 1/98" that
got underway on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish army in Cyprus is participating in the Turkish
navy and airforce exercises, between April 28-30.
</P>
<P>
The exercises are conducted in northern Cyprus and Eastern
Mediterranean international waters and airspace.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops on the island and took over the northern third in the
aftermath of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", where Turkey maintains a
40,000-strong military force.

<HEADLINE> More Patients Sue Doctors in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- More and more British patients are
suing their doctors nowadays for compensation, according to
figures released by the Medical Defense Union (MDU) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The MDU, which represents approximately 80,000 doctors in
Britain, said in its annual report that there has been a 15
percent rise in the number of legal actions brought by patients
against doctors in 1997 over the previous year and a similar
increase in the value of compensation payouts.
</P>
<P>
The most common claims against doctors are for the prescription
of wrong drugs, failure to diagnose a medical condition and
problems relating to pregnancy and labor.
</P>
<P>
Julia Neild, head of the claims handling department at the MDU,
said the figures reflect the general increase in legal actions
against the medical profession since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence of a fall in standards but with the
introduction of various charters, people's expectations are much
greater," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also warned that if plans to introduce a "no win, no fee"
legal system for medical negligence claims go ahead, there may
well be an increase in litigation against doctors.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Producer Inflation at 28-Year Low in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's production
price index fell 0.2 percentage points to 2.3 percent in March,
the lowest level in 28 years, the central statistical service
(CSS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The index hit the 2.1 percent level in May, 1970.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the index, a major precursor of consumer
inflation trend, was largely due to decreases in prices of
petroleum products, electricity and mining and quarrying
products, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Decreases in these prices were counteracted by increases in
the prices of food, textiles and chemical products, resulting in
a monthly decrease of 0.1 percent, the CSS said.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted index increased by 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of increase in the producer price index for
locally produced commodities was 3.3 percent in March, compared
with the corresponding annual rate of 3.6 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price index for imported goods reflected an
annual decrease of 1.9 percent compared with the corresponding
annual rate of -2.3 percent in February.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak-Gore Meetings to Propel Ties, Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President AL Gore will
arrive in Cairo next week for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to add a fresh impetus to bilateral ties and the Mideast
peace-making, an Egyptian diplomat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gore will get acquainted with Egypt's evaluation of the current
Mideast situation in advance of the May 4 London meetings of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Egypt's Ambassador to the U.S. Ahmed Maher was quoted by the
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of views aimed at rescuing the dwindling peace
process also comes after the talks Mubarak held Tuesday in Cairo
with Netanyahu and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near
East Affairs Martin Indyk, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cairo became a venue of contacts in the past few days for various
parties working to revive the peace process which has been stalled
since March 1997 over Israeli settlement buildings in Arab East
Jerusalem and long-delayed redeployment from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far failed to persuade Israel to give in to a
13.1 percent withdrawal plan after the Palestinians have endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the peace-making, Egyptian and American officials
expect the Mubarak-Gore meetings to invigorate economic relations
and the four sub-committees of the Egyptian-American Presidential
Council which "move at a slow pace and need a push."
</P>
<P>
The two-day meetings will tackle all facets of bilateral
relations, especially the development of the U.S.-Egyptian
partnership program, Maher said.
</P>
<P>
The meetings of both delegations will focus on means of
encouraging American investments in Egypt and facilitating the
entry of Egyptian exports into the U.S, he added.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said two agreements will be signed on the
sidelines of the meetings to promote cooperation in environment
and the medium and small industries.
</P>
<P>
Gore will be accompanied by a delegation grouping the assistant
secretary of state for economic affairs, the deputy assistant
secretary of trade, deputy secretary of state for economic affairs
and the deputy director of the American International Development
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Gore's visit falls within the context of a regional tour that
includes Saudi Arabia and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Oxford Falls Down at UK University Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Oxford, Britain's world famous
academic institution, has fallen behind some less famous
universities in the country to rank the third at the UK university
premier league, according to a survey published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first Financial Times survey of UK higher education found
that Oxford, Britain's once undisputed intellectual powerhouse,
has fallen behind not only Cambridge but in some respects also the
less famous London's Imperial College.
</P>
<P>
The table established by the survey recorded performance across
16 categories, ranging from entrance requirements to library
expenditure and a total score has been calculated.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that Cambridge beats Oxford in almost
every department, with tougher entry requirements, a better
teaching and research record and a higher proportion of research
students.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the survey signals the end of Oxford's
stranglehold on the higher education system and could spark new
calls for urgent reform in the institution.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Peter North, a former vice-chancellor of
Oxford, has earlier said that the university was at risk unless it
modernized.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Chairs Joint Meeting on U.N. Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
here Wednesday chaired a joint meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council and the Command of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported the meeting discussed the
position of the United Nations Security Council in light of the
principles announced in a statement by the decision-making body in
April 16.
</P>
<P>
The April 16 statement demanded an immediate implementation of
Paragraph 22 of the U.N. Security Council resolution 687 as a
prelude to an overall lifting of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This paragraph provides for an easing of sanctions once all
Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic weapons have
been scrapped and steps taken to ensure that they cannot be
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's deliberations Monday have not reached
any consensus on Iraq's weapons files, so the sanctions imposed
on Iraq since 1990 will remain in place.
</P>
<P>
INA said that the Iraqi leadership decided the joint meeting
will continue to consider the report to be presented by Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf on his contacts and talks with
the U.N. secretary-general and Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf is in New York to watch closely the discussions of
the Security Council. He is expected to come back home very soon,
INA said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says No to Dictates in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu held here Wednesday a third meeting with U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross, while reaffirming his rejection to any dictates
in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu met with Ross in the Prime Minister's Office late
in the afternoon to continue talks on the controversial U.S. peace
plan calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli pullback in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Netanyahu, Ross held talks with chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in the West Bank town Jericho
to discuss the pullback and other issues. Ross will also travel
to another West Bank city Ramallah to hold the second meeting with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat later
in the day.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who launched the latest shuttle mission from last
Saturday, tried to persuade Netanyahu to accept the U.S. plan in
order to secure the success of the May 4 talks, to be held in
London by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright with
Netanyahu and Arafat separately.
</P>
<P>
It seemed so far that Ross has achieved little in compromising
Israel's intransigency in rejecting the U.S. plan. Netanyahu has
declared that his government would not accept any pullback
exceeding 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu repeated on Wednesday his refusal to accept what
he called "dictates" from anyone, saying Israel alone will
determine its security.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio on the eve of Israel's
50th anniversary, Netanyahu said he hoped the London talks would
achieve progress in breaking the year-long peace stalemate. But
he urged all those who wish the talks a success to make
contributions, and not Israel alone.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Israel will never accept any dictates, because
if it accepts them in the interim talks, then such tactics will be
used again in the crucial final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Ask Gore to Stop Russia-Iran Nuclear Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel will ask U.S. Vice
President Al Gore to prevent Russia from providing nuclear
technology to Iran, said an Israel government official here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
told the Israel Radio that the Israeli side will raise this issue
with Gore during his visit here, and ask him to pressure Russia to
stop providing such technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israel can not allow Iran to seek and develop such technology
because it will pose direct threat to Israel's national security,
Bar-Illan said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Gore is personally in charge of this issue and could do
something to prevent Russia from providing nuclear technology to
Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gore is expected here Thursday to attend Israel's 50th birthday
celebrations. He will hold talks with Netanyahu and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat on ways to break
the impasse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In the Israeli cabinet, Industry and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky is recently in charge of the Russian-Iranian nuclear
technology issue. He traveled to Russia and the United States in
the past months aimed at trying to stop the Russian-Iranian deal.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that Russia has provided such nuclear technology
which could help Iran develop nuclear and ballistic missiles, but
could not give any evidence in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Factions Closer to Final Accord on Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia and the rival Northern Alliance made significant progress
in their talks here Wednesday as the two sides agreed to nominate
20 members each for a proposed Ulema (religious scholar)
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fantastic success in my assessment," said James Ngobi,
acting head of the U.N. Special Mission for Afghanistan, after the
two sides concluded the forth day of their talks Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi told reporters that the Joint Steering Committee, made up
of five Taliban and nine alliance delegates, continued
consideration of more topics relating to the Ulema Commission,
which would decide the political setup of the future Afghan
government.
</P>
<P>
The committee decided that each side should send a delegation
of 20 members to the Ulema Commission and each delegate to the
commission will "bring a letter of guarantee and authority that
the decision taken by the commission will be implemented," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan diplomat said other matters relating to the
commission will be considered at a future session or meeting of
the steering committee.
</P>
<P>
The intra-Afghan talks ran into a deadlock earlier this week
because of differences between the two sides over the composition
of the Ulema Commission.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said the committee has started consideration of other
items on its agenda starting with a cease-fire and the release of
POWs by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The committee decided these two items should be effected at
the time of convening the Ulema Commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the date for establishing the Ulema Commission
has not been set yet. "It's one of the items remaining, it is on
the agenda Thursday."
</P>
<P>
Asked if a moratorium on launching military offensives by the
two sides will hold till an agreement is reached on cease-fire, he
said this will be discussed on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Denktash Firm in Stances on Resuming Cyprus' Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash is standing firm in his demand for recognition of his
breakaway state as the precondition for resuming peace talks with
the government, a Greek Cypriot daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the English-language daily Cyprus Mail,
Denktash claimed that time is going "in the wrong direction"
toward "complete separation" of the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third after a failed coup by
Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara against the
internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriots should really make up their minds. Do they
want a settlement or do they want the complete division of
Cyprus?" Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he would not go back to the negotiating
table unless his self-styled regime is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Denktash walked out of intercommunal peace talks sponsored by
the United Nations last summer in protest against European Union's
decision to start accession negotiations with the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
He insists that the negotiations be resumed on the basis of
"two states."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots do not accept the Cypriot government as
their own, Denktash said, adding the Turkish Cypriots have their
own administration, government and state.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think there is any chance of a settlement of the
Cyprus problem" if the Greek Cypriots do not accept this, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader said that he favors a four-party
conference attended by the two communities of the island, Turkey
and Greece for a solution to the protracted problem.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a visit to Cyprus on Friday by United States
Presidential Emissary Richard Holbrooke, Denktash said the
U.S. envoy will bring some ideas.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would give Holbrooke his own ideas and papers,
but refrained from elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to look into ways of breaking the deadlock
in the peace process and bring the two communities back to the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and other concerned parties have been trying to help
reunify the island in a bizonal and bicommunal federation. But so
far, no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Develops Method to Cure Genetic Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot scientist working in
Britain has developed a new method to treat diseases caused by
genetic problems, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Leonidas Phylactou, who is leading an Oxford University
research team investigating ways to cure genetic diseases, told
CNA that the current study utilizes the natural abilities of a
genetic molecule called ribozyme to repair the genetic defect
that gives rise to myotonic dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
Myotonic dystrophy is a common neuromuscular genetic disease,
for which there is still no ready cure.
</P>
<P>
Phylactou said it is still early before the method can be used
in patients with myotonic dystrophy. However, its potential is
tremendous since it interferes directly with the genetic problem
and repairs by "molecular surgery."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the system can be widely applied to many other
diseases of genetic origin, he added. The findings of his current
research were published in the leading scientific journal
"Natural Genetics," on April 1.

MAPUTO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said here Wednesday that Mozambique should do its best
to help solve the problems in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with Salim Himidi, special envoy of
Comoran President Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim, Chissano said he
concerned very much about the situation in the Comoros and would
forward the issue to French President Jacques Chirac who is
expected to visit Mozambique in June.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that Mozambique's effort to help the Comoros
should be accomplished through the Secretariat General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president also promised to report the situation
of Comoran political crisis to Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, the acting chairman of OAU to "find out a quick
solution."
</P>
<P>
The Comoran official said that Comoran president expressed his
disappointment over the oppositions' refusal for OAU mediation in
his letter conveyed to Chissano by the special envoy.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Abdoulkarim urged the OAU to give more concern
to the Comoran crisis and hold a high-level meeting over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Comoran political crisis started in August 1997 when
people on Anjouan, one of the four islands in the Comoros
demanded the island separate from the country.

<HEADLINE> UK Still Opposed to Neutral Venue for Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government Wednesday
reaffirmed its opposition to the proposal of allowing two Libyans
to stand trial in a neutral country for the bombing of a Pan Am
airliner that killed 270 people over Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on Libya since
1992 for failing to extradite the two suspects named Abdel Baset
Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah to Scotland to
face a trial.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to break the deadlock, British MP Tam Dalyell asked
the British Labor government to be more flexible in responding to
willingness by Libya to send the two suspects for trial to a
neutral place in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett told
the House of Commons Wednesday that it would set a bad precedent
if individuals or countries accused of terrorist crimes could be
tried in the place of their choice.
</P>
<P>
"The most appropriate place is a Scottish court and the
Scottish legal system," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett stressed that the British and American government
positions on this issue remained unchanged and U.N. experts had
certified that the two Libyans would get a fair trial in Scotland.

<HEADLINE> Europe to Help Modernize Egypt's Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Europe is to grant Egypt more than
1 billion dollars to help finance an industry renovation program
to be implemented over the coming three years, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement Wednesday by Egyptian Assistant
Foreign Minister Gamal Bayoumi upon his return from Brussels,
where patcipated in a meeting of 27 European and Arab countries to
assess the European-Mediterranean partnership, better known as the
"Barcelona process."
</P>
<P>
He said the grant will be earmarked for updating Egyptian
industry before it would face strong European competition when the
policy of trade liberalization is carried out.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "this policy will not be seriously put into
effect before the year 2008," which gives Egypt enough room to
prepare for the new situation.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which ended in Brussels Tuesday, had dwelt
on the impact of a unified Europe on trade with the southern
Mediterranean states, which involve eight Arab states, namely
Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), he said.
</P>
<P>
The partnership between the 15 EU member states and 12
countries along the southern mediterranean basin, is aimed at
developing political, economic, cultural and social ties and
establishing security. Their first conference was held in
Barcelona, Spain, in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean foreign ministers will meet in Palermo,
Italy, in June to review all resolutions adopted during the
Barcelona meeting, Bayoumi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Four Arab countries, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and the PNA have
signed partnership agreements with Mediterranean EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Algeria are expected to be among the
countries which will conclude similar agreements with the EU
soon.

<HEADLINE> 5 Nuclear States Pledge to Reduce Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Five nuclear states, China,
France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, have
reaffirmed their determination to continue the pursuit to reduce
nuclear weapons globally with the ultimate goal of eliminating
those weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the earliest ratification of the treaty by
all states," the five said in a statement issued here Wednesday
following a session of the preparatory committee for the 2000
review conference of the parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee meeting is being held here in Geneva
from April 27 to May 8.
</P>
<P>
The five also reaffirmed their readiness for the immediate
commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the
Conference on Disarmament on a convention banning the production
of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices.
</P>
<P>
Such a treaty, the statement said, will strengthen the
international nuclear non-proliferation regime and will constitute
a significant step towards the eventual achievement of nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize the importance of the faithful adherence of all
states parties to their respective non-proliferation obligations
under the NPT and Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaties," the five
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We supported the re-establishment of an ad hoc committee on
effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear weapon
states against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in the
Conference on Disarmament, as part of the decision adopted by the
conference on March 26, 1998," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the five said that they welcomed the adoption
on May 15, 1997 by the Board of Governors of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of a Model Additional Protocol
containing measures which, when implemented, will strengthen the
effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards system
as a contribution to global nuclear non-proliferation objectives.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all states which have not yet done so to start early
negotiations with the IAEA and to conclude their Additional
Protocol negotiations in accordance with this model as soon as
possible," said the three-page statement.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the development and emphasize the importance of
peaceful uses of nuclear energy which is used increasingly in many
sectors of the economy, not just for the production of electricity
but also for the improvement of the health and welfare of
mankind," the five nuclear states said.
</P>
<P>
The five said that they would commit themselves towards
cooperation in the field of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes
without discrimination and in conformity with relevant articles of
the NPT.

LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Wednesday

African country.
</P>
<P>
Britain's International Development Secretary Clare Short,

Sudan and the factions in the South -- to agree (to) an immediate
cease-fire so that the necessary supplies can be delivered
urgently."
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not lack of food supplies or money, but delay
caused by the government of Sudan in permitting access," she
added.
</P>
<P>
She also called on the international community to put strong
pressure on the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army to reach a peace agreement at peace talks due to
start in Kenya in May.

<P>
MOGADISHU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Intellectuals, politicians and
elders from the Habar Gidir clan of Hussein Mohamed Aidid
Wednesday appealed to the warring parties of Southern Somalia to
withdraw their forces.
</P>
<P>
At a large meeting in Hodon District here, the elders urged
that the warring sides of Majerten and Marehan sub-clans pulled
their forces back to their places of origin.
</P>
<P>
The appeal also said that all troop reinforcement from Gedo
and Northeast regions of Somalia to Lower Jubba should be stopped
so as to minimize the extent of the fighting which they said has
already resulted in deaths and an influx of refugees into the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The signatories of the appeal included Osman Ali Atto and
General Mohamed Nur Galal and they also asked the warring sides
to honor the Lower Jubba peace treaty signed by the clan
representatives of the region in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
The troubled Southern region of Lower Jubba is quiet Wednesday
after experiencing almost a week of fighting between the Majerten
and Marehan sub-clans of Darod.
</P>
<P>
The Majertens have made territorial gains of more than 100 km
North of the Southern port town of Kismayu. The gained
territories include areas earlier controlled by factional leader

<HEADLINE> Intra-Afghan Talks Make Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- After a three-day deadlock, the
Intra-Afghan talks held here Wednesday afternoon made further
headway as the Islamic Taliban militia and the rival Northern
Alliance chalked out details about the formation of a Ulema
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Joint Steering Committee, made up of five
Taliban and nine alliance delegates, has agreed to nominate 20
members from each side to form the council of religious scholars,
James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N. Special Mission for
Afghanistan, announced here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fantastic success in my assessment," said Ngobi, who
is presiding over the on-going talks, after the forth day of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the steering committee also agreed that each delegate
to the commission, will "bring a letter of guarantee and authority
that the decision taken by the commission will be implemented."
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan diplomat said other matters relating to the
commission will be considered at a future session or meeting of
the steering committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also started consideration of other items on
its agenda starting with a cease-fire and the release of POWs by
the two sides and it will continue the talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The committee decided these two items should be effected at
the time of convening the Ulema commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the date for establishing the Ulema (religious
scholar) Commission has been set, Ngobi said, "Not yet, it's one
of the items remaining, it is on the agenda on Thursday."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about when the Ulema list would be
provided, he said, "It is not easy, it is not the time to say, but
it (the discussion) will continue."
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty shrouding the talks began to fade Wednesday
morning when the Taliban and the alliance suddenly softened their
positions and reached an agreement on the Ulema Commission, which
would decide the future political setup of a central government in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-point agreement, each delegation will submit a
list of Ulema for the commission; neither side will have the right
to veto any names on the proposed list; the deliberations and
decisions should be completed and implemented in accordance with
the principles of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which has actually prevented the intra-Afghan
talks from collapsing, received warm welcome from both delegations
and the United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, Pakistan and Iran, which have played a key role in
bringing the Afghan factions to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad and satisfied with the achievement through
dialogue," Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Mohammad Mehdi
Akhoundzadeh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that it would put an end to hostilities
in the war-shattered Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman described the agreement as
a "landmark" that would lead to durable and lasting peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed his confidence that both parties would
continue their deliberations in the future in the spirit of
cooperation and accommodation, so that the Afghan people may enjoy
the peace for which they have made tremendous sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the first formal encounter between the Taliban and
the Northern Alliance, had to be suspended Monday as the two sides
bogged down in the definition of the Ulema. In the talks reopened
Tuesday afternoon, the two Afghan rivals failed to end the
impasse.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had insisted that only those who have a degree from
institutions of Islamic education and teaching could participate
in the Ulema Commission while the alliance demanded some other
renowned figures like professors and politicians should also be
inducted into the commission.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Taliban Flexibility in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday called on the
Afghan Taliban militia to show flexibility in its peace talks with
rival National Islamic United Front (NIUF) in order to put an end
to the protracted civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Although the mere presence of the Taliban at the negotiations
is indicative of a turn around in their policies, this turn around
would be meaningful only if they show the flexibility needed to
reach a cease-fire, to exchange prisoners of war and to eventually
establish a broad-based government," Iran' special envoy for
Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Iran's official news agency IRNA, Boroujerdi said
that the limited authority of the Taliban delegation in Islamabad
talks, and the tough constraints they attach to their proposals,
have slowed down the progress of the talks.
</P>
<P>
There has been virtually no progress in the talks in Islamabad
between the Taliban and NIUF, led by Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani whose government was driven out of capital Kabul in
September in 1996.
</P>
<P>
They could not reconcile on a list of scholars who would help
negotiate an end to the civil war.
</P>
<P>
NIUF wanted a commission of learned men of all sorts while the
Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist group which presently rules
over two third of Afghanistan, insisted that only religious
scholars or Ulema should be included.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that Ulema are among the most respected
segment of the Afghan society, but they have had little role in
starting the war as well as its continuation.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, they can play a role regarding the crisis only if
others commit themselves to carry out their decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in order to achieve peace, it is the political
leaders that should reach an understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran supports the Afghan peace negotiations and regards
the Islamabad talks as a result of the first ever successful
cooperation between the U.N. and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and NIUF started talks on Sunday after the
mediation by U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Vows not to Cede Inch of Palestinian Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) Leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin Wednesday
vowed to continue struggle against Israel and not to give up any
Palestinian soil.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a pledge ... that we will not cede even an inch
of the Palestinian land to the enemy," Yassin said at a meeting
with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported .
</P>
<P>
Despite all the problems and the U.S. support for Israel, he
said, bound by the slogan "Victory or Martyrdom," the Hamas would
continue struggle until the liberation of Palestine and freedom
from "the occupiers' oppression."
</P>
<P>
Yassin stressed that the liberation of Palestine requires
patience, perseverance and sacrifice, saying that "this is a goal
we hope to achieve through divine blessings and the spiritual
support by world of Islam."
</P>
<P>
He termed the Oslo peace accord between Israel and the
Palestinians as "one-sided accord," saying the accord has helped
the Palestinians realize that liberation of Jerusalem is possible
only through a struggle against the Israeli occupation and
oppression.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader also praised Iran for its "outstanding stands
and spiritual support for Palestinian people's struggle to
liberate their lands."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi reiterated Iran's "spiritual support for
the Palestinians," expressing hope that the Palestinian nation,
through unity and support by the Islamic world, would achieve the
sacred goal of liberating all the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian problem has figured prominently in Iranian
foreign policy since the Islamic revolution in 1979, he said,
Palestine and the Al-Qods (Jerusalem) have always had a place in
the hearts of the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
Iran arrived here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Plane Abducted in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A small Caesna plane was
abducted by armed Somalis from the central town of Galkayo late
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness at Galkayo airstrip, two men and a
woman have asked the pilot to take them to Nairobi after off
loading a consignment of the green stimulant leaves known as khat
in the town.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the abductors who were armed with
pistols have shortly after taking off ordered the pilot to take
them to the town of Abudwaq of the central neighboring region of
Galgudud.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the abduction is not disclosed. But reports
close to the abductors said they have been trying to escape with
money they allegedly took from their relatives and business
share-holders.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly an hour later, the plane has been seen again
landing at the rough road just two kilometers South of Galkayo
town, 600 km North of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The plane owned by a Kenyan air company, Blue Bird, has
earlier crushed after its wheels exploded and the trees beside
the road have seriously scratched its wings.
</P>
<P>
The abductors have then escaped into the jungle after seizing
all the money the pilot has with him on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Mohamed Dhere who is himself a Somali Kenyan, told
elders who reached him that he was safe but robbed. The pilot
said he suggested to the abductors that he could take them to
Nairobi, Adado or Beletwein town which they refused, but he said
they asked him instead to take them back to Galkayo.

BUCHAREST, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The fifth conference of the
European ministers responsible for the youth ended here Wednesday,
highlighting the efforts deployed in clarifying the role the youth
are playing in today's societies, as well as their integration
into the modern society.
</P>
<P>
Education, its recognition and the starting of a dialogue
between generations for the insurance of a better and harmonious
social climate added up to the solutions put forth for finding the
resources necessary for the implementation of youth programs.
</P>
<P>
The participants underscored the necessity for education
flexibility to narrow inequality of chances on the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that special programs for combating
racism, violence, xenophobia and intolerance would enable the
youth to take a more active part in the Public affairs, which in
turn would help systems and mentalities to change.
</P>
<P>
The next conference of the youth ministers, scheduled to take
place in Greece, is expected to endorse a European charter of
youth's rights.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Reiterates Positions on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Government Spokesman Christos
Stylianides reiterated Wednesday that the Cyprus government wishes
for the resumption of negotiations under U.N. aegis with an aim
at reaching a bicommunal, bizonal federation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Stylianides said the
government remains firm in its positions on the resumption of
bicommunal talks for a settlement in Cyprus and is in expectation
of a visit here by U.S. Presidential Emissary, Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is coming to Cyprus on Friday and will remain here
until Monday, in an effort to achieve progress toward the
resumption of the stalled political dialog between President
Glafcos Clrides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman refrained from replying to questions on the
Turkish side's position on the peace talks, which he described as
"contradicting".
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash reiterated in an interview
Wednesday that he will not participate in negotiations unless his
regime in the Turkish occupied areas of Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
But two days ago the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman
announced that the recognition is not a precondition for
resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has demanded a change to the bicommunal basis on
which the U.N.-led peace talks are carried out, by which he and
President Clerides participated as leaders of their respective
communities.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has expressed readiness to continue
negotiations on this basis and not to accept any change that
would lead to a direct or indirect recognition of the breakaway
state in northern island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops on the island and took over the northern third in
the aftermath of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which is only
recognized by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Protect Amazon Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
announced here Wednesday morning its commitment to establish 25
million hectares of new protected forest areas by the year 2000
with the help of the World Bank and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
</P>
<P>
This is the single largest forest conservation and is the first
outcome of an alliance between the World Bank and the WWF to set
aside an ecologically representative network of forests around the
world.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech Wednesday, Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said that Brazil will join an effort launched
by the WWF to preserve 10 percent of the world's forests.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to note that the global commitment
proposed by the WWF in coordination with the World Bank is to
protect 50 million hectares in the entire planet until the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
"This decision will help preserve the abundant biodiversity in
this remarkable tropical region," said James D. Wolfensohn,
president of the World Bank. "It is a true gift to the Brazilian
people and, indeed to the world."
</P>
<P>
The world's forests are disappearing at an alarming rate.
Nearly two-thirds of the Earth's original forest cover has already
been lost.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months alone, forest fires have raged in
Brazil, across an area the size of Belgium. Home to an astounding
one-tenth of the world's plant and animal species, the Amazon
contains some of the planet's most important tropical habitats.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this move, Claude Martin, director general of WWF
International, said, "It is a crucial step forward for the WWF's
Living Planet Campaign in its goal to protect at least 10 percent
of the world's major forest types by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
To launch this commitment, President Cardoso Wednesday signed
decrees for two new protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon, and
two in the Atlantic Forest, totaling almost 600,000 hectares.

<P>
BUCHAREST, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A complete sun eclipse which
could be observed in Europe on August 11, 1999 and whose peak will
be in Romania is one of the most important events of this
end-millennium.
</P>
<P>
The event has aroused the entire world's attention to Romania,
both from the scientific and tourist point of view.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon is extremely rare, happening once in about 350
years. The eclipse will score its core in the nearby Ramnicu
Valcea town, South Romania, at 1104 GMT and will last two minutes
and 23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Astronomic Institute is the only of the kind
endowed with a solar observer on the eclipse's band.
</P>
<P>
Magda Savinschi, director of the institute, said the number of
tourists will reach half a million, meaning "an extremely large
figure for Romania's tourist capacity, given that August is a
holiday month."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Extend MONUA Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Wednesday decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) for a further
period of two months until June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also endorsed the recommendations by the
U.N. chief to complete the withdrawal of all military personnel,
with the exception of one infantry company, the helicopter unit,
the medical support unit and 90 military observers, no later than
July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council welcomed the recent steps taken by the
government of Angola and the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) towards completing the remaining
tasks of the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
These include promulgation of the law granting special status
to the leader of UNITA, the appointment of the remaining governors
and vice-governors nominated by UNITA, cessation of broadcasts by
Radio Vorgan and the arrival in Luanda of senior officials of
UNITA to prepare for the establishment of UNITA headquarters in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the government of Angola and in
particular UNITA to complete all remaining obligations under the
Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions,
including the normalization of state administration throughout the
national territory as well as disarmament of the civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
The council strongly condemned the attacks by members of UNITA
on the personnel of the MONUA, international personnel and Angola
national authorities, and demanded UNITA immediately stop attacks.
</P>
<P>
The council requested the U.N. secretary-general to submit a
report by June 17, 1998 on the status of the peace process, with
further recommendations regarding the mandate, size and
organizational structure of the MONUA or a follow-up United
Nations presence after June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The MONUA, established in June 1997, is aimed to supervise the
peace process in Angola.

<HEADLINE> International Labour Organization Calls for More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Labour
Organization (ILO) Wednesday called upon African leaders to
improve the lot of women workers in Sub-Saharan Africa by
providing more and better jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the ongoing international conference
on 'African Women and Economic Development' which was opened at
the United Nations conference center here Tuesday, ILO deputy
director-general Mary Chinery Hesse urged African leaders to take
concrete steps to implement the resolutions adopted by the Fourth
World Conference on women held in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
She said women make up one-half of the workforce in Africa,
but their activities are concentrated only in low paid jobs,
subsistence agriculture and informal sectors.
</P>
<P>
She blamed rampant poverty and the lack of educational
opportunities for women as the primary causes of female
unemployment and underemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Until the energy and entrepreneurship of women in Africa and
elsewhere are fully recognized and nurtured as the valuable
economic asset they are, future generations of African men, women
and children risk further poverty," she warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four-day international conference on Wednesday
continued its deliberations on themes of globalization,
information technology, conflict, education and training, health
and population as well as leadership in 22 groups.
</P>
<P>
The conference is organized by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) in connection with its 40th
anniversary to seek ways to improve African women's social and
economic status.
</P>
<P>
The conference will reach its climax on Thursday when UN
secretary general Kofi Annan makes keynote address at the plenary
session on "Post Beijing -- the Advancement of African Women".
</P>
<P>
The conference will conclude on Friday after closing remarks
made by the UN secretary general at the forum of heads of state
and government.

<HEADLINE> Paula Jones Files Appeal Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Paula Corbin Jones Wednesday
formally notified a federal judge that she was appealing the
decision that tossed out her sexual harassment lawsuit against
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The four-page notice filed Wednesday with the U.S. District
Court in Little Rock, Arkansas, said she would appeal the April 1
decision of Judge Susan Webber Wright to the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in St. Louis, Missouri, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyers later on will file formal arguments with the
appeals court, stating the reasons they believe the judge's
decision should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
Jones announced at a news conference on April 16 in Dallas that
she would continue to fight for a chance to tell her story in
court even though it meant additional hardships for her family.
</P>

case "worthy of submitting to a jury." She said there was no
evidence of criminal assault or of Jones being punished on the job
after the alleged incident.

Jones claims in her lawsuit that when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas in 1991, he propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel

promotion as a state clerk.

Clinton has repeatedly denied the allegations and said he does

Washington, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced here
Wednesday the approval of a 170 million U.S. dollar loan to
finance a privatization project in the state of Minas Gerais, one
of four state government privatization projects in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Three other projects are being carried out successfully in the

</P>
<P>
The latest project reinforces the state government's structural
reform program with the objective of selling two state-owned
deposit-taking banks.
</P>
<P>
This project will also support the state's concession program,
which will make more efficient gas delivery operations and highway
maintenance services and includes the privatization or
concessioning of GASMIG (Companhia Estadual de Gas de Minas
Gerais), the state-owned gas company.
</P>
<P>
State programs supported by the project also include
concessioning of 460 kilometers of state roads, development of an

<HEADLINE> 5 Soldiers of South Lebanese Army Wounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Five members of Israel's ally
South Lebanese Army (SLA) were wounded Wednesday evening in
attacks by the Hezbollah in south Lebanon, the Lebanese Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were caused at 20:00 local time (1700 GMT) when
the Muslim resistance force bombed SLA's Taier Harfai position in
the west of south Lebanon occupied by Israeli troops, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the area witnessed the most bloodiest fight
between the Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Israeli troops
this year, which left a Hezbollah fighter dead, six Israeli
soldiers, an SLA member and three Lebanese civilians wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance forces have been fighting to drive the
Israeli troops and the SLA out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Heavy casualties of Israeli troops have prompted the Jewish
state to seek a conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon through
negotiating security arrangements with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon has rejected Israel's offer, insisting that the
withdrawal be unconditional.

<HEADLINE> NATO Works on Detailed Plan for Post-SFOR Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO ambassadors agreed
Wednesday that the follow-on force to the Stabilization Force
(SFOR) will be a transitional force with an open-ended mission
focusing on restoring public order in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors at their weekly North Atlantic Council meeting
decided to review the post-SFOR mission every six months to gauge
whether it is time to reduce the size of the follow-on force and
transfer more task to the civilian.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, who declined to be named, said that some
benchmark criteria had been agreed at the council meeting at which
the timing for force reduction and task transfer will be judged.
</P>
<P>
The criteria included democratization, demining,
anti-corruption, return of refugees, detainment of indicted war
criminals and pluralistic way of governmental operation.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that there will also be a multinational
security unit within the follow-on force, consisting of troops
from Italy. Troops will also be contributed by Argentina and
possibly Poland.
</P>
<P>
The multinational security unit is a paramilitary force. So the
ambassadors had to discuss the coordination mechanism between this
unit and the International Police Task Force currently deployed in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led follow-on force will also see to it that the
Bosnian local media turns non-biased while disseminating
information.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR mandate expires in mid-June and the Western military
alliance is cooperating with the United Nations Security Council
for a mandate for the follow-on force.
</P>
<P>
The official said that also on Wednesday the NATO ambassadors
met and discussed with their Russian counterpart the issue of
nuclear transparency.
</P>
<P>
The discussion, described by the official as more like a
nuclear policy seminar with photos and graphics, centered on
tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Though declining to give figures, the official said that both
Russia and NATO had reduced their tactical nuclear weapons and
de-targeted the remaining tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that NATO had canceled three plans of
modernizing its nuclear weaponry and reduced its five types of
nuclear weapons to just one.

<HEADLINE> Lower Blood-Alcohol Limit Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Legislators and activists are
calling for a new nationwide drunk driving standard that would
lower the legal blood-alcohol level from the current 0.10 percent
to 0.08 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the House of Representatives and the Senate
must decide whether to include the proposal in the final version
of a multi-billion dollar federal transportation bill.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the new standard by a two-thirds majority
when it crafted its version of the bill last month, but the House
Rules Committee blocked the proposal from a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
If implemented, the proposal would withhold a portion of federal
highway construction funds from states that refuse to change their
blood-alcohol standards. The government used similar tactics to
convince states to adopt lower speed limits and to increase the
legal drinking age from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
Senator John Chaffee, a Republican and chairman of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee, said Wednesday he is
pressuring his colleagues on the conference committee to include
the Senate provisions in the final version of the bill. He said
the question will be resolved within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday, Chaffee and other federal and
state legislators said the drunk driving standards have triggered
incredible pressure from the beer and liquor industries.
</P>
<P>
Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat, who sponsored an
unsuccessful attempt to bring 0.08 up for a vote in the House,
said, "The alcohol lobby spent 8 million dollars on campaign
contributions, and sadly, they now appear to have gotten their
money's worth."
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the proposal infringes on states' rights, and
would unfairly penalize social drinkers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Angolan Ties Greatly Enhanced: Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Angola
Tamar Golan said here Wednesday that the cooperation between the
two nations "has been greatly enhanced" in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Golan told the press that since Israel opened its embassy in
Angola in July 1995, great progress has been made in their
cooperation in politics and economics, especially in such fields
as telecommunications, aviation, agriculture, diamond and
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Israel is helping the Angolan government in its effort to
resettle the demilitarized soldiers, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
She said that there is a broad prospect in their cooperation
in diamond industry because Israel with advanced technology has
rich experience in the exploitation and sales of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
As for the petroleum sector, NEFTA, an Israeli oil company, is
negotiating with the Angolan government. The company is seeking
the right for jointly exploring petroleum with the Angolan
state-owned oil company.
</P>
<P>
Israel has provided Angola with high-tech irrigation equipment
and helped the southern African country to train its technicians,
said Golan.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, a joint venture has been launched in the
suburb of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, her government also offers scholarships
for the Angolan officials to study in Israel. Some members of
the opposition National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) and some local government officials have received
professional training in Israel since April 1997 when the
government of national unity and reconciliation was established.
</P>
<P>
Golan also noted that four Israeli specialists have come to
Angola to work with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
in removing mines in some provinces of the country. And Israeli
mammalogist Tamar Ron has come to help the Angolan Environment
Ministry in conserving the endangered animal species.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador called on UNITA to make greater efforts
to accomplish all tasks stipulated in the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol. She said that the two warring sides should continue
their efforts to avoid a reccurrence of war.
</P>
<P>
She believed that peace will be achieved finally in Angola and
it will brighten the future of the Israeli-Angolan cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Foreign Exchange in Zambia to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The current shortage of foreign
exchange in Zambia is expected to end soon following a major plan
worked out with the assistance of the World Bank to boost its
copper production and export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Zambia governor Jacob Mwanza said here Wednesday that
the survival plan, coupled with increased export of
non-traditional goods, are expected to earn the country enough
foreign exchange to offset the current shortage on the financial
market.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the country's central bank told a weekly news
briefing at the State House that the shortage of foreign currency
has been caused by a number of factors such as the decline of
copper production and prices of the commodity at the London
market, non-release of donor aid to the country and the
importation of 250 tons of maize and mealie meal worth over 40
million U.S. Dollars between October 1997 and March this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the harvest season will see a reduction in food
imports thereby saving the scarce foreign currency while the
increase in the exports of cash crops such as soya beans,
sunflower and cotton will also help to stabilize the financial
market.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza said the central bank will through the open market
operations syphon excess local currency in circulation in order
to bring down inflation which rocketed by more than 20 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the next Paris Club meeting to be
held next month will give his couuntry a better change for
bilateral aid flow as well as help it qualify for debt relief
through the highly indeted poor countries initiative of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza also said that debt servicing has contributed to the
shortage of foreign currency.

<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index closed up 26.5 points or 0.46 percent

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British government officials said
here Wednesday the Middle East peace talks to be held in London
next Monday are unlikely to achieve major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will chair the
one-day talks, at which Israel and the Palestinians are expected
to discuss new American peace proposals, calling on Israel to
withdraw from 13 percent of West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman told reporters Wednesday afternoon,
"You can see from the noises coming from various quarters that
people are not expecting any significant breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Tuesday that it was up to the Palestinians to break the
deadlock and insisted that Israel should not risk its security for
a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that British Prime Minister Tony Blair is
expected to hold separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in London, but
made it clear that Britain would play a complementary role.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook played down the
prospect of substantial progress at the London talks by saying
Wednesday, "While there has been a commitment from both sides to
come, there has been no commitment to any specific deal."
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to have the opportunity to help advance the
(Middle East peace) process, but it will be difficult," Cook said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Africa has a very special place
within the International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization (INTELSAT) now and in the future, INTELSATt director
general said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening meeting of the INTELSAT Africa group one,
Irving Goldstein said that out of 142 members 42 are African
countries and many African countries depend on INTELSAT
satellites for their communications lifeline to the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 INTELSAT's revenue from Africa totaled over 84 million
U.S. Dollars, an increase of 15 percent over 1996 and 60 percent
since 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
Along with technological advancement, privatization,
liberalization, increasing investment and competition are the
driving forces behind the growth of telecommunications, he said.
</P>
<P>
Whatever changes INTELSAT, which was founded in 1964, is
experiencing as a result of the increased competition, its
commitment to the development of telecommunications on African
continent will remain as strong as ever, he promised.
</P>
<P>
In fact, about 60 percent of INTELSAT's assistance and
development activities are concentrated on African customers and
this forms an integral part of INTELSAT's sales and marketing
effort, said Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
Eleven countries including Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia,
Mauritius, Ghana and Angola are represented at the on-going
meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Wednesday reiterated that
its disputes over some Aegean islets with Greece should be
resolved through bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The problems between the two countries are so serious that
they can not be discussed in multilateral meetings," Turkish
Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a weekly press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Utkan rejected as "unacceptable to Turkey" the recent remarks
by Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos which claimed
sovereignty over the disputed islets.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over a number of issues
relating to the Aegean Sea, including the air space, sea-bed
minerals as well as sovereignty over some small uninhabited
islands.
</P>
<P>
In February, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem proposed
bilateral discussions on the Aegean issues but was rejected by
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Athens insists that the disputes be settled through arbitration
by the Hague-based U.N. International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
"Such a stance of Greece has made a solution to the thorny issue
more difficult," the Turkish spokesman said.

WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore on
Wednesday left for the Middle East both for the celebrations of
50th anniversary of Israel's establishment and for talks aimed at
finding ways to revive the deadlocked peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this trip is to celebrate Israel's 50th
anniversary and reiterate the United States' steadfast support for
its friend," Gore spokesman Jonathan Splater said.
</P>
<P>
And a White House official involved in preparation for the
trip, said the purpose of Gore's trip "is to promote the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"He's there to add his voice and perspective... He's not going
to negotiate or mediate," the official said. "That's for others."
</P>
<P>
Gore will meet with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Gore's trip to the Middle East was seen here as new U.S.
efforts to send a message to Middle East leaders, especially the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders, that the Clinton administration
would not let the year-long stalemate of the peace process
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president will be reinforcing our basic message --
that we'll be there for them if they take risks for peace," one
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will start separate talks
with Netanyahu and Arafat in London on May 4, the day Gore winds
up his Middle East trip.
</P>
<P>
Washington has cautioned the public not to pin great hope on
the upcoming London meetings as a U.S. proposal on percentage of
Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank was again rejected last
week by Netanyahu after his talks with U.S. special envoy Dennis
Ross.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Fully Implement UN Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nairobi, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela who is visiting Angola Wednesday said that his government
will fully implement United Nations sanctions against the rebel
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to information reaching here, the South African
President, speaking at the Angolan National Assembly, said that
South Africa "is ready to play whatever part it can in helping to
ensure that the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol are met and
that (U.N.) Security Council resolutions are adhered to."
</P>
<P>
President Mandels who is on his first state visit to Angola
told Angolan President Jose Dos Santos and the parliament that
his government as a member of the United Nations and the Southern
African Development Community is doing everything to comply with
the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Among other things, we have tightened control and
surveillance at airports that were being used to destabilize the
peace for which Angola has been working," said the South African
president.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa unequivocally supports the peace process,"
President Mandela said, adding that his government looks forward
eagerly to the final implementation of the provisions in a
peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
He said that the full realization of the potential for the two
nations to draw mutual benefit from their relationship with each
other, hinges on the success of the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the recent steps that have been taken in
compliance with the Lusaka Protocol," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated all those involved for putting the interests
of the whole nation before all else.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela also thanked Angola for the democracy it
helped his country achieve, saying that democracy "has brought us
opportunity to address the basic needs of our people."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the large business delegation accompanying him
testified to the fact that South African companies wish to lose
no opportunity to expand trade and investment ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Mandela will not meet UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi who has fear for his own safety and won't
leave his headquarters in central Angola.

<HEADLINE> 4,800 Cases of Breast Cancer Recorded in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- There are a total of 4,800 new
cases of breast cancer in Greece each year.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, 1,100 to 1,200 new cases of ovarian cancer are also
recorded annually, according to Greece's Athens News newspaper
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Greek experts believe that both breast and ovarian cancer are
hereditary and can be detected at an early stage through a blood
test which identifies genes known as BRC1 and BRC2.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 50,000 women in Greece are believed to carry the
gene and one in 10 women with breast cancer in Greece would have
inherited the trait.
</P>
<P>
BRC1 has been reportedly found in 87 percent of women with
cancer in one breast, in 50 percent of women with cancer in both
breasts and in 40-60 percent of women with ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
Experimental tests being conducted at two private Athens
hospitals and the state-run Agios Savvas hospital are now
providing Greek specialists with the hope of gauging a woman's
genetic predisposition to developing the disease.

<HEADLINE> ADB Group to Further Enhance Members' Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (ADB)
Group Wednesday pledged to further enhance the development of its
regional members so as to play a more active role in the
continent's development.
</P>
<P>
This is the aim of the group's current development policy and
operational objectives, said Beita Yusuf, an executive director
of ADB at the Pre-1998 ADB Annual Meetings Forum held here.
</P>
<P>
The ADB Group was established in 1964 for the purpose of
promoting the economic development and social development of the
African members of ADB.
</P>
<P>
The group consists of ADB, the African Development Fund (ADF)
and the Nigeria Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to Yusuf, the current development policy priorities
of the group emanate from Africa's overarching development
objectives, which focus on accelerating production growth,
promoting human resource development, reducing poverty and
establishing foundations for long-term sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
A substantial share of the group's resources will be accorded
to projects and programs in the agricultural and social sectors
because of their direct effects on poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The group, as a matter of fact, has mobilized and deployed
resources over the past years to finance projects and programs of
its regional member countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the bank group had cumulatively approved
over 2,000 loans and grants amounting to more than 33 billion
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The commitments, according to Yusuf, were made to 52 countries
and multinational institutions to support projects and programs
in agriculture, transport, public utilities, industry, education
and health.
</P>
<P>
It has also co-financed policy-based loans to support
adjustment and reform programs of governments of member countries
with an aim to enhance efficiency and the macro-economic
environment, Yusuf said.
</P>
<P>
The group's role in the development of Africa is also
reflected by its active involvement in the international
initiative for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries, which is aimed
at reducing the debts of eligible countries to sustainable
levels.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the group will enhance its catalytic role in private
sector financing, the official added.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Finance "Enclave" Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (ADB)
is to give more investment to export-oriented, commercial
projects in a fresh bid to boost the development of regional
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of ADB has just approved proposals to
introduce the financing of "enclave" projects in these countries,
Beita Yusuf, an executive director of ADB, disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The detailed guidelines should be finalized in the second half
of this year, he said in his keynote address at the Pre-1998 ADB
Annual Meetings Forum held here.
</P>
<P>
Enclave projects, Yusuf explained, are those "whose operations
are export-oriented and are run on commercial basis and can,
therefore, take and repay loans without assistance from the
government."
</P>
<P>
Such projects could be publicly or privately owned or a
combination of both ownership, with the main difference lying in
the size of ADB investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
While for normal private sector operations, the bank's
investment is generally limited to about 15 million U.S. Dollars
per project, enclave projects could be as high as 50 million U.S.
Dollars each.
</P>
<P>
According to Yusuf, this is an area where some of the
parastatals being privatized could benefit. But he did not
further elaborate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Health Insurers Sue Tobacco Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A United States coalition
representing health insurers from at least 35 states Wednesday
filed lawsuits against major tobacco companies, seeking
compensation for treating smoking-related illness.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition for Tobacco Responsibility, a network
representing 25 million Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance
policyholders, said they had filed the suits in federal courts in
New York, Chicago and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"These suits are our effort to begin to improve public health
by changing the behavior of the tobacco industry," said Michael
McGarvey, chief medical officer of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
New Jersey, told a Washington news conference.
</P>
<P>
McGarvey said, "We are accusing the tobacco industry of
conspiracy, fraud, misrepresentation and violation of federal
racketeering and anti-trust laws."
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits allege that the tobacco industry concealed the
addictive nature of smoking, manipulated nicotine levels to make
cigarettes more addictive and conducted research and marketing
campaigns targeting teen-agers and children.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department said that direct health care costs by
tobacco-related illnesses reach 60 billion U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross and Blue Shield provides health care coverage for
one in four Americans, or 68.7 million people, in all 50 states.
The amount of compensation the coalition is seeking for could be
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new lawsuits dramatically escalate the troubles of the
tobacco companies, which are under attack from the federal
government, states and public health advocates.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies had hoped to end most of the litigation
against them in a proposed settlement they negotiated with states
last June. But this month they abandoned efforts to get that
agreement approved by Congress and instead vowed to defend
themselves in court.
</P>
<P>
But President Bill Clinton has taken a hard line against Big
Tobacco, urging the industry to stop marketing to young people and
warning that legislation will come with or without industry
participation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the nation's fifth biggest cigarette company,
Liggett Group, agreed to cooperate in the government's criminal
investigation of the tobacco industry.

<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday lodged a protest
with Greece over the remarks by the country's foreign minister on
President Jacques Chirac, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodore Pangalos said Tuesday during
the European Union (EU) foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg
that Chirac "was uncontestedly the star of beauty contest...
before the Turkish government."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos made the remarks after French Minister for European
Affairs Pierre Moscovici described as "incomprehensible" the
veto by Greece to a 412.5 million U.S. dollar EU aid package to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The protest was delivered by French ambassador in Athens,
Bernard Kessejian, to the secretary general of the Greek Foreign
Ministry, Alexander Philon.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Greek government accused France of failing to
understand its position in its territorial dispute with Turkey
over some islands in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of the meeting between Kessejian and Philon was
heavy, said AFP.

<HEADLINE> G8 Urged to Guard Against Euro as Source of Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Eight (G8) leading
industrialized nations was urged Wednesday to make joint efforts
to ensure that the coming single European currency named euro
would not become a source of global financial volatility.
</P>
<P>
The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) said in a statement
issued ahead of next month's G8 summit in Birmingham, England,
that leading industrial governments and businesses should work
more closely together to design the rules for the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was delivered to G8 summit host British
Prime Minister Tony Blair by ICC President Helmut Maucher, said:
"As markets become increasingly global, so the need is rapidly
growing for more global rule-setting. And that means global
decision-making and leadership."
</P>
<P>
Maucher made it clear in the statement that the planned launch
of the single currency in January 1999 was a welcome aspect of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"But the introduction of the euro will require governments and
central bankers across the world, but particularly in G8
countries, to collaborate to ensure that this major development is
handled efficiently and does not become a source of global
financial volatility," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Asia's financial crisis had also demonstrated
the need for a stronger framework of laws, rules and institutions
to ensure the smooth running of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"It would be unfortunate if the Asian crisis contributed to a
growing perception in the public mind that the process known as
globalization is a threat rather than an opportunity," he said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The G8 comprises the United States, Japan, France, Italy,
Germany, Canada, Britain and Russia.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Urges ADB for Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Wednesday called on the African
Development Bank (ADB) to amend its charter in a view to better
supporting the economic integration efforts of the regional
economic groupings.
</P>
<P>
The important thing at present is how to develop a working
relationship and modalities between ADB and Africa's major five
regional economic groupings that do not violate the charter of
the respective institutions, a senior ECOWAS official said.
</P>
<P>
There are great possibilities for cooperation between ADB and
such groupings, R.D. Asante, head of ECOWAS money and payments
division, said in a keynote address at the Pre-1998 ADB Annual
Meetings Forum held here.
</P>
<P>
According to Asante, who spoke on behalf of the ECOWAS
Executive Secretariat, ADB's involvement in regional integration
programs has been low because it was set up at a time when
regional cooperation and integration schemes were not on the
cards.
</P>
<P>
"To enable the ADB to pay a more positive role in promoting
regional economic integration activities through the provision of
financial resources and technical assistance, its charter would
have to be amended to include provisions that make room for
financing regional integration activities of African countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he went on, ADB should assist regional economic
groupings by mobilizing the support of other international
financial institutions for regional economic integration, apart
from its own efforts to manage the matter.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that ADB create a department of African economic
integration to formulate policies and strategies, and to provide
advice, monitor and follow-up on implementation of cooperation
programs.
</P>
<P>
ADB should also create a special fund for African economic
integration, he added.
</P>
<P>
ADB is to hold its 1998 annual meeting in late May in Abidjan,
Cote d'Ivoire, where its headquarters is based.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Settle Dispute with Arabs Through Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri Wednesday his country is willing to
settle disputes with Arab neighbors through "constructive dialog."
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference before winding up a three-day visit
here that "the lull or the so-called chill (between Iran and Gulf
Arab countries) is on its way to vanish."
</P>
<P>
He said Tehran is awaiting visits by officials of the United
Arab Emirates to solve their territorial dispute over the three
islands of Abu Mussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs near the Strait
of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the possibility of referring the dispute to the
U.N. International Court of Justice in the Hague, saying "by doing
so, we are allowing the issue to be given a political angle."
</P>
<P>
Nouri, who arrived here Monday on his second official visit
since 1995, expressed satisfaction over bilateral relations and
the result of his visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Nouri met with Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah and his Kuwaiti counterpart Ahmed Abdul Aziz Al-Sadoun on
Iran's ties with Gulf Arab states as well as improvement of
bilateral ties and issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Nouri denied media reports that there existed illegal trade of
oil between Iraq and Iran, which is a violation of the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq imposed since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He assured that Iran's relations with Iraq would not affect the
its stand that Baghdad must implement all the Security Council
resolutions related to its 1990-91 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed the importance of exchange of visits between
senior Iranian officials and their Arab counterparts, which he
said is "an opportunity to open dialog that would help remove the
existing" mistrust.
</P>
<P>
Last year Iran made goodwill gestures to improve ties with the
Gulf Arab states which had been strained since Iran's Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have since taken steps to upgrade the level of
relations, believing that building strong ties is vital for
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, Kuwait and Iran signed a bilateral memorandum of
understanding on all aspects of economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nouri has suggested the establishment of a joint center for
regional studies as a step towards developing scientific
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Says U.S. Credibility Affected in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. bias toward Israel "has
severely affected American credibility and standing" in the Middle
East, a top Palestinian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of attitude has led to the very open charge of
double standards and lack of evenhandedness in the way in which
the U.S. has dealt with the peace process and therefore it has
affected its standing and interests and credibility in the
region," Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian higher education
minister, said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Her comment came just days before Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is to hold separate meetings in London with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said Palestinian leaders will be in London to see
whether the United States will be willing to take a firm stand
against what she described as Israel's unwillingness to abide by
commitments to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for one
more meeting," she said.
</P>
<P>
As for U.S. suggestions that it might wind up its mediation
in the peace process because of the unwillingness of Israel and
the Palestinians to negotiate seriously, Ashrawi said: "I don't
take the threats that seriously."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. can't afford to withdraw" with its huge interests
in the region, she said.
</P>
<P>
But she envisioned the possibility of an increased European
role in Middle East diplomacy.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Revenue Authority
(ZRA) has intensified effort to curb smuggling and ensures that
all duties and other taxes are paid, Zambia News Agency ZANA
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Enoch Kavindele, minister of commerce, trade and industry,
quoted by ZANA, said on Wedanesday morning that as a result of
intensified patrols by a ZRA's flexible anti-smuggling team, an
additional revenue of one billion Kwacha or 700,000 U.S dollars
was realised in March.
</P>
<P>
In March, said the minister, one truck carrying grossly
undervalued goods while another one with 190 motorcar tyres were
seized by ZRA at the Kafue check point, 40 kilometers south of
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele added that ZRA will seize all the goods together
with the trucks used in these activities and in addition, severe
penalties and fines will be imposed on those involved.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zambian government is committed to seeing that ZRA
forces the law without any political interference.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, smuggling has increased at the borders,
putting many manufacturing companies in Zambia in a difficult
situation as their products can not compete favourably with
smuggled goods, which are priced much lower than the local ones.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month, Britain gave Zambia a grant of about
14 million dollars and international tax and customs experts
began arriving in the country to assist ZRA to curb the
ever-rising cross-border smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Chief Economist Recommended to Be ECB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The German cabinet Wednesday decided
to nominate Itmar Issing, the chief economist of the German
central bank Bundesbank, to be the German representative in the
planned six-member executive board of the future Europe central
bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Issing, who is seen as a staunch defender of
the Bundesbank's tight-money policy, will help to guarantee the
independence of the ECB, said German Finance Minister Theo Waigel.
</P>
<P>
The final decision on the composition of the six-member ECB
executive board is expected to be made at the European Union
leaders' summit meeting on May 1-2 in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
However, the most contraversial issue at the summit will prove
to be the selection of the first president of the new bank.
</P>
<P>
Germany and most other EU states expect the former Dutch
central bank chief Wim Duisenberg to take the EU's top monetary
job. France, however, has insisted that its own central bank
governor, Jean-Claude Trichet deserves the post.
</P>
<P>
With the EU summit only two days away, there is still no sign
of an agreement yet.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the dispute over the ECB leadership is
largely a confrontation between Germany and France about who will
hold control over future European monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges INTELSAT to Continue Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Wednesday urged the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization
(INTELSAT) to continue developing advanced and cheap digital
systems solutions for developing countries like Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Opening the INTELSAT Africa Group One meeting here Wednesday,
Zambian Minister of Communications and Transport Anoshi Chipawa
said that the digital systems will enable a number of developing
countries to have direct connections among themselves and thus
reduce the transit charges which are usually very high.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister also called on INTELSAT to continue
developing affordable products with reputable companies that can
easily be installed in remote rural areas in order to provide the
basic telephone service.
</P>
<P>
"This would be responding to the needs of the majority of our
people who live in the rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the two-day meeting that "meaningful development
cannot be achieved in any country if its telecommunication
infrastructure remains undeveloped."
</P>
<P>
Satellite communications now form an integral part of our new
"wired" world, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Although submarine cable is now more frequently used to
connect the continents of the world with readily available
telephone circuits, he said, only satellite communications have
enabled completely reliable communication links of telephone,
television and data transmission to be provided over all types of
terrestrial obstacles.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1970, Zambia had realized the potential of
satellite communications in providing international links for
telephone, television and data communications.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Mwembeshi-IA Earth Station was commissioned in
ushering the dawn of satellite communications in the country and
the station enables Zambia to be connected to a number of
European and Asian countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has benefitted from the INTELSAT digitalization loan
program through which INTELSAT gave Zambia a loan of 2.2 million
U.S. Dollars for the Zambia Telecommunications Company to
digitalize its Mwembeshi-IA Earth Station, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Africa is divided into two zones. Africa Group One mainly
comprises the English-speaking countries and Africa Group Two is
mainly Francophone.
</P>
<P>
Eleven countries including Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia,
Mauritius, Ghana and Angola are represented at the on-going
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Greece Says No EU Expansion if Problems Created </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece warned Thursday that there
would be no European Union (EU) expansion if anyone created a
political problem over Cyprus' accession course.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Athens afternoon daily
Eleftherotypia, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said
that Cyprus was part of a package with the other membership
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations would be held separately with each candidate and
each candidate would be judged on the basis of its pros and cons,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that if someone created a political issue
over Cyprus, this would create a political issue of the
community's function in its entirety. Therefore, he said, there
would be no smoothly functioning community and, consequently,
there would be no enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive-coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cyprus was included by the EU in its list of
countries waiting to join the community. The divided island
republic began at the end of March its accession negotiations with
the EU. All this led to the opposition of northern Cyprus and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
To protest against the EU's above-mentioned decision, northern
Cyprus suspended its negotiations with the Cyprus government for
the final settlement of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Just before the May 1 visit to Cyprus by U.S. presidential
envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash repeated Wednesday that peace talks between the island's
two communities could be resumed only if his northern Cyprus was
recognized.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, the Greek government is now under
extreme pressure from its European partners and the United States
to first lift its veto on EU financial packages destined for
Turkey and then to recognize northern Cyprus, which declared its
independence from the Republic of Cyprus in 1983 and has been
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that Athens is sending a clear
message to its EU partners and other countries such as the United
States that Greece firmly supports Cyprus' efforts to join the EU
and no one should try to make troubles in Cyprus' accession
course.

<P>
WUHAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- An underwater mine which was planted
in the Yangtze River 60 years ago was successfully detonated at
three o'clock this afternoon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bougainville Cease-fire Signed After Last-Minute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Warring factions on Papua New
Guinea(PNG)'s Bougainville island Thursday declared an end to the
island's bloody 10-year secessionist conflict as they signed a
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The war is over -- now it's up to us to protect the peace,"
rebel military commander Sam Kauona told hundreds gathering in
Arawa, Bougainville, for a formal peace ceremony and a symbolic
laying-down of arms, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Islanders broke arrows and handed over spears amid singing and
dancing at the ceremony, attended by PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate
and witnessed by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
The permanent cease-fire, signed by anti- and pro-government
factions and the PNG government itself, comes into effect at
midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire came after nine months of New Zealand-brokered
talks aimed at ending the conflict, which began in 1988 with
landowner disputes over the world-famous Panguna copper mine, and
escalated into a war for independence from PNG after the mine
closed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's cease-fire was only finalized after an 11th-hour
hiccup threatened to derail the agreement, the Australian wire
service said in a dispatch from Arawa.
</P>
<P>
Secessionist rebel leaders and PNG officials were locked in an
impasse Wednesday night over technicalities in implementing the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
However, a compromise was reached at 3 a.m. local time after
overnight talks aboard the Australian naval vessel HMAS Tobruk,
which was moored off the war-ravaged island's central coast.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stops the carrying, manufacture and distribution
of weapons and assures freedom of movement on the island, where an
estimated 15,000 lives have been lost in the conflict, the wire
service said.
</P>
<P>
The PNG government has also agreed to a phased withdrawal of
troops from Bougainville, which will be dependent on a civil
police force being established, while Arawa will be declared a
demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ceremony was marred by the absence of the rebels'
reclusive political leader, Bougainville Interim Government
President Francis Ona, who has become isolated from the rest of
the rebel leadership and refused to back the current peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Ona's deputy Joseph Kabui attended Thursday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Australian troops will make up the majority of a multi-nation
300-member Peace Monitoring Group on the island which will assume
duties after the cease-fire.

<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The just-ended visit to Japan and
the Republic of Korea (ROK) by Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao is
a complete success, a senior Chinese official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dai Bingguo, head of the International Liaison Department of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, told reporters
that the visit has met the targets of extending friendship,
increasing understanding, enhancing trust, providing orientation
for the future, and furthering Sino-Japanese and Sino-ROK
cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Hu, during his tour, exchanged sincere and wide-ranging views
on how to build a stable long-term and good neighborly
relationship between China and the two countries, said Dai, who
accompanied Hu on the visit.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan confirmed that the two countries must comply
with the principles and spirit enshrined in the Sino-Japanese
Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty,
Dai said.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan agreed to seize upon opportunities, draw
lessons from history, and work together so as to establish a
long-term and stable relationship oriented toward the 21st century.

<P>
China and South Korea have also reached consensus on how to

</P>
<P>
The three countries pledged they would boost economic and trade
ties and achieve common prosperity and development on a mutually
beneficial basis, said Dai.
</P>

Dai said Japan and South Korea are China's major neighbors.
Developing good-neighborly ties and expanding cooperation is in
the interest of the three countries and is also conducive to
peace, stability and development in Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Dai believed that Hu's visit will eventually pose a significant
influence in developments between the three countries in the
impending new century.

<HEADLINE> China to Meet 1998 Targets: Chinese Bank Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's economic performance in
1998 will be better than that of 1997, said a Chinese bank
official here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China will meet major economic targets for 1998 such as a GDP
growth of eight percent and a rise of less than three percent in
the consumer price index, said Yin Jieyan, the alternate governor
of the People's Bank of China. He made the comment at a session of
the 31st annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Having met the general objectives of sustained growth while
maintaining stability, China's economy delivered its best
performance in 1997 since the country adopted the policy of reform
and opening up in 1978," said Yin, head of the Chinese delegation
attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"1998 will be a crucial year for China to push ahead with
economic reform, opening up and its modernization drive," he added.
</P>
<P>
He told the session that the newly-elected Chinese government
will strengthen the fundamental economic status of the
agricultural sector, expand investment in infrastructure, speed up
the transformation of various state-owned enterprises, intensify
economic structure readjustment, and further integrate the Chinese
economy with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts will be made to improve the quality of growth so as to
sustain rapid and healthy economic development as well as social
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The appropriately stringent fiscal and monetary policies will
continue and financial regulation will be improved," he said.
"Inflation will be contained and financial risks prevented and
mitigated."
</P>
<P>
Yin said that a social security network will be established to
ensure stable the macroeconomic environment.
</P>
<P>
He believes that China's economic performance in 1998 will
improve over 1997 as a result of the proposed efforts by the
government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Should Stop Bullying Cuba, Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States should stop
trying to bully Cuban President Fidel Castro into change, Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said after his return from an
official visit to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The decades-old U.S. economic embargo and other pressure
tactics are hurting the Cuban people needlessly, Chretien was
quoted as saying in published reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chretien was particularly concerned that the embargo deprived
Cubans of anesthetics and other medicines.
</P>
<P>
"I am told that dentists do not have the proper anesthesia to
serve the people," he said in an interview with CNN after his
return.
</P>
<P>
This is not the way a rich and powerful country like the United
States should behave toward a smaller neighbor, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"When you are that powerful, that is the time to be benevolent,
to be nice, not to show your muscle," Chretien noted.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian prime minister, who will host the next Summit of
Americas in three years, said he is not sure yet whether he will
invite Mr. Castro to attend the future event.
</P>
<P>
At the most recent summit meeting earlier this month, Latin
American and Caribbean leaders were reported to have reached a
broad consensus on bringing Cuba into the hemispheric integration
process.

<HEADLINE> France to Adopt Tougher Anti-doping Ways in Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The French government on
Thursday agreed a bill to boost the fight against doping in
sport, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which includes tougher action against dealers,
young people will be given a medical check-up before starting any
sport. A medical record will be built up for sportsmen throughout
their career.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the sports ministry also decided to create an
independent commission against doping which will try to harmonise
sanctions between the different sports federations.
</P>
<P>
The governement also decided that sanctions against dealers
should be tougher. "Sportsmen are often victims while dealers are
criminals," sports minister Marie-George Buffet told French
television.
</P>
<P>
The sports minister said there were 226 positive dope tests in
France in 1997. Only 25 involved professionnals or full-time
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Eight prominent French athletes, including five soccer
professionals and an Olympic judo champion, failed dope tests for
the banned steroid nandrolone in recent months, reports added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Official Calls for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese bank official called for
regional and global cooperation Thursday in preventing excessive
financial assaults by international speculative capital and in
maintaining world financial order.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage regional financial cooperation in Asia and are
willing to participate in discussions on possible cooperation
mechanisms," Yin Jieyan, the alternate governor of the People's
Bank of China said at a session of the 31st annual meeting of the
the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing globalization of the world economy, many
causes can lead to a systemic financial crisis," said Yin, who led
the Chinese delegation to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He believes that a secure and stable financial system
constitutes the cornerstone for the stability and development of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Yin said he is pleased to see that some of the countries
affected by the Asian financial crisis have already started to
recover, which shows that Asia will continue to be one of the most
dynamic economic regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Asked why China has fended off a potential financial crisis and
sustained sound economic development, the Chinese central bank
leader outlined the following major reasons: rapid and healthy
economic development, prudent financial policies, a strong balance
of payments position, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and a
rational external debt structure.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing country, China has an urgent need to develop
its economy," Yin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He told the session however that to maintain regional economic
stability and help crisis-hit countries get out of difficulties
quickly, China has contributed through international financial
organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and with
bilateral arrangements to the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said China has on many occasions reiterated its
commitment to a stable Renminbi exchange rate, for which China
will pay a certain price.
</P>
<P>
"We think it worthwhile as long as the announcement not to
devalue Renminbi continues to remain beneficial and conducive to
the maintenance of financial stability in Asia and the world at
large and it is the best way to support economic recovery in East
and Southeast Asia," Yin said.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Discusses Israeli Offer with Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- European Union's Middle East envoy
Miguel Moratinos held talks on Thursday with Lebanese leaders on
Israel's offer of a conditional pullback from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit here following a trip to Syria,
Moratinos met with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berry, Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
The envoy told reporters after talks with Boueiz that during
discussions with Lebanese and Syrian leaders, he reaffirmed EU's
support for Lebanon's position on the Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425 which demands a unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon, but requested Lebanese government to
guarantee Israel's northern security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which agree to coordinate their stances on
key issues, have rejected the offer. They insist that the Israeli
withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that under the request of Israel, he has
conveyed some ideas of the Jewish state on the pullback proposal
to Lebanese leaders. But he refused to go into the details.
</P>
<P>
He had reportedly held talks on the Israeli proposal with a
senior Israeli official in Cyprus before embarking on the trip to
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that he also discussed with leaders of Syria and
Lebanon various ways of reviving the peace talks between Syria and
Lebanon on one side and Israel on the other.
</P>
<P>
The talks came to a standstill in early 1996 after a series of
suicide bombings in Israel. Syria wants the return of its Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos has left here for Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> River Blindness Coming Down in W. Africa: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Africa regional Director of
the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the onchocerciasis
control program (OCP), which was set up to bring down river
blindness in 11 west African states, has achieved its objective.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Malick Samba told the Zimbabwe News Agency in Harare
Thursday the program was scheduled to end by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 10 percent of the population of the 11
countries used to be blind before it was introduced.
</P>
<P>
''Now nobody in the area risks being blind because of river
blindness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
By the time it winds up it would have protected 40 million
people from river blindness.
</P>
<P>
The countries covered by the program are Benin, Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger,
Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Exports Remain Major Contributors to Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Li Shengjiang
</P>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Can China's export trade grow
at a rate higher than that of the national economy in 1998, as it
did for the past two decades?
</P>
<P>
Can exports contribute two percentage points to the projected
eight percent growth in GDP this year, as the central government
hopes?
</P>
<P>
Certain factors are leading to a positive answer to the above
questions.
</P>
<P>
China set this year's export target at 200 billion US dollars,
which is an impressive growth for one year of 10 percent, taking into
account the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
To the delight of trade policy makers, exports climbed 13.2
percent in the first quarter, six percentage points higher than
the GDP growth in the same period.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we are working in the right direction, we'll be
able to overcome the impact of the financial crisis," said Liu
Xiangdong, assistant minister of foreign trade and Economic
Cooperation. Liu was in Guangzhou to attend the 83th China Export
Commodities Fair, which closed today.
</P>
<P>
The success of the fair also further enhances the belief that
China is able to meet its export goal this year.
</P>
<P>
The pinch of the financial crisis could be widely felt during
the fair, as the number of buyers as well as orders from Southeast
Asian countries shrank.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese trade experts have noted that Southeast Asia,
after all, accounts for only about seven percent of China's total
exports. Moreover, demand from the region for daily-use items and
raw materials remains robust during the fair.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the optimism is the fact that orders from
long-distance and newly-emerging markets in Western and Eastern
Europe, the United States, the Commonwealth of Independent States,
East Europe, Africa and Latin America rose drastically,
contributing greatly to a near-record 10.2 billion US
dollars-worth of deals clinched during the fair.

<P>
"Because of brisk business with neighboring countries, many
Chinese exporters in the past were reluctant to engage in
ocean-going trade. Now they are taking the initiative to do so,"
Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
The fair was also a convincing illustration of to what extent
the opening-up of new markets can help China offset the impact of
the financial crisis on its exports.
</P>
<P>
For example, Guangdong Province, which is a heavyweight
exporter, accounting for one fourth of the country's exports,
received over 10 percent more orders during the fair, with over 70
percent from newly-emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Though coastal Shandong Province calls itself a "major victim"
due to its close business ties with the Republic of Korea (ROK),
it still managed to score a 16 percent increase in orders, also
due to diversified trade.
</P>
<P>
China's leading four exporters -- Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai,
and Shandong -- all performed well during the fair, convincing trade
authorities that the four regions can achieve projected export
growth of between 10 and 15 percent. "If the goal is met, it will
mean a 60 percent guarantee for hitting the national export
target," trade officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Jianhua, a Shanghai trade official, that east
China metropolis has stepped up its efforts to offset the crisis
by further tapping new markets and developing high-tech and
high-value-added products, especially information-related products.
</P>
<P>
There are also other favorable factors for China's exports,
trade experts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A comparatively stronger Renminbi can benefit China's purchase
of raw and semi-finished materials from Southeast Asia and help
boost the processing trade, which make up half of the country's
exports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the steady growth in exports by Sino-foreign joint
ventures and solely-owned foreign enterprises, and the granting
independent foreign trade rights to more Chinese enterprises will
also guarantee the sustained growth of exports, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Emigration Tide Ebbs in Kyrgyzstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Housing, unemployment and the
education of children -- some of the problems besetting the
pioneering Kyrgyzian emigrants abroad -- have led more would-be
emigrants to stay home.
</P>
<P>
1997 saw 11,000 emigrants leave Kyrgyzstan compared to 1993,
when over 140,000 people left the country. About 6,000 to 8,000
emigrants are returning to Kyrgyzstan annually, according to the
latest issue of the "Asian Economy and Life" weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
The emigration tide in the Kyrgyz Republic can be traced back
to the country's independence in 1991. Since then, many
non-Kyrgyzian people, mainly ethnic Russians, have been trying to
return to their native lands.
</P>
<P>
Their motherlands however are not quick to welcome them as they
vanguards eventually find out after obtaining permanent
residence. The migrants have to face more difficulties in seeking
housing and jobs, and their children have less access to education.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Kyrgyzstan by Tatiana Regent, director
of the Immigration Board of the Russian Federation, Kyrgyzstan and
Russia signed an agreement to provide legal protection to
Russian-speaking people in their attempt to immigrate to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the Russian official pointed out, would lay the
legal groundwork for the protection of the migrants' civil
rights.

<HEADLINE> First Degree Awarding Program to Promote Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Institute of
Education (HKIEd) announced here Thursday that it will offer a
four-year full-time degree program in primary education for
secondary school graduates beginning this fall, the first of its
kind in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Named the Bachelor of Education Program, it includes three
special features: a strong focus on languages, a special emphasis
on civic education and the use of information technology in
pedagogy and classroom practice, said professor Ruth Hayhoe,
director of the HKIEd, at a press conference held on Thursday to
launch the professional four-year degree programs.
</P>
<P>
Hayhoe said that the program creates a new choice for secondary
school graduates who wish to become primary school teachers as it
provides a sound basis for its graduates to work competently as
beginning primary school teachers and to develop continuously in
meeting the challenges facing primary school education in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"The program had been designed to produce knowledgeable and
professional teachers thus helping to contribute to Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa's
stated objectives of attaining 35 percent graduate posts for all
primary schools at the advanced date of year 2001 instead of
2007," Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
The program's strong language focus is motivated by a concern
about the adequacy of standards of language teaching in Hong Kong,
Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
All students are therefore required to take 60-hour language
course each in Chinese, English and Putonghua (standard Chinese)
and to meet relevant language benchmarks before graduation, she
added.
</P>
<P>
The program also encourages the use of computers as tools for
learning in primary schools to ensure that students will develop
efficient basic computer skills and are introduced to issues in
information technology, Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
All students would need to demonstrate a basic level of
computer competence prior to taking a module on Computer Assisted
Learning in the final year, she said.
</P>
<P>
Special attention has also been given to the provision of civic
and moral education in the program, Hayhoe stressed.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to prepare graduate primary teachers who will
demonstrate sound academic and professional performance in the
process of developing all-round young school learners as committed
members of the Hong Kong community, she added.

<HEADLINE> Photographs of Buddhist Remains Exhibited in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition focusing on
Buddhist relics of the period when the Khitan people of the Liao
Dynasty (916-1125) and the Jurchens of the Jin Dynasty
(1115-1234) made the Beijing area their capital opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
All the photographs were the results of a five-year joint
exploration of Beijing's history by Japanese scholar Virginia
Fumiyo Anami and German professional photographer Kosima Weber Liu.
</P>
<P>
Anami, a scholar of East Asian history, lived for many years in
Beijing and has written numerous articles on Beijing's history and
Buddhism. Liu studied art history at the Central Academy of Fine
Arts in Beijing, and has been living in Beijing since 1984.
</P>
<P>
This collection of photographs illustrates what remains of the
Liao-Jin period and includes stories from that history.
</P>
<P>
The Liao called Beijing Nanjing or Yanjing from the year 938;
the Jurchens captured the Liao capital in 1122 and made
it their capital, calling it Zhongdu, or central capital in 1153.
</P>
<P>
During this time Buddhism flourished, and even today the
remaining Liao and Jin temples, pagodas, stone carvings and even
ancient trees are still redolent of this 1,000-year cultural
heritage.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Liao/Jin City Wall Museum, where the exhibition is
being held, straddles the ancient Jin city wall's water gate and

<HEADLINE> HK Links German Businesses with East Asia: German Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The German government attaches
great importance to Hong Kong's function as a part of China and,
at the same time, a part of the international economy, a senior
German government official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gunter Rexrodt, federal minister of economics of Germany, who
is on a two-day visit to Hong Kong, said that German companies in
Hong Kong play an important role by linking German business with
China and the other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"With over 500 addresses, they still form the largest German
business community in the Far East and it is hard to imagine
German economic relations with eastern Asia without them," Rexrodt
said at a reception held Thursday in the Conrad Hotel in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt, who arrived in Hong Kong at noon time on Thursday
following his visit to Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, hosted the
reception to Hong Kong businessmen and foreign businessmen in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt said that it is always stimulating and instructive to
end -- or to begin -- a visit to China in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's dynamism has become a symbol of the vigorous
development in eastern Asia over the last 20 years, Rexrodt said.
</P>
<P>
In what is currently a troubled region, Hong Kong is an anchor
of stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
With its stable currency, its high currency reserves and its
rock-solid budget, Hong Kong has supported the crisis management
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with an impressive
contribution.
</P>
<P>
As to his visit to China's inland areas, Rexrodt said that
following his discussions with representatives of the Chinese
government, he is sure that China is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned companies are being restructured, the banking
system is being over-hauled, and the government apparatus is being
rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that this new phase of the economic reforms
will be just as successful as the previous one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should also recognize the great sense of responsibility for
the region shown by China during the present crisis," Rexrodt
stressed.
</P>
<P>
China is participating in the IMF's support measures. And it
has kept the external value of its currency stable, thus
preventing a race to devalue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the reception, Rexrodt held a press briefing to inform
reporters on his visit to China including Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At the press briefing, Rexrodt said that the German government
encourages German companies to expand their business in Asia,
especially in China's inland areas and Hong Kong, and invites Hong
Kong businessmen to invest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt met with Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Donald Tsang,
financial secretary of the SAR on Thursday afternoon. He is
scheduled to leave Hong Kong for home tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Outcome of Guangzhou Trade Fair Better Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The curtain fell today on the
83rd China Export Commodities Fair in this capital of Guangdong
Province in south China, after a record 10.2 billion US
dollars-worth of export transactions had been completed.
</P>
<P>
"The final results of the trade fair surprised market
observers," said Liu Shanzai, vice-minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Regarded as a "thermometer" of China's foreign trade, the
biannual event this time had attracted about 65,000 overseas
buyers from 166 countries and regions since it opened on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the impact of the East Asian financial crisis,
however, orders from Asian countries like Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea dropped considerably this year
as expected.
</P>
<P>
But China's business volumes with the European Union, the United
States, the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe
have been increasing sharply.
</P>
<P>
Europe and the United States remain the top two markets for
Chinese exporters this year, with the trade volumes with the two
markets increasing by eight percent and 10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Overseas buyers still favor Chinese export products, as they
can find whatever they need, said Hamoudi Youssef, a businessman
from the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Name-brand products and commodities with high added value sell
well at the Guangzhou trade fair. The Zhuhai Green Group, based in
Zhuhai City, Guangdong, received orders worth 150 million US
dollars for its electrical appliances at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said that the optimistic trend observed at the fair
has enhanced his conviction that China's exports will grow by more
than 10 percent and hit the 200-billion-US-dollar target soon.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes New Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia is opposed to the new
economic sanctions the Contact Group imposed on Yugoslavia, a
Russian foreign ministry spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Rakhmanin said the six-nation Contact Group should
instead focus attention on promoting political dialogue between
Belgrade and ethnic Albanian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Contact Group, which include the United States,
Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, met in Rome on
April 29 to discuss the escalating Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the meeting, the group, with the exception
of Russia, decided to freeze Yugoslav assets abroad and threatened
to impose harsher sanctions if Belgrade fails to ease tensions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Only With political dialogue, not economic sanctions, can the
international community dissolve the Kosovo crisis," Rakhmanin
said.

<HEADLINE> Japan-US Security Moves Must Keep off Taiwan Straits: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China firmly opposes any direct
or indirect activities which attempt to include the Taiwan Straits
in the scope of the Japan-US security cooperation relationship.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made here today by Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao while responding to a reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
China is concerned about reports in the Japanese media to the
effect that the Japanese government includes the Taiwan Straits in
the scope of the Japan-US security cooperation relationship, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
China holds a clear-cut and consistent stand that Japan-US
security cooperation is a bilateral arrangement formed with a
specific historical background; it should be strictly limited to
the scope of bilateral relations between the two countries,
otherwise it will upset surrounding countries in Asia and create
complexity affecting the security situation in this region, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that China has repeatedly suggested to Japan
and the US that they take a cautious attitude toward security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, both Japan and the US have assured the
Chinese side on a number of occasions that their security
cooperation has not been extended and is not aimed at any third
party.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China, the Spokesman
said, adding that any direct or indirect activities which attempt
to include the Taiwan Straits in the Japan-US security cooperation
framework will be resolutely opposed by the Chinese government and
the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Upgrading Standards to Improve HK's Medical Profession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Academy of
Medicine (HKAM) has recently approved six additional specialities,
which it seeks to be included in the Specialist Register by the
Hong Kong Medical Council.
</P>
<P>
HKAM's leading doctors believed that the move will upgrade the
standard of Hong Kong's medical care.
</P>
<P>
The Special Register, launched and gazetted last month in Hong
Kong offers the community direct access and information on
qualified doctors that have been recognized by the Medical Council
as specialists.
</P>
<P>
"The Specialist Register in Hong Kong is a clear indication of
the high standards that are currently developed in the medical
profession to cater for the needs of the community," said David
Fang, HKAM's president.
</P>
<P>
The six new specialities brought the existing Register-covered
specialties to a total of 42.
</P>
<P>
To be recommended for inclusion in the Register, candidates
must satisfy the Academy that they have fulfilled the requirements
for training and obtained the necessary higher qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Around 2,000 specialists, all Fellows of the HKAM, were
included in the Register on the first round of application in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Doctors must have at least six years of recognized structured
specialist training and pass an exit/assessment of the Academy in
the related speciality before they can be admitted as a Fellow of
the HKAM for inclusion in the specialist Register.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in December 1993, the HKAM is an independent
institution with statutory power to organize, monitor, asses and
accredit all postgraduate medical training and to oversee the
provision of continuing medical education. It enables Hong Kong
doctors, having completed recognized specialist training to become
specialists registered by the Medical Council.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The diminishing likelihood of a
cut in interest rates bolstered the Australian dollar Thursday,
pushing it higher to close above 65.00 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The unit ended the local session on its highs for the day at
65.22 U.S. cents from 64.77 previously.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank senior foreign exchange dealer Nick
Volanakis said stronger than expected wages data released Thursday
had wiped the chances of a cut in official interest rates by the
Reserve Bank of Australia off the agenda in the near term.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the figures took a bit of the heat out of the
expectation of an interest rate cut," Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
Average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) figures for the
February quarter released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
showed full-time adult AWOTE climbed by 1.3 percent in the three
months to February to a seasonally adjusted 720.30 Australian
dollars. Over the year, AWOTE were an adjusted 3.9 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that although higher than expected, the data
were still in line with Reserve Bank of Australia targets.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing with the AWOTE figure is that the annual
rate is still below 4.0 percent," Axiom Funds Management senior
economist Matthew Drennan said.
</P>
<P>
"So while it is a little higher than expectations would have
suggested, I think it is still quite comfortably in line with
Reserve Bank targets and certainly shouldn't provide any great
source of inflationary pressure over the next 12 months."
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the Australian dollar ended at 85.98
from 85.68 against Japanese yen and at 1.1678 from 1.1628 against
Deutsche marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Sacked Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais has been appointed chief executive of the
state-controlled Unified Energy Systems (UES) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Sannikov, an official of the Russian Ministry of Fuel
and Energy and a UES board member, said Chubais is expected
to ease the company's debt problem.
</P>
<P>
The UES, one of the monopolies in the transport, of natural gas
and energy sector, is owed some 2 billion U.S. dollars by Russian
factories and industries, and other CIS countries, who cannot
afford to pay their debts.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government holds 52.7 percent of shares in the
nation's electric sector, as well as direct stakes in most
regional utilities.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Chubais was sacked when Russian President Boris

<HEADLINE> France's Unemployment Rate Continues Downward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France's unemployment rate
continued to inch down in March by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate dropped slightly to 12 percent from 12.2
percent in February, said the ministry of employment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Except for a slight rebound in January, the unemployment rate
in France has been falling since last September.
</P>
<P>
The jobless number declined to below three million for the
first time since January 1996 when it was at 2,989,800.
</P>
<P>
The number of the unemployed below 25 dropped by 2.2 percent in
March, compared with 0.4 percent of those above 50, while those
considered long-time unemployed slumped by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
France is expected to create a total of 400,000 jobs in 1998
and 1999, and the unemployment rate will continue to drop, said
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, minister of industry, finance and economy.
</P>
<P>
The drop in unemployment, he said, is due to the economic
policy of the socialist government. He did admit that there are
still too many unemployed in France.

<P>
XIAMEN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen's foreign investment has
witnessed big growth over the past 17 years and currently
accounts for the lion's share of the local economy, according to
Shi Zhaobin, secretary of the Xiamen Committee of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises accounted for 80 percent of the
city's total 1997 industrial output value and contributed close to
33 percent of the local tax revenues, according to Shi.
</P>
<P>
He said the port city has approved 4,343 foreign-funded
projects involving total contracted investments of 13.76 billion
US dollars, including allocated funds of over 7.97 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 68.8 percent of foreign-funded projects are closely
related to the manufacturing sector. The investment in the service
sector and agriculture sector accounted for 29 percent and 2.2
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The influx of foreign investments has led to radical changes in
the city economic structure, with the ratio for the agricultural
sector falling from 21.67 percent in 1980 to 6.03 percent
in 1997, said Shi.
</P>
<P>

LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Around 70 percent of top-class
sportsmen are cheating with drugs, former British athletic star
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Yates, a former European 1,500 meters indoor champion,

believed most athletes who appeared in a final at the top level
were taking banned substances.

cheating with drugs)," Yates said in a debate about drugs in sport
on BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard that figure and I wouldn't be surprised. It is
going on in the world of athletics. There is hypocrisy from guys
who say 'don't do drugs' and they are on drugs," Redmond
continuted.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Chinese Trade Unions Adjust Role to Changing Times(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- As China's economic reforms cut
deeper, trade unions across the country are making every effort to
shift their function from prompting workers to toil harder for the
state to safeguarding workers' rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
"It should be the bound duty of trade unions to protect the
workers, who are both the unions' founders and members," said an
official with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
(ACFTU). "But in the past, we used to lay more emphasis on
encouraging and prompting the workers to make greater
contributions to their country."
</P>
<P>
In the time of a planned economy, all workers labored for, and
were protected by, the state. There were no labor-capital
conflicts in the enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, with the establishment in recent years of a socialist
market economy which allows the co-existence of multiple ownership
systems, many Chinese workers are no longer directly patronized by
the government in terms of employment and pay.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as a result of the separation of government functions
from enterprise operation, Chinese businesses have gained
increasing autonomy, which has led to infringement on the workers'
interests and rights.
</P>
<P>
In some state-owned enterprises that have turned to the
shareholding system in a bid to overcome economic difficulties,
all workers were forced to buy shares. In other places, mergers or
sales of state enterprises were announced without approval by
workers' congresses, which according to law should have the right
of supervision.
</P>
<P>
The number of labor-capital disputes in private, foreign-funded
and township enterprises has also been surging in recent
years. Statistics from the ACFTU put the total number of labor
disputes in China last year at more than 71,000, more than double
the figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a recent editorial, Workers' Daily, a major national
newspaper based in Beijing, warned: "The greatest danger presently
threatening the trade unions' development and even survival is
that they have lost their close relationship with the broad masses
of the workers."

starting from April 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced Wednesday by the government,

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Foreign Minister Returns Home from New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 30 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahaf returned home from New York on Thursday after
attending U.N. Security Council meetings on arms inspections
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in New York, al-Sahaf held talks with
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and met with representatives of
the Security Council member states.
</P>
<P>
He repeated a longtime Iraqi claim that his country has
implemented relevant U.N. resolutions on dismantling weapons of
mass destruction, and demanded lifting the seven-year-old
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament in Iraq
(UNSCOM) said in its report submitted to the Security Council that
it had made "virtually no progress" over the last six months in
verifying Iraq's compliance with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The report led to a Monday U.N. decision to prolong economic
sanctions against Iraq. U.N. arms inspectors must certify that
Iraq has destroyed all banned weapons before the council lifts
the embargo imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Describing the decision as "very disappointing," al-Sahaf
pledged to cooperate with the Security Council to refute "lies and
fallacies" included in the UNSCOM's report that Iraq is still
holding banned arms.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the purpose behind such lies and
allegations was to justify aggressive U.S. and British policies
against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf was accompanied by Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed,
the top Iraqi negotiator in talks with the UNSCOM during the
U.N. deliberation held in New York.
</P>
<P>
The review was the first since Iraq signed a deal last February
with Annan to open all sites, including presidential compounds to
U.N. arms inspectors. The agreement has avoided a U.S.-led military
strike against Iraq.

the enterprises on behalf of the workers, and assisting local
governments in finding new jobs for the laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
To date, the workers' congress, which in accordance with the
law has the right to examine reform plans of the enterprise and
suggest the promotion or ouster of enterprise managers, has been
established in more than 300,000 businesses across China.
</P>
<P>
But an ACFTU official acknowledged that in many places the
power of the workers' congress has been largely neglected and all
major issues concerning enterprise operations were decided by a
few people in management.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprise owners also used various excuses to avoid or
delay the signing of a collective labor contract with the workers,
he added.
</P>
<P>
With further reforms in state-owned enterprises, more than 11
million Chinese workers have now been laid off, and the figure is
expected to continue rising this year.
</P>
<P>
Qin Yangong, deputy head of the social protection department
with the ACFTU, said that by the end of last year trade unions
across the country had raised 2 billion yuan (250 million
U.S. dollars) in relief funds to help the laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions at all levels have also opened a large number of
vocational training or job placement centers for the laid-off
workers, and have directly offered more than 700,000 jobs in
union-run businesses to these workers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Announces Mass Discussion on Law Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature announced
plans to make public a draft of amendments to the Land-Use Law to
solicit people's opinions.
</P>
<P>
"The draft of the revised Land-Use Law will affect agriculture,
the immediate interests of 900 million farmers and our coming
generations," said Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), at the closing meeting
of the second session of the committee which ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By publicizing the draft and hearing the response, the highest
legislative body can collect more opinions from the public and
improve the law, Li said.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the state must adopt special policies
to protect farmland resources, and strictly prevent farmland from
being transferred into other uses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it strictly controls the different uses of
agricultural, construction and idle land. The draft, regarded as
an overhaul of the current law, controls urban landscaping as well.
</P>
<P>
China adopted land-use legislation in 1986. However, the
existing law is considered unsuitable for a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Considering the effects of the amendments, the NPC Standing
Committee unanimously approved the mass discussion of the draft
law.
</P>
<P>
It decided to publicize the draft of amendments to the
Constitution in 1982 for people's discussion. After that, the
Standing Committee also released drafts of Administrative
Procedure Law, the Basic Law of Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and the Basic Law of Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Chairman Li said that public discussion might
increase people's legal understanding.

<HEADLINE> China Expands Protection of Ocean Ecology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese environmental
protection official said today that China will improve the
management of the ocean's ecology in an attempt to prevent red
tides.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Natural Protection Department of the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said that China
will increase spending on wastewater treatment facilities in
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
"The control over the development of seacoast and marshes will
be tightened to protect the coastal ecology," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official added that China will improve environmental
management of agriculture as soon as possible and strictly control
the density of aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
The red tides which have plagued coastal waters in south
China's Guangdong Province and Hong Kong has caused losses of 350
million yuan, including losses of 50 million yuan in Guangdong,
according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
SEPA said that pollution has contributed to red tides, adding
that huge land-originated pollution and unscientific aquaculture
are two outstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
China empties eight billion tons of wastewater into the sea
annually, with the volume increasing yearly. In addition, overly
dense aquaculture has also contributed to pollution
problems.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Launch Anti-Flu Vaccination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's health
departments have called on people in the country to have
vaccination against looming winter flu so as to boost their
immunity against the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to Tony Brewitt, Chief Executive Officer of
Medicross Family Medical Centers, such vaccinations should
ideally take place in May as the "protective effects of the
treatment develop some 114 days later".
</P>
<P>
Brewitt said flu is a contagious respiratory disease caused by
a virus. "While it cannot be completely cured, it can be
prevented by vaccination which has been shown to offer 80 to 90
percent protection in healthy young individuals.
</P>
<P>
"For most healthy people, flu is mild to moderately severe
illness, but for those in high risk categories, it can be life
threatening. Complications can be serious, even in healthy young
individuals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Complications include inflammation of the heart muscle
following vigorous exercise. Influenza often triggers other
diseases like ear infections, sinusitis and meningitis, medical
experts said.

JOHANNESBURG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of South
Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has met prisoners
in the Maze outside Belfast and will meet others in the Ireland
Republic shortly, Northern Ireland's republican party Sinn Fein
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four-strong delegation is on a four-day visit to Northern
Ireland and the Republic this week and will be addressing a
number of meetings on both sides of the border, South African
newspaper The Citizen reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, which invited the group, said it is going to listen
and learn from the South African negotiators who had solved many
prickly issues during their reconciliation talks with the former
apartheid government which led to the 1994 democratic election.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to apply, where practical, those lessons to our
efforts to win for the Irish people a lasting peace," said a Sinn
Fein spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Former ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, head of the
delegation, was due to address a meeting in Dublin Friday on
"Ireland-South Africa, the Struggle for peace and Justice", the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ANC officials, who formed the core of the ANC delegation
in the 1993 Kempton Park talks, are hoped to facilitate talks in
Northern Ireland, where an agreement reached by political parties
on April 10 has to be subjected to a referendum on May 22.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding issues such as the status of political prisoners
and the disarmament of para-military groups, are similar to
matters that had to be dealt with in South Africa before the 1994
all-race election.

TUNIS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine
Ben Ali held talks Wednesday night with visiting King Hussein of
Jordan on bilateral ties, as well as Arab, regional and
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Tunis Afrique Presse quoted an official spokesman for the
Tunisian Presidency as saying that the two leaders expressed their
satisfaction at the outcome of Tunisian-Jordanian cooperation in
all fields, especially in the economic one.
</P>
<P>
The two countries recently agreed to set up a joint free trade
zone and reactivate the role of the private sector in promoting
investment enterprises and partnership.
</P>
<P>
The two leader also affirmed the Tunisian-Jordanian Joint
Commission meetings, which meet regularly, should continue so as
to bring bilateral cooperation to the highest level.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the Middle East peace process and the
efforts made by both countries and the international community
designed to save the peace process from its current deadlock, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian president reiterated his country's attitude
supporting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the efforts being made to ease the
suffering of the Iraqi and Libyan peoples as a result of the
U.N. embargoes. King Hussein reiterated his suggestion that Iraq
and the U.S. enter into direct dialog.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were laid on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed air and arms embargoes on
Libya in 1992 after Libya refused to surrender for trial in
Britain or the United States two Libyans accused of killing 270
people by blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two leaders underlined the necessity of
continuing efforts to clear the Arab atmosphere and reactivate
Arab joint action.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein arrived here Wednesday evening for a two-day
official visit to Tunisia within a tour of a number of Arab and
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged to Exercise Restraint on Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The international society has
urged the Nigerian government to exercise restraint and not
execute the six persons sentenced to death by a special military
tribunal for alleged coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said Wednesday what
Nigeria needs at the moment is genuine national reconciliation
rather than blood-letting.
</P>
<P>
A special bulletin from Mandela's office counseled Nigeria's
Head of State, General Sani Abacha, to realize that death
sentences are no longer fashionable in the world today as many
countries have expunged them from their statute books.
</P>
<P>
Also reacting to the verdict, Commonwealth Secretary-General
Emeka Anyaoku urged the Nigerian government "to exercise utmost
restraint and humanitarianism over the death sentences."
</P>
<P>
The British government, according to a British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) report, urged Nigeria to respect the human
rights of the condemned by giving them the right to appeal
against their sentences.
</P>
<P>
A special military tribunal Tuesday sentenced to death former
Chief of General Staff Oladipo Diya and five
others on charges of treason. Ten others were sentenced to jail
terms ranging from 14 years to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The sentences are to be approved by the Provisional Ruling
Council, the highest decision-making body in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Noted individuals and groups in Nigeria have also appealed to
the government to temper justice with mercy.

<HEADLINE> Vice-President Reaffirms Stability of Chinese Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHEJU, South Korea, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President
Hu Jintao reaffirmed here Thursday the significance to stabilize
the Chinese yuan (Renminbi) in the wake of the Southeast Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's firm commitment not to devaluate
Renminbi is a serious and well-based one made before the
international community, Hu told reporters before flying home.
</P>
<P>
To elaborate his answers to media questions, Hu said that
firstly, China's economy is showing a trend of high growth and low
inflation, which serves as a strong basis for the stable Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, China has been running a favorable balance
of international payments, with a steady growth of its foreign
exchange reserves now exceeding 140 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the total amount and structure of the country's
external debts are relatively rational, and that the pressure on
its foreign debt payment has not been great, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, although keeping Renminbi at its current value has a
negative impact on exports, he said, low labor costs have made
some Chinese commodities still competitive on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the vice-president explained, the restructuring of
China's financial system is proceeding in an orderly way and the
supervision and control over the financial sector will be further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Based on these evaluations, Hu said, the Chinese government is
fully confident that the value of Renminbi will stay where it is.
</P>
<P>
Such a monetary policy on the part of China will boost the
stability and growth of the home economy, as well as contribute to
the stabilization of the Asian economy as a whole and to the
strengthening of market confidence.
</P>
<P>
Hu left here for home later in the day after concluding a
five-day official visit to South Korea. South Korea was the
second leg of Hu's East Asian tour which also took him to Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State Visits China College for Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that she hoped U.S.-China
cooperation in the field of law can be expanded.
</P>
<P>
Albright made her remarks here before an audience of more than
100 judges attending a course at the China National Judges College
under the Supreme People's Court, which is an adult education
college for the training of senior judges.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that she is aware that in recent years China has
made a major effort to reform and develop its legal system, and
that the United States is very interested in the "important legal
development" that is taking place in China.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that the Chinese leadership and people
recognize the "need to strengthen the rule of law and to ensure
its judicial system is fair to all Chinese," adding that this is
"essential to cope with the vast economic and social changes that
are now occurring in China."
</P>
<P>
"The college demonstrates the commitment China is making to
further develop its legal system," added Albright.
</P>
<P>
She said that during the summit meeting last year in the United
States, Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill
Clinton agreed to launch a new initiative to cooperate in the
field of law, which she said is in the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Observing that the legal communities of both countries are
enthusiastic about the initiative, Albright said she hoped that
the college would be a partner in bilateral exchanges and
cooperation in the field of law.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt Wants Genocide Criminals Extradited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government is trying
for the extradition of the genocide criminals holed up in some
west African states, a senior government official told the Rwanda
News Agency (RNA).
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to do everything possible in order to have them
(genocide criminals) extradited to Rwanda," said Faustin
Nteziryayo, Rwandan Minister of Justice, during a telephone
interview with RNA.
</P>
<P>
Nteziryayo's statement came shortly after the announcement of
the arrest of the former Prefect of Butare, Colonel Alphonse
Nteziryayo, in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Two other Rwandan nationals, Laurent Serubuga and Francois
Sibomana, were also said to have been put under house arrest in
neighbouring Mali, pending a request by the Rwandan government or
the International Criminal Tribunal to have them extradited.
</P>
<P>
Both Mali and Burkina Faso have declared that they have no
extradition treaty with the Rwandan government, hinting that the
criminals might be transferred to Arusha International Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"Here the question of extradition treaty does not really apply
for genocide crimes and crimes against humanity," said
Nteziryayo. "These countries should abide by the 1948 convention
which requests all governments to arrest and extradite genocide
criminals," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "This issue of Rwandan criminals roaming in many
countries without any fear for being arrested will be raised
during a meeting that Kofi Annan, and officials from the
International Criminal Tribunal will hold with Rwandan
authorities in Kigali."
</P>
<P>
Most of these criminals have been arrested on the basis of a
list issued by the Rwandan government which features about 2,000
most wanted criminals made of masterminds and organisers of the
1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"This list is being reviewed and updated," since some
information was lacking as well as new names will be added,
Nteziryayo said.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 genocide in Rwanda left over 500,000 people dead in
less than three months.
</P>
<P>
According to some scientists, the methods used here to
slaughter Tutsis and opposition Hutus were eight times faster
than the gas chambers of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, over 130,000 genocide suspects are detained in
Rwandan prisons, waiting for trials. Last year, about 300
suspects were tried by Rwandan war crimes tribunals.
</P>
<P>
The first 22 genocide criminals sentenced to death were
publicly executed last Friday in five different locations of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls on Israel to Attain Trust and Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday paid homage to the founders of the State of Israel, but
estimated that the country has yet to win trust and peace with its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to his Israeli counterpart Ezer Weizman on
the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel, Chirac praised
Israel as a country "where the orchards are born out of desert
and where industry, research and science draw the Third
Millennium."
</P>
<P>
He also paid homage to the former leaders of Israel -- David Ben
Gourion, Gola Meir, Manahem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
"But a country should, in my view, still attain the essential:
trust and peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
While promising Israel with "frienship and support" of France,
Chirac called on the young people of Israel to be "the heros of
peace."
</P>
<P>
"Today, through you, it is to the youths of Israel that I wish
to address myself to encourage them to be, with your neighbors and
partners of all times, the heros of peace. You can count on the
friendship and support of France," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac failed to mention Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in his message of congratulations.

<HEADLINE> French Socialists Welcome OECD Suspension of Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France's ruling Socialist Party
Thursday welcomed the decision by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) to suspend its talks on
liberalizing investments among its member countries.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the party described as "a failure for the
defenders of ultra-liberalism" the decision by OECD on Tuesday to
suspend talks on the Agreement on Multilateral Investment, which
aims to lift barriers on investment among the 29 members of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"The Socialist Party is delighted that the firmness shown by
the French government allowed the protection of the great
objectives of our country: cultural exception, continuation of
European construction, rejection of social and environmental
dumping and dismantlement of American laws of d'Amato and
Helms-Burton," it said.
</P>
<P>
It also called for vigilance to ensure that globalization
should not become "standardization," and liberalization not become
the synonym of "generalized impoverishment at the profit of a
smallest number of people."

<HEADLINE> No Progress Made in Intra-Afghan Talks Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia and
the rival Northern Alliance continued their peace talks Thursday
but no major progress was made in the morning session.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Saleh Bakar, assistant general secretary of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), told reporters after
the morning session that the two Afghan warring factions discussed
mainly the issues of lifting the blockade of humanitarian aid to
central Afghanistan and the release of POWs.
</P>
<P>
Bakar admitted that the progress in the morning session was
"slow." There are still some differences between the two sides on
certain issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the holding of the next round of intra-Afghan
peace talks, Bakar said that the matter has not been discussed so
far.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there are a number of countries which have
offered to host the next round of meeting.
</P>
<P>
Taliban representative to Pakistan Abdul Hakeem told reporters
that "we want an early formation of the Ulema (religious scholars)
Commission. And it is the Ulema Commission that should discuss the
matters relating to ceasefire and release of POWs."
</P>
<P>
However, Hakeem said the Northern Alliance insists that these
issues should be discussed by the Joint Steering Committee, which
consists of five Taliban and nine alliance representatives.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance on
Thursday morning lasted for more than three hours. The two sides
are to resume their talks at 03:00 p.m. Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In their talks Wednesday, the two Afghan warring factions
reached a three-point agreement: each side will submit a list of
Ulema for the commission; neither side will have the right to veto
any names on the proposed list; and the deliberations and
decisions should be completed and implemented in accordance with
the principles of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the fifth day since the Taliban and the Northern
Alliance opened their peace talks on Sunday. As previously-agreed
by the two sides, the ongoing intra-Afghan peace talks are to be
concluded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the divergence of opinion on certain important issues, the
Taliban and the rival Northern Alliance are not expected to make
any major breakthrough before the end of the current round of
peace talks.

Talking about China's entry to the World Trade Organization,

further. Meanwhile, China has made great effort in opening up its

<P>
Zhu said he hoped that the American side would truly understand
the situation in China, which is a developing country, and take a

<HEADLINE> Experts Call on Control Spread of Harmful Seaweed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanographers have
warned relevant government departments to take measures to prevent
the spread of a dangerous seaweed into the Chinese coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
So-called "Super Seaweed" easily adapts to the marine
environment. It grows vigorously, absorbing vast amounts
of sunlight, oxygen and nutrients.
</P>
<P>
The vigorous growth of the seaweed most often decimates the
fish, shrimp and shellfish populations and destroys coral beds.
</P>
<P>
"Super Seaweed has wreaked havoc with the fishing operations
and the environments of many countries," said an expert
with the National Oceanographic Bureau (NOB).
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that immediate steps should be taken
to expand research into methods of reducing the damage caused by
this plant, as well as effective measures to eradicate it. The rapid
spread of Super Seaweed results from the fact that the plant grows
on the hulls of vessels which regularly ply the world's oceans.
</P>
<P>
The NOB says that the plant has not as yet been found in
China's sea areas, but stress that the possibility of its
appearance in the Chinese waters exists because a large number of
ships enter into the nation's ports.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has organized experts to conduct research on the
plant, and has informed the Customs, ports and quarantine stations
to adopt appropriate measures.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Launches Largest Operation Against Kurdish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government troops are
carrying on a military operation against the Kurdish rebels in
eastern and southeastern Turkey, the largest over the past 14
years, Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
General Nahit Snogul, head of 24 army generals commanding the
mission, was quoted by the paper as saying at a press conference
late Wednesday in the southeastern province of Bingol that about
40,000 Turkish troops participated in the military action
codenamed "Murat" starting from April 25.
</P>
<P>
In respect of the size of battlefield and level of
participation, the operation is the largest of its kind since the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) began guerilla warfares in
the region since 1984, Snogul said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five days, a total of 35 PKK members were killed
by Turkish government troops and three army soldiers died during
the fightings as well.
</P>
<P>
Some PKK rebels have been surrounded in a triangular area
between provinces of Bingol and Diyarbakir by the government
troops, according to Snogul.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the militants to surrender, Snogul said that "we
don't want anyone to die, even though they are terrorists." He
promised that they would be treated in a humanitarian manner if
they lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commander also denied press reports that Sedin
Sakik, a former senior member of the PKK who was captured two
weeks ago by Turkish security authorities in northern Iraq, had
anything to do with the military operation.
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched in accordance with a plan worked
out by Turkish General Staff in February, Snogul said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts, however, believe that Sakik most probably
provided some useful information to the Turkish military regarding
the deployment of the PKK forces in the mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, there are around 4,800 PKK
militants involved in the anti-government war, 2,300 in eastern
and southeastern Turkey and 2,500 in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old bloody war against the
Turkish government in an attempt to establish an independent
Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 35,000 rebels, soldiers and civilians were killed in
the armed clashes between government troops and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets U.S. Secretary Of State (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in a
meeting here today with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, said that he believes President Clinton's upcoming visit
to China will further the development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Chinese government places great importance on
President Clinton's state visit to China in June, which is another
major event in Sino-American relations after Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that, with joint effort and
conscientious preparation on both sides, President Clinton's visit
would be a great success.
</P>
<P>
Albright, while emphasizing the importance of the U.S.-China
relationship, said that the American side is delighted to see the
opportunities for the United States and China to develop
cooperation in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
She said President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States
last fall demonstrated the depth of the development of the
U.S.-China relationship. She said the U.S. side expects President
Clinton's visit to further consolidate relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed appreciation and gratitude for China's
stabilizing role during the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China, while closely following the development of this
financial crisis, has promised not to devalue its currency and has
provided assistance to affected countries within its capability
through bilateral and multilateral channels, although its own
economy has also been affected by the crisis, with further
consequences possible.
</P>
<P>
"All this constitutes China's positive contributions to
safeguarding regional stability and proves that China is a
responsible big country," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Arrives in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
arrived in Israel on Thursday to attend the activities of Israel's
50th anniversary of its founding at the invitation of the
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Gore was greeted at the Ben Gurion Airport by
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Gore is scheduled to attend the "Jubilee Bells" event at
Givat Ram Stadium here Thursday evening, which will be the major
anniversary event to be attended by Israeli government leaders
and thousands of local people.
</P>
<P>
Another important mission for Gore during his visit is to
try to help break the deadlock on the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Gore will meet with President Ezer Weizman Thursday and hold
official talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on this
issue Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Gore will leave Israel for an unannounced
destination, probably Egypt or Jordan, and will return to Israel
Saturday evening. Shortly after his return, Gore will hold talks
in the West Bank city of Ramallah with Yasser Arafat, President of
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Paletinian peace talks have been stalled for over a
year due to Israel's activities of building Jewish settlement
housing units on Har Homa in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock, high level meetings have been planned
between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Netanyahu
and Arafat in London on May 4. The London meetings will discuss
the U.S. new proposal for bringing the Mideast peace process
back on track.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal, which has not been made public so far, is to
ask Israel to conduct a 13.1 percent troop redeployment in the
West Bank, to ask Israel to have a "time out" for settlement
activities, and to ask both sides to work out ways for security
cooperation and the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross returned to the region on Sunday to
try to lay the grounds for the London talks, but his mission has
achieved no progress so far although he held several rounds of
talks with the Israelis and Palestinians during his shuttle
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli troop redeployment, Arafat openly stated on
Wednesday in Gaza that he accepts the U.S. 13.1 percent pullback
proposal, but Netanyahu has insisted that his government can not
hand that much land to the PNA during the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Whether Gore could succeed in urging Israel to accept the
U.S. proposal still remains uncertain.

in leading Egyptian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has warned western
countries against harboring terrorists and granting them political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
In an interview released by the second channel of the French

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Cairo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has advised Netanyahu to accept a U.S.-proposed plan on
Israel's withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank. Netanyahu
rejected the suggestion, and instead demanded Mubarak to exert
influence on Palestinians to make more concessions.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian and U.S. officials expected a scheduled visit by
U.S. Vice President Al Gore to Cairo next Sunday will give a new
impetus towards the promotion of the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Gore is to hold talks with Mubarak and their discussions will
focus on developing economic cooperation between Cairo and
Washington.
</P>

Gore's two-day visit to Egypt falls within the context of a
regional tour which will also take him to Saudi Arabian and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases 140 Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- About 140 detainees, including
some journalists, have been released in Nigeria on the orders of
the Head of State, General Sani Abacha, the New Nigerian reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, this is not in response to the list of 60 persons for
whom the Catholic Pontiff Pope John Paul II pleaded for clemency
during his visit to Nigeria last month, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper quoted a reliable resource as saying
that the release should be seen as a most magnanimous gesture of
the Abacha regime, not induced by any local or international
pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
Those released who are in four categories include those
convicted on various offences but who are over 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
They also include 10 convicted persons serving life
sentences but having already spent more than 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Also released are journalists detained under Decree Two of the
government. The number of freed journalists is yet to be known.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth category are about 120 freed persons awaiting
trial for various offences.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha, in a nationwide broadcast to mark the
country's independence anniversary, promised on November 17, 1997
to release only those whose freedom would not undermine the peace
and stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not say when the detainees were freed. But

<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and people
place high value on the forthcoming state visit by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, said President Jiang Zemin this morning, adding that
he is looking forward to meeting with his U.S. counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted to see continuing improvements in Sino-US
relations in recent years. The common understanding President
Clinton and I reached in Washington has turned into reality on a
step by step basis," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that increased contacts between high-ranking
officials from the two countries have been accompanied by expanded
economic and trade cooperation, as well as increased exchanges and
cooperation in the environmental, science and education
sectors. He also noted new progress in cultural, military and
legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Facts have demonstrated that so long as the Chinese and
American leaders consider and handle Sino-US relations from a
truely strategic stand and long-term point of view, they can
master the times and historical trends and push the bilateral
relationship to a new stage, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton and I decided to engage in joint efforts to
establish a constructive Sino-US strategic partnership for the
21st century. So doing complies not only with the fundamental
interests of both countries, but will also benefit world peace,
stability and prosperity," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States are actively preparing for
President Clinton's scheduled visit and we sincerely hope the
visit will be highly successful and further promote Sino-US
relations, Jiang told Albright.

<HEADLINE> 200,000-Year-Old Stalagmite in Central China Insured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A stalagmite, which has growing
in a cave in central China for 200,000 years, has been insured for
100 million yuan (12 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is the first natural landscape to be insured in China,
according to Ping'an Insurance Company, which holds the policy on
the stalagmite.
</P>
<P>
The 19.2-meter-high stalagmite is regarded as a symbolic scenic
spot of Huanglongdong Cave, or the Yellow Dragon Cave, in central
China's Hunan Province. The cave is home to more than 3,000
stalagmites.
</P>
<P>
"The stalagmite is wide in two ends and thin in the middle, and
there is a possibility of breakage," said Ye Wenzhi, an executive
of Huanglongdong Tourism Investment Co. Ltd., the applicant. "The
symbolic stalagmite makes no small contribution to Huanglongdong's
30 million yuan annual income."
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the insurance company should pay
damages caused by geological changes, fires, floods, storms or
lightning strikes. However, damage from earthquakes or human
activities are not covered.
</P>
<P>
"The premium rate is only five per 10,000, but the stalagmite
has grown for 200,000 years and we estimate that the risk of
damage is low," said an official with the insurance company.
</P>
<P>
Huanglongdong Tourism Investment Co. Ltd. said they want to
increase the protection awareness of the company's employees
through the insurance, at the same time building up the company's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
So far, the stalagmites and stalactites in the cave have been
put under special protection by the company.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Issue Licences to More Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to issue
licences to more insurance companies in the country to break the
monopoly of the National Insurance Corporation (NIC), local
newspapers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Crony Asukenye Kasamala, the Commissioner of Insurance in the
Ministry of Finance, said at a signing ceremony here
Wednesday that 27 companies have made inquiries of doing
insurance business in the east African country, and 10 of them
have collected application forms.
</P>
<P>
According to Kasamala, three have returned forms with
registration fees. The regulatory authorities are scrutinizing
the applications before issuing licences to them, he said, adding
that the process may take some two months.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during the signing
ceremony of subscription and agreement between the Jubilee
Insurance Company (Tanzania) Limited and the Washington-based
International Finance Corporation (IFC).
</P>
<P>
Jubilee is a subsidiary of the Aga Khan Fund of Economic
Development (AKFED), which has a wide interest in tourism,
banking and industrial promotion services.
</P>
<P>
Officials with IFC, the wing of the World Bank that finances
private sector investments, said that Jubilee is likely to be the
first private insurance company to be approved in Tanzania since
the sector was liberalized last year.
</P>
<P>
IFC and AKFED respectively invested 285,000 US Dollars in the
Jubilee Insurance Company (Tanzania) Limited, which will provide
general, non-life insurance and also plans to offer life
insurance after one to two years.
</P>
<P>
Jubilee was operating in Tanzania during 1937 and 1967 until
insurance business was nationalized. At that time, the company
controlled about 30 to 40 percent of Tanzania's insurance market.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Warns West Against Sheltering Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has warned that those Western countries giving shelter or
political asylum to terrorists will have the repercussions, the
English Daily Egyptian Gazette reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French TV Channel 2, broadcast
Wednesday night, Mubarak said that the terrorists would soon turn
on the countries that harbored them.
</P>
<P>
"Those terrorists have no loyalty to the countries that shelter
them exactly as they do not have towards their own countries," he
said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists, the Egyptian leader added, served foreign
powers in Afghanistan and in other areas that seek to undermine
stability in Arab and Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Unless the United States and the European countries are on full
alert, Mubarak warned, "the plague of terrorism will prevail the
world."
</P>
<P>
Muslim militants have been fighting a violent war against
Mubarak's secular government since 1992. After last November's
Luxor attack against foreign tourists, Cairo repeatedly demanded
Western countries including Britain to extradite leading Egyptian
terrorists known to be remote-controlling the insurgency back home.
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 people have been killed in the violence, which
mostly took place in the relatively less-developed Upper
Egypt. Fifty-eight foreign tourists were killed in the November
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak ruled out dialog with Egyptian terrorist groups and
pledged more severe crackdown on them. He added that terrorists
used the dialog during the time of late President Anwar el Sadat
to expand their ranks.
</P>
<P>
Reconciliation talks had been conducted by Sadat's government
and the rebels before they gave way to more Muslim insurgency that
led to Sadat's assassination by militants in 1981.
</P>
<P>
"We had to take very strict measures within the law. Dialog
with terrorists was a big mistake that allowed them to beef up
their groups," he said.

<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has said it is not planning another nationwide work
boycott, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be seeking a mandate from workers on the next
course of action regarding their demands for the government to
scrap unpopular taxes and levies.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Tsvangirai, Secretary-General of the Labour Movement
that organized a national job stayaway on March 3 and 4 this
year, told a press conference Wednesday that the ZCTU also had no
intention of transforming itself into a political party that will
challenge the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF).
</P>
<P>
"There are rumours going round that the ZCTU will be
announcing a stayaway. We have not completed our consultations
and we will only announce a stayaway or no stayaway when we have
completed that exercise," he said, adding they will call a
special general council meeting on the way forward.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU wished to dispel rumours that the labour movement
would soon launch itself into a political party, Tsvangirai
noted.
</P>
<P>
"That is mischievous. If it is being discussed, it is not by
us because we are not thinking of forming a political party," he
said.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Company Hires Managers at Top Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The collectively-owned Dongjiang
Group, a high-tech enterprise in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, posed a challenge to state-owned enterprises by hiring
managers at high salary.
</P>
<P>
The company employed five senior executives recently, including
a vice-president, a vice-president in charge of the group's
marketing, a general manager, an accounting manager and a
technology manager of its subsidiary, Dongjiang Industrial Corp.
</P>
<P>
The annual salary for the five executives is 1.1 million yuan,
accounting for 50 percent of the company's wages. Moreover, the
salary of 200,000 yuan a year is 10 times that of managers of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
So far, four of the five managers have taken office, and the
technology manager is expected to start soon.
</P>
<P>
Dongjiang Group is a developer of software and a producer of
magnetic cards and intelligent cards, said Li Peiying, chairman
and general manager of the Dongjiang Group.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dongjiang Group has adopted a 4-3-3 distribution
system of profits among the group, branch company and individual
employees. It means that the group takes 40 percent of the net
profit that an individual employee has made, and the rest will be
divided equally between the company he belongs to and the employee
himself.
</P>
<P>
"This distribution system is helpful to encouraging us to work
hard as we can, and enhance the competitiveness of my company,"
said Che Jianhua, chief accountant of Dongjiang Group.

<HEADLINE> Moi to Chair Kenya's Economic Consultative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
is scheduled to chair an economic consultative meeting on May 6
in a bid to solve the current economic difficulties facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Wednesday, the president said
that he would name some eminent economists from within and
outside the government to prepare a paper to guide the
deliberations at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of all political parties, diplomatic missions,
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were invited
to attend the consultative meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had held a meeting with the Development and
Democracy Group (DDG) representing 21 developed countries, and
the World Bank country director, during which he explained the
government's position on Kenya's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a forum on Kenya's economy was held in the port
city of Mombasa to seek ways for solving the country's economic
problems. The forum was sponsored by the World Bank, the United
States government and the German non-governmental organization of
Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.
</P>
<P>
President Moi criticized the forum for ignoring the existence
of a constitutionally elected government and accused the sponsors
of "having a hidden agenda and ulterior motives" against his
government.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the Kenyan government should be
the central player in any discussions regarding the interests of
the country, noting that the World Bank had no genuine reason to
discuss Kenyan matters with shady non-governmental organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 experts from home
and abroad have gathered in an international symposium in Shanghai
to make suggestions on how to decorate the city with sculptures.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, the first of its kind in the city, opened
Wednesday and focused on the relationship among urban
construction, sculptures and the environment. The experts --
specialists in sculpture, architecture, and horticulture -- come
from such countries as the United States, France, Germany,
Britain, Japan and Norway. Some of them are famous artists in
international sculpture and environmental art.
</P>
<P>
Gong Xueping, a Shanghai City official, met with the experts and
said that, with rapid economic development, Shanghai is taking on
a new look.
</P>
<P>
"But the city still lacks symbolic sculptures," said
Gong. "City sculptures are not only works of art but also a symbol
of the city's development."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to build a sculpture park and several symbolic
city sculptures in the Pudong New Area, according to Zhang
Yonghao, deputy director of Shanghai City Sculpture Committee.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Cases Increase Sharply in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- There has been an eightfold
increase of tuberculosis in Zimbabwe because of various factors
including overcrowding, malnutrition and high incidence of the
HIV virus which causes AIDS, The Herald daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
TB, which has been considered the disease of the past, has now
emerged as a major health threat. Now dubbed "the return of a
killer", TB was declared a global emergency last month.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase of TB in Zimbabwe is related and attributed
to HIV infection. Studies in Zimbabwe have shown that more than
50 percent of tuberculosis cases were HIV-related.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, said the report, TB cases rose from
5,848 in 1987 to 43,752 in 1997. The figures do not reflect the
true picture since not all TB cases are referred to the
government institutions.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Propose Anti-Money-Laundering Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is to propose that the
European Union establishes a convention for cooperation in
fighting against criminal money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Justice and European Legal Integration Minister Vasil
Gotsev said at the opening of an international seminar on money
laundering that the idea behind the convention was to make the
non-judiciary bodies which engage in financial intelligence
exchange data on the origin and movement of dirty money.
</P>
<P>
He said dirty money comes from narcotics businesses,
international crime and prostitution. The uncovering of dirty
money that has already been legalized would be difficult, but in
the future the laundering of money will be just as hard.
</P>
<P>
Narcotics are the principal source of dirty money, European
experts attending the seminar said. The turnover of the global
narcotics business amounts to some 1,000 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and the other former socialist countries are
potentially endangered by investments by international criminal
cartels which in the 1980s used to invest their money mainly in
Latin America, said Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Bozhidar
Popov.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions for success involve legislative measures and
political will, which we already have, stopping the inflow of
dirty money, and breaking the rings for investing such money,"
Popov said.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Bulgaria would draft instructions for
banking employees to help in the detection of suspicious money
operations, Roumyana Georgieva of the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to eliminate this type of crimes in Bulgaria
because a large number of the payments were made in cash,
Georgieva said.
</P>
<P>
The methods preferred by Bulgarian money launderers involve
investing in foreign assets, gambling and shops, said Deputy
Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski.
</P>
<P>
Oresharski predicted that in the future money launderers would
turn to the stock exchange. In the 1990s Bulgaria was one of the
countries where money laundering was flourishing, he stated.

<HEADLINE> Largest Jasper Ornament Unearthed in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Some beautifully designed jaspers
2,200 years old have been removed from a newly found tomb in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said one of the jaspers is the largest of its kind
ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is located two kilometers from the north gate of the
city of Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province. Its occupant is a male
in his 40s, around whom experts found four jaspers and 12 jade
bars.
</P>
<P>
"The largest one has been smashed into 25 pieces and placed on
the head and belly of the tomb occupant," said an archeologist, who
explained that it was meant to ward off evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
After broken pieces were carefully reassembled, the jasper
regained its original appearance -- 43.2 centimeters in diameter,
round and flat in shape with a hole in the center. People can see
animal-masks, millet patterns and birds with phoenix heads and
snake-shaped bodies carved on the stone.
</P>
<P>
The tomb's occupant is believed to have been an official
guarding the emperor's treasure hall or a warrior during the Qin
Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) in accordance with a few characters carved
on jaspers and a large number of iron swords, arrowheads and
bronze crossbow triggers also found in the coffin.

<HEADLINE> China Can Meet Market Demand for New Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's aerospace industry
has consistently developed new rockets in accordance with market
demand, according to today's Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper explained that China has acquired a capacity to
develop high quality rockets.
</P>
<P>
China's Long March 3b rockets not only fully satisfy the
demands for placing geosynchronous in orbit, but also offer
certain technical advantages for the low- to medium-earth orbit
satellite market.
</P>
<P>
China has also developed a number of other rockets of the Long
March family, including Long March 2c/sd rockets with a 17 percent
launch success rate since 1975 and an upgraded model of the same
rocket which carried foreign manufactured satellites into orbit on
two separate occassions.
</P>
<P>
China has used the Long March Carrier Rocket to place
satellites in orbit since 1970, with an 88 percent success rate,
of 44 successful launches out of 50 attempts.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen launches have placed commercial satellites in orbit
for customers from a number of countries and regions, including
the United States, Sweden, Australia, Pakistan, the Philippines
and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Portable Computer Prices Fall with Chip Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Computer chip price cuts by
Intel Corp. have heralded a new round of falling notebook PC
prices in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Two notebook makers, Acer and Winbook, slashed prices on the
same day that Intel cut costs on its mobile Pentium MMX and
Pentium II chips.
</P>
<P>
Intel launched the two mobile Pentium processors at the
beginning of April. By the end of the month the prices of the two
models were lowered by eight to 15 percent. The cuts of older
Pentium models were up to more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the chip price cuts, the two notebook makers lowered
the prices of their low-end products by 20 percent. One model, for
instance, was cut from 1,499 U.S. dollars to 1,199 dollars. The
high-end portables were also cut by seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, laptops were among the most profitable segments
of the PC market. When makers of desktop PCs were slashing prices
below 2,000 U.S. dollars, notebook makers were still getting 6,000
to 7,000 dollars. Those days ended in 1997, when desktop PCs
costing less than 1,000 dollars suddenly grabbed about one-third
of the consumer market in the United States. Laptop prices dropped
below 2,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The changing market had affected the earnings of both chip and
computer makers. Intel's earnings dropped by 27 percent in the
first quarter this year from the fourth quarter 1997. Industry
analysts said that the chipmaking giant suffered from a failure to
compete aggressively at the low end of the market. The chip price
cuts indicate that Intel has been learning from the lesson.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Hewlett-Packard also cut prices on notebook
models using MMX chip, to make room for Pentium II models.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if Intel could not increase demand for
high-powered systems, it was going to be a tough four to six
quarters for PC industry as a whole.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Argentina beat old rivals
Brazil 1-0 here on Wednesday in a friendly that was part of both
teams' preparation for the upcoming 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Striker Claudio Lopez stunned a near-100,000 crowd in the 84th
minute with a superb goal, collecting the ball near the corner
flag, breaking free of Junior Baiano and slotted the ball home.
</P>
<P>
Argentina deserved the win, having enjoyed the better of most
of the game and keeping Brazil's dreaded Ronaldo-Romario
strikeforce under wraps throughout.
</P>
<P>
Argentina didn't put on a great exhibition, but they made
fewer mistakes and counterattacked effectively.
</P>
<P>
Argentina claimed their 30th victory over their longtime
rivals, to the 29 triumphs Brazil have posted in the 84 matches
contested between the two.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Brazil had hosted a match here since a

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Investment Flows into Poland in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- About 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign investments flowed into Poland in the first quarter of
this year, according to statistics from the Polish Foreign
Investment Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The figure means that foreign investment for the first half of
this year should exceed the 1.9 billion dollars in the first six
months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of March this year, the total amount of foreign
investment in the 1990s reached 22.1 billion U.S. dollars. The
bureau estimated that the number might reach 30 billion dollars by
the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper "Rzeczpospolita" reported Wednesday that there
was not much change on the structure of foreign investment. But
investment in the financial service sector slightly increased.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that more investment will flow into the
food processing and automobile industries in the near future.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Daewoo Group has invested one billion dollars in
Poland for automobile manufacturing and sales.
</P>
<P>
A report from "Gazeta Wyboreza" said the United States and
Germany were on the top of list of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts maintained that the direct cause for surge of
foreign investment in Poland was the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia. On top of that, Poland recently has better
performed economically than its neighbors such as Czech and
Hungary, and become more attractive to investors.

MANAGUA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan city of Matagalpa
declared a state of emergency on Tuesday because of a lack of
water.
</P>
<P>
The city, about 130 kilometers away from Managua, is suffering
the severe water shortage because of the El Nino phenomenon.

The city's 230,000 inhabitants get their water from the Molino
Norte and Grande Rivers of Matagalpa. But because of the dry
season, the two rivers do not have enough water to supply the
population.

<P>
The emergency state may be prolonged until the beginning of

<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States-Japan military

nature, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said here Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Bans Logging of Precious Timber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 29 -- Nicaragua President Arnoldo Aleman signed
a decree on Wednesday to prevent logging of mahogany, cedar and
bombax trees throughout the national territory over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
"This not only benefits ourselves, but also future generations
of the whole world," said a statement releaseed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The decree says that the degradation rates in the country are
growing at an alarming pace, due mainly to timber exploitation, so
it is necessary to check and up-date the use and utilization of
the forests.
</P>
<P>
The decree will cancel all the logging permits of the three
timbers, and warns that any violation will resault in the
confiscation of the timber and fines of up to 20,000 cordobas
(around 2,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
President Aleman expressed the view that a sole decree would
not be enough to prohibit the logging of precious trees, and it
was urgent that "deputies enact a law imposing jail sanctions on
everybody who does not respect the resolution."
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Nicaraguan government has been taken
because of the constant denunciations of over-exploitation of
forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip, the comptroller general of the republic,
Agustin Jarquin, witnessed the condition of forestry exploitation
caused by the over-logging formerly granted by the ministry of
environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Last monday the comptroller sent a letter to the government
requesting urgent measures to protect the natural resources.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided
to extend the deadline for repatriating foreign illegal workers
for another 30 days.
</P>
<P>
However, the extension of the deadline, originally set for may
1, is only applied to foreign workers working at rice mills,
quarries and rubber plantations.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chairs a national
committee to solve foreign labor problems, said on Wednesday that
the committee had agreed to give the employment department 30 more
days after may 1 to find if there was a shortage of labor in rice
mills, quarries and rubber plantations.

<P>
If the findings showed that there was not such a shortage as
stated by some businessmen, the foreign workers would be
repatriated, Bhichai was quoted by Thursday's Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government said earlier that it would repatriate about
300,000 foreign workers this year. there are more than 1 million
foreign workers in Thailand, according to official statistics.

These people can also seek Thai authorities' permission to work
for the fisheries industry and other related industries in 22
provinces for another year.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 representatives from the rice mills association of
Thailand have asked the Thai government to ensure that concerned
officials refrain from taking any action against millers who
continue to employ foreigners after the may 1 deadline.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Postal Dispute Takes New Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's postal dispute has
taken a new turn for the worse from today with workers deciding to
stage a sit down strike, postal union sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Workers in post offices throughout the country will stage a sit
down strike whereby they will report for duty but will not perform
any work, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Union of Posts and Telecom Officers
N.P. Hettiarachchi said this was in addition to the overtime
boycott they were conducting at present.
</P>
<P>
This latest act of defiance was against the transfer of nine
union leaders.
</P>
<P>
The transfers followed the promulgation of Emergency
Regulations to declare the postal service an Essential Service by
the government last Friday to stifle a 44-day strike by the postal
Unions demanding overtime payments and the removal of the Post
Master General.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that a sit down strike by postal workers
would be a violation of the Essential Services promulgation and
they would be liable to punishment.
</P>
<P>
Measures by the government to mediate in the strike have so far
failed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile several trade unions outside the postal service both
in the state and private sectors are due to stage a massive lunch
hour demonstration in Colombo today against the governments
decision to use Emergency Regulations to stifle the strike and the
arrest of union leaders.

BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's manufacturing firms have
witnessed rapid development in export since the country loosened
approval conditions and streamlined applications procedures for
these firms to gain import and export rights, said today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
With another 2,000-plus manufacturing enterprises obtaining
foreign trade rights in 1997, there had been 8,000 company members in
the category by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of enterprises whose self-conducted export volume
exceeded ten million US dollars rose by 71 to 487 last year, with
their total export volume reaching 14.47 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A survey made by the State Trade and Economic Commission on
4,700 enterprises covering 13 sectors show that of these
companies' 38.5 billion US dollars of total foreign trade volume
in 1997, their self-conducted export amounted to as high as 20.3
billion US dollars.

<P>
JINAN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong province is
well prepared for flood prevention efforts along the Yellow River,
the second largest river in China, according to the local
government.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to invest 50 million yuan in 25
infrastructure construction projects along the river, including
the reinforcement of dikes and rechanneling projects. Some 50
percent of the total funding has been allocated to date.
</P>
<P>
An overall check of flood control facilities, conducted in
March, has uncovered possibly dangerous areas which the province
is currently repairing.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River was prone to endemic flooding which resulted
in heavy losses of both life and property prior to the founding of
New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
However, the past 48 years has been relatively free from major
disasters or losses along the river thanks to the efforts of local
people and governments at all levels.

has expressed the Fund's satisfaction with the country's
performance in implementing its ongoing economic reform measures.
</P>
<P>
Narvekar made the expression here Wednesday after meeting with
Indonesian Vice President B.J. Habibie, the "Jakarta Post" daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF envoy said he was optimistic the IMF executive board

However, the final decision will be made by the 24-member board
which is to met on May 4, he said.
</P>

Indonesia and the IMF reached an agreement in October last year
on a 43 billion U.S. dollar bailout package to overcome the

conduct wide-ranging economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The IMF disbursed the first tranche of 3 billion U.S. dollars
in aid in December.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF delayed the second tranche of 3 billion dollars
scheduled last month after Indonesia failed to implement key terms
of its agreement with IMF.
</P>

Under a revised program agreement reached earlier this month,
Indonesia is subject to monthly performance reviews instead of
quarterly review under the initial IMF program.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group Steps Up Pressure for End to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The six-nation Contact Group on the
former Yugoslavia has announced a package of "incentives and
deterrents" to push Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo into
a negotiated end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Rome on Wednesday, the six states -- the United
States, France, Britain, Russia, Italy and Germany -- called for
an immediate end to violence in the Serbian province and the
opening of dialogue between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Although the six delegations urged both sides to renounce all
conditions of dialogue, the agreed package of measures mainly
targeted the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Among the incentives was the full reintegration of Yugoslavia
into international organizations, while the deterrents included a
freeze on Serbia's and the Yugoslav Federation's foreign assets --
a measure proposed at the Contact Group's meeting in London last
month.
</P>
<P>
The group also announced that if Belgrade hindered the start
of dialogue, the group's next meeting in Paris would call for a
halt on all foreign investments in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint declaration released after the meeting,
Russian representatives withheld approval for the two deterrents,
saying they were excessively "punitive."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that only the
United Nations Security Council had the right to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement appeared to coincide with the
U.S. calls this week for harsher sanctions against Yugoslavia,
which Washington believes has not been doing enough to halt the
violence. This position is generally shared in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Although Belgrade has offered to negotiate with the ethnic
Albanians, their leader Ibrahim Rugova has not taken up the offer,
claiming it is only a ploy to cover recent Serb military action in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo Albanians, who form 90 percent of the province's two
million population, want autonomy for their province while some
sections of the community there are calling for fully-fledged
secession.
</P>
<P>
So far Serbia has refused to consider the idea and Western
countries have also said secession is not an option, although a
greater level of self-rule is.
</P>
<P>
About 80 people have been killed in the province in the clashes
between the Serb police and alleged separatists since this
February.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Leaders Confident of Approving NATO's Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate leaders said on
Wednesday they were confident that the Senate will vote for NATO
expanding on tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Following their meeting with President Bill Clinton, both
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Minority Leader Tom Daschle
said they believe the measure on the alliance's expansion will win
a two-thirds majority in the 100-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we are going to be able to do that, and we
will have final passage tomorrow of this very important treaty
that is important to, I think not only the United States national
security but security in all of Europe," Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Senate began the debate on Monday and has focused on more
than two dozens of amendments to the measure.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Lott and Daschle at the White House, Clinton
said, "I must say, I've been very impressed by the debate and I'm
looking forward to a positive vote by the end of this week."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Senate rejected by 62-37 one attempt to set
up a special NATO process to resolve disputes among allies but
more than dozens of amendments to the measure remained to be voted
on Thursday and final passage could slip to Friday.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, which only require a simple majority, include a
move by Democratic Sen. Daniel Moynihan of New York to allow
countries to join NATO only after they have been allowed into the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Senate also overwhelmingly rejected a measure
to limit the U.S. shares in the costs of expanding NATO.
</P>
<P>
The amendment proposed by Senator Tom Harkin would have
restricted the amount of military subsidies the United States
provides to the prospective members to 25 percent of total NATO
aid to the countries.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO signed accession protocols with Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic in December and the three countries
will be full NATO members after the documents are ratified by all
NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Denmark, Germany and Norway have ratified the protocols
up to date. A NATO summit meeting has been scheduled in
Washington next spring to formally accept the new three members.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Rejects Lewinsky's Immunity Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has ruled that
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky does not have immunity
from prosecution in the investigation into whether President Bill
Clinton had an affair with her and sought to cover it up,
television networks reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has firmly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was under seal, CBS and ABC said in their nightly
news shows. Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, told CBS
that he was not aware of the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson. The office of her other attorney, Nathan
Speights, said it also had not be notified of the decision.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg had gone to court trying to enforce what he has said
was a deal in late January with Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth
Starr in which his client would be given immunity for her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Starr's investigation on the Lewinsky
matter had slowed in recent weeks as the judge weighed several
issues, including a dispute between the prosecutor's and attorneys
for Clinton aides who have refused to answer grand jury questions,
claiming executive privilege.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province Destroys 120,000 Spindles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a leading
industrial base in northeast China, has significantly reduced its
textile production capacity by destroying 120,000 obsolete
spindles since the initial reduction project was completed by the
Shenyang Textile Mill on March 25.
</P>
<P>
Local sources indicate that the province plans to destroy over
691,000 obsolete cotton spindles over the next three years in a
move to reduce the province's total textile production capacity by
50 percent. Some 410,000 spindles will be destroyed this year, and
some 80,000 textile workers will lose their jobs over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning will not only carry out the spindle reduction
campaign, but will also establish six textile groups by
introducing inter-regional mergers among cotton mills.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Textile Mill, established over 70 years ago, will
remove 75,000 of its 88,000 spindles, and in turn significantly
reduce its payroll by laying off some 4,000 workers during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The mill will close down operations covering 100,000 sq.m, and
will introduce real estate development and property management
departments, in addition to forming a textile group based on
several local textile mills, according to company officials.
</P>
<P>
China launched a national spindle reduction campaign earlier
this year in a bid to raise the efficiency of the textile industry
and help related firms turn losses into profits.
</P>
<P>
The national plans call for the textile sector to destroy 10
million obsolete cotton spindles by the year 2000, in addition to
transferring some 1.2 million textile workers to other sectors.
</P>
<P>
China destroyed some 742,000 obsolete cotton spindles during
the first quarter of this year, or 98.9 percent of the targeted
figure for the period.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sees Moderate GDP Growth for Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has projected that
the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Philippines will post a
2.8 percent growth in 1998 despite the slowdown in business
activities due to the lingering effects of a depreciating
currency.
</P>
<P>
In a confidential country assessment report published here
Thursday, the bank said that a "sharp reduction in growth appears
unavoidable under current conditions of tightening credit
availability and its impact on private consumption and
investment."
</P>
<P>
The GDP projection is a big contraction from the 5.1-percent
growth for the overall 1997. But it is still higher than the lower
end of the range target of 2.4 percent programmed under the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed precautionary
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
As the economy weathers the currency storm, the bank foresees
the domestic economy to rebound and post a growth of 4.8 percent
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank said that the incoming administration
will have to adhere to the precautionary agreement set forth with
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The bank stressed that the conditionalities tied to the
18-month precautionary arrangement are designed to strengthen the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We and the IMF aim to contain the remaining risks through a
number of safeguards including agreement on strong programs that
bind the current and new administration and provide framework for
continuity of policies," the bank declared.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the incoming presidential elections
would impact on the economic growth as there is uncertainty
whether the new administration would proceed with the structural
reform measures adopted by previous governments.
