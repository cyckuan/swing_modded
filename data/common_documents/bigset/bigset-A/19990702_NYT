COMMENTARY: A BAD YEAR FOR THE WORLD'S BORDER GUARDS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among its other casualties, the war in Kosovo punctured the
sanctity of state sovereignty _ the idea that a nation's actions
within its borders are its own business. This concept has organized
international relations since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648.
That year, as Europe's religious empires crumbled, the Continent's
powerful states agreed to respect each other's sovereignty,
founding the modern state system. That has now been eroding for 50
years, but the events of the past year have been a blow like no
other, and one that should be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereignty's worst day in memory was undoubtedly March 24. NATO
began bombing Serbia, probably the first multinational attack
designed primarily to stop violations of international law within a
country's borders. The same day, England's high court ruled that
London could send Augusto Pinochet to Spain to be tried for crimes
in Chile, as both European countries had signed an international
convention promising to prosecute torturers, no matter where their
crimes took place.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 27, the war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia announced a warrant for the arrest of Slobodan
Milosevic. It was the first indictment of a sitting head of state
for violations of international law. A year ago, 120 nations, not
including the United States, signed a treaty establishing an
international criminal court, in which international law trumps
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   While sovereignty has been fading since the end of World War II,
until recently governments have in general ceded powers
voluntarily. European nations have voted their way into defense,
political and monetary unions. Globalization has been bringing down
economic borders, but whether to open up has been a nation's
choice, although one influenced by substantial economic pressure.
Peacekeepers and election observers are found around the world, but
they do not arrive without the blessing of their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   This year's attacks on sovereignty had widespread approval, but
not from Milosevic or Pinochet. That is a shift toward respecting a
nation's sovereignty only when it respects the rights of its people
as international law defines them.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has been growing since the end of World War II. The
Nuremberg tribunal introduced the concept that leaders' treatment
of their own people was subject to international prosecution. The
United Nations _ organized around sovereignty _ also created one of
the most important tools for the assault on sovereignty today, the
1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nations also signed the
Geneva Conventions and a treaty promising to punish genocide
carried out anywhere in the world. These laws were never enforced
because Cold War politics intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are the first stirrings of enforcement. Pinochet's
government had signed the Torture Convention that nabbed him. The
international criminal court will apply laws endorsed by nearly
every country. The war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia
and Rwanda were established by the United Nations and have been
fair. The Yugoslav tribunal has prosecuted Serbs, Croats and
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of Serbia was based on the same principle _
enforcing respect for international law. But many people all over
the world did not perceive it that way. Because the bombing was not
done under U.N. auspices, theories abounded that Washington was
really trying to establish hegemony in the Balkans or assure the
flow of Caspian basin oil.
</P>
<P>
   The war did not get U.N. Security Council approval because
Russia and China called NATO's motives not universal, but
political. The brief period of world consensus on the limits of
sovereignty is closing precisely because the notion has come far
enough to scare many nations. Russia worries it will be criticized
or even invaded for its abuses in Chechnya, and China has the same
defensiveness over its behavior in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Serbia was indeed based on political
considerations. Yugoslavia is in Europe, the abuses were on CNN,
and it is a weak country where quick and effective intervention
seemed likely. That this human rights crisis was chosen for
intervention over others, however, does not make the intervention
less necessary or legitimate. The weight of political
considerations, moreover, shows why Russia and China need not fear
similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Absolute respect for sovereignty, of course, was even more
political than the challenge to it posed today. The remarkable
development is that some of the actions of the past year have
managed to rise above politics. Power politics will always rule
international affairs. But the last 50 years have seen the rise of
universally endorsed principles of conduct. The extent to which the
world chooses to respect them, even when they conflict with
sovereignty, is a good measure of civilization's progress.

METS BEAT MARLINS, 12-8 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Octavio Dotel will always remember the New York Mets'
12-8 victory over the Florida Marlins on Thursday night because it
was his first victory in the major leagues. Otherwise, it would
have been a day to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to an early eight-run lead, Dotel barely hung on for five
rocky innings to record the victory in his second major-league
start. All the 23-year-old right-hander needed was two more walks
to complete a bizarre pitching line: five innings, five hits, five
runs, five earned runs, three walks, five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was not quite the stuff major-league dreams
are made of. Nor was it convincing, considering that the Mets'
offense, with Mike Piazza given the night off, ran up leads of 8-0
and 10-2 for Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   After two starts, Dotel has allowed 11 hits, 10 runs and 8 walks
in nine and one-third innings. His earned run average is 10.61. But
he was happy just the same. He said he had not received the
traditional game ball yet. ``But it's not the only one coming,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel is obviously not short on confidence. But his struggles
may be one reason the Mets are considering re-signing Allen Watson,
whom they traded two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Dotel's quest for victory No. 1, the main question for
the Mets at Pro Player Stadium was would they get five innings in
before the game was rained out. That was one of the reasons Dotel
said he had problems in the fifth with the 10-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody said anything to me, but I was thinking to myself that
I wanted to finish the fifth quickly so the game would be
official,'' Dotel said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he was pitching in a downpour. A half-inning earlier,
he had been hit in the head by a pitch from Brian Edmondson, and by
the time Dotel had struck out Mark Kotsay to finish the fifth, it
was a 10-5 game.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wallace, the Mets' pitching coach had already visited the
mound once to chastise Dotel for having shown dismay at an umpire's
ball call. There was action in the Mets' bullpen. Another visit
would have meant Dotel was gone _and along with him, his chance for
victory.
</P>
<P>
   He was nearly gone in the top of the fifth after being struck
squarely on the back of the helmet. ``It worked,'' the trainer Fred
Hina said of the helmet that protected Dotel's head. ``We teased
him and said it hit him in a good spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel said he was fine after the game. Still, the momentary
trauma might have explained Dotel's troubles in the bottom of the
inning, except for the fact Dotel was already struggling before the
beaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times his fastball was down in the zone and he threw his
breaking ball for strikes,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``And at
times his fastball was up in the zone and he was hanging some
breaking balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Dotel, he had a big cushion to work with. Which was
one reason he gave special thanks to his catcher, Todd Pratt, who
again was the hitting star. His two-run single with the bases
loaded helped key a six-run third, in which the Mets sent 11
batters to the plate. And Pratt's run-scoring single in the fourth
gave him three hits and three runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was in the starting lineup for only one reason. With a
three-game series at Shea Stadium against the first-place Atlanta
Braves this weekend, Valentine gave Piazza tonight what he had
given John Olerud the night before: a rare night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the schedule we have coming up,'' Valentine said.
``Mike came into the office and we talked about it. In order to
maximize his performance from here to the All-Star break, we
thought today was the best time to give him a blow.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was up to Pratt to give the catcher's critique of
Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a live arm,'' Pratt said. ``He's got some things to
learn, but he's going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will settle for an outing better than tonight's the
next time Dotel takes the mound.

YANKEES SHUT OUT TIGERS, 6-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Orlando Hernandez cheering him on _ ``Go!''
Hernandez yelled, in English, Spanish or Japanese _ Hideki Irabu
rushed out of the Yankees' dugout to pitch the fifth inning on
Thursday night, feeling great, his confidence high, probably the
best it has been since joining the Yankees two years ago. But there
was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hadn't finished batting in the bottom of the fourth;
there were only two outs. Irabu retreated to the dugout, grinning
at his own mistake, his teammates laughing, at him and with him.
Gone are the days when Irabu walks sluggishly to the mound each
inning as if marching onto a scaffold, and for now, there is no
talk of dumping Irabu. Nobody's calling him a fat toad anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu pitched a three-hit shutout against the Detroit Tigers on
Thursday night, as the Yankees won, 6-0, in what Manager Joe Torre
called the best regular-season outing of Irabu's tenure with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is my best overall game with the Yankees,'' said
Irabu, who was supported by a home run from Paul O'Neill and a
two-run double by Shane Spencer. The Yankees, who beat Dave Mlicki
(3-8), have won 10 of their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu (5-3) always does pitch well against the Tigers, a
free-swinging team that ranks last in the American League in
on-base percentage and walks; going into Thursday night's game,
Irabu was 4-0 with a 1.67 earned run average in seven career
appearances versus Detroit. But as one scout who watched Irabu on
Thursday night said, it didn't really matter who he faced. ``He
would've pitched well against anybody,'' the scout said.
</P>
<P>
   What Irabu did against the Tigers _ what he has been doing for
the better part of a month _ is to throw his curveball and fastball
for strikes early in the count. His curveball is unusually slow,
65-68 miles an hour, or about 25 mph slower than his fastball, and
for that reason, batters almost never swing at it; he threw 12 to
15 curves among his 105 pitches on Thursday night, and only Dean
Palmer tried hitting it, and that in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu got ahead in the count with his curveball, placing the
Tigers at an immediate disadvantage. ``If you get ahead like
that,'' Torre said, ``the hitter is pretty much at your mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Firing fastballs to both sides of the plate, Irabu needed only
36 pitches to get through the first three innings; it was not until
the fourth inning that the Tigers generated a hit, Bobby Higginson
slapping a single through the middle. Irabu retired the first 10
batters after Higginson's single, before Tony Clark and Juan
Encarnacion had back-to-back hits in the seventh _ the only time in
the first eight innings that the Tigers had a runner in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu threw just six pitches to set down the Tigers in order in
the eighth, and for Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre,
there was no debate about whether Irabu would pitch the ninth
inning: He had earned the right, and when Irabu emerged from the
dugout to throw the final inning, the fans clapped generously for
him.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Torre said that all he wanted from Irabu was
consistency, and Irabu has responded, allowing four runs or less in
his last six starts. He has won his last four decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu closed out Detroit quickly, the last out coming when Clark
lifted fly to O'Neill in right, the 16th fly ball or popup hit by
the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu pumped his right fist slightly, twice, a third time, and
shook hands with his catcher, Jorge Posada, and with his teammates,
chuckling and smiling as he went through the traditional line of
handshakes and high fives. Some fans who remained from the crowd of
26,311 waited behind the Yankees' dugout, stood and cheered, and
Irabu lifted off his cap. Not bad for the fifth starter in the
rotation.

HOUSE APPROVES DEREGULATION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The following story is an added starter on The New York Times
front page.) 
(Eds. TOPS with house approval of bill; CHANGES throughout.) 
 (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives approved legislation
Thursday night that would deregulate the nation's financial system
by removing the last remnants of Depression-era laws that have
largely kept banks, securities firms and insurance companies from
entering one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was adopted by a 343-86 vote. Despite new
opposition that developed Thursday by some Democrats, the measure
was largely endorsed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be forwarded to a conference committee, where the
lawmakers will try later this summer to reconcile it with a
different version that the Senate adopted two months ago. President
Clinton has threatened to veto the Senate version because, unlike
the House version, it would take away some authority of the
Treasury Department to regulate banks.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also opposed the Senate measure because it
dilutes the current law that requires banks to lend money to
minorities, inner-city neighborhoods, rural areas and others who
have historically been denied access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say the legislation would set off a new wave of
financial services mergers and allow banks, insurers and brokers to
expand their ranges of businesses. But there is debate over whether
it would benefit consumers. Although the lawmakers managed to get
the bill through the House by pushing aside several contentious
issues that could still doom the legislation, the vote Thursday
night was a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental precept of this bill is that it will end the
artificial restraints on commerce embodied in 65 years of law,''
said Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, who is chairman of the House Banking
Committee and was one of the main authors of the legislation. He
said it would ultimately save consumers at least $15 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   House approval marks the first time that both chambers of
Congress in the same legislative session have approved measures
repealing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. That landmark law
reflected the view that the close affiliations between banks and
securities firms had been a primary cause of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The Glass-Steagall Act restricted the securities activities of
national banks and prohibited investment banks from engaging in
commercial banking activities. Over the last 12 years, those
restrictions have eased considerably as judges and regulators have
interpreted the act more loosely.
</P>
<P>
   Their rulings have enabled the rise of some enormous financial
conglomerates. But many federal and state restrictions remain, and
they either limit the expansion of such conglomerates or make it
prohibitively expensive for affiliations between investment banks,
commercial banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate bills eliminate most of those
remaining restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic supporters of the House legislation either
withdrew their support Thursday or raised criticisms of it after
many of the items they had thought were in the legislation aimed at
protecting minority borrowers and the privacy rights of all
consumers were removed by the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all voted for this legislation in committee because we were
able to have strong community reinvestment provisions, because of
consumer protections and because of strong anti-redlining
provisions,'' said Rep. John J. LaFalce of New York, the ranking
Democrat on the banking committee. ``Once those items eroded, so
did our support.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions of the legislation considered Thursday
night by the House:
</P>
<P>
   _ Companies that engage in any activities that are ``financial
in nature'' would be able to affiliate under a holding company.
Insurance underwriters and real estate developers would not be
permitted to be in subsidiaries of the conglomerates but would have
to operate as affiliates. By structuring such companies in this
way, both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department would
have important roles in regulating conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restrictions would continue to limit industrial companies from
owning banks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The legislation authorizes the establishment of a new banking
institution, the wholesale financial institution, that has the
powers of a national bank but could only accept deposits of more
than $100,000 and would not be federally insured.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new federal crime would be created that outlaws the practice
of using trickery and pretending to be a customer to obtain
confidential bank information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banks would be required to post surcharges on their automated
teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the chief author of the Senate version
of the legislation, said the House action significantly increased
the odds that the House and Senate would be able to reconcile their
differences and produce a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the House vote, we now have it within our grasp to pass a
good bill, and that's my objective,'' said Gramm, . ``We face some
very high hurdles, and negotiations will require a tremendous
effort. But I am ready to take the time and do the hard work with
this goal in mind: The bill must benefit consumers by making the
broadest array of financial services available at the lowest
possible price.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, the House measure had not faced any of the
partisan bickering that pervaded the Senate legislation. The House
bill was co-sponsored by leading Republicans and Democrats and it
was largely embraced by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin after the
House rejected a proposal by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, that would have the effect of taking regulatory
authority away from the Treasury and giving it to the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's debate was steeped in bitter partisan wrangling
after House Republicans stripped the measure of a provision that
would have prohibited insurance companies affiliated with banks
from discriminating against poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, known as redlining, is already against the law for
banks. A provision pre-empting state insurance laws and extending
the prohibition to the insurance industry was passed earlier this
year by the House Banking Committee by a single vote. It was
sponsored by Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican leadership decided late Wednesday evening
to remove the Lee Amendment and not allow further consideration of
it by the full House, Democrats who had supported the legislation
defected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a good job in fostering conditions in which our
capitalist system can flourish and it's in our interest that our
capitalist system flourish,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass..
``But can we try to do a little bit for those who are being left
behind. This is an inappropriate continuation of a pattern of
helping those who need a benefit but ignoring those who are left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats also complained that the legislation did not go
far enough in protecting the privacy interests of bank customers
and medical patients. And in one of his final acts in office, Rubin
criticized an amendment to the Bank Secrecy Act proposed by Rep.
Bob Barr, R-Ga., that would eliminate the requirements that banks
report suspicious money transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are now required to report all transactions of more than
$10,000 to the federal government as part of the secrecy act, which
is intended to discourage tax evasion and money laundering. The
amendment criticized by Rubin would raise that amount to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The House ultimately defeated the Barr amendment.

GM WEIGHS BUILDING NEW LINE OF CARS AT PLANT IN KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. said Thursday it probably would build the
platform components for a still-secret next generation of compact
and midsize cars at the company's Fairfax plant in Kansas City,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal comes about, the plant would turn out chassis, drive
train and engine components as part of a project that has a code
name of Epsilon.
</P>
<P>
   GM's Pontiac Grand Prix assembly would be moved to a Canadian
plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Oldsmobile Intrigue assembly line at Fairfax would remain
for the time being and even could overlap production for the new
Epsilon line. The Epsilon platform could carry Chevrolet, Pontiac
or other GM body styles.
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Kyle Johnson declined to answer questions about
project costs or employment needs for a retooled plant. Workers at
Fairfax, which employs about 3,500 people, were advised of the
possible change at noon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There (are) a lot of things that have to happen'' before GM
will declare that the change absolutely is coming, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors include a new labor agreement with local Auto
Workers and negotiation of infrastructure and tax incentive deals
with state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Russell, president of United Auto Workers Local 31, said he
thought GM's move would ensure the long-term viability of the
Fairfax plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a car GM plans to market worldwide, and we've been
chosen to build it,'' Russell said. ``I feel like it's going to
give job security to our people, particularly the younger
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Russell said there was some work force anxiety about
the departure of the Grand Prix, which has been a popular Pontiac
model in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some concern, because the Grand Prix has given us job
security since 1994,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Denney, spokesman for the Unified Government of Wyandotte
County and Kansas City, Kan., said news of GM's plans came
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Denney said, the company had made no proposals to
Unified Government officials regarding tax breaks, development
incentives or public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're that far down the road yet,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But requests for various forms of taxpayer assistance certainly
will come later, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time economic incentives have been
traded for GM jobs at Fairfax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, city officials agreed essentially to waive GM's
property taxes for 10 years when the auto industry giant agreed to
build a state-of-the-art, $1 billion assembly plant on the grounds
of an abandoned, city-owned airport.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the area's poorest municipality granted the
nation's largest corporation tax breaks worth an estimated $270
million. The vast majority of the plant's workers live outside
Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax plant has since returned to the tax rolls, and GM
now pays about $10.1 million a year in real estate and personal
property taxes _ making it the municipality's largest taxpayer,
Denney said. The taxes paid by the plant allowed for both a tax cut
in the community with the area's highest property taxes and a
spending increase for public services.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a retooling at the plant appears likely to spark
a renegotiated deal between GM and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion to Epsilon production at Fairfax ``is contingent
upon a sound business case and appropriate agreements with
stakeholders, including with governmental bodies on infrastructure
and tax arrangements,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have a competitive local labor agreement that
benefits both sides,'' he said. ``We've got to put the whole
package together.''
</P>
<P>
   GM is keeping details of its Epsilon platform top secret. It is
being developed as the undercarriage for a new generation of
compact and midsize cars that will be sold internationally, Johnson
said.

   Platform components are often interchangeable among GM
companies. Such a production scheme saves money, simplifies the
manufacturing process and smooths deliveries from suppliers. One
such platform today, for instance, is the engineering foundation
for both the Pontiac Sunfire and the Chevrolet Cavalier.

TIDE OF EMOTION FUELS RUDD'S RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ Ricky Rudd valiantly tried to mask his
bitterness at losing the sponsor he'd had for almost 10 years, the
sponsor that wasn't as loyal to him as he was to it, the sponsor
lured away by a carpetbagger from CART.
</P>
<P>
   After saying most of the right things, Rudd finally let his true
feelings slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fighter,'' he said. ``It just makes me mad and I want to
come back and stick it in their face and say, `Hey, you made a
mistake.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd almost did that last night, putting his No. 10 Ford Taurus
on the outside pole for \Rtomorrow's\S Pepsi 400 during qualifying
at Daytona International Speedway last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Front Row'' Joe Nemechek won the pole position with a fast lap
at 194.860 mph in the No. 42 BellSouth Chevrolet Monte Carlo,
slightly faster than Rudd's best circuit at 194.574.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had about as perfect a lap as I could drive,'' Nemechek
said. ``That was all I could do to keep the car from going sideways
and keep it headed as straight as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first pole since 1997 for Nemechek, who has fallen on
hard times since finishing fourth in the Texas 500 at Texas Motor
Speedway two years ago. He hasn't finished in the top five since
then. He enters tomorrow night's race 37th in the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had high expectations coming into 1999,'' Nemechek said.
``We've had some really good race cars. Where we are in the points
definitely doesn't show what kind of team we have. We've been
involved in about seven accidents, and had a lot of crazy things
happen. To get the pole is definitely special.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as special, though, as getting on the outside of the front
row in the No. 10 Tide Ford was for Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudd'' and ``Tide'' go together in stock-car racing circles
like ``Mark McGwire'' and ``home run,'' ``Juan Gonzalez'' and
``RBI'' or ``Randy Johnson'' and ``strikeout.'' The driver and the
sponsor have been paired since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This, though, is the last year for that association.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd found out Tuesday that Procter &AMP; Gamble, the parent company
for the laundry detergent, isn't renewing the contract, even though
he has won at least one race every season of the deal until this
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't quite understand it,'' he said. ``We haven't
been competitive this year like we need to be, but we've been able
to win a race every year since we've had the association.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd is 38th in the points standings and hasn't recorded a
top-10 finish, but there's more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Rudd wanted more money. He is in the last year of a
three-year deal that left him underfunded because he didn't
anticipate the escalating costs of racing.
</P>
<P>
   But that, he said, isn't the biggest reason. Tide is leaving the
long-time stock-car driver and going to NASCAR-come-lately Cal
Wells, a CART owner who plans to run a Winston Cup team next year.
</P>
<P>
   To Rudd, Tide's departure continues a disturbing trend of
newcomers luring major sponsors away from established teams and
drivers that built the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably guilty of working too many hours and worrying way
too much about this race team instead of going up to Cincinnati
with a fancy briefcase and a nice powerpoint presentation,'' said
Rudd, one of a dying breed of owner/drivers.
</P>
<P>
   That hard work paid off in a solid qualifying effort last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am not that low,'' Rudd said. ``This sport is full of
highs and lows. You just learn to deal with them and move on. I
know no way of dealing with it other than getting mad and running
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd also qualified well earlier this season. He was on the pole
for the second race at Rockingham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   To truly be able to tell Tide it made a mistake, he needs to
race well, also. That would also help in finding a replacement
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good run here \Rtomorrow\S wouldn't hurt anything,'' he
said.

N.Y. COMPANY EYES SITE NEAR PLANNED KANSAS SPEEDWAY FOR DOMED WATER
PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New York company is considering building a glass-domed
water-recreation theme park near the international motor speedway
under construction in western Wyandotte County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, about 8,000 households within a 21/2-hour drive
of Kansas City have received a four-minute videotape about the
Aquadrome park and a marketing questionnaire from Aquatic
Development Group Inc. in suburban Cohoes, N.Y., near Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the video _ filmed at comparable company-affiliated
parks in Europe _ an Aquadrome appears to be a smaller version of
Oceans of Fun, complete with wave pools, water slides, hot tubs and
other features, all under glass.
</P>
<P>
   The typical size for such indoor water parks is about 100,000
square feet, a company official said. The official said it was too
early to estimate development costs.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of such competition doesn't daunt Rick Rau,
director of marketing at Oceans of Fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oceans of Fun is 60 acres,'' Rau said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller water parks ``are really community-centered
attractions,'' he said. ``They serve a purpose. We think of Oceans
of Fun as a mainstream attraction ... a tourism destination.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no downturn in business whenever a local water
park has opened in the region, Rau said. A water-recreation park in
Olathe, Kan., a Kansas City suburb, was open in the early 1990s
before closing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Aquatic Development representatives in recent weeks have met
with Unified Government leaders in Wyandotte County about
purchasing part of a publicly owned 400-acre tract just north of
the auto racetrack site near the Interstate 70 and Interstate 435
interchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything we can to make it become a reality,''
said Don Denney, a spokesman for the Unified Government of Kansas
City, Kan., and Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   J. Gregory Crozier, vice president for marketing and
architectural design for Aquatic Development, said Thursday that
other sites near the track also were under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In its marketing letter, the company pledges that the project
``will not be financed with tax revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City, Kan., Aquadrome is far from a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Crozier said the company was engaged in similar talks with
several other cities, hoping to import and adapt the popular
European water attraction to American tastes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, there's nothing like an Aquadrome anywhere in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (marketing survey) is just the first stage of analysis,''
Crozier said. The company hopes to decide by the end of summer
whether the project is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Aquatic Development Group successfully emerged
from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the company completed design and construction
work on Hurricane Harbor, an outdoor water theme park at Six Flags
St. Louis that opened May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags spokeswoman Elizabeth Gotway said Thursday that
Aquatic Development did a splendid job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just gorgeous,'' she said of the 12-acre attraction.
Gotway said Aquatic Development had done other projects for the Six
Flags theme park group.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, Kan., officials are enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indicative of the types of developers that have
contacted us about the racetrack area,'' Denney said.
</P>
<P>
   Denney would not disclose other potential developers but said
the Unified Government was fielding numerous inquiries from hotel
and motel companies, restaurants and others interested in projects
to complement the speedway, which is expected to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Aquatic Development's promotional videotape is generic for any
market and touts an ``all-weather paradise ... a water playground
... near your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Crozier said spacious and inviting domed indoor water parks in
Belgium, Holland and Germany were used in the video. Those
facilities feature plenty of greenery and open spaces for
sunbathing.
</P>
<P>
   In its written material, Aquatic Development mentions its
proposed proximity to the International Speedway Corp. track. But
speedway officials said they had not been contacted by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds cool,'' said Gillian Zucker, director of business
development for Kansas Speedway Corp., the parent company's Kansas
subsidiary. ``But anything that they have said that includes our
name is without our permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said none of the 1,250 acres owned by her firm was
available for development by outside firms.
</P>
<P>
   Information that accompanies the video suggests that the water
park's daily admission would be $20 for adults and $15 for
children. Annual memberships also would be available.
</P>
<P>
   The Aquadrome would be only the second public swimming facility
in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   City officials Thursday announced that next week three high
school swimming pools would be opened for public use through Aug.
13 for a $1 entrance fee.
</P>
<P>
   A long-discussed plan to develop a swimming beach at Wyandotte
Lake was voted down by the Unified Government last month.

MODERN PROSTHESES MEAN FREEDOM FOR VICTIM OF CHERNOBYL DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a struggle for 9-year-old Tonya Khvitko to walk two years
ago when she first visited Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Now she enjoys running and riding bikes, thanks to more than
$12,000 worth of prostheses from Project Restoration, a nonprofit
group started by Laurann Schlapper of Merriam.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya, of Belarus, was born with one leg that ended at the ankle
and one that stopped above the knee, possibly the result of
radiation from the Chernobyl power plant disaster in 1986. She also
is missing fingers on each hand.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Tonya wore leather prostheses with wooden
feet. The one on her shorter leg had a heavy, metal knee. The
prosthesis often fell off, making it difficult to walk more than a
short distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not independent before,'' Doyle Collier, a prosthetist
for Rehab Designs of America, said Tuesday. ``She had to have help
on stairs and uneven ground. She had to be carried at the zoo
because she grew too tired. Now she wouldn't let you help her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonya's prostheses look more human than the more primitive ones
she wore before, and they allow her knees to bend and put a spring
in her step. Collier will have to replace straps and the feet in
both prostheses because they're worn and she has grown.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Tonya ran around the Rehab Designs examination room
in Overland Park and climbed on wooden bars. She smiled, sang songs
and tried to entertain those around her.
</P>
<P>
   Schlapper said the change was unbelievable: Tonya used to cower
in front of other people and felt bitter that she wasn't able to do
things that other children could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled by what has happened in her life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlapper created Project Restoration five years ago. For the
last three summers the project has brought children from Belarus to
the Kansas City area, where dentists and medical professionals have
donated their services. The organization also has received money
from individuals, churches and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip with a Christian organization in 1991, Schlapper
visited Belarus, a country the size of Kansas. Belarus bore the
brunt of the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station disaster in nearby
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that Chernobyl's aftermath is worse than Hiroshima's
and that the widespread contamination has resulted in millions of
physical deformities and ailments. Nearly 800,000 children live in
the highest-contaminated areas of Belarus, and the continuing
low-level exposure puts children at risk for thyroid disease and
gastrointestinal, circulatory, neurological and immune system
problems, Schlapper said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three weeks, 18 children age 5 to 17 will receive
medical attention in the Kansas City area, up from 12 children last
year and five two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya still must visit the dentist and receive the new parts for
her prostheses. She's staying with Kathy Ingram of Lenexa, who has
watched Tonya swim without her prostheses or any
self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's pretty spunky,'' Ingram said.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreter Galina Denisova said Tonya had made a breakthrough:
She has worn shorts while she's been in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears pants in (Belarus), although it's very hot,''
Denisova said. ``She said that people laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Those around Tonya say she has turned from being a frustrated
child into a girl who is forming goals about her future.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says she wants to be a doctor and help others like her,''
Schlapper said.

TWO GIRLS ARE HELD AFTER WOMAN IS BEATEN TO DEATH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating throughout to say victim died)   (sw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A 25-year-old woman died on Thursday night after a
severe beating by two teen-age girls who the police said assaulted
her when she complained that their car was blocking a street.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Natalie Giles Davis, died after two days in a coma at
a Northern Virginia hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Prince William County, where the incident
occurred in a generally quiet, middle-class neighborhood of
Woodbridge, said it was unusual for girls to commit so brutal a
crime, although the county police said violence by teen-age girls
and young women was on the rise throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever had anything like this with girls
involved,'' said Sgt. Kim Chinn, a spokeswoman for the Prince
William County Police Department. ``But we have noticed in the last
several years that more young girls are becoming involved in crime,
and more in violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ebert, the commonwealth attorney for Prince William County,
said in an interview that the girls had administered ``an unusually
brutal beating with little justification.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls, Teresa Hattie Dixon, 18, and a 16-year-old girl whose
name was not released because of her age, were arrested shortly
after the beating and are being held without bond. They were
initially charged with aggravated malicious wounding, but
authorities said they would elevate the charges to murder if the
victim died.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the incident began shortly after a car in which
Mrs. Davis was riding with her two young children and two other
young cousins left the Davis house to attend a church service.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Davis's car drove around a stopped vehicle, heated words
were exchanged between her and the two girls, who were on the
sidewalk with three friends, Sergeant Chinn said. Mrs. Davis drove
on, and the five girls jumped into the stopped car and caught up
with her, pulling in front to force the car to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Davis and the 16-year-old girl left their cars and got into
a fight, which Ms. Dixon joined, the police said. Mrs. Davis' head
was pounded against the sidewalk, the police said, and was also
kicked.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert said he intended to ask the court to try the younger girl
as an adult.

UNITED NATION OF ISLAM CELEBRATING ITS SUCCESS WITH A FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE NICELY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skepticism from northeast Kansas City, Kan., area residents
abounded three years ago when the United Nation of Islam began
refurbishing and opening businesses along Quindaro Boulevard in
Kansas City, Kan., the heart of the city's high-crime area.
</P>
<P>
   But since that inauspicious start with Your Diner, at least
eight other businesses have followed.
</P>
<P>
   They include Your Supermarket and Bakery, Your Service Station
and Your Variety Store. The newest shop, Sweets to Eat, a
whole-wheat pastry and low-fat ice cream shop, is opening next to
the diner this weekend _ in conjunction with the United Nation of
Islam's first annual Independence Day Unity Festival to celebrate
the organization's success in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are expecting about 1,000 people to attend the
festival, which begins today and concludes Sunday evening with an
address by Solomon, the organization's founder and spiritual
leader. He is coming in from the organization's national
headquarters in Temple Hills, Md., outside Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the United Nation of Islam regard Solomon, a former
dock worker and auto mechanic, as Allah, the Supreme Being.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the organization say their long-term goal is to give
_ not sell _ their business operations to private operators and
replicate the Kansas City, Kan., model in other cities, including
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the business expansion and lofty goals, United Nation of
Islam officials acknowledge that community skepticism of the
organization's motives persists. James 2X, United Nation of Islam
national secretary, said that is evident in the lack of a strong
customer base for the diner, supermarket and other sect-operated
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hudgins, who lives near Quindaro, characterized community
skepticism by saying: ``People are always suspicious when change is
occurring. Especially when something is going good, people think,
`Let's wait and see when the bottom drops out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hudgins takes delight in the convenience of a
sit-down restaurant and the luxury of fresh fruit in the
neighborhood for the first time in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Others take a bottom-line view of the new entrepreneurial
activity along Quindaro. LaVert Murray, development director of the
Wyandotte County Unified Government, praised the group's
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly happy to see the activity they're involved
in,'' Murray said. ``We can use all of the help we can get because
the blight and disinvestment has been in place so long.''
</P>
<P>
   James 2X said the main reason for public skepticism is that many
people confuse the United Nation of Islam with Louis Farrakhan's
Chicago-based Nation of Islam or other mainstream Muslim faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is not to come in espousing a religion,'' he said.
``We do not espouse the religion of Islam....There is no hidden
agenda. We do not proselytize....We are about doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But 2X, who lives in Kansas City, Kan., does not hesitate to say
the sect emphasizes ``doing right'' and embracing a healthful,
civilized way of life. For adherents, doing right means, among
other things, shunning alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs; eating
health foods and substituting fructose for sugar, fish for red meat
and organic vegetables for processed and chemically treated foods;
smiling courteously and acting and speaking respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Organization leaders try to inculcate those traits and habits in
young people early on.
</P>
<P>
   The organization currently operates a private school that about
100 children attend at two locations, including the group's local
headquarters at a former tire store at 12th Street and Minnesota
Avenue. Early next year, the organization plans to open a private,
year-round elementary school and training center _ the University
of Islam _ in the former Roosevelt Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City, Kan., School District donated the building at
North 36th Street and Washington Avenue for $1.
</P>
<P>
   The events begin today with a tour of Roosevelt Elementary
School at 6 p.m. and a ``mathematical thinking'' class at the
school from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The main events take place Saturday, when three blocks east of
Quindaro east of 18th Street will be blocked off. From noon to 7
p.m., the street will be filled with displays, booths, music, food,
ethnic dancing and other attractions. A talent search will take
place from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at Sumner Academy of Arts and Science.
</P>
<P>
   A buffet will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday at 1726
Quindaro. Solomon is scheduled to speak at 6 p.m. at the buffet
site.

TALKS BETWEEN KC SCHOOL BOARD, SUPERINTENDENT CANDIDATE BREAK OFF

<P>
   Negotiations between school superintendent finalist Jay T.
Edwards and the Kansas City Board of Education abruptly ended
Thursday night after he and board members were unable to reach
agreement on a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Board members spent about an hour behind closed doors Thursday
evening, exchanging offers via an attorney with Edwards, who was
elsewhere in the Board of Education building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped, of course, that we were making the right
selection,'' board President John Rios said. ``The general had
great skills. We just couldn't agree on the contract. It was the
consensus of the board that we need to reopen the search, and the
general understood. It was a mutual parting, and I just wish him
well. He was a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a retired Air Force major general, immediately checked
out of his hotel and headed to Kansas City International Airport to
catch a flight back to Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My counter-counteroffer was not accepted, and we both
recognized by that point that we were at a stalemate,'' Edwards
said as he waited to board his flight. ``I think if we had more
time, we could have come to an agreement. It was an agreeable,
affable, friendly parting.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and the board disagreed over the length of the contract.
But the key stumbling block was the financial package, Edwards
said. He said the incentives the board had offered him were too
vague.
</P>
<P>
   The board originally offered Edwards a salary of $125,000.
Edwards asked for $200,000. Board members countered with an offer
of $140,000 in base salary plus $34,000 if he met certain
performance incentives. With benefits, the total compensation
package offered by the district equaled close to the amount paid to
former Superintendent Henry Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' final request was for $164,000 in base pay, plus about
$10,000 more in possible incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards praised the district's teachers, students, facilities
and parents. And he would not criticize the school board or the
process that led to his withdrawal, saying, ``They did the best
they could under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he had any advice for the next candidate,
Edwards shook his head, laughed and said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's regret on both sides,'' he concluded. ``If we
could have worked out the numbers, I could have worked with the
board and with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said he would continue in his post as general
administrator of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, a court-appointed monitoring committee denied
a request by the board to delay past a deadline today for
completion of negotiations with Edwards. The Desegregation
Monitoring Committee instead recommended the board turn to three
other finalists recommended for the post if the board was unable to
reach accord with Edwards. The monitoring committee set a new
deadline of July 9 for the board to name a new superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Rios said the district contacted the other three finalists to
see whether they were still interested in the Kansas City job. He
said the board could meet through the holiday weekend to try to
identify its next choice.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one of the other three finalists, Grandview School
District Superintendent John Martin, said he no longer wanted the
Kansas City job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, I'm simply not interested, not at
this point,'' Martin said. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   A second finalist, Pascal Forgione Jr., former U.S. education
commissioner for statistics, said he still would consider the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've kind of thrown me,'' Forgione said when reached at his
Washington home. ``I guess I've got to think some. I definitely
would think about it. I'm impressed with the community and the
commitment to quality education that they want, so I have to give
it thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The third finalist, Benjamin Demps Jr., former Oklahoma
Department of Human Services director, could not be reached
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Board members and the Desegregation Monitoring Committee want
the new superintendent to receive an incentive-based contract
because it would coincide with their efforts to hold employees
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to come to the Kansas City School District and
accept this position, you better be willing to work on commission,
at least for part of the salary,'' board member Lance Loewenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members opposed Edwards' request for a three-year
contract. They expressed concern about having to buy out a
long-term deal if their relationship with Edwards soured.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they offered a one-year deal that could be renewed
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Rios also said some board members were concerned by the
reception Edwards received from some community groups he visited
during a daylong tour of the district on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards met early Thursday with several ministers and leaders in
the African-American community. He later met with community
members, including Hispanic parents and activists, at Westport
Middle School. He finished his tour with a similar meeting in
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things didn't work out as we hoped,'' Rios said. ``We hoped
there would be a bonding there, and I guess it was hit and miss in
his travels today.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was to appear at a 7 p.m. forum at Central High School
but was on his way out of town by that time.
</P>
<P>
   Many community members in the packed auditorium used the forum
to express their dissatisfaction with the process that led to
Edwards' selection. Several complained that the process was being
controlled by U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple and that the
community was left out. As the judge overseeing the federal
desegregation case, Whipple has wide-ranging authority over the
district, including the selection of the next superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When do we get to a point where we say our kids are not going
to a school run by Whipple (or) a monitoring committee?'' asked
community activist Ron McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple has ordered school board members to keep the names and
backgrounds of candidates confidential to avoid political
interference.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan and others asked board member Terry Riley how community
members could be more empowered, and Riley advised the community to
unite and sue the court.
</P>
<P>
   Rios said ultimately it was the breakdown over the contract and
not community concerns that led the board to end discussions with
Edwards. Rios said he expected the next candidate to hold similar
meetings with community groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to square one,'' Rios said.

 151st STREET BRIDGE IN OLATHE NEEDS EXTENSIVE REPAIRS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little over four years ago, politicians and business leaders
climbed aboard school buses and crossed the 151st Street bridge in
Olathe, Kan., marking the opening of an economic gateway into
southern Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   Now highway officials say the $3.9 million bridge needs $3
million in repairs. Abutments that support the ends of the bridge
have shifted, causing extensive damage and raising concerns about
the structure's ability to withstand normal stresses.
</P>
<P>
   But they will delay repairs until next year, partly to avoid
subjecting holiday shoppers to a maze of detours and traffic
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The interchange connects 151st Street, Interstate 35 and U.S.
169, a major economic corridor on the county's south side that is
used by many who go to the Great Mall of the Great Plains and to
the Olathe Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   State officials ``could not be sure that they would have the
repairs completed before Thanksgiving once they got it designed and
built,'' said Rick Biery, city engineer for Olathe. ``They decided
it would be better to wait until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it will be somewhat of an inconvenience, people will be
able to get where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim McKee, Olathe's director of economic development, said
Olathe has an economic incentive to keep the bridge open past the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big portion of the city's budget is created from sales
taxes,'' he said. ``The mall is a large contributing factor to that
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the closing could affect more than 1,500 businesses within
a three-mile radius of the bridge, McKee said.
</P>
<P>
   If the repairs were started this year, the bridge work might not
get done before winter, causing a longer closing. If repair work
starts next year, it should take about four months.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation officials say the delay won't compromise public
safety. Sensors and survey crews will monitor the structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we see there is a safety problem, we will shut it
down right away,'' said Ruben Noguera, field engineering
administrator for the Kansas Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department is trying to figure out what is
causing the bridge, which opened in November 1994, to move. An
Olathe official said preliminary indications are that erosion has
eaten away at the abutments, and it has started to settle.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge's eastern abutment had dropped 2.5 inches and moved
3.75 inches to the west, and the western abutment had moved 1.5
inches to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Department officials hoped the abutments had
stopped moving, but Noguera said recent rains, including this
week's heavy downpour, had caused them to move again.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are concerned that the bridge, which is built on
rockers to allow for expansion and contraction, might not be able
handle normal stresses if the abutments continue to move.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks have appeared on the abutments. Also, the concrete
covering of the slope leading to the western bridge abutment has
fallen apart in places, exposing the soil and parts of the bridge's
pilings that should be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Crews made temporary fixes last week by inserting wood supports
near the rockers to help bear the weight of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, crews will fix the concrete covering on the western slope
of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Department officials met Wednesday with Olathe
officials and bridge designers and decided to close the bridge next
year to rebuild the abutments.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Department officials estimate that more than
6,000 vehicles use the bridge daily, but that number climbs during
the holiday season as shoppers flock to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   John Myers, assistant professor of civil engineering at the
University of Missouri-Rolla, said settling of a bridge is not
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most settlement occurs very quickly after the initial
construction,'' said Myers, who has not seen the damage but agreed
to be interviewed about bridges in general. ``So it does happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the amount of movement the 151st Street bridge has
undergone is significant.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge's problem is a major disappointment for the
Transportation Department because a bridge's lifespan is supposed
to be 40 to 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Noguera said the Transportation Department never had a bridge
with settlement problems of this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been really frustrating,'' Noguera said. ``It is a
really good-looking bridge. It really is a beautiful bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Biery said it is uncertain who would have to pay for the
repairs. The city is negotiating with the Transportation
Department. The Transportation Department is trying to determine if
the bridge designer and contractor should be held liable for any of
the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, we just don't know,'' Noguera said.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said emergency services should face only minor
inconveniences and delays.
</P>
<P>
   McKee said traffic will be detoured to the U.S. 169//Kansas 7
bridge under the 151st Street bridge, so an east//west connection
in that area will be available.
</P>
<P>
   Olathe Medical Center expects the repairs to have little effect
on its patients, said Lesle Knop, corporate director of marketing
and wellness for the Olathe Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Art Mabry, Olathe's chief of police, said emergency services
should not be hampered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they don't mess with any of the other roads with
any other major construction, all that I see it causing is some
minor delays,'' Mabry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it will be a show stopper.''

US WEST TO TALK WITH QUEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of US West, the smallest regional Bell company, has
agreed to allow management and its advisers to enter into
preliminary merger talks with Qwest Communications International
Inc., the company said on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The move was an important development for Qwest, the
fourth-largest long-distance telephone company, which is trying to
buy not only US West but the Frontier Corp. Those two companies
have already agreed to be acquired by Global Crossing Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, the telecommunications upstart based in
Bermuda, has given US West its consent to have discussions with
Qwest. Thus, US West does not need to declare that Qwest's offer is
``superior'' as required by its existing agreement with Global
Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   US West agreed in May to merge with Global, which offered $30
billion in stock. Frontier, the fifth-largest long-distance
carrier, also agreed to be acquired by Global Crossing in a stock
swap valued at $11.1 billion. Frontier said on Wednesday that its
management and advisers would begin exploratory discussions with
Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's first bid on June 13 _ a combination of cash and stock _
did little to inspire US West and Frontier, so Qwest revised its
bid last week.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing is offering Frontier shareholders $63 a share in
Global stock and US West stockholders about $60 a share in stock.
Qwest is offering Frontier shareholders $68 in stock and cash and
US West shareholders $69 in stock or cash. But there are several
issues both boards will have to consider besides price, including
regulatory risks, the deal's structure and its strategic
rationale. &QL;

BOARD PRIMED TO HALT BELMONT WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shortly after being sworn in to office, the new
reform-minded Los Angeles school board has agreed to hold an
emergency meeting Tuesday at which it is expected to order
construction on the Belmont Learning Center halted temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of board members said on Thursday they were prepared
to vote to halt construction on the $200 million school -- the
nation's costliest -- and decide whether to abandon the project
within a month because of growing evidence of the seriousness of
toxic soil contamination and the cost of mitigation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, administrators were directed to offer the board
legal options that could include suing the lead contractor, Kajima
Urban Development, and others involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't put another dime into Belmont until we know what
we're going to do,'' said Genethia Hayes, who was elected board
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Belmont is a top, top priority for the new
school board. We can't keep throwing money into that project. I
expect the board to make a final decision within the next 30
days.''
</P>
<P>
   A continuing Daily News investigation disclosed last week that
internal documents showed Kajima repeatedly used incomplete
environmental data to assure the Fire Department that no hazardous
levels of methane existed around the site of school buildings.
Comprehensive environmental tests later determined that the
explosive gas, seeping from an old oil field, pervades the entire
site.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes and fellow new San Fernando Valley board member Caprice
Young said they will support earlier efforts by David Tokofsky and
Julie Korenstein to stop construction on the partially-built school
until the district determines whether there is an economically
feasible way to finish the school and make it safe for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for the construction to keep going on,''
said Young. ``If we decide it is not cost-effective or safe to put
children at that school, there will be less to tear down.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Valerie Fields and newcomer Michael Lansing have
expressed serious reservations about going forward.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Castro, once Belmont's most adamant supporter, told the
Daily News last week that she believes district administrators
misled her about the severity of methane problems and other
environmental contamination at the 35-acre site and said she was
considering abandoning the project.
</P>
<P>
   The three new board members and Tokofsky were all backed by a
well-funded campaign organized by Mayor Richard Riordan. They
ousted Jeff Horton, George Kiriyama and Barbara Boudreaux.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the retail and school complex had been completed
before the state Department of Toxic Substances Control determined
late last year that previous environmental assessments of the site
failed to adequately characterize toxic and methane contamination.
</P>
<P>
   While construction was partially halted in February, work has
continued on portions of the complex where foundations for
buildings already were poured.
</P>
<P>
   A School Safety Team, created with staffers and outside
consultants to cope with the growing crisis, warned last week
against finishing the school unless a ``failsafe'' methane
mitigation system could be installed and maintained ``without human
error'' for the 30- to 50-year lifespan of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The safety team has forwarded test results from 900 new soil,
vapor and groundwater tests to the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control, and plans to conduct additional tests until the
end of the year. The cost of mitigation was estimated at close to
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky said allowing construction to continue while the
district's internal audit department investigates environmental
problems and alleged criminal actions surrounding Belmont is
comparable to ``trying to catch a runaway train.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, being conducted by LAUSD chief of special
investigations Don Mullinax and closely reviewed by the District
Attorney's Office, received support Thursday from the state Senate,
which voted 37-1 to approve a bill by Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los
Angeles, to grant subpoena power to Mullinax.
</P>
<P>
   Civil legal issues also were raised byTokofsky, who said he has
asked Superintendent Ruben Zacarias to give the board ``a list of
legal and financial options for the future of Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   The list will include the possibility of suing Kajima, as well
as several environmental and legal consultants who told the
district to proceed with the project, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zacarias, the board will receive a list of options,
compiled by general counsel Richard Mason, by next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said if anyone expects the board to back down from a legal
fight over Belmont, they are mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``If legal action is necessary, we will move forward
expediently,'' Hayes said. ``If people are legally culpable for
this, they need to be held accountable and need to know they can't
do this with taxpayers' money.''

<P>
   One year before completing their home in Ross, Calif., Mary and
Bill Poland began scouting for a Valley oak, a picture-perfect
wide-branched tree that would exactly match the one depicted by
their architect in his sketch of their new home.
</P>
<P>
   After searching up and down the state, Mary eventually found one
_ a 30-foot, 50-year-old beauty for $12,500 _ at a nearby nursery.
</P>
<P>
   She reserved it, waited for her house to be finished, and then
had it brought over by truck and planted by her driveway, where it
offers shade for her house and takes the newness off her property.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell when the home was built. It has an old-world
look,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   Trophy trees: The trend was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   As people look to recreate the grand houses of the past (the
Polands' is 8,000 square feet, in the French Mediterranean style),
they want the trees around them to be just as lofty.
</P>
<P>
   Says Barry W. Starke, president of the American Society of
Landscape Architects, ``Older trees, the really large ones, used to
be bought by older folks, who didn't have the time to watch a tree
come into its glory. But now it seems the younger people with money
don't want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, trophy trees are American classics such as
maples, oaks, and beeches; most are found on farms and older
estates about to be subdivided or in large nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   A lush, ample copper beech, valued for its leaf color and
beautiful bark, can cost $25,000. A 60-year-old disectum Japanese
maple _ typically slow growing and prized for its delicate, lacy
leaves _ can command over $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Verderosa, a landscaper in East Hampton, Long
Island, trees and shrubs go through fashions, much like houses.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent hemlocks were popular a few years ago in the Long
Island/Connecticut region; now he says, the demand is for topiaries
at least 60 years old and big hydrangeas, preferably 50-plus (their
prices range from $20,000 to $30,000).
</P>
<P>
   Dallas landscape architect Caye Cook says that live oaks, cedar
elms, magnolias, and American sweet-gum trees are now status
symbols par excellence in residential neighborhoods and commercial
parks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Many new homeowners are surprised by the lead time trophy trees
require.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the tree's extensive root system must be pruned in
stages, a process that can last roughly a year and a half or the
time it can take for the architect to secure the proper permits
from highway authorities; sometimes traffic lights have to come
down.
</P>
<P>
   And the home's value? Says Jo Bishop, a Kentucky-based realtor
who specializes in affluent communities, ``Trophy trees can easily
add 20 percent to a home's value, especially on smaller
properties.'' &QL;

   One year before completing their home in Ross, Calif., Mary and
Bill Poland began scouting for a Valley oak, a picture-perfect
wide-branched tree that would exactly match the one depicted by
their architect in his sketch of their new home.
</P>
<P>
   After searching up and down the state, Mary eventually found one
_ a 30-foot, 50-year-old beauty for $12,500 _ at a nearby nursery.
</P>
<P>
   She reserved it, waited for her house to be finished, and then
had it brought over by truck and planted by her driveway, where it
offers shade for her house and takes the newness off her property.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell when the home was built. It has an old-world
look,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   Trophy trees: The trend was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   As people look to recreate the grand houses of the past (the
Polands' is 8,000 square feet, in the French Mediterranean style),
they want the trees around them to be just as lofty.
</P>
<P>
   Says Barry W. Starke, president of the American Society of
Landscape Architects, ``Older trees, the really large ones, used to
be bought by older folks, who didn't have the time to watch a tree
come into its glory. But now it seems the younger people with money
don't want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, trophy trees are American classics such as
maples, oaks, and beeches; most are found on farms and older
estates about to be subdivided or in large nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   A lush, ample copper beech, valued for its leaf color and
beautiful bark, can cost $25,000. A 60-year-old disectum Japanese
maple _ typically slow growing and prized for its delicate, lacy
leaves _ can command over $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Verderosa, a landscaper in East Hampton, Long
Island, trees and shrubs go through fashions, much like houses.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent hemlocks were popular a few years ago in the Long
Island/Connecticut region; now he says, the demand is for topiaries
at least 60 years old and big hydrangeas, preferably 50-plus (their
prices range from $20,000 to $30,000).
</P>
<P>
   Dallas landscape architect Caye Cook says that live oaks, cedar
elms, magnolias, and American sweet-gum trees are now status
symbols par excellence in residential neighborhoods and commercial
parks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Many new homeowners are surprised by the lead time trophy trees
require.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the tree's extensive root system must be pruned in
stages, a process that can last roughly a year and a half or the
time it can take for the architect to secure the proper permits
from highway authorities; sometimes traffic lights have to come
down.
</P>
<P>
   And the home's value? Says Jo Bishop, a Kentucky-based realtor
who specializes in affluent communities, ``Trophy trees can easily
add 20 percent to a home's value, especially on smaller
properties.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy. The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us
down. Same for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian
currency collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S.
consumers and to many U.S. corporations. Thanks to devalued Asian
currencies, we've been getting TVs, microwave ovens, and computer
chips at bargain prices, so our consumer price index has stayed
amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and wider profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms.)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing market propels furniture,
refrigerator, and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-business sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 till now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

POWER STILL OUT ON M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It turned on a bloop and a plunk, and it could
have used a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners came that close to beating the Oakland Athletics
Thursday and heading happily to Texas for three crucial games this
weekend. Instead, they will meet the division-leading Rangers
trailing by six games, thanks to a 5-4 loss to the A's before
11,632 fans in the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lost for the second game in a row to the A's, the
plucky, low-budget team Seattle can't shake in this American League
West race. After blowing out the Mariners Wednesday, Oakland won in
the ninth inning Thursday, when Tony Phillips' one-out single off
Jose Paniagua (5-7) brought home pinch runner A.J. Hinch.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored just two runs in 21 innings against Oakland
starters this series, and they went homerless over the three games.
The M's still lead the majors in homers by a wide margin, but have
failed to homer in six of their past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one guy gets hot, another guy gets hot,'' said third
baseman Russ Davis. ``You saw it in their game (Wednesday). It was
one guy, the next guy and it took off from there. We're going to
score runs, I don't think anybody here is thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have to win games like Thursday's, Davis said, when
the pitching gives the offense a chance. Frankie Rodriguez and Paul
Abbott pitched effectively for eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez allowed an opposite-field homer to Eric Chavez in the
third, and had six strikeouts through four innings. In the fifth,
Jason Giambi led off with a single, and Rodriguez induced a pop-up
to shallow right-center from Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman David Bell went after it, and his only option was
to turn his back to the ball and attempt an over-the-shoulder
catch. The sun, he said, prevented him from getting a better look.
Bell came close to catching the ball, but it dropped for a hit,
putting two runners on with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the difference in the game for us,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was rookie catcher Ramon Hernandez, who went
7-for-13 in this series, his first in the majors. Hernandez singled
to load the bases, and Giambi scored when Rodriguez got Ryan
Christenson to ground into a double play. Another run came in on a
single by Phillips, his second of three.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez departed after the fifth, having allowed three runs on
six hits but walking none in a spot start. Rookie Gil Meche will
join the rotation the next time around, replacing Abbott, who used
a good changeup to toss three strong innings. The A's scored only
once off Abbott, on a seventh-inning single by Christenson that
gave them a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by two errors, the Mariners tied it in the eighth, driving
Jimmy Haynes from the game, and getting to closer Billy Taylor for
stolen bases by Brian Hunter and Ken Griffey Jr. and a run-scoring
single by David Segui. Two of Seattle's runs were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   The score was still 4-4 when Paniagua entered in the ninth. The
Mariners' set-up man had overwhelmed Oakland on Tuesday, but he
failed to repeat that Thursday. After Hernandez's one-out single,
Paniagua hit Christenson, putting pinch runner Hinch in position to
score _ which he did, when Phillips ripped one down the right-field
line one batter later.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua's inconsistency has been frustrating for the M's,
especially in a stretch of games in which he has played such a big
role. The right-hander blew saves in losses last Monday and last
Thursday. He blew a save but won Saturday, pitched two shutout
innings and won Tuesday, then lost Thursday. He declined to talk
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, he was using too many two-seam (fastballs),
and the ball was moving so much he had trouble controlling it,''
said pitching coach Stan Williams. ``We tried a four-seamer to get
ahead, then the two-seamer. Obviously, he flew open on that pitch
today. Hitting a guy was the last thing in the world he wanted to
do there.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua was successful using a new grip on his slider on
Tuesday, but that pitch might have indirectly worked against him
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on his slider and trying to mix his pitches,''
Williams said. ``He's been doing a real good job with the slider,
but whether or not it's screwing up his delivery on the fastball,
that's something I plan to talk to him about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy. The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us
down. Same for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian
currency collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S.
consumers and to many U.S. corporations. Thanks to devalued Asian
currencies, we've been getting TVs, microwave ovens, and computer
chips at bargain prices, so our consumer price index has stayed
amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and wider profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms.)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing market propels furniture,
refrigerator, and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-business sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 till now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

<P>
   SEOUL _ North Korea has softened its enemies in the South using
a weapon that no one could have imagined during the long years of
North-South confrontation _ cold noodles, Pyongyang-style.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans are shipping buckwheat, bean paste and liquor
here to satiate the appetites of South Koreans yearning for a taste
of life above the Demilitarized Zone that still divides the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The food is arriving here at a time when millions of North
Koreans survive on tree bark and the husks of corn kernels and the
country is getting millions of tons of emergency food aid from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is an unabashedly capitalist entrepreneur whose
Okryukwan Restaurant takes its ingredients, cuisine _ and name _
from the original restaurant founded on orders from the late North
Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting 10 tons of buckwheat a month for noodles,'' said
the owner, Kim Young Baek, who sees the venture as a marriage
between his own capitalist drive to open up North Korea and North
Korea's need for hard cash. ``We don't think about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all in accordance with the ``sunshine policy'' promoted
by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea to reduce border tensions
after years in which South Korea's national security law forbade
the least sign of Pyongyang influence in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   These days, bags shipped from the North Korean port of Nampo to
the South Korean port of Inchon litter the office of the Okryukwan.
Their labels clearly say ``DPR Korea'' for Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, a name banned in Seoul in print until a year or
so ago.
</P>
<P>
   The original Okryukwan in Pyongyang used to dish up 10,000 daily
servings, but now serves just occasional foreign visitors and VIPs,
Kim said. His own Okryukwan, meanwhile, can hardly cope with the
crowds lined up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Customers try not to think of the horrors of the Korean War or
the current suffering of starving North Koreans as they wait
happily for a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the North Koreans, but what can you do?''
asked Eum Seong Jin, a university student, standing in line with a
couple of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beside him, Shin Hyun Joo, working for an American company,
contrasted her response to the North with that of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents' generation went through the Korean War,'' she
said. ``Many left families behind in the North. They have strong
feelings. We don't have those feelings. It's like it's a different
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, all 360 seats on three floors were filled with diners
tucking in on the famous cold noodles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this place special is we know the recipe is
straight from Pyongyang,'' said Kim Ok Ja, visiting the restaurant
with her husband. ``The flavoring is different.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the result of the culinary skills of two employees: a
chef who holds a Japanese passport and was trained at the Okryukwan
in Pyongyang, and a defector who once worked at another restaurant
in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're training all our 27 cooks,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   To further guarantee authenticity, he has purchased hundreds of
chopsticks, ceramic spoons, plates and bowls from the North, all
displaying the label of the Okryukwan Restaurant. Some of them bear
the initials ``DPRK'' on the bottom. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who has been importing metal products from the North for
eight years, sees the restaurant as setting three precedents:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1991, when there was the first economic cooperation
between North and South, all the business was in the North,'' he
said. ``This is the first such business in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now all economic transactions between North and South
were based on crops and raw materials,'' he said. Now Koreans ``can
feel real cooperation since this is a service sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang, he added, ``is going to register the name of
Okryukwan in the South,'' and the South Korean government has
promised to accept it. ``That means, if a South Korean company
wants to sell anything in the North, North Korea will register its
brand as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes help account for the restaurant's popularity
among South Koreans curious about life in the North. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the food,'' said Park Yong Sub, an elderly man who
said he had come from his home town of Hamhung in North Korea
shortly before the Korea War. ``It's the idea of a taste from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's popularity has surged so fast that Kim hopes to
open another 10 just like it. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has the permission of the South Korean government, eager to
push reconciliation with the North, as well as the cooperation of
North Korean authorities, eager to export their products.
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is how long supplies can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the food shortage problem in the North, we
anticipate that the supply will not be stable,'' said Kim, who has
asked for three shipments of buckwheat a month as well as a ton a
month of mung bean, used in Pyongyang-style pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   He talks every day to representatives of a trading company in
North Korea, patching calls through Tokyo. A Korean-Japanese
company handles the paperwork for shipments that Pyongyang still
does not want to recognize as moving directly to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure where they get the buckwheat and the mung bean,''
Kim said, but he believes the North Koreans buy it on a free market
that has grown as government agencies break down. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Okryukwan attempts to live up to the reputation
of its namesake in Pyongyang. A painting of the original Okryukwan,
made by a North Korean artist, adorns the outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   There are no signs, however, of Kim Il Sung, the longtime North
Korean leader who ordered the establishment of the Okryukwan in the
early 1960s, or his son and heir, Kim Jong Il. ``We are completely
non-political,'' Kim, the restaurant owner, emphasized. &QL;

SONICS GAIN TOUGHNESS, FLEXIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Horace Grant knew several teams were interested in
trading for him on draft day.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one thing Grant found puzzling about him being
shipped to the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Magic never mentioned Seattle,'' Grant said. ``Not once.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were to go by the 1999 Sonics, it would seem like a
mismatch. Grant is known for his colorful goggles and tough
defense. Last season, the Sonics were only a shade of their former
selves _ particularly on defense.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the Sonics introduced Grant Thursday at their
practice facility, they revealed an intention to re-establish a
defensive prowess and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   When Gary Payton and Olden Polynice said last season no one
feared the Sonics, Grant believed them from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching the Sonics this past year, they needed that toughness
more so that aggressive defense they had in past years. That's what
made the Sonics,'' said Grant, whose built a 12-year career and
reputation on being a tenacious front-line defender.
</P>
<P>
   Grant runs the floor well, rebounds and keeps post-up players
off balance even as he approaches his 34th birthday on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Excited about the prospect of adding Grant, Paul Westphal rushed
into a film session with team president Wally Walker one day last
month. The tape Westphal put in the VCR showed Grant hustling from
end to end on the court twice in one sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Grant snared a defensive rebound, made the outlet pass, filled
the lane on offense, then made the sprint back on defense and drew
an offensive foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It enables us to do what I want to do defensively. If you have
players who can do it, it works a lot better,'' Westphal said. ``He
brings a defensive mindset. ... His leadership and his example will
be very good for the rest of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grant's locker at the O-rena were several Indian warrior
figures, which he says serve to remind him that every game is a
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in that aspect of my game,'' Grant said. ``I'll
come to work every night and be ready to perform against the best
out here. I've made my name on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were regularly beaten inside for dunks and layups
last season. Defense is not a strong suit for forward Vin Baker,
whom the Sonics hope to re-sign as a free agent. Polynice was not
much of an enforcer, either. Grant is expecting to change how
opponents attack the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal envisions Grant and Baker playing together. Grant is
capable of defending centers _ a chore from which he will not back
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with that whatsoever. As long as I'm here,
this team is going to be aggressive,'' said Grant, who stands
6-foot-10 and 245 pounds. ``I watched Gary and Hawk (Hersey
Hawkins) play defense and it excites me to see guys play like that.
My best assets are defense, a no-nonsense attitude and hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant brings leadership in addition to defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls made him the 10th overall pick in the 1987 draft. In
Chicago, Grant, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were known as the
``Dobermans'' for the way they attacked on defense. The result was
Grant becoming an integral part of three NBA titles with the Bulls
from 1991 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did not see much of a dropoff during Grant's five
seasons in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like his energy,'' Walker said. ``There's no doubt we need
to get better defensively. And that's exactly what we were thinking
when we made the deal.''

   ``What makes this place special is we know the recipe is
straight from Pyongyang,'' said Kim Ok Ja, visiting the restaurant
with her husband. ``The flavoring is different.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the result of the culinary skills of two employees: a
chef who holds a Japanese passport and was trained at the Okryukwan
in Pyongyang, and a defector who once worked at another restaurant
in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're training all our 27 cooks,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   To further guarantee authenticity, he has purchased hundreds of
chopsticks, ceramic spoons, plates and bowls from the North, all
displaying the label of the Okryukwan Restaurant. Some of them bear
the initials ``DPRK'' on the bottom. &QL;

<P>
   Kim, who has been importing metal products from the North for
eight years, sees the restaurant as setting three precedents:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1991, when there was the first economic cooperation
between North and South, all the business was in the North,'' he
said. ``This is the first such business in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now all economic transactions between North and South
were based on crops and raw materials,'' he said. Now Koreans ``can
feel real cooperation since this is a service sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang, he added, ``is going to register the name of
Okryukwan in the South,'' and the South Korean government has
promised to accept it. ``That means, if a South Korean company
wants to sell anything in the North, North Korea will register its
brand as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes help account for the restaurant's popularity
among South Koreans curious about life in the North. &QL;

   ``It's not the food,'' said Park Yong Sub, an elderly man who
said he had come from his home town of Hamhung in North Korea
shortly before the Korea War. ``It's the idea of a taste from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's popularity has surged so fast that Kim hopes to
open another 10 just like it. &QL;

<P>
   He has the permission of the South Korean government, eager to
push reconciliation with the North, as well as the cooperation of
North Korean authorities, eager to export their products.
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is how long supplies can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the food shortage problem in the North, we
anticipate that the supply will not be stable,'' said Kim, who has
asked for three shipments of buckwheat a month as well as a ton a
month of mung bean, used in Pyongyang-style pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   He talks every day to representatives of a trading company in
North Korea, patching calls through Tokyo. A Korean-Japanese
company handles the paperwork for shipments that Pyongyang still
does not want to recognize as moving directly to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure where they get the buckwheat and the mung bean,''
Kim said, but he believes the North Koreans buy it on a free market
that has grown as government agencies break down. &QL;

   In the meantime, Okryukwan attempts to live up to the reputation
of its namesake in Pyongyang. A painting of the original Okryukwan,
made by a North Korean artist, adorns the outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   There are no signs, however, of Kim Il Sung, the longtime North
Korean leader who ordered the establishment of the Okryukwan in the
early 1960s, or his son and heir, Kim Jong Il. ``We are completely
non-political,'' Kim, the restaurant owner, emphasized. &QL;

FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AWAITS BIGGEST TRANSFORMATION SINCE
DEPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (rk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As sweeping deregulation measures to remake the nation's
financial system near the congressional finish line, an oft-heard
comment is that the efforts would ``level the playing field'' among
banks, securities companies and insurers, which currently have
different rules of engagement for competing with each other.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation, one version passed the Senate in May and
another cleared the House Thursday night _ would do more than that.
Many experts say it would usher in a new financial era in which the
playing field would be greatly expanded, where many competing teams
would be merged into fewer and bigger teams and where today's
teams, which look quite different from one another, will begin to
look alike.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any prototype for the future, it is Citigroup, the
product of the $70 billion merger of Citicorp and the Travelers
Group Inc. into a financial giant empowered to sell securities,
take deposits, make loans, underwrite stocks, sell insurance and
engage in a wide variety of financial activities under one roof.
These combinations are currently either prohibited _ or made very
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the Citicorp-Travelers merger, announced in
April 1998, that threw out the challenge to Washington to change
Depression-era laws that had hampered such bold unions. Parts of
that deal were not permitted under current law, and
Citigroup-Travelers were faced with either getting the law changed
within five years or scuttling big parts of the deal, for instance,
jettisoning large chunks of Traveler's insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that the law will be changed, knocking down all
legal barriers to such unions and, some believe, setting off a new
wave of financial services mergers. In addition, banks, insurers
and brokers will all begin to expand their ranges of businesses. As
examples, a consumer could go to a securities firm and buy life
insurance, or go to a life insurer and buy stocks and mutual funds,
or go to a securities firm and make a bank deposit _ or simply go
to one financial services company and do all these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will open the door for a new wave of financial
services mergers,'' said Kenneth Guenther, the top lobbyist for the
Independent Community Bankers Association. ``It will put a lot more
companies _ companies like Merrill Lynch and other big bank and
insurance companies _ in play.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the three big players _ securities firms, banks and
insurers _ the bill means something different. While the bill is
generally associated with banks, in some ways, it means the least
change for them. Banks, through court rulings and regulatory
changes, can now engage in a limited amount of insurance and
securities activities. This bill would remove those limits and let
them enter these businesses unfettered, rather than fighting for
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Securities firms would be able to buy banks _ currently, banks
can buy securities firms, but not vice versa. For them, this is a
big victory, and firms like Merrill Lynch have been at the
forefront of the lobbying effort to get the measure passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have any strategic option foreclosed as we
attempt to compete on a global basis and in an industry seeing
substantial consolidation,'' said James Wiggins, a Merrill
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   And insurance companies, which have seen their business fall as
fewer people buy life insurance, like the bill for the same reason:
They feel banks are poaching into their business, and they want to
poach back. Acquiring a bank would give them access to new
customers and allow them to enter new businesses. Moreover, it
would put banks and insurance companies under the same regulatory
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is a recognition that the market has just outpaced
the regulatory system,'' said Daniel Zielinski, a spokesman for the
American Insurance Association. ``The big win for us is it allows
us to move into banking territory. ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the consumers, the picture is less clear. David Runkel, a
staff member of the House Banking Committee, said consumers would
benefit from increased convenience, more protections on securities
and insurance sales, and a reduction in fees from increased
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have more people and more companies offering more
services, you should have additional choices and convenience for
consumers,'' Runkel said. ``If you have $10,000, you can go to one
place and buy stocks, get a life insurance policy and open a
banking account.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenther, opposing the measure, contends that the consumer could
lose, arguing that financial consolidation will lead to fewer
choices and higher consumer fees. ``You will have fewer and fewer
institutions controlling the credit and debit card empire, and the
world will be divided more into really big and really small
institutions,'' said Guenther, whose group opposes the measure.
</P>
<P>
   One such sign of the future came last month when Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. applied to purchase an Oklahoma savings and loan company so
that it could offer banking services alongside the fishing tackle,
car batteries and other retail goods at its superstores. This
activity would be permitted under a complicated provision of the
bill that allows a limited number of acquisitions of unitary
savings and loan companies by commercial companies, like Wal-Mart.

POWER STILL OUT ON M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It turned on a bloop and a plunk, and it could
have used a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners came that close to beating the Oakland Athletics
Thursday and heading happily to Texas for three crucial games this
weekend. Instead, they will meet the division-leading Rangers
trailing by six games, thanks to a 5-4 loss to the A's before
11,632 fans in the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lost for the second game in a row to the A's, the
plucky, low-budget team Seattle can't shake in this American League
West race. After blowing out the Mariners Wednesday, Oakland won in
the ninth inning Thursday, when Tony Phillips' one-out single off
Jose Paniagua (5-7) brought home pinch runner A.J. Hinch.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored just two runs in 21 innings against Oakland
starters this series, and they went homerless over the three games.
The M's still lead the majors in homers by a wide margin, but have
failed to homer in six of their past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one guy gets hot, another guy gets hot,'' said third
baseman Russ Davis. ``You saw it in their game (Wednesday). It was
one guy, the next guy and it took off from there. We're going to
score runs, I don't think anybody here is thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have to win games like Thursday's, Davis said, when
the pitching gives the offense a chance. Frankie Rodriguez and Paul
Abbott pitched effectively for eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez allowed an opposite-field homer to Eric Chavez in the
third, and had six strikeouts through four innings. In the fifth,
Jason Giambi led off with a single, and Rodriguez induced a pop-up
to shallow right-center from Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman David Bell went after it, and his only option was
to turn his back to the ball and attempt an over-the-shoulder
catch. The sun, he said, prevented him from getting a better look.
Bell came close to catching the ball, but it dropped for a hit,
putting two runners on with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the difference in the game for us,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was rookie catcher Ramon Hernandez, who went
7-for-13 in this series, his first in the majors. Hernandez singled
to load the bases, and Giambi scored when Rodriguez got Ryan
Christenson to ground into a double play. Another run came in on a
single by Phillips, his second of three.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez departed after the fifth, having allowed three runs on
six hits but walking none in a spot start. Rookie Gil Meche will
join the rotation the next time around, replacing Abbott, who used
a good changeup to toss three strong innings. The A's scored only
once off Abbott, on a seventh-inning single by Christenson that
gave them a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by two errors, the Mariners tied it in the eighth, driving
Jimmy Haynes from the game, and getting to closer Billy Taylor for
stolen bases by Brian Hunter and Ken Griffey Jr. and a run-scoring
single by David Segui. Two of Seattle's runs were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   The score was still 4-4 when Paniagua entered in the ninth. The
Mariners' set-up man had overwhelmed Oakland on Tuesday, but he
failed to repeat that Thursday. After Hernandez's one-out single,
Paniagua hit Christenson, putting pinch runner Hinch in position to
score _ which he did, when Phillips ripped one down the right-field
line one batter later.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua's inconsistency has been frustrating for the M's,
especially in a stretch of games in which he has played such a big
role. The right-hander blew saves in losses last Monday and last
Thursday. He blew a save but won Saturday, pitched two shutout
innings and won Tuesday, then lost Thursday. He declined to talk
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, he was using too many two-seam (fastballs),
and the ball was moving so much he had trouble controlling it,''
said pitching coach Stan Williams. ``We tried a four-seamer to get
ahead, then the two-seamer. Obviously, he flew open on that pitch
today. Hitting a guy was the last thing in the world he wanted to
do there.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua was successful using a new grip on his slider on
Tuesday, but that pitch might have indirectly worked against him
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on his slider and trying to mix his pitches,''
Williams said. ``He's been doing a real good job with the slider,
but whether or not it's screwing up his delivery on the fastball,
that's something I plan to talk to him about.''

   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
A gypsy without a crystal ball could have predicted how the
road-weary Comets might have played against the Cleveland Rockers
on Thursday night at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the second straight night and for the third time
since Sunday, the Comets needed a big injection of energy from
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson, who has had an injured knee and has been in a
shooting slump, gave the Comets exactly what they needed. She
pumped in a career-high 26 points as the Comets overcame a slow
start to jet past the Rockers 76-64 before a crowd of 9,059.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to take off a minute from practice unnecessarily or
use an injury as an alibi, Thompson, true to form, wouldn't own up
to an offensive slump over the previous four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that mean?'' she asked. ``I really don't get it.
Because I haven't been making shots that I usually make doesn't
mean that I haven't been myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played very well on defense and rebounded, just helping
my team in any way I could. Cynthia (Cooper) and Sheryl (Swoopes)
have been very good offensively. And we haven't needed anyone to
step up and be an offensive threat, because they've been doing so
well.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case Thursday. Cooper admitted she played badly
and didn't shoot well.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, her string of scoring in double figures in every
WNBA game in which she has participated over two-plus years was in
jeopardy until the final minutes, but Cooper finished with 13
points.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, who carried the bulk of the offensive load in a 78-68
win at Utah on Wednesday, struggled against Cleveland _ as did most
of her teammates. Swoopes hit six of 17 shots for 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson, who in the previous three games had shot 38
percent (12-for-32), provided the safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you can say her game's been off,'' said
Swoopes. ``It's still early in the season. Tina maybe has been
struggling a little bit, and she's gotten down on herself a little
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this (Thursday night) did a lot for her confidence
and it did a lot for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing much of the game with her back to the basket for one of
the few times in her career, Thompson exhibited a power game that
resulted in 8-of-12 shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets got support from another team member who has been
mired in a rut of late, too.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve point guard Jennifer Rizzotti had her best game in the
WNBA, playing 18 minutes that yielded eight points and four steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she gave us a spark tonight,'' coach Van Chancellor
said of Rizzotti. ``I thought we were tired tonight, and I slipped
her in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she played well.''
</P>
<P>
   During their impressive run to the 1998 WNBA championship, one
of the blemishes on the Comets' 27-3 regular-season record was an
overtime loss to the Rockers at Compaq Center. With a 9-1 start to
the 1999 season, the Comets are on that same record .900 pace.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland came in Thursday riding a two-game win streak after
starting the season 0-7, a league record. The Rockers (2-8) also
had the advantage of two days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in energy levels between the teams was
immediately evident, though the scoreboard might not have showed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were a little tired and a little sluggish,'' said
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   With ABL refugee Chasity Melvin ranging free inside, the Rockers
played on even terms with the Comets until late in the first half.
There were seven early ties, and neither team led by more than
three points until the Comets outscored the Rockers 15-0 to go
ahead 36-23.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson scored five straight points during the surge and was a
constant terror on the backboards.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets led by as many as 13 points on three occasions in the
first half and by 15 (53-38) _ following a 3-pointer by Thompson _
in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:15 remaining, a basket by reserve Alisa Burras brought
the Rockers to 66-60.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper then scored eight points during a closing 10-4 run that
carried the Comets to their ninth win in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, you ride on a jet plane for three hours from
Utah and you're playing back-to-back,'' said Chancellor, ``and
you're in a grueling game like we were tonight?
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're playing Cleveland, who's won two in a row. Yeah,
I'm pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Also thrown into the mix was a 68-66 loss to Orlando at Compaq
Center on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team's just got it. We got beat Monday night. This is a
team that just has that special something,'' Chancellor said.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The good news _ if you're an Astros fan _ is that the Astros won
two of three games against the St. Louis Cardinals and showed signs
of breaking out of the funk that has defined them for two weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news is that Chris Holt seems to have reverted to his
early-season problem of poor pitch location.
</P>
<P>
   Holt let a three-run lead slip away and stood helpless as the
Cardinals pulled away for a 10-4 victory before a Thursday
afternoon crowd of 43,727 _ the largest at the Astrodome since
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored three runs in the first inning, but the game
was tied by the fifth and the Cardinals blew it open with four in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got three runs in the first inning against their No. 1
starter (Kent Bottenfield), and we couldn't hold them,'' interim
manager Matt Galante said. ``When we get a 3-0 lead, I kind of
expect us to take the bull by the horn, but it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt (1-8) allowed runs in the second, third and fifth innings
and two more in the sixth before being replaced by Jose Cabrera.
After compiling a 2.27 ERA over a five-start stretch that included
his only win, Holt has allowed 11 earned runs in his last two
starts, covering 9 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not making good pitches,'' Holt said. ``When I get a
three-run lead, I should hold it. I didn't throw many first-pitch
strikes, and you can't do that when you get a three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, it was just a bad outing. I've gotten a little out
of sync, and I need to find it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll try to clear his head in hopes of
finishing the first half of the season on a good note. Considering
the Astros' 2-11 record in Holt's starts, he is getting plenty of
advice. And questions regarding the security of his spot in the
rotation are beginning to surface.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the 28-year-old righthander is wondering if the
coaching staff has confidence in him. Despite a 3-2 lead in the
third inning Thursday, Galante had Brian Williams warming up in the
third, fourth and fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like that at all,'' Holt said. ``I don't know if they
don't have confidence in me or what the deal is, but it was still a
3-2 ballgame in the third inning, and I felt I could get out of
those situations. There are a lot of things being said and a lot of
things going on in my head, and I just need to block that out and
pitch like Chris Holt knows how to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be able to do that. I'm not even worried about
(losing his spot in the rotation). I know 1-8 doesn't look good; it
looks terrible. But it doesn't completely show how I've pitched.
Whenever things aren't going well, you have people telling you to
do this and do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to pitch like I'm capable of pitching. I know I'm
a better pitcher than what my record shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Galante indicated he has not lost confidence in Holt's stuff,
but he did admit to being displeased with the pitcher's location
and his approach after he was staked to a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he went after people the way he needed to go
after them,'' Galante said. ``I'm concerned with his location, not
his stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (12-3) didn't have his best stuff, and the Astros
took advantage in the first when Craig Biggio hit a leadoff homer
and Carl Everett topped off the inning with a towering two-run shot
to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got only three hits over the next six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who allowed the leadoff runner to reach in five of the
first six innings (three of them scored), was on the verge of
getting out of a second-inning trouble spot before throwing a wild
pitch with Ray Lankford on third base.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire singled home a run in the third, and Joe McEwing's
fifth-inning sacrifice fly tied the score at 3. Galante pulled the
plug on Holt after McGwire walked to open the sixth inning and
Lankford followed with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera gave up an RBI single to Fernando Tatis, a sacrifice fly
to Edgar Renteria and a seeing-eye, two-out double to Bottenfield
after an intentional walk. The ball dropped between Biggio and
right fielder Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bidge came pretty close to it,'' Galante said. ``But he
(Bottenfield) just hit the ball where no one could get to it. The
disheartening thing is that we went to a 3-0 count on him. That was
an out waiting to happen, and we didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield left after facing two batters in the sixth, and the
Astros got a run when Rick Croushore walked Jeff Bagwell with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored three runs in an eighth-inning rally
highlighted by J.D. Drew's liner into center field that Everett
misplayed into the first inside-the-park home run against the
Astros since 1986.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ For the third time in four days, Wimbledon's
tarps got more court time than the tennis players. And once again
Thursday, the BBC was reduced to filling hours of air time with
ancient matches involving fading legends wielding rackets made of
Stone Age materials.
</P>
<P>
   We were given the third set of Martina Navratilova's win over
Chris Evert in the 1978 final. Martina's weapon was made of steel,
Chrissie's of wood. Both rackets appeared as small as flyswatters
and seemingly capable of generating about the same amount of
sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the live tennis _ there were sporadic yet brilliant
interludes of same throughout the afternoon and evening _ the two
greats looked almost prissy, exchanging patty-cake serves, soft
volleys and safe, looping groundstrokes that rarely threatened to
clip a line.
</P>
<P>
   Their gentle, almost dainty style seemed more closely akin to
Lottie Dod's era, the Edwardian, than to Jelena Dokic's
millennium-straddling one.
</P>
<P>
   You were left with the impression any of the current
quarterfinalists _ including Dokic and Alexandra Stevenson, the
other teen-age qualifier she'll resume playing today _ would pummel
either of the women who together created the most compelling,
longest-running rivalry their sport has known.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, put a titanium boron graphite Kevlar weapon in
Navratilova's or Evert's mitts, rewind their body clocks, and
perhaps our contemporary bashers would be grossly overmatched.
That's why it's unreasonable, even impossible, to compare players
of different eras. The game has evolved exponentially, thanks to
its more sophisticated technology and the players' advanced
training regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams cracked a couple of 110-mph serves at Steffi Graf
in one of the three women's matches that dragged on deep into the
damp evening's gloaming. More amazingly, perhaps, Graf smacked them
back despite what had to be marginal visibility. Thirty years ago,
as he pursued his second Grand Slam, Rod Laver rarely, if ever,
belted a tennis ball with such velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi's career roots predate 1985, the year her countryman,
Boris Becker, won Wimbledon as a burly 17-year-old boomer using a
racket that's of the same species as those of today. Tennis changed
radically with Boris, who said bye-bye forever to Wimbledon this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although arguably not for the better.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, the men's grass-court game clearly has
suffered from the excess of oomph, unless your idea of
entertainment and intrigue is watching terror-stricken linespeople
duck and dodge subsonic aces that could leave them with contusions,
if not concussions.
</P>
<P>
   But women's tennis is in full flower, having maintained a
tactical element while adding sufficient muscle to cement the
ladies' status as athletes of the first rank. Graf, pursuing a 23rd
Slam title, had even admitted Wednesday that Williams, 19, sort of,
well, scares her.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Venus hits the ball that hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very tough,'' Steffi said. ``You could see the last two
years the kind of potential she has.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graf, 30, still hits the ball better _ and pretty hard
herself, too, for an old gal. Her forehand never has taken a back
seat to anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, which came more than seven hours after the start
because of more maddening weather delays that have thrown the
weekend's schedule into chaos, Graf had sufficient power and too
much crucial-point poise for Williams, who remains a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Steffi has an eighth Wimbledon title in her cross hairs,
with only the defending U.S. Open champion, Lindsay Davenport,
seemingly presenting a serious threat to same.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's first championship here came at Navratilova's expense in
1988, after a rain delay. The same as Boris, she brought a
different game to the court, one with which Martina wasn't
familiar, or comfortable. It continues to serve Steffi well, now
that she has recovered from serious knee and wrist injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was asked what Graf had going for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything she wants to do,'' Venus said.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi's strokes were strong enough for her to win the French
Open, and her supreme confidence on grass compensated for Williams'
salvos. Given the skewed circumstances, the caliber of play stayed
remarkably high, equal aesthetically to Evert and Navratilova at
their peak, with a much faster pace.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie and Martina couldn't go sideline to sideline like
Venus, never mind matching the crackling pop of her serve and the
penetrating depth of her groundstrokes. Once she solidifies her
volley
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus has the game,'' Graf said, ``and the physique, which is
equally important, (to be No. 1). I think so, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger, faster, stronger. Such is sport, hurtling through time.

L.A. MOM, TEACHER LINKED TO PRISON GANG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND, LISA VAN PROYEN AND GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An LAUSD teacher was among seven people arrested
on suspicion of helping the ruthless Mexican Mafia prison gang
expand its control of drug dealing in Los Angeles, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Cheryl Farrell, 50, a social studies teacher at a South
Central Los Angeles campus, is accused of delivering messages to
imprisoned members of the gang known as La Eme or the Mexican
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   She was arrested Thursday at her Los Angeles home as part of a 2
1/2-year investigation of the Mexican Mafia. Two grand jury
indictments charge Farrell and 15 suspected gang members and
associates with racketeering, murder, conspiracy to commit murder
and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' said Howard Lappin, principal of Foshay
Learning Center, where Farrell taught social studies and English as
a second language to seventh- and eighth-graders since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   However, Farrell told Lappin she had kept in touch with former
students who were in prison because she wanted to help them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to me and said she did keep in contact with people in
prison. She talked with me about it and said that she doesn't do
anything wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret Farrell is the last person in the world I would think
would do anything to hurt anybody. If there was an ant on the
floor, Margaret Farrell would walk around it,'' Lappin said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents paint a different picture of Farrell, who they
say was among five women arrested on suspicion of delivering
messages to gang members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for them to succeed, they need helpers, and the
helpers become part of the conspiracy even though they may never
have picked up a gun or a drug or bumped someone off,'' said John
Schiman, acting assistant direct in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles
field office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will really have a major impact on their operations in
the L.A. area,'' Schiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell's tie to the gang was unclear, Schiman said. But she is
accused in the indictment of acting as a messenger for the gang on
six occasions over two months beginning May 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She is accused of disseminating the names of three people the
gang planned to attack in state prison. The indictment also says
she received instructions ``to do some things'' that were
``complicated'' on behalf of an incarcerated Mexican Mafia member,
according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell and six others are expected to be arraigned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants are now in state prison and seven others
remain fugitives, according to U.S. Attorney spokesman Thom Mrozek.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictments allege six murders, four attempted murders
and 14 conspiracies to commit murders. Federal prosecutors also
accuse the gang of expanding its drug dealing operations by forcing
Latino street gangs and drug dealers to pay a tax in exchange for
protection in prisons and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Farrell, those arrested Thursday are Javier
Alvidrez Duarte, 29, of West Covina; Gerardo Jacobo, 18, of Los
Angeles; Adrian Miguel Nieto, 23, of Pico Rivera; Sally Peters, 45,
of Santa Ana; Suzanne Schoenberg, 26, of Paramount; and Veronica
Ruiz Rodriguez, 25, of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Schiman said agents did not know Farrell was a teacher until her
arrest, but ``her activities had nothing to do with the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities did not inform the LAUSD of the probe, said
Shel Erlich, a district spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   She began working for the district as a full-time teacher in
1983 at Markham Middle School in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Lappin said Farrell is married and has a teen-age son, and she
consistently received ``good evaluations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She cares about her kids a great deal and she wants them to
succeed,'' Lappin said. ``She always goes beyond the call of duty.
Whenever her children are in trouble, she lends an ear.''

GOP LETTER URGES PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO EXPLOIT `SOFT MONEY'
LOOPHOLE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Party has sent a letter to GOP
presidential candidates suggesting that the party intends to
exploit the same ``soft money'' loophole in 2000 that led to widely
criticized campaign finance practices in 1996, The Arizona Republic
has learned.
</P>
<P>
   In the June 18 letter, obtained by The Republic, the Republican
National Committee told all of the Republican presidential
contenders to ``channel'' their top donors to the RNC to help fund
``an aggressive issue advertising campaign designed to counter the
efforts of union bosses and the Democratic National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you to let your donors know that once they have
reached their contribution limit for (the candidate), all further
support should be channeled to the RNC,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Public-interest groups said the letter raised the issue of
whether the party was attempting to circumvent federal election
contribution limits by using soft money contributions to the RNC as
a back door on behalf of the ultimate GOP nominee. During
congressional hearing, Republicans accused President Clinton of
using the Democratic National Committee for the same purpose in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is supposed to build support for parties rather than
assist specific candidates. But both parties bent the rules during
the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reformers say the soft money loophole made
campaign spending limits meaningless during the 1996 campaign. The
result, they say, is that the political system is awash in big
donations given for favors that aren't available to the average
voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the letter) is one of those things you don't expect to
see in writing,'' said Paul Hendrie, a spokesman for the watchdog
Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It illustrates the kind of fraud that the party-purchased ads
are. They are pretending they're not campaign ads, and a letter
like this shows this is just what they are,'' Hendrie said.
</P>
<P>
   But RNC spokesman Mark Pfeifle said, ``These dollars are not
earmarked for any one particular candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ads would run in the heat of the campaign, Pfeifle
said they would not directly benefit any presidential candidate.
For that reason, the RNC believes soft money may be used to fund
the ads, at least in part, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the ads would appear after the
presidential primaries and would be designed to avoid ``a
repetition of 1996,'' when a Democratic media blitz, whose funding
later became the subject of congressional hearings, helped Clinton
defeat GOP challenger Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Democrats, and to a lesser extent Republicans, spent
millions of dollars on advertising financed by soft money from
wealthy donors, corporations and labor groups.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC letter suggests that the line between soft money to the
national party and direct contributions to a specific candidate
again may be improperly blurred, Hendrie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it tells you is down the road we're going to see a
campaign in the fall, or post-primary, that is modeled after the
kinds of campaigns that occurred in 1996, and those are problematic
campaigns. This is a precursor,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president
of Democracy 21, a public-policy group specializing in campaign
finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifle said the ads, part of a new campaign called Media 2000,
will run after the primaries as a self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when Republicans are most vulnerable to
Democrat attack ads aimed at misrepresentation of the GOP message.
It's designed to counter union bosses, the Democratic National
Committee, trial lawyers, the Hollywood crowd and (Vice President)
Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC letter, which was signed by Chairman Jim Nicholson,
appears to link the planned ad campaign to the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to avoid a repetition of 1996,'' the letter
said. ``The combined Clinton/Gore, DNC and union media blitz
attacking Senator Dole and Republicans proceeded uninterrupted from
March through August and built a Democratic lead that we never
closed. That must not happen next year.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus said, ``It's no surprise that the
Republican Party wants to go back to their same old ways, just like
the days before Nixon where we had the abuses which led to the
funding caps in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hendrie said it would be difficult for the Democrats to
rightly complain, saying, ``If anybody pioneered this whole
approach, it was Bill Clinton and the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate,
has introduced a bill that would prevent either party from
collecting soft money for ``issue advertising,'' as the RNC is
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said in a speech earlier this week that soft money is a
loophole ``that corrupts our political ideas, whether it comes from
big business or from labor bosses and trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the presidential candidates were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   But David Beckwith, a spokesman for Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
said, ``This (the letter) shows one of the major problems with
campaign finance restrictions of any kind. There will be ways to
avoid them _ legal ways _ and people encouraging others to do just
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Bush, the front-runner by a wide margin in the
polls and in fund-raising, hadn't decided whether to cooperate with
the RNC by encouraging his donors to contribute to the party ads
once they had given him the maximum $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Donors who contribute to a specific candidate's campaign and to
the RNC will have the satisfaction of knowing that the campaign
will be made aware of both gifts, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been so concerned with our fund-raising that we haven't
had time to cooperate with anyone else,'' Beckwith said. ``But,
basically, you cant blame a Republican leader for attempting to
counter abuses on the other side. To do anything else would be
unilateral disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wertheimer said the letter was a harbinger of a campaign
that may be worse than 1996, in terms of bending the rules. He said
the new RNC plan, by itself, didn't illustrate abuses because the
GOP hasn't yet picked its nominee. But he said the letter was a bad
sign.

DODGERS SWEPT BY PADRES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Of all the Los Angeles Dodgers to attack for the
offensive offense, left fielder Gary Sheffield should be last. He's
hitting .300, producing and scoring runs and drawing walks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was Sheffield who went to Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort
after the Dodgers lost 6-3 to San Diego _ the Padres' second
three-game sweep of the Dodgers in a week _ to say the offense is
failing the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the pitchers and said, `We have to get you some runs
to give you something to work with,''' Sheffield said. ``We have to
make your job easier. When you pitch with a cushion, it takes
pressure off the pitchers, makes it so it's not a do-or-die
situation all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have won a club-record 13 straight and at 38-38 are
.500 for the first time since the 12th game of the season. The
last-place Dodgers (34-42) have lost four straight overall and
seven straight to the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   In going 8-17 in June, the Dodgers scored in the first inning in
four games. Ditto on the first day of July, though they did give
Dreifort a 2-0 lead with runs in the second and third inning. In
fact, the Dodgers scored first in each game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Padres loaded the bases in the fourth with none out and
scored on a fielder's choice, a single and a groundout to take a
3-2 lead. Quilvio Veras hit a solo shot in the fifth to make it
4-2.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Padres scratched and clawed for runs by making
contact and getting runs with outs, the Dodgers offense is feeling
the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White scored in the second by running through a stop sign,
and Dreifort failed to get a bunt down with two runners on in the
fifth. Raul Mondesi, batting leadoff for the first time in six
years, then singled in one run instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can do anything right,'' injured Dodgers
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek said. ``I've never seen anything like
it. I don't know if there's a cloud over this team right now, but
it's got to be lifted for there to be success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres tacked on two runs in the eighth with back-to-back
homers by Ruben Rivera and Wally Joyner. Rivera, who robbed Eric
Karros of a homer Friday with a great catch, made another
spectacular catch against the wall in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera also happens to be the model of why the Padres are
playing well. He's got loads of talent, but entered each of the
three games as a defensive replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working out and everybody's happy,'' Rivera said. ``I'm
happy. I'm just waiting for my time. But I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (6-7) allowed four runs in six innings in the loss.
Matt Clement (5-7) pitched 52/3 innings for the win, and Trevor
Hoffman got his 20th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys to hang with it,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``There's a long way to go. You can turn things
around. Offensively, we have to do something. The look we had today
(with Mondesi leading off) wasn't bad. I'd like to do some other
things with the lineup, but right now we're having trouble scoring
runs, getting base hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, 14th in the NL in scoring, had eight runs and 17
hits against the Padres. They also went 3 for 38 (.079) from the
seventh inning even though one game was tied and another was a
one-run contest at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are 8{ games out of first but that's in the mediocre
NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, we're in this division,'' Sheffield said. ``For us to
play the way we are playing, we're still in striking range.''

JOHNSON LOOKS TO `JUMP-START' OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Davey Johnson is trying everything to break Raul
Mondesi _ and the Los Angeles Dodgers _ out of their offensive funk
that has lasted 76 games.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Dodgers manager batted Mondesi sixth for the
first time in two years, Johnson moved Mondesi to the leadoff spot
for the first time in six years as the search for offense
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to jump-start him and our offense _ be a Bobby
Bonds-type,'' Johnson said. ``We definitely have to try something
offensively to free us up some more. We're not meshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi began July by going 1 for 5 with an RBI in Thursday's
6-3 loss at San Diego. Usual leadoff hitter Eric Young hit .346 on
the six-game road trip, but Johnson wanted to mix things up because
the offense still isn't performing even adequately.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've got to be right-handed (in the lineup), I might as
well rub my finger in there quick,'' Johnson said. ``When I look at
what we're doing offensively, as a group, we have to try something.
I'm going to keep throwing things against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty much gotten to the point where Johnson is ready to
pound his head against a wall. The Dodgers are 14th in the NL in
runs scored (340) and hit .257 and drove in 96 runs in 25 games
(8-17) in June.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's a shining symbol. He hit .210 with one homer and six
RBI in June. His averaged dropped from .305 at the end of April to
.261.
</P>
<P>
   His insertion as the leadoff hitter, instead of the cleanup
spot, where he's batted 63 times, marks the first time he's hit
there since Sept. 29, 1993, against Chicago. It's the fourth time
Mondesi hit leadoff in his career. He was 6 for 13 with a triple,
homer, four RBI and two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek to begin rehab: Injured shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, who's been out since breaking his hand June 2, will
begin a rehab assignment today for Single-A San Bernardino at Lake
Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey will be looking to see how I do, see how I feel out
there,'' Grudzielanek said. ``... 10 to 15 at-bats and I'll be
ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who's hitting .284, said he's hoping to be
activated either Sunday or Monday. That would cause a logjam among
middle infielders, and Johnson said he'd like to remain with five
outfielders if Todd Hollandsworth's injury isn't serious. But none
of the Dodgers infielders have options remaining, which could
expose Tripp Cromer on the waiver wire.
</P>
<P>
   June swoon, July jolt?: This is for those who are a step beyond
eternal optimists. The Dodgers' 8-17 mark in June is their worst
for one month in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers' public relations staff, whose job it is to find
the silver lining in even tornadic situations, came up with this
one: In the past two Julys, the Dodgers are 37-17 (.685). They went
17-10 last season and 20-7 in 1997. In the previous two Junes, the
Dodgers were 26-29.
</P>
<P>
   In closing: Right-hander Antonio Osuna (elbow surgery) threw
another bullpen session before the game. ``Osuna threw a great pen,
threw some breaking balls, about 60 pitches,'' Johnson said. Osuna
will face live hitters before Sunday's game at Dodger Stadium and
could be sent on a rehab assignment shortly thereafter....
Outfielder Todd Hollandsworth returned to Los Angeles before the
game to have his ailing left triceps examined. Johnson said the
swelling and pain are symptomatic of a bruise.... Tonight's series
opener against the Giants is sold out, as is Sunday's
fireworks-highlighted night game.

ODOM FINDS HIS WAY TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The symbolism may not have been orchestrated, but
it was loud.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of Convention Center windows presented a view of the rising
Staples Center at point-blank range, but also managed to frame a
first-hand look at this year's touchstone of Los Angeles Clippers
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask for anything more,'' said 19-year-old Lamar
Odom, referring to his NBA opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It was 21 hours after the Clippers realized that dropping to
fourth position in the NBA Draft lottery wouldn't separate them
from the type of player an NBA team can build on.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who has been something of a hoop vagabond, spent the past
two weeks sticking his foot in and out of the draft waters. At
Thursday's welcome to L.A. press conference, he discussed the
personal uncertainty that made drafting him a risk the Clippers
were happy to assume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe I was a little scared,'' Odom said of his
reluctance to leave Rhode Island after one official season for a
high-paying and high-profile life in the NBA. ``My whole life was
about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers employees believe the same can be said for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we realized the draft had gotten down to the fourth pick
and he was still on the board,'' Clippers coach coach Chris Ford
said, ``we were thrilled. He's made some mistakes, but we will
judge Lamar Odom from this day forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the cameras, the soft-spoken Odom, a versatile
6-foot-10 small forward, seemed relieved to be able to return his
focus to basketball and away from any decision deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost cried last night,'' he said of the NBA's draft show
at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. ``I'm happy I was able to
share the moment with my family and some of the players I grew up
playing with.''
</P>
<P>
   The lineup from Odom's AAU days included first-round hot shots
Elton Brand, the draft's first pick, Wally Szczerbiak and Ron
Artest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Odom is eager to use his creative passing skills for the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get out there and start playing,'' said Odom,
whose desire to participate in the summer pro league at Long Beach
State may be tempered by being unable to sign an NBA contract until
Aug. 1. ``I just want to be a leader and get everyone involved.
They have plenty of players on this team who can put the ball in
the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those is last year's small forward, Tyrone Nesby, whose
senior year at Nevada-Las Vegas didn't lead to selection in the
1998 NBA Draft. But it did steer Nesby to the Clippers as a free
agent, and his performance was rated by Sports Illustrated as
fifth-best statistically among rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Nesby is a free agent again, but Thursday, the Clippers tendered
him an offer, a relative formality that secures their position of
holding the right of first refusal. If he signs on offer sheet with
another team, the Clippers can keep Nesby by matching it.
</P>
<P>
   A Clippers source says the team intends to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest fish in the Clippers' potential free-agent pond
is Maurice Taylor. As of Thursday, the team can offer the power
forward a six-year contract extension. Taylor, who has become one
of the game's top young players in two pro seasons, is seeking the
maximum boost, which would pay him $70 million over those six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking,'' Norm Nixon, Taylor's agent, said, ``and
we expect it to be completed soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the windows behind Nixon, the Staples Center
construction crew continued pounding a little irony.

L.A. groups focus on stadium design 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With less than a month before NFL owners meet in
Chicago, principals from the two competing Los Angeles ownership
groups met a second time Wednesday to focus their newly combined
effort on a Coliseum stadium and site plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chadwick, recently appointed by Gov. Gray Davis to direct
the Los Angeles franchise drive, would not confirm the new team
effort was basing its plans on Michael Ovitz's design and parking
scheme, but came away encouraged a consensus was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm highly confident we're going to come to a common
resolution,'' Chadwick said. ``I can't say it's going to be the
next meeting or the one after that. But I'm very confident we're
going to come to a meeting of the minds on what this ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick said he met for about four hours with Ed Roski Jr., a
principal with Eli Broad in the competing ownership group, Ovitz,
NFL vice president Roger Goodell and about a dozen architects
representing both groups. He met with the potential owners and NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue for the first time last week.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups are working out a compromise between the 27,000
additional parking spaces proposed by Ovitz, and the 7,500 by
Broad-Roski. The NFL has requested at least 25,000 spaces for the
Coliseum, but even if they agree on something closer to 17,000
spaces, Ovitz's multiple-garage design would have to be utilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm narrowing it down, and I don't think it's appropriate to
say what it's narrowed down to at this point because I don't
positively know,'' Chadwick said. ``I'm just not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lots of discussion, but we need to see drawings to see
what it looks like and how it all works. I'm probably going to get
that next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roski-Broad Coliseum renovation features a modern design
with a futuristic canopy covering the upper decks. The Ovitz design
is based on the ancient Roman Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups are supposed to be combining their efforts
leading up to the July 28 meeting of NFL owners, and Chadwick would
not say they were modifying the Ovitz design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nobody's plan,'' Chadwick said. ``It's the plan for the
Coliseum. This isn't about whose plan or whose vision or whose
thought, it's about collectively what we think works.''
</P>
<P>
   Although working together on a stadium and site plan, the NFL is
still expected to select only one ownership group. Both Broad and
Ovitz have said they want to be the principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick has broken the combined Los Angeles effort into various
sub-groups that meet on an almost daily basis but said he didn't
expect another major meeting with principals until possibly late
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two groups say they can afford the stadium redesign
and franchise fee, both said they will need outside assistance to
finance parking structures. Ovitz said each space costs $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL could offer some financial aid for parking, but some
public assistance is still expected to be needed. Chadwick said he
is now focusing on financing the parking additions for the
state-owned property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long card game, and we're not at the end of the deck,''
he said.

RAYS STING RED SOX AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 RAYS-RED SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nothing like a dose of reality to remind the Red Sox
their position in the American League East is extremely fragile.
There are still 10 games before the All-Star break, so the season
is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   That point was brought home dramatically Thursday &UR;  &LR; night at
Fenway Park in a 12-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays that came on
the heels of an 11-10 Boston loss Wednesday night. Tampa Bay backed
veteran lefthander Wilson Alvarez with 16 hits, including home runs
by Miguel Cairo and Peabody's Paul Sorrento. The Sox are 3-6 this
year against the Devil Rays, 1-5 in Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, sitting in second place in the AL East, simply were
outgunned by the fourth-place Devil Rays (11 games worse than
Boston in the standings at 34-44). Red Sox pitching was flat-out
bad. Bad location. Bad execution. Bad results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could say something about the effect of being in two games
like the ones we played,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams. ``You
shoot a lot of bullets in games like the first one. We put a lot of
energy into coming back three times only to lose. But I won't do
that. We have no excuses. They beat us both nights. We just have to
forget about it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the series, the Sox were coming off a four-game set
with the White Sox in which they won three games and their bats
were sizzling. They took a 1-0 lead in the first Thursday &UR;  &LR; night,
but after Tampa gained the lead by scoring once in the second and
three times in the fourth, the Sox attack vanished until it was too
late. Alvarez left after the seventh inning, when he gave up two
more runs. But by then it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Ho Cho, who suffered his first loss in four starts, was
knocked out in the fourth, and the bullpen could do little to slow
the Devil Ray attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of games happen sometimes,'' said Williams.
``They're swinging the bat good. They hit good and pitched good,
especially tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were done in by backup catcher Mike DiFelice, who drove
in a career-high five runs on three singles and a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra singled with two out in the first to extend
his hitting streak to a season-high 16 games. Mike Stanley then
walked, and Troy O'Leary singled to left for Boston's only lead of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa tied it in the second inning after a leadoff double by
Wade Boggs, who continued his march to 3,000 with a pair of hits.
After Sorrento walked, DiFelice singled to left for his first RBI.
There would be more.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa got to Cho for three runs in the fourth. After three
decent innings, the Korean-born righthander began making mistakes
in his mechanics. ``He was under the ball,'' said Williams. ``By
that I mean he was dropped down on his release point instead of
staying on top. The ball stays high. He can't pitch like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes with our location both nights,''
said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``When you make mistakes to major
league hitters, they're going to smack you around. Cho had poor
location. It's as simple as that. He threw a lot of backup sliders.
Fastballs that were supposed to be away that he threw in. And vice
versa. He's had four starts so far, three of them good. Let's go
back, work on the side, and see if we can find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento started the Tampa fourth with a double to center and
scored on a hit by DiFelice for a 2-1 lead. Randy Winn bounced into
a force out at second, but Cairo followed with a two-run homer,
giving the Devil Rays a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back to the locker room and saw myself on TV,'' Cho
said through an interpreter. ``I saw I wasn't on top. I'll fix it
next time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox aren't about to panic over two losses, but they
certainly don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is worried about the break right now,'' said
Garciaparra. ``We're worried about playing hard every day. Today
was just another loss. We don't look at the size, how they did it,
and how many runs they scored. We've got to go to Chicago, play a
good team, and win.''

MOGER BECOMES UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings opted not to tender a
qualifying offer to winger Sandy Moger, who became an unrestricted
free agent Thursday as the NHL's signing period began.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Moger, who joined the Kings two years ago with
Jozef Stumpel in the trade that sent Dimitri Khristich and Byron
Dafoe to Boston, suffered through an injury-plagued 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Kings became restricted free agents Thursday: forwards
Dan Bylsma, Steve McKenna, Jason Morgan, Glen Murray, Jason
Podollan, Bryan Smolinski and Vladimir Tsyplakov; goalie Stephane
Fiset and defensemen Jaroslav Modry, Jan Nemecek and Mattias
Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Moger was one of 13 Kings to become unrestricted free agents
Thursday. The others were defensemen Dave Babych, Mark Visheau,
Doug Bodger and Joe Corvo; forwards Russ Courtnall, Ray Ferraro,
Brandon Convery, Sean Pronger, Chris Schmidt and Andrew Dale; and
goalies Manny Legace and Ryan Bach.

AMERICANS ENGINEER A WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Maybe, to make it even more interesting next
time, the US women's soccer team should use just nine people. Or
play with their bootlaces tied together. Or show up 10 minutes
after the opening whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta keep people glued to the set; gotta keep them on the
edge of their seats,'' shrugged keeper Briana Scurry, after a
teammate had scored on her and the Americans trailed twice before
knocking stubborn Germany out of the World Cup, 3-2,
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night before a crowd of 54,642 (including the First
Family) at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which was sealed by Mama Joy Fawcett's header off a
Shannon MacMillan corner kick in the 66th minute, earned the US not
only a Sunday semifinal date with Brazil (which defeated Nigeria,
4-3, in overtime here Thursday &UR;  &LR; night) but also a trip to next
summer's Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``America now sees why they're attracted to this team,'' said US
coach Tony DiCicco, after President Clinton had congratulated his
ponytailed countrywomen in the locker room. ``They played on pure
guts. They refused to be beaten. It just came down to the women on
this team just having to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the US could have nailed down an Olympic berth even if it
had lost by a goal, that would have been cold comfort. Going out in
the quarterfinals would have been a disaster for a team that has
always won a medal at the world level and expects to reclaim the
Cup in the Rose Bowl a week from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the Yanks gave up an own goal in the fifth minute
after a miscommunication between Scurry and defender Brandi
Chastain and fell behind again moments before halftime, they
believed they would find a way to survive. ``Lift your heads up,''
DiCicco told them during intermission. ``This is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   The US had conceded a goal to the Nigerians on the first shot
and still won, 7-1, but they hadn't put it in their own net.
Chastain, under pressure, had played the ball routinely back to
Scurry, not realizing she had left her line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called `keeper,' but I guess Brandi didn't hear me,'' Scurry
said. ``So she played it back to where she thought I was. The ball
was going slow, but too fast for me to get it. It never happens,
but it happened. We were in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of goofy error that happens in 10-and-under
tournaments, not on the global stage. But the Americans shrugged it
off and drew even in the 16th minute. With German midfielder
Bettina Wiegmann off having a split lip repaired, Michelle Akers
fired a shot that bounced off two defenders and came loose to
Tiffeny Milbrett, who popped the ball past keeper Silke Rottenberg
from 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Just before intermission, though, playing in added time, the US
defenders let Wiegmann have too much time and space, and she
wheeled and fired a leftfooted cannon that beat Scurry from 20
yards and put the Germans up, 2-1. ``We really believed we could
win,'' said German coach Christina Theune-Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Americans had beaten the Germans eight times and tied
them once in their previous dozen meetings, they hadn't trailed
this late in a Cup match. ``You've got 45 minutes,'' DiCicco told
them. ``It's your choice whether you want to go home or go out and
play your game.''
</P>
<P>
   The US had been a second-half side all year, and it took only
four minutes to draw even. This time it was Chastain scoring her
second `goal' off a Mia Hamm corner that defender Steffi Jones
headed her way, with Chastain side-volleying a roofer that bounced
off the bar and in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for Tony's trust in me and my teammates' respect for
what I've done over the years,'' said Chastain. ``And thank God I
was in the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the clock ticked with the match in a deadlock, DiCicco
wanted a terminator. So he tapped MacMillan, the supersub who'd had
a hand in all three goals against the North Koreans in Foxborough,
Mass. ``Get us a goal,'' DiCicco told her.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan sprinted to the far corner where Milbrett was lining
up a kick. ``It's all yours,'' Milbrett told her. So MacMillan
launched a laser aimed right for Fawcett's forehead _ and the US
was up for good.
</P>
<P>
   And the Germans were facing a dilemma. If they tried to draw
even, they risked going down two goals and possibly missing the
Olympics. If they sat back, packed the box and lost only by one,
they could pack for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   So the Germans played it safe and went home with an Olympic
invite. And their hosts went on _ and, they hope, on. ``No team has
a bigger heart than we do,'' Scurry said. ``Many teams would have
fallen over dead at halftime. But we weren't going to let our dream
die.''

STATER BROS. EXPANDS TO FILL GAPS BETWEEN GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Antelope Valley and Santa Clarita residents will
soon have a company in their neighborhoods that prides itself on
being an old-fashioned, customer-friendly grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Colton-based The Stater Bros. bought 43 stores from
Albertson's, including two each in Palmdale and Lancaster and one
in Canyon Country _ areas that the chain has been eagerly eyeing
for five years, said Jack Brown, the company's chairman, president
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the opportunity we've been waiting for,'' Brown said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knows competition for the consumer's grocery dollar is
coming from all sides; from Wal-Mart and its
everything-under-one-roof strategy to specialty retailers like
Bristol Farms and Trader Joe's.
</P>
<P>
   But Stater Bros. keeps doing what it does best: Sell groceries
in a traditional grocery store format. And if the company's growth
and popularity are any indications, that strategy is working just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Stater Bros.' most recent opportunity to grow came
because of the latest mega-merger, this one between Albertson's and
American Stores. Albertson's received regulators' approval last
week to buy the parent company of the Lucky grocery chain and
Sav-on drugstore chain on the condition that it sell 145 stores
across the West to preserve market competition.
</P>
<P>
   Stater Bros. ate up 43 of the 117 California stores for
$147.2million, adding them to the 112 it already owns. Certified
Grocers of California Ltd. bought 32 of the divested stores on
behalf of its member grocers.
</P>
<P>
   Independent grocery chains like Stater Bros. and the members of
Certified Grocers ``are looking for niches in the marketplace that
they can exploit _ and they do it very well,'' said Tom Schaffner,
a spokesman for the association.
</P>
<P>
   The five north Los Angeles County stores represent a prime
opportunity for Stater Bros. to extend its reach further from its
San Bernardino County hub, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Stater Bros. got ``a really good deal'' on its 43-store
purchase, said Andrew P. Wolf, senior grocery industry analyst with
Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a per-store basis, that is really quite inexpensive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a local chain up against a host of national and
often publicly traded companies that have economies of scale,
access to cheap capital and other advantages. Thus, Stater Bros.
faces challenges _ but challenges that the independents frequently
meet by offering better service and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be even better than the big chains because of
some of the disadvantages that you face when you're up against much
bigger players,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Stater Bros. raked in $2billion in sales last year and
was able to pay cash for its newest stores _ and all as a privately
held company, without the benefit of stockholders' money.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Brown is concerned, stockholders would only have
gotten in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't answer to shareholders, we can do the right things
for the right reasons,'' he said. ``If we were a public company, we
would probably have had 10 shareholders' meetings to try and do
what we did with a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did is call Albertson's. They sent me a list, I looked
at all the stores and said, We want these stores,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The chain had first considered expanding in the Antelope Valley
about five years ago and went so far as to complete some
feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans, however, stalled when the desert communities where
Stater Bros. has a strong presence saw their economies decline as
military bases closed or scaled back. Rather than expand, the chain
focused on what it had.
</P>
<P>
   But now Southern California's economy is on the upswing and when
the Albertson's stores became available, Stater Bros. opened its
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the new stores will stock everything that both Stater
Bros. and Albertson's carried. The only changes customers can
expect to see will be the elimination of in-store pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't operate pharmacies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Stater Bros. chose the stores it did was that
they were all already quite successful, and in family-oriented
areas. Buying existing stores also saved the company the time and
money it would have taken to build and staff new ones from the
ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're able to acquire a going business and hopefully, all
the employees that are there now will be there with us,'' Brown
said. ``We think that's very important.''

TAMPA TRIO BELTS OUT WINNING TUNE 
</HEADLINE>
 RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Batting practice was coming to a close and members of
the Tampa Bay Trio _ led, of course, by Jose Canseco _ were down to
one swing apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs, as to be expected, put his off the wall in
left-center. Paul Sorrento, of the Peabody Sorrentos, hit a shot to
deep right field. And Canseco jumped in for his single swing and
launched one _ really launched one _ over everything in left.
</P>
<P>
   As the grounds crew broke down the batting cage, the crowd
applauded the veterans for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the three were back to bedevil the Red Sox and help Tampa
Bay finish off a two-game sweep. The Devil Rays were off to Toronto
after the game and that wasn't soon enough for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento, 33, was breaking out. Boggs, 41, was closing in. And
Canseco, 35 Friday, just kept on bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento, who sat out Wednesday night and has not been playing a
lot, had a single, a double, a home run, and walked once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a frustrating two or three weeks, you know,''
Sorrento said. ``You can't control what goes on and when you're in
there you've just got to give 100 percent and see what happens. I
got some good pitches to hit tonight and hit 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   And how.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrento, who had been in a 1-for-16 slump, had three of Tampa
Bay's 16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a first baseman, Sorrento had been starting in the
outfield until the Devil Rays recalled Bubba Trammell. Suddenly,
Sorrento was a spot starter.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs added two hits to the pair he had Wednesday night and now
has a magic number of 29 on his way to 3,000 for his career. For
good measure, he just about flew around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   He ran his Wall ball into a double in the second inning,
sustaining a bruised hip in the process, and scored on Mike
DiFelice's single. Later, he scooted from first to third on
Sorrento's single in the seventh. Boggs scored that time, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got so many at-bats in this park that it relaxes you and
makes you feel comfortable,'' Boggs said. ``And then you know
you've got that little thing in left field to play with. In my
opinion, it's the greatest hitters' park in baseball. The fun part
is coming back and hitting to left off the wall. In some other
parks you can hit bullets to left-center and guys run them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Tampa Bay paid its final visit to Boston of the
season, don't assume it's the end of the line at Fenway for Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't declared the Farewell Tour yet,'' he said. ``I'll
just continue to play and have fun and see what happens. That's out
of my control. If you continue to hit .300 at 41 or 42 and you're
healthy and continuing to play well and it's still fun . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, by the way, improved to .295 with his 2 for 4. His
numbers at Fenway as a Devil Ray: 12 for 27 (.444).
</P>
<P>
   Canseco added no home runs to his league-leading 28, largely
because he was walked seven times in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he nearly beheaded Sox starter Jin Ho Cho with a line
single in the third inning and added a long double to center in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco likely won't have to wait until next year to again take
aim at Fenway's wall.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he'll get another shot in the All-Star Game.

REBATES AIMED AT GETTING MORE HOMES ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES -- Coming now: the free personal computer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With computer prices falling and competition rising for services
such as Internet access and Internet search functions, companies
are flocking to give consumers free computers in exchange for
long-term Internet service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Internet giants such as America Online Inc.,
Microsoft Corp.'s MSN Internet Access and Prodigy Communications
Corp. have flooded the market with offers that rebate buyers as
much as $400 on computer purchases.
</P>
<P>
   On cheaper machines being offered by companies such as
Irvine-based eMachines Inc., a $400 rebate makes a computer
effectively free. The offers do not include monitors and other
peripheral devices.
</P>
<P>
   The trend -- similar to free phone offers by cellular phone
companies -- calls into question old assumptions about personal
computers, said Greg Blatnik, an analyst with Zona Research in
Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way some companies are thinking of the PC is as a way to
sell you Internet access,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy is the latest company to jump onto the free PC bandwagon
with an offer, beginning today, that gives consumers a $400 rebate
on computers purchased at Best Buy if they sign up for three years
of Prodigy Internet service at $19.95 a month, or $718.20 over the
life of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   America Online launched two similar offers Thursday tied to
eMachines and to computers purchased at Circuit City, and
Microsoft's MSN began a test offer this week at Staples stores
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   MSN also has a $400 subsidy offer for some computers sold at
Micro Center, a Columbus, Ohio-based retailer. The offer was
initiated in April.
</P>
<P>
   Most offers require three-year contract commitments but include
smaller rebates for shorter contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there are several motivations behind the spate of
rebate deals.
</P>
<P>
   By locking customers into long-term contracts, Internet
providers can address the problem of customers who switch back and
forth among providers.
</P>
<P>
   That turnover, or ``churn,'' is a problem because it costs
Internet providers $100 or more in marketing to capture each new
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them it's a great deal because they have a high rate of
churn,'' said Steve Chadima, vice president of marketing for
Free-PC Inc., the Pasadena company that offers free computers in
exchange for marketing data on customers and their online habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are realizing that unless they make moves like
this, they are going to slowly lose their customer base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the deals are not money-losing propositions for the Internet
providers, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already got the economics worked out,'' said Bruce
Kasrel, senior analyst with Forrester Research in Massachusetts.
``If someone signs up for this program, AOL's going to make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering free or nearly free PCs also could open the market to
the thousands of Americans without computers. According to Juniper
Communications, a New York-based research firm, only 52.5 percent
of American households had computers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it very attractive for people who have not purchased
PCs before,'' said Pattie Adams, spokeswoman for eMachines. ``It
really works at the low price points.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebates tap into a trend in the market that has most new
users buying computers for Internet access, not traditional uses
such as word processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to whatever is available on the Internet has taken the
primacy away from so-called personal computing,'' said Blatnik of
Zona Research.
</P>
<P>
   Another kind of change is playing a role in the computer rebate
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that if current trends hold, Internet providers
eventually might make more money from advertising and their cut of
online sales, or e-commerce, than they do from monthly access fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically the bet we're placing,'' said Mike Lucero,
group product manager for MSN Internet Access. ``We're going to end
up profiting off the access, but our bet on the upside is on the
portal revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Control of the ``portal'' that brings users into the Internet is
also an important consideration for new users who have not yet
formed online habits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people are going to get used to using our portal by
beginning their Internet experience with that portal,'' Lucero
said. &QL;

about worn out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sparse in some spots, invisible in others, scuffed at the
service line, beat up at the base line, it still provides the
setting for great tennis theater, the finals of the fortnight, the
Wimbledon Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It is Grand Slam tennis on its most glorious stage. Both men's
and women's finals were expected to be played there today, weather
permitting.
</P>
<P>
   In 115 years of the competition on the outskirts of London, no
woman has dominated that cathedral of tennis more thoroughly than
Martina Navratilova, who won nine singles championships there.
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova ruled Centre Court majestically, a master of the
grass who scooped up some blades as a keepsake after her last final
there in 1994. She won Wimbledon in 1978 and 1979, then every year
from 1982 through 1987, and once more in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Five times, her victim was old pal Chris Evert, her longtime
rival in one of the great sports soap operas this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special because she had her following and I had mine,''
said Evert, at Wimbledon for NBC. ``They were different groups. Her
fans appreciated what she stood for and my fans appreciated what I
stood for. It was about how we looked, how we acted, our style,
where we came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova and Evert faced each other 80 times during their
careers, with Martina holding a 43-37 edge. Nine times, the setting
was Wimbledon and five of those were in the finals. They split four
semis, Evert winning in 1976 and 1980, Navratilova in 1987 and
1988.
</P>
<P>
   But each time they played with the Wimbledon championship at
stake _ 1978, 1979, 1982, 1984 and 1985 _ Navratilova prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of a given that I would play her,'' said
Navratilova, who now broadcasts the event for HBO.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Martina planned for their matches, knowing that sooner
or later, Evert would show up on the other side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Once, though, that strategy backfired.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Evert and Navratilova seemed headed to a third straight
showdown. Certainly, Martina thought so. But a funny thing happened
on the way to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Hana Mandlikova beat Evert in the semifinals, leaving
Navratilova surprised, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had geared up for Chris for two weeks,'' she said. ``When
she lost to Hana, it threw me. Now I had to change tactics from
practicing chips and charges and long baselines. Suddenly, I had a
serve-and-volleyer on my hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You prepare for Chris and two days before, it's a total
U-turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova took a deep breath and adjusted her plans, beating
Mandlikova 7-6, 6-3 for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up winning and that's what counts,'' she said. ``But
it taught me a lesson about planning for an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Evert won this event three times _ never, however, when
Navratilova was on the other side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always at a disadvantage there,'' she said. ``Elsewhere,
I felt it was 50-50. But there, with the grass, that was her best
surface and my least effective. I always felt I was swimming uphill
against the tide there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she appreciated the significance of the matches and the
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always got excited,'' she said. ``The adrenaline was
flowing. I knew every part of my game had to be on. The grass
created more pressure on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Evert treasures the memories and the matches she played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wimbledon to me transcends tennis,'' she said. ``The English
know how to do occasions, whether it's a royal wedding or Ascot or
Wimbledon. You sense the ghosts that have played there. It's the
only grass around. The rivalry with Martina made it more special.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as she played on grass, Navratilova said Wimbledon's
lawns did not make Evert an easy opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was better against her on other surfaces,'' she said. ``It
was hard to create much against her on grass. On a surface with a
high bounce, I did better. She knew it was easier for me to serve
and volley. Her ball was low and deep, easier to attack on a slower
court. It was more difficult for her to hit a passing shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, perhaps, playing Evert at Wimbledon did not add
that much to the rivalry for Navratilova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Chris was special enough all by itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, early on in their careers, Evert and Navratilova played
doubles together, a master of the baseline and a serve-and-volley
expert in what seemed an almost unfair alliance. They won the
French Open in 1975 and a year later took the Wimbledon
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went their separate ways, destined to meet again in
singles matches all over the tennis world, but rarely in one as
regal as Wimbledon.!end!

 BUSH HITS RIGHT NOTES IN SILICON VALLEY  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and ROBERT B. GUNNISON  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a rousing speech to Silicon Valley
executives, George W. Bush attacked President Clinton's handling of
Y2K legislation Thursday and promised lower taxes and easier
immigration rules for the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic response by the 500 high-tech executives
demonstrated that Democrat front-runner Al Gore's grip on the
prosperous region is less than firm, despite years of careful
political cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times during his three-day trip to
California, Bush tailored his basic stump speech for an industry
that ``speaks to the spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It not only talks about the new technologies that shape our
lives,'' he said, ``but it speaks about daring and enterprise and
the ultimate American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The special attention seemed to thrill many in the audience, who
paid $1,000 apiece to eat quiche with Bush. The Texas governor has
collected more than $5 million during his three-day swing through
California.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of slippage for Gore was the presence of Halsey Minor,
chief executive officer of C-Net, who had hosted a ``Gore Tech''
event for the vice president at his San Francisco mansion less than
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another was Meg Whitman, CEO of eBay, who only two weeks ago
appeared at Gore's side at a symposium on welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, there's a viable Republican candidate,''
Whitman said in explaining her presence. She said that she has not
yet decided whom to support and that, like many of her colleagues,
she has donated to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she was trying to understand Bush's positions on
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Randlett, Democratic consultant for Technology Network, an
industry lobbying group that includes donors to both parties, said
Bush's effective fund raising _ a record $36.3 million _ is worse
news for his GOP rivals than for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign spokesman, Roger Salazar, said the vice
president has strong support in the high-tech industry and was not
concerned about Bush's money-raising prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much on target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's overflowing bank account attracted the attention of
President Clinton, who said in Washington, ``Money may be
important, but ideas are even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush may choose to forgo federal matching funds, which would
cost his campaign about $16.8 million in federal dollars but allow
him to raise and spend as much as he wants from individual donors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said such a decision by Bush would show that the Texas
Republican is ``hostile'' to campaign finance reform. ``The
American people will have to make up their minds about whether this
is an important issue or not,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   During a fund-raising event Thursday in Palo Alto, Calif., that
drew high-profile Silicon Valley executives, Bush got a little
ahead of himself. He told the crowd he had been to California
before but that this is ``my first trip as president of the United
States.'' He quickly caught himself and corrected, ``the soon-to-be
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush underscored his record in his state's own
burgeoning technology industry and called for charter schools, free
trade and loosening restrictions on encryption software.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast with Gore, the Texas governor labeled Y2K
lawsuits ``the ambulance chase of the millennium'' _ a statement
that drew cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments were timely as Congress approved Thursday
protections for companies against lawsuits stemming from year 2000
computer breakdowns _ legislation that Clinton had threatened to
veto but now will sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this administration, wisdom comes so rarely that we
should not complain when it comes too late,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also addressed a roster of other technology issues, calling
for a permanent research and development tax credit and an increase
in the number of H1B visas, which would allow high-tech firms to
import highly skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   On technology exports, Bush said ``our current system doesn't
work.'' He said America must devise better ways to protect
sensitive military technology, without hamstringing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Bush's first official visit to Silicon Valley as
a candidate was stunning to some insiders, who noted that Gore has
visited the increasingly important region nearly every month and
met with industry leaders for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been out here, but in reality, Bush can walk the walk
and talk the talk,'' said Brian Halla, CEO of National
Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-tech leaders also said that they have been
disillusioned with the Clinton-Gore administration's response to
key valley issues _ and that Gore's exclusive meetings with
industry insiders may even have fostered some resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech community is very savvy, and there are issues
that Clinton-Gore have not supported, like easing the regulation on
encrypted products,'' and tort reform, said Christine Hughes, a
vice president at San Jose-based Secure Computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are gravitating to an inclusionary candidate,'' she
said. ``Bush is not just holding sessions with the same cast of
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bartz, CEO of Autodesk Inc. of San Rafael _ who, as one of
the industry's star female executives, has been wooed by both sides
_ raised her eyebrows when asked about Gore's celebrated savvy in
the Valley. ``People are real excited about some change,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp hinted that more surprises may be in store. ``I
think you're going to see some surprising things and more big-name
defections,'' said economist Michael Boskin, one of Bush's
``kitchen cabinet'' advisers from the Stanford-based Hoover
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's biggest accomplishment this week may have been his
success in grabbing the ``new money'' that Silicon Valley's
fledgling political donors represent, said venture capitalist and
Bush supporter Floyd Kvamme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley is 15 percent Democrat, 10 percent Republican
and,'' said Kvamme, ``75 percent wish-it-would-all-go-away.''

`NEW DEMOCRATS' WOO HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Making their third annual Silicon Valley pilgrimage
next week, members of the burgeoning ``New Democrat'' House
coalition declared Thursday that they seek _ without apology _ to
reposition the Democratic Party as high-tech's top ally.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians are practically tripping over themselves
to court the high-tech industry, with the Democrats' visit coming
on the heels of the House Republicans' unveiling last week of their
``e-Contract,'' a 10-point legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' visit will , which includes an all-day session
Friday in San Francisco where C-net co-founder Shelby Bonnie will
lead a tour of his company, comes on the heels of the House
Republicans' unveiling last week of their ``e-Contract,'' a
10-point legislative agenda aimed squarely at wooing Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're both going after the same girl to some extent,''
conceded Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington. But, he added, ``There's no
such thing as a low-tech district'' in Congress anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cal Dooley, a Democrat from Visalia, Calif., who heads the
group, insisted that the high-tech community has more in common
with Democrats, at least the new variety.
</P>
<P>
   Techies, he maintained, are generally a young and socially
liberal set that gets turned off by Republican jihads on guns and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are just not in sync with them,'' Dooley said.
``Democrats can provide leadership on business and economic issues,
and (the high-tech community) is much, much more comfortable with
us on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans point out that if young techies are concerned
about social issues, they're even more concerned about such
fundamental GOP principles as low taxes, low regulation and
protection from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican and former Democrat,
laughed when he heard about the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they going to take their trial lawyer friends with them?''
Tauzin asked. ``Are they going to take the FCC regulators, the
local taxing authorities, the immigration and control board and the
State Department officials who won't let them export encryption
technology?''
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrat coalition, founded in part by Bill Clinton
before he became president, has grown to 63 members, including
Ellen Tauscher, Anna Eshoo and Mike Thompson, all representatives
from the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make no apologies for trying to reposition the Democratic
Party,'' Dooley said. Noting that many coalition members were
elected within the last four years, Dooley said the party ``is
going through its own ideological and generational changes'' that
take into account ``a sensibility toward the new economy and new
economy workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats got ahead in courting high tech with the Clinton-Gore
campaign in 1992. Gore touted the ``Information Superhighway'' long
before most politicians took notice and has been a staunch
supporter ever since, making at least 30 trips to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin conceded that Silicon Valley ``correctly gives Gore
credit for paying them attention sooner rather than later, and
that's fine.'' But, he said, Democrats ``talk the talk,'' but
Republicans ``walk the walk'' and ``can understand their issues and
won't side against them when it comes time to deciding whether the
labor unions and the lawyers are running the process here in
Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and New Democrats say their voting records
prove their superior devotion. The Information Technology Industry
Council, which represents more than two dozen large computer,
software and telecommunications companies, actually surveyed nine
congressional votes 1997 and 1998, including securities litigation
reform, ``fast track'' trade negotiating authority, H1B immigrant
visa expansion, and export controls on encryption technology.
</P>
<P>
   The tally showed House Democrats with a slight edge _ 14 with
``perfect'' pro-industry voting records, versus 12 Republicans.
California Democrats Dooley, Eshoo, Tauscher and San Jose's Zoe
Lofgren all got perfect scores, along with Southern California
Republicans Brian Bilbray, Mary Bono and David Dreier. The
breakdown was more lopsided in the Senate, where 17 Republicans got
perfect scores, versus 14 Democrats. Neither of California's two
senators, Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, made the
list.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, there are plenty of signs that more and more
politicians from both parties will be voting with high tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that policymakers are leery of killing the goose
that lays the golden eggs,'' said Ed Gillespie, a former top aide
to House Majority Leader Dick Armey who now lobbies for TechNet,
the Silicon Valley lobbying powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley is not only creating jobs in Silicon Valley,
it's creating wealth that is being broadly dispersed in the
economy,'' he said. ``People's college funds, their 401K retirement
funds are getting stuffed fatter and fatter with the gains
generated from the high-tech sector of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin said Washington's sudden interest reflects ``the fact
that Congress and the high-tech community are interfacing finally.
We're finally plugging into each other's ports. It's natural for
both parties to do what the parties are doing.''

 UC ACCUSED OF OVERBILLING U.S. FOR RESEARCHERS  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of California overcharged the federal government
by almost $24 million for research by graduate students during the
past three years, according to a new report by Congress'
investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong General Accounting Office investigation of payments
since 1996 concluded that the university has improperly compensated
graduate student researchers $23.7 million more than allowed under
federal guidelines from the $201 million it billed for federally
sponsored research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our review of the compensation paid to GSRs for
services charged to federal research grants, we found that these
payments sometimes exceeded the allowable costs that could be
charged to such grants,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report has prompted calls in Congress for stricter rules in
disbursement of grants for research financed at universities across
the nation by federal agencies such as the National Institutes of
Health and the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   But UC attorney Chris Patti disputed the report's conclusions as
flawed and said the university was audited in 1997 by the
Department of Health and Human Services without any allegations of
wrongdoing in graduate student compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly disagree with the report,'' he said. ``The only
limit on what you are allowed to charge is this vague standard on
what is reasonable compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report _ released Thursday _ says the National
Institutes of Health has grant guidelines that the university
violated by paying graduate students working on federal projects
more than first-year researchers who have already earned their
doctoral degrees. UC thus improperly charged the government $19.3
million for the compensation, it said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report says the university gave $4.4 million in
``unreasonable compensation'' to graduate students by paying them
more than the $23,000 then allowed per student. The rate was raised
to $26,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   At Berkeley in 1997, 3.4 percent of the graduate student
researchers received more than the standard from grant money,
including one who was compensated $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Patti said the grants allow for some flexibility in how
funds are spent on a project.
</P>
<P>
   He said the report also underestimated the salary of qualified
researchers with doctoral degrees by 10 percent because
investigators used a base salary that few are paid. In addition,
they counted the fringe benefits _ tuition or fee remission _ for
graduate students but not the medical and other benefits that post
doctoral researchers get.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are comparing apples and oranges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also raises questions about whether the university
has underreported the taxable compensation paid to graduate
students, who get tuition or fee waivers in addition to wages.
</P>
<P>
   It says the university treats the salary and tuition and fee
remissions as compensation to be reimbursed with grant funding, but
reports only the salaries to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The report declines to make a conclusion on the issue, but
critics say the university is trying to double-dip from federal
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patti notes the report includes statements from both
the Internal Revenue Service and the National Institutes of Health
that imply there are no inconsistencies in the way the university
has been treating tuition waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The report mentions another university practice that critics say
is unethical. Students are supposed to be compensated for work
performed, but the university gives foreign students a
proportionally larger share of fee and tuition payments because
they pay a higher nonresident tuition, raising costs for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   While foreign students represented 21 to 24 percent of the
graduate student researchers at the university's campuses from 1985
to 1998, the report says they received 34 to 39 percent of the
$38.6 million charged to federal research grants for tuition and
fee remission.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that those students take their skills back to
their home countries after they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley,cq &LR;  R-Va.,
commissioned the report in response to allegations that surfaced in
a 1996 whistle-blower lawsuit that six of the nine UC campuses
recouped tuition that had been waived for graduate students by
billing the federal government for research contracts. He is now
calling for a strictly defined set of rules on compensation of
graduate student researchers from federal grants, and has asked for
a report on progress toward that goal by September 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``This compensation scheme is a misuse of government funds,''
Bliley said in a statement. ``It is a disturbing example of how
weak guidance in federal programs can lead to waste and abuse by
the recipients of those programs.''

 &HT;    Jarrett is halfway home with biggest lead of year
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daytona Beach, Fla. _ The way NASCAR driver Dale Jarrett figures
it, he probably has lost four or five layers of skin from the heel
of the foot he rests on the hot floorboard of his No. 88 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare himself for the nearly unbearable temperatures he
endures every week during a Winston Cup race, Jarrett installed a
sauna in his home in Hickory, N.C. Twice a week, he turns the
temperature to 120 degrees and stays inside the sauna for about an
hour. And he avoids cool temperatures at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm with my family, that's one thing,'' Jarrett said, ``but
otherwise, I'll never be in a car with air-conditioning. And if I
get in a restaurant that's cold, I'll leave. I'm really not doing
myself any favors by staying in cold air.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, 42, won't have to worry about cooling off anytime soon.
He'll face plenty of heat during the next five months, as he tries
to maintain a 157-point lead in the Winston Cup standings.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's main challengers _ Bobby Labonte, Mark Martin, Jeff
Burton, Jeff Gordon and rookie Tony Stewart all are within 400
points _ begin their second-half assaults in Saturday night's Pepsi
400 at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of the season, you just kind of position
yourself to try and win the championship, and the second half is
where you try to capitalize from what you learned in the first
half,'' said Jarrett, who has held the points lead for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, over the last three years, the second half of the
season has been a better part of the season for us, but it's gonna
have to be pretty good to be better than our first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Through 16 of 34 races, Jarrett has two victories and 12
top-five finishes. He finished outside the top 10 only twice _ 37th
after wrecking in the season-opening Daytona 500 and 11th in the
Las Vegas 400, the third event.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's current points lead is the largest any driver has held
this season, and he seems to be getting stronger. Both of his
victories came in the last six races, and he started sixth or
better in three of the last four events.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's recent run _ fifth at Dover, first at Michigan, third
at Pocono and sixth at Sears Point _ offset a serious challenge by
Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup champion. Gordon had one
victory and three runner-up finishes in June, but gained only 40
points on Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the scenario better when (someone else) goes home and
cusses me, instead of me going home and cussing him,'' Jarrett
said. ``We've known what it's like the last few years to really run
good and not gain any points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a good roll right now'' he said, ``and hopefully we
can continue that. We want to be out front, and we want to make
those guys chase us. We know there's still a long way to go,
because it's a long season where a lot of things can happen, but we
also realize that right now we're kind of controlling things. We'll
enjoy it while we can. I don't know how long it will last.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, only three drivers who led the points standings
with 18 races remaining won the Winston Cup championship _ Dale
Earnhardt in '91 and '93 and Gordon in '97. Only Earnhardt's
209-point lead on Rusty Wallace in 1993 was larger than Jarrett's
at this point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jarrett's) running good, and they're finishing good,'' Gordon
said. ``It's quite a lot of points that we have to close. I'm not
saying we're out of it. We're just going to keep doing what we've
been doing and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gordon trailed Jeremy Mayfield by 36 points with 18
races left, but Gordon won the title by 364 points over
second-place Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gordon, who is fifth in points and trails Jarrett by 314,
says it could take a complete collapse by the drivers in front of
him for him to win his third title in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematically, we can still win the championship,'' Gordon
said. ``There are going to have to be a lot of things that happen
first to win the championship this year. We need to keep doing what
we're doing. If we can keep that up, then the other thing that
would have to happen is that Jarrett, Burton, Labonte and Martin
would all have to have problems. ... Those things are not likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Ned Jarrett, a former driver who won 50 Winston Cup races in 14
seasons, says his son's close finishes in the past _ Dale Jarrett
finished third, second and third in points the past three seasons _
have taught him patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly feels better than he's ever felt before, because
he's never been in this position,'' Ned Jarrett said. ``But he also
realizes that there are things that can happen and that things can
get turned around even quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made mistakes over the years and the team has made
mistakes over the years that maybe cost him a shot at the
championship,'' his father said. ``They've learned from those
mistakes. I think he's confident in his abilities and confident in
his team's ability to get the job done.''

GETTING GRAPHIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Deletes reference to the ViRGE chip in the 5th graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like most journalists, I'm irresistibly drawn to tales of
conflict. I reveled in the browser wars between Microsoft Corp. and
Netscape Communications Corp. I thrill to Advanced Micro Devices
Inc.'s desperate campaign to seize a share of the microprocessor
market from mighty Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer blood-on-the-wallpaper viciousness, it's hard to
top the competition in 3D graphic accelerators _ the chips that let
fans of computer games like Quake slaughter one another with
maximum realism.
</P>
<P>
   Good computer 3D used to cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Today it's so cheap any home PC owner can afford it, and it's
getting cheaper and better by the month. Unlike the processor chip
market, where everybody waits for the next new idea from Intel,
there are a host of firms all trying different techniques to serve
up better graphics at lower cost. The result is a market that
resembles an old ``Mad Max'' movie. It's an apocalyptic struggle of
all against all, where even the product names radiate an aura of
menace.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, a firm called Cirrus Logic Inc.
practically owned the market. Today, the company barely has a
pulse.S3 Inc. dominated for a while, then cratered last year when
the public rejected the company's Savage 3D products. Up came ATI
Technologies Inc. of Canada, with its Rage accelerators. But ATI's
reign is now imperiled by 3Dfx Interactive Inc., whose Voodoo 3
products are presently number one at retail stores. And S3, once
given up for dead, is launching a massive counterattack with its
new Savage 4 chip, which is getting good early reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in this fearsome struggle are those who do the best
job of deceiving the rest of us. Graphic accelerators draw images
on a flat, two-dimensional computer screen that appear to have the
three-dimensional depth of the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Any sketch artist can trick your eye by drawing two-dimensional
objects that seem to have depth. A computer can do the same. But
what if you want to create the illusion of 3D images that move?
Your problem suddenly becomes a few million times more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Just move your own head and you'll see why. The relative
position of everything in the room changes, because your point of
view has changed. The only way a computer can emulate this effect
is by recalculating the position of every single dot of light on
the screen, using extremely complex math equations to make it all
look right.
</P>
<P>
   It gets far, far worse if you want the objects to move quickly
and smoothly, because then the computer must make all of these
calculations almost instantly. As a Quake player runs down a
virtual corridor, his computer must redraw every image on the
screen dozens of times a second, with no flicker, no delay.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop microprocessors couldn't begin to handle this kind of
load. So graphics firms make chips designed solely to do
three-dimensional math. They run at speeds once found only in Cray
supercomputers, yet graphics cards using these chips generally cost
well below $200.
</P>
<P>
   And as the leaders keep introducing newer and better chips, the
smaller players find it ever harder to keep up. A few years ago,
Number Nine Visual Technologies in Lexington seemed to be within
striking distance of the top-tier graphics players. Today, Number
Nine is only number 31 in market share, according to PC Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the company hopes to pick up a few share points by basing
fewer products on its own accelerator chip and building more of
them around the Savage 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a smaller company, it's hard for us to come out with a
sustainable product,'' said general manager William Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Number Nine, I got a glimpse of the
company's Savage 4 board working its magic on Quake. The 3D images
had all the murky grimness anyone could want, with smooth,
realistic movement. The price seemed even more impressive _ $109
list.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, compared with the computer images in films like ``Toy
Story'' or the new ``Star Wars,'' the Savage 4 and its desktop
rivals are still at the Model T stage.
</P>
<P>
   So graphics chip makers continue their relentless campaign of
improvements, constantly leapfrogging their rivals with even better
performance. It's like one of those computer games where victory
simply means staying alive _ my favorite kind.

 &HT;    Cow books and a few to take to the beach
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Two recent photography books crossed my
path the other day, courtesy of the publisher who hopes for a kind
word in this column. I'm happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs in both were taken by Kathleen Jo Ryan, a
Washington-state based photographer. ``Texas Cattle Barons: Their
Families, Land and Legacy'' is a handsome coffee-table book with a
foreword by Tommy Lee Jones and essays by Elmer Kelton, a fine
novelist and author of the classic, ``The Time It Never Rained.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelton's book about the 1950s drought is one of my favorites,
one of the few novels I've read more than once, along with ``All
The King's Men'' by Robert Penn Warren and ``Prince of Tides'' by
Pat Conroy. The fact that he wrote the essays for ``Cattle Barons''
was incentive enough to take a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   The book depicts through Ryan's photos and Kelton's essays the
stories of 13 modern cattle ranches, in South Texas, the Panhandle,
Big Bend Country _ with only one in our neck of the woods: Broseco
Ranch near Clarksville.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are somewhat uneven. All in color, more than a
few are absolutely gorgeous, but there are also a few that should
have been culled because of exposure or composition problems.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the best of the photographs make up for the mediocre,
like a two-page horizontal shot of a cowboy getting ready to rope a
calf at 6666 Ranch in the Panhandle, or the photo of a woman
watching a thunderstorm in the distance while checking the goats at
her South Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Kelton's essays, like his novels, are straightforward, sparely
written and contain a minimum of hyperbole. This is straight
journalism, enlivened by the words of these ranchers, most of whom
are third-or-fourth generation cattlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Primo Walker of the Vaquillas Ranch saying, ``We're
cattle people. The stock market is not real. Everything is floating
on computer screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest one get too romantic, Kelton is quick to point out that
ranching is very much a business, and those who survive learn to
adapt to the times. As Mike Gibson of the 6666 Ranch points, out,
``We have to watch everything very closely. It used to be that
you'd pretty much run a ranch out of the daybook in your shirt
pocket. Not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the ranches featured are owned by men who made their
money somewhere else: West Texan Clayton Williams Jr., who got rich
in oil and gas and ran unsuccessfully for governor against Ann
Richards in 1990; and Nolan Ryan, future Hall-of-Famer, who has a
spread outside Alvin, south of Houston. It certainly helps to
survive in ranching if one has another source of income to get
through the hard times, like the drought last year _ which was when
this book was compiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Cattle Barons'' (192 pages, $49.95) is published by Ten
Speed Press of Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Also from Ten Speed Press comes a companion book in softcover:
``Deep in the Heart of Texas: Texas Ranchers in Their Own Words''
($24.95, 158 pages.), photographed and compiled by Kathleen Jo
Ryan. Shot entirely in black-and-white and reproduced in deep
selenium tones, the photography appears stronger, though my
prejudice for black-and-white over color probably comes to play
here.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan talks extensively to the ranch owners of the same outfits
featured in ``Cattle Barons.'' The talk is more technical _ pasture
rotation, sources of outside income, the differences between
raising cattle in West Texas and East Texas _ but it's a good
companion piece to ``Cattle Barons,'' especially as a gift to that
wanna-be cattle raiser who's looking to buy a little spread and
raise some Hereford cross.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I got that itch out of my system some years ago.
I'll settle for looking at the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while we're talking about books, here are a few
summertime reading suggestions if you're on vacation, roasting your
skin on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jacquelyn Mitchard had a blockbuster debut with ``Deep End of
the Ocean,'' the story of a mother searching for her young son
who's snatched away in a hotel lobby. ``The Most Wanted,'' her
second novel now out in paperback, is set in Texas outside of San
Antonio and features a 15-year-old girl who marries an older
inmate, the female attorney who helps her to do so, and what
happens when the inmate escapes from prison and comes after his new
bride and her baby. It's one of those books that you'll get a
sunburn reading on the beach, because it's nearly impossible to put
down. Mitchard, a syndicated columnist based in Milwaukee, is
obviously a newcomer to Texas, but except a few exaggerated
attempts at capturing our dialect, the book is engrossing and
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anna Quindlen used to write a column for The New York Times
before taking up fiction writing full-time, and ``Black and Blue,''
her latest in paperback, is a heartbreaking story of a woman trying
to escape an abusive husband. She and her young son flee New York
for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a cheerful book, but it is skillfully done. Quindlen
is quickly establishing herself in a class along with a very few
female American writers _ Anne Tyler, to name one. Oprah picked it
for her book club, which is good enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   _The above novels can be found in the supermarket or any
bookstore, but you might have to order ``Sugar Land,'' the second
novel by Joni Rogers (Spinsters Ink, Duluth, Minn.) It tells the
story of two Texas sisters who used to be singing sensations as
kids, ala Leanne Rimes. Now they're approaching middle age, are
married to dootbrains and trying to figure out exactly what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar Land'' is funny and heartbreaking at times, with some
priceless one-liners that sound exactly like a big-haired Texas
girl had uttered them.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy your summer reading and don't forget the sunblock.

 &HT;    There's more to remember
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A recent column on they way things used to be
really struck a chord with readers. I've been flooded with notes,
letters and e-mails from folks around the courner and across the
country who remember the way were.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hammer from Salida, Calif., wrote: ``I'm closing in on 55
years of scattered memories, here's a few that I recall:''
</P>
<P>
   Going into a small Texaco gas station that sold bread, milk,
butter _ the essentials and coming out with a quart of milk and a
loaf of bread for two-bits (that's where I learned what two-bits
meant).
</P>
<P>
   When TV meant one channel and 5-6 hours of broadcast time each
day.
</P>
<P>
   When the first color broadcast was, ``sing-a-long with Mitch''
and we watched it!
</P>
<P>
   When potato chips came in a cardboard box with no other
wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   When getting a ``swat'' from the coach meant you had slightly
misbehaved.
</P>
<P>
   When buying a TV that cost almost as much as the family car and
had only 12 channels on the tuner.
</P>
<P>
   I earned 25 cents a week and that 25 cents got me into the movie
(news, cartoon, feature and serial) plus a candy bar with 10 cents
left over for a comic book and more candy.

   ``I really enjoyed remembering the old days. I was born in '65

same idea.''
</P>
<P>
   No caller ID so when someone called a store and asked if ``they
have Prince Albert in a can,'' the call couldn't be traced.
</P>
<P>
   When the cable boxes came into style, they went up to like 60 or
so channels and we would have to stand there and switch through
each channel _ no remote.
</P>
<P>
   Being worried about my ``permanent school record.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering when there was no PG-13 movies, just PG.
</P>
<P>
   Trick-or-treating when there were only a few teens who tried to
pass off as a little kid.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't hear about people breaking into cars to steal a
stereo system with an 8 track.
</P>
<P>
   The antics of the worst-behaved kid in the class back then would
be laughed at nowdays.
</P>
<P>
   My children aren't scared of the same shows that terrified me at
their age.
</P>
<P>
   Having the checker at the grocery store look for the price on
the product before ringing it up.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna and Al Rochelle, mimig(at)clarksville.net sent along these
remembrances:
</P>
<P>
   When you could mail 11 letters for $.33.
</P>
<P>
   When people respected police and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   When the most popular drugs were aspirin and Black Draught.
</P>
<P>
   When farm implement power ran on corn and hay.
</P>
<P>
   When smoking was socially acceptable and homosexuality wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   When the banks paid you for your checking account business and
supplied checks.
</P>
<P>
   When welfare and bankruptcy were considered to be social
stigmas.
</P>
<P>
   When mothers actually cooked supper from scratch and didn't take
special orders.
</P>
<P>
   When pickup trucks were only bought and used for work purposes.
</P>
<P>
   When no self-respecting female would be caught dead driving a
pickup, Jeep or other SUV.
</P>
<P>
   When the USA produced more things than it consumed.
</P>
<P>
   When items for sale in a store had price tags on them.
</P>
<P>
   When an automobile didn't cost more than most houses.
</P>
<P>
   When the high school building was bigger than its parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   When teachers drove better cars than the students.
</P>
<P>
   When you wanted sweetener on your cereal, you had to put it on.
</P>
<P>
   When walking was a principal means of getting somewhere _ not an
exercise routine.
</P>
<P>
   When high school graduates could read and write _ at grade
level.
</P>
<P>
   When there was only one telephone in the house, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Send me your thoughts on the way we were and I'll print more.

 &HT;    Don't sleep on drive-in movies
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As the credits rolled on the new ``Tarzan''
movie, the kids in the row in front of us at the drive-in clambered
on top of the van, beat their chests and belted out a lusty Tarzan
yell.
</P>
<P>
   I nudged Jim and said with satisfaction, ``I have a feeling
we're not at Showcase any more.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't have stadium seating and 16 screens, but only at the
drive-in can you bellow the Tarzan yell. Only at the drive-in can
you pack the kids in the car in their PJs. Only at the drive-in can
you say what you like without being shushed. Only at the drive-in
can half the family fall asleep and snore with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   The cinemas can be comfortable, luxurious even, but going to the
drive-in can still be an event, an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   They seem so much a part of the landscape of another era, you
almost forget they're there. Until summer comes, the new Disney
movie arrives, and it's time for the drive-in.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you have to remind yourself to go. The typical
drive-in is a mom-and-pop operation, with a limited advertising
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get there, you wonder why you don't go more often. It's
a chance to relive your own childhood while creating memories for
your kids.
</P>
<P>
   Jim grew up in one of those draconian households where soda pop
and candy were not distributed liberally. Bedtimes and behavioral
codes were strictly enforced. The one exception: drive-in nights.
The Coke was put on ice, the candy bars packed, the popcorn popped
over the stove (none of that namby-pamby microwave stuff) and
stashed in brown paper bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the drive-in had a Christmas feeling to it,'' Jim
said, ``a feeling of something out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd get into his PJs and vow not to fall asleep, to make it
through the late-late feature. By the beginning of the second
feature, he invariably crashed in the back of the station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   There are those (SET ITAL) other (END ITAL) drive-in memories,
of course, which Jim and I, high school wallflowers that we were,
failed to take proper advantage of. ``It was an adventure to go to
the drive-in, even more so on a date,'' recalled one friend.
``Being a Catholic girl, I started much too late, but going to the
drive-in turned into a coming-of-age rite for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive-in audience seems to be mostly families these days,
with a minimum of the passion-pit activity so common in my high
school years. A scientific survey of my high school-age baby
sitters confirmed my hypothesis: Kids may go together in groups,
but the drive-in is no longer a hot date ticket. Too many bugs, too
few screens.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, there is talk of a drive-in revival, but
local and national trends indicate otherwise. Two years ago, the
Belmont Auto Drive-In breathed its last, after 50 years in
business. Today, only the Dixie Drive-In, the Melody 49 Twin
Drive-In, the Skyborn Cruise-In near Fairborn and the Park Lane
Drive-in are left.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids told me they had never been to the drive-in. Maybe the
drive-in movie _ a tradition begun 66 years ago this summer in
Camden, N.J. _ will slowly go the way of the silent movie.
</P>
<P>
   I hope not. This summer, do your part to keep this piece of
Americana alive. Make one less trip to the multiplex and visit an
old friend.
</P>
<P>
   All in favor, give a Tarzan yell.

 &HT;    A store of Southern heritage
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ The older we get, the wiser we get, at
least in some respects. One thing we learn is to be careful about
ranking people. So I won't say that Gene Asher is my most loyal
friend, and about the finest human being I know.
</P>
<P>
   What I can say is that if I made up such a list, Gene would rank
very, very high. He would also rank high on a lot of other people's
lists. He has been collecting friends since before Tech High School
in Atlanta through the University of Georgia, the sports
departments of both The Atlanta Journal and Constitution and a
career in insurance, Korea and the Marines, where he rose to the
rank of colonel.
</P>
<P>
   In youth he was a better-than-average amateur boxer. As a child
prodigy he toured Georgia theaters giving Al Jolson impersonations,
his mother at the piano. He can still be persuaded to do a few
Jolson numbers on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost 10 years ago when he invited me to lunch, to hear
one of his ideas. He wanted to start a newspaper, something not
easy to do, as a lot of dreamers have discovered on the way to
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Before lunch was over he had sketched out a table of contents
and the newspaper had a name: The Jewish Georgian.
</P>
<P>
   Most new publications have a short lifespan. But they don't have
Gene Asher for a founding editor and publisher. The Jewish
Georgian, 10 years old next year, is alive and well, although Gene
has semiretired to the position of consulting editor and columnist.
</P>
<P>
   I pick up a copy whenever I can. The newspaper is exactly what
he intended it to be: a warm and upbeat celebration of Jewish life
in Georgia, present and past. I recently read his story about
Charles Harris, a South Georgia icon from Ocilla, who has been
chairman of the Board of Regents and who in World War II commanded
the Navajo Talkers, a platoon of combat radiomen who communicated
in their native language, totally baffling Japanese eavesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue features the Alexander family, descended from a
Revolutionary War hero and the only American-born Jew among
Atlanta's pre-Civil War pioneers. The Alexanders are now
sixth-generation Atlantans. Cecil Alexander, a Distinguished Flying
Cross Marine pilot in World War II, headed the architectural team
that built Atlanta Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Georgian is a reminder of how much Jewish history is
a part of our Southern heritage, especially in rural areas. Every
small town had a ``Jew Store'' selling ``small dry goods,'' mostly
needles, thread, buttons, clothing: household items on the shopping
lists of those not overly affluent. Ours in Fayetteville belonged
to Mr. Rosenbloom.
</P>
<P>
   Most Jew Stores are gone, or have grown into much larger
operations, like Charles Harris' in Ocilla. Some became Rich's and
Macy's and Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   The Jew Store is a Southern icon that shouldn't be forgotten,
and now, according to the Jewish Georgian, it isn't. Stella
Suberman, whose father was a small dry goods merchant in a small
Tennessee town, has written a book: ``The Jew Store.'' When Cecile
Waronker, who reviewed it, tried to buy a copy at an Atlanta
bookstore, the clerk misunderstood. She began a computer search for
``The Juice Store.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Simons was sold out when I inquired. The store owner said
it's becoming a classic, and that first editions are going to be
very valuable. Anybody who has been sent by a grandmother to buy
buttons or bobbins, or a spool of thread for a foot-pedaled Singer
sewing machine, ought to have a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Barnesville have a Jew Store?'' I asked an elderly friend,
Capt. Alex Moye. ``Of course,'' he said. ``It only closed this
year.'' Neither Alex nor I, when we were growing up on the farm,
knew why the Jew Store was called the Jew Store. I thought it just
another shopping stop, like Custard Mize's store, or McElwaney's,
or John M. Jackson's, where we bought on credit to be paid off when
cotton was picked, ginned and sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jew Store'' is a funny, poignant, revealing account of a
family living in a small town, separated from neighbors by
religion, by country of origin; trying to make a living and a life;
being accepted but not totally accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The book made me think of the Jewish family from south Fayette
County. The grandfather walked dirt roads with his backpack,
selling ``small dry goods'' to farm wives. One of his
granddaughters taught with my mother at the Woolsey school. Her
brother, after finishing business college, had to change his name
to get a job in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waronke, the Jewish Georgian reviewer, grew up in Clio,
S.C., (pop. 1,000), where her father owned the Jew Store. She wrote
about an Indian who came in needing long underwear for the winter,
but could afford only a pair of overalls and 25-cent socks. She
watched her father reach under the counter and discreetly roll and
wrap a pair of long johns inside the overalls, careful not to
injure his customer's pride. I don't think they do that at the big
discount stores in our nice new malls.

   WACO, Texas _ Operating a motor vehicle is a privilege, not a
right.
</P>
<P>
   That's often repeated and assumed to be true.
</P>
<P>
   After all, while the Constitution gives Americans the right to
own and use guns, it doesn't say a word about the right of
Americans to own and drive cars.
</P>
<P>
   A nitpicker might point out that the founders didn't make it a
right to own and drive cars because cars wouldn't be invented for
another 100 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, the founders also didn't give Americans the
right to fly planes or keep and bear nuclear weapons, unless an
argument can be made that the right to keep and bear arms includes
atomic bombs and planes are needed to fly these personal weapons to
selected targets.
</P>
<P>
   While the framers of the Constitution couldn't have known what a
car was, they knew good and well what a gun was.
</P>
<P>
   Guns were the most modern, sophisticated and deadly weapons
available to the human race in the last quarter of the 18th
century. The founders used them to overthrow their legitimate
government and establish a new government more to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Every American who celebrates the July 4 holiday has to be
thankful that the founders had access to the guns that were needed
to win this nation's independence.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the founders couldn't have foreseen the invention of
the automobile, they also couldn't have foreseen the invention of
tanks, shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, flamethrowers or easily
concealed machine pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Pro- and anti-gun Americans will probably be arguing what the
founders meant for the next 100 Independence Days.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, I'm more interested in what the founders might have
said about the right of citizens to drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some people say that driving a car is a privilege and
not a right because they believe that the only rights Americans
have are those spelled out in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly a point of view. But without access to cable
TV, telephones and the Psychic Hotline, that reasoning puts a heavy
burden on men who could not foresee the future.
</P>
<P>
   For people who believe the Constitution a living document
subject to continued interpretation, perhaps the reason that
driving an automobile is considered a privilege and not a right is
because this activity applies only when people drive cars on public
roads, not on private land.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the argument would hold that if the public paid
for the road with tax dollars, then the public, through its
government, gets to decide who can use the road and under what
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, then what justification does the government
have to say who can fly airplanes? No tax dollars paid for the sky.
</P>
<P>
   If the sky is not publicly owned, then how can the government
require that pilots undergo rigorous training and testing before
they can fly?
</P>
<P>
   The government must have laid claim to ownership of the sky when
no one was looking.
</P>
<P>
   You can drive your new Corvette 150 mph on your own property,
but you can't pull over and fire machine guns or other
government-banned arms.
</P>
<P>
   One of this nation's greatest strengths is the ability to search
for the meaning of rights specifically granted in the Constitution,
find the limits of specifically granted rights and uncover rights
and limitations through constant interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   For my part, I think that operating a motor vehicle on a public
road is a privilege, not a right. I also believe that the
requirements to obtain a driver's license should be more like the
requirements to obtain a pilot's license. Only skilled drivers in
good physical condition should be granted the privilege to operate
a motor vehicle on a public road.

   MISTER-FAN _ When Barbara Mason spotted a Mister Fan combination
spray bottle and small fan, she remembered seeing others use
similar products and decided to buy one. Now she's sold on what
she's dubbed her ``spritzer.'' The concept is simple: Fill the
bottle with tap water and squeeze it periodically to release a fine
mist. To add to the cooling effect, there's a battery-operated fan
with an on/off button. Similar products have names such as Mist N

 &HT;    Marketing a Messiah
 &HT;    By Mark Beaver
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Got Jesus?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, I do, as a matter of fact. Thanks for inquiring. But
I must admit I resent the way you ask the question.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down Barrett Parkway north of Atlanta recently, I was
confronted by a stark, black billboard with white letters. The
billboard, etched in the same type face as the dairy
advertisements, merely substituted ``Jesus'' for ``milk.'' Simple
as that, ``Got milk?'' becomes ``Got Jesus?'' and somebody
somewhere thinks he's spreading the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   All the sudden, Christianity is sounding a lot like capitalism.
The shift started innocently enough, I suppose. First it was bumper
stickers: ``God is my co-pilot,'' ``My boss is a Jewish
carpenter,'' ``In case of rapture, this vehicle will be unmanned.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the genius of marketing, you could make a generalized
statement about your beliefs while steering your minivan through an
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Next it was WWJD bracelets. Ball caps. T-shirts. Pencils. Coffee
mugs. Etc. Seemingly, any object larger than a pinhead was posing
the question ``What Would Jesus Do?'' The purpose was genuine: In
every situation, the question reminded the Christian to ask himself
what Christ would do under the same circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, the letters, like the fish symbol on cars,
identified Christians to one another. Again, sounds legit, but the
question, I confess, made me uncomfortable, a bit suspicious. To
me, ``What Would Jesus Do?'' sounded dangerously close to a catch
phrase _ something with more style than substance.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the trend didn't last long. Lately, I'm seeing
fewer and fewer of those WWJD products. America knows a trend when
it sees one, and soon tires of it. To a public short on attention
span, the question WWJD must be replaced by a new question: WN?
What's Next?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, I found the answer on a billboard. I don't know how many
conversion experiences the ``Got Jesus?'' advertisement has
prompted, but I wouldn't set the number too high. Maybe if we gave
Jesus one of those little milk mustaches, folks would get the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Proselytizing has its place, don't get me wrong. I'm all for
witnessing. I grew up in a Baptist church. I'm the son of a Baptist
deacon. I'm not like some of the other naysayers who probably see
the billboard and mutter under their breaths about how the ``Jesus
Freaks'' are at it again.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, I appreciate a person's attempt to share his or
her faith, since religion and spirituality seem to be the only
subjects that are off limits in our society.
</P>
<P>
   But the question ``Got Jesus?'' strikes me as a concession to a
commercial culture, one that can sum up something as complex as
religious faith with a slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging religion as a product is selling it out. It suggests,
however innocently, I can drop by Winn-Dixie after work to pick up
some Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Someone's going to argue that this advertising approach is only
using our culture's means to achieve heavenly ends.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I checked, though, the Good Book told me to be ``in it
but not of it.'' We're in this world, all right _ not much we can
do about that. But instead of playing by its rules, it seems we
should try to change the rules. Rise above the rules. Gandhi did
it. The Rev. Martin Luther King did it. Oh yeah, a guy named Christ
did it, too.
</P>
<P>
   After all, at the door of heaven, I don't think saying ``I got
Jesus'' will guarantee admission. Not unless heaven is a
capitalistic economy. And despite those streets of gold, I don't
think it is.
</P>
<P>
   If religious beliefs were slogan material, if they were only
products in the marketplace, I wouldn't want any part of it. A milk
mustache is a temporal thing. Religious faith, however, has eternal
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Seems to me that some of these church billboards come closer.
Some offer quotes or Scripture. To me, quotes invite contemplation,
provoke thought, ask us to go deeper. Slogans, on the other hand,
clip investigation, curb thought.
</P>
<P>
   Got Jesus? If not, don't count on picking up a quart of him to
go with a loaf of bread. Even if you've got a coupon.

 &HT;    Vacation tips for a safe, sound home and garden
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There you are, on the beach of some tropical isle and
that long pre-vacation to-do list suddenly runs through your mind:
Did I leave enough lights on? Did I unplug the TV? Did I water the
geraniums?
</P>
<P>
   Most people know the drill before getting on the road, but with
so many tasks at hand, it never hurts to be reminded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, when people take vacations, they take more
precautions _ the kinds of things they should be doing day to
day,'' Atlanta police Inspector Juanita Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you'll need to take measures to protect your garden
so that, like your belongings, it's still around when you return.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Smith recommends for the home:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lights. Leave on exterior lights but only if they're on a
timer so that would-be burglars don't suspect you're gone. Indoor
lights also should be on timers. ``They're a must for making the
house look as lived-in as possible,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Garbage. Never leave your garbage roll cart on the street for
more than one night because it signals you're away. Ask a neighbor
to wheel it in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deliveries. Postpone mail and newspaper deliveries or ask a
neighbor to collect them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keys. Don't leave out keys, no matter how hidden you think
they are. ``Anybody can see someone stooping down to get a key from
under a flowerpot or doormat, or reaching above a door,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Answering machines. Don't advertise you're away by leaving a
recording to that effect and don't leave notes for delivery
drivers. And don't record a greeting on your phone mail at work
stating you'll be out of the office for several days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alarms. If you own a security system, make sure you have a
backup battery in case of a power outage. Also, alert your security
company and people on your emergency call list that you'll be out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   _ Neighbors. Ask neighbors to keep an eye on things. ``That way,
when a U-Haul backs up to your house, they'll know you're not
moving,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrols. Ask police to patrol your street and inspect your
property while gone. For a directed patrol, call your zone office.
</P>
<P>
   _ Appliances. Unplug appliances, such as TVs and computers, to
guard against power surges.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawns. Ask a neighbor or hire a service to mow the lawn and
trim the shrubbery if you'll be away more than a week. ``Shrubbery
should never be higher than window level because it provides a
hiding place for peeping Toms or someone to rob you at the front
door,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A garden not only can signal that homeowners are away, but it
could mean a slow death if not tended for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps to have a friend stop by frequently and check
on things,'' said Atlanta horticulturist Erica Glasener, who
travels often as host of Home &AMP; Garden Television's ``A Gardener's
Diary.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of her suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Houseplants. Place houseplants in the sink or bathtub in
several inches of water and close the curtains to keep them cool.
</P>
<P>
   _ New plants. Don't plant anything new and don't fertilize
before going out of town, when extra care and maintenance might be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trade favors. Ask a friend or neighbor to check on things
about twice a week and offer to return the favor. As a gesture of
thanks, give that person a souvenir from your trip, such as a
gardening book or a plant; or share your bounty by offering friends
their pick from your garden.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timers. Place a timer on sprinklers and soaker hoses so that
all a friend or neighbor has to do is stop by and turn on the
water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Containers. Group all pots and hanging baskets in the shade,
not only to protect them but to make it convenient for others to
water. ``That way, they won't miss anything, either,'' Glasener
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mulch. Freshen beds and containers with several inches of
mulch to help soil retain moisture and discourage weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, chill out. Now that you've taken care of things for the
home and the garden _ relax and enjoy yourself. Remember: There
will be plenty to catch up on when you get home.

 &HT;    Joinery method should suit the furniture function
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The topic is, basically, how furniture is made.
</P>
<P>
   We're discussing the fact that once certain basic principles of
joinery are understood, a woodworker can make any sort of
furniture, from a workbench to a chest of drawers, without
commercial plans or ``patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   The rant was inspired by a poor reader who sent me an e-mail
inquiring where he could get a pattern for a workbench.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain kinds of joints, chiefly the mortise and tenon
and its many variations, that are used to joint pieces of wood in a
cross-grain assembly. There are other kinds of joints used in
casework, which involves the joining of two pieces of wood in which
the grain is running in the same direction, such as a chest or a
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   The best, and the cheapest, place to learn this is in Tage
Frid's first book. Its rather cumbersome title is ``Tage Frid
teaches Woodworking: Joinery: Tools and Techniques.'' You may be
able to find it in a big bookstore. If not, you can certainly find
it in any woodworking store that stocks books.
</P>
<P>
   In this book, a fine man and a great teacher shows how to make
more joints than you'll ever need with both hand and power tools
and which should be used in any given situation. It should be the
first book in a woodworker's library.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a workbench is a special-purpose piece of furniture. It
would be a mistake to simply begin building one without learning
something about them, and the various styles in which they are
commonly constructed.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of books and many magazine articles about
workbenches. There is even a big, beautiful coffee table book about
them. Check out as many as you can _ you canfind some in your local
library.
</P>
<P>
   Certain things are true about any style. A workbench undergoes
severe stress, and it must be unwavering. One that sways or quivers
is useless. Thus it must be very heavy. It is also good to make the
lower stretchers adjustable so that any play which develops during
use may be taken out.
</P>
<P>
   The top must be absolutely flat.
</P>
<P>
   Provision must be made for at least one vise. The Scandinavian
type of bench has two vises; the standard cast iron vise at one end
of the working side, and a shop-built, integrated shoulder vise at
the other end. You can buy a hardware kit for the shoulder vise,
but making it properly is still a formidable task. This is why many
woodworkers begin with the English style bench, which has just the
cast iron vise.
</P>
<P>
   My correspondent wanted a bench with two drawers. I wouldn't
fool with drawers in a workbench, but if you really want them you
can use ordinary kitchen hardware to hang a couple under the top.
Be sure they are set an inch or two behind the top, so the pulls
don't get in your way and there's less likelihood of scraps getting
into them.
</P>
<P>
   Once you understand all the principles, and decide what you want
in the way of a workbench, you can sit down with paper and a ruler
or a simple drawing program on the computer, and make your own
dimensioned plans with notes on the construction.

   In this book, a fine man and a great teacher shows how to make
more joints than you'll ever need with both hand and power tools
and which should be used in any given situation. It should be the
first book in a woodworker's library.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a workbench is a special-purpose piece of furniture. It
would be a mistake to simply begin building one without learning
something about them, and the various styles in which they are
commonly constructed.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of books and many magazine articles about
workbenches. There is even a big, beautiful coffee table book about
them. Check out as many as you can _ you canfind some in your local
library.
</P>
<P>
   Certain things are true about any style. A workbench undergoes
severe stress, and it must be unwavering. One that sways or quivers
is useless. Thus it must be very heavy. It is also good to make the
lower stretchers adjustable so that any play which develops during
use may be taken out.
</P>
<P>
   The top must be absolutely flat.
</P>
<P>
   Provision must be made for at least one vise. The Scandinavian
type of bench has two vises; the standard cast iron vise at one end
of the working side, and a shop-built, integrated shoulder vise at
the other end. You can buy a hardware kit for the shoulder vise,
but making it properly is still a formidable task. This is why many
woodworkers begin with the English style bench, which has just the
cast iron vise.
</P>
<P>
   My correspondent wanted a bench with two drawers. I wouldn't
fool with drawers in a workbench, but if you really want them you
can use ordinary kitchen hardware to hang a couple under the top.
Be sure they are set an inch or two behind the top, so the pulls
don't get in your way and there's less likelihood of scraps getting
into them.
</P>
<P>
   Once you understand all the principles, and decide what you want
in the way of a workbench, you can sit down with paper and a ruler
or a simple drawing program on the computer, and make your own
dimensioned plans with notes on the construction.

   EDITORIAL-PRAYER - If God reads all fine print, those who
portray as ``anti-prayer'' the opponents of a prayer resolution in
the House of Representatives may have some explaining to do to
their maker. For ``anti-prayer'' is not the truth. Opponents of the
resolution for a ``day of solemn prayer, fasting and humiliation
before God'' had virtuous reasons to oppose it, even as prayer and
fasting are virtues unto themselves. (Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED

Circus. (Yoakum, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN - I think that operating a motor vehicle on a
public road is a privilege, not a right. I also believe that the

Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED FOR
SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN - My children are bored. For a fact, I am
absolutely sure your children are bored, too. Summer boredom for
children begins roughly 30 seconds after school ends. That's right,
the same school that fills children's lips with loathing one minute
earlier. Just before school ends, children swear that they will
never return to this hell-hole. Just after the final bell rings,
they miss it terribly, though they never quite admit to that.

   MISTER-FAN _ When Barbara Mason spotted a Mister Fan combination
spray bottle and small fan, she remembered seeing others use
similar products and decided to buy one. Now she's sold on what
she's dubbed her ``spritzer.'' The concept is simple: Fill the
bottle with tap water and squeeze it periodically to release a fine
mist. To add to the cooling effect, there's a battery-operated fan
with an on/off button. Similar products have names such as Mist N
Cool and Misty Mates. Consumer column. (Dayton Daily News)

<P>
   VACATION-TIPS _ If you're one of the hundreds of families
getting ready to pack up the minivan for a summer vacation, there
are a few things you'll need to know such as: turning off the main
water valve, cleaning up the yard, etc. Our safety home/garden
story offers a checklist of things to do before hitting the road.

with paper and a ruler or a simple drawing program on the computer,
and make your own dimensioned plans with notes on the construction.
(Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVES FRIDAY.

<P>
   BOOKS-BORDERS _ ``Texas Cattle Barons: Their Families, Land and
Legacy'' by Kathleen Jo Ryan is a handsome coffee-table book. Also,
here's a few summertime reading picks. (Borders, Nacogdoches Daily
Sentinel) MOVED

<P>
   LAMB-COLUMN _ DAYTON _ We do health care a little differently
here. A market of Dayton's size can't have nationally renowned
centers for treating grave illnesses, but it can find different
ways of reaching more people and keeping them healthy. That's a
particularly valuable knack in this era of cataclysmic changes in
the way health care is delivered. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). 21.

   REDCROSS-BULLOCK _ Conversation with Steve Bullock, acting

African-American president of the Red Cross, and the first to come
from within the organization's ranks. (Henry, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>

   CURSEFREE-TV _ Less is more for many Christian homes. Now
there's a gadget that will do away with offensive words on
television and let the show go on. V-chips are out. Curse Free TV
is in. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post). 18.
</P>
<P>
   SHABBAT _ DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ ONLINE-SHABBAT _ WEST PALM BEACH,
Fla. _ Religious law bars Jews from working, driving, or even
flipping a light switch on the Sabbath. So why has an organization
dedicated to bringing Jews back into the fold released a CD-ROM to
help guide them through Sabbath rituals when a computer is required
to view it? File the answer under D, as in desperate times call for
desperate measures. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED MONDAY.

</P>
<P>
   ROCK-MUSICALS _ The 1970s were when Broadway and pop music
finished making their break. Now that they're nostalgic, but still
punchy, the pop-rock sounds of the decade are big on the London
stage and probably will be soon on America's. Dual reviews of
ABBA's ``Mamma Mia'' (thumbs up) and the Broadway-bound ``Saturday
Night Fever'' (thumbs down) in a broader critical look at the state
of rock musicals. Length includes fact box. (Hulbert, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 32. FOR SUNDAY

president, they should look no farther than Texas. Bush's record on

small-business owners feeling increasingly squeezed by high-end

   HEALTH-PLAN (San Francisco) _ Alarmed by heavy losses and jobs

million. George W. Bush didn't even hold a cardboard sign saying
``Will be whatever you want me to be for money.'' The main thing
we've learned about Bush is that he speaks fluent Spanish. But
Bush's real second language is money, the same as that other son of
privilege, Al Gore. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ An aide to Gov. George Pataki and
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have taken some shots at President
Clinton's drug czar, Barry McCaffrey. Disagree with Barry McCaffrey
on drug policy? Hey, that's fine. But trash the guy? I'll never
outgrow outrage over cheap stunts like that. By DAN LYNCH.

   NEW-DEAL (Danville, Calif.) _ It was 67 years ago that Franklin
D. Roosevelt accepted the Democratic Party's presidential
nomination and made a momentous promise: ``I pledge you, I pledge
myself, to a new deal for the American people.'' The New Deal
thrust government into everyday life. Before that, most Americans _
except during war _ rarely had dealings with Washington beyond
voting. After the New Deal, such isolation was nearly impossible.

   &UR; THE REAL ALL-STARS &LR;  &QL;

country singer/songwriter Kenny Rogers.) &QL; 
 &UR; By KENNY ROGERS &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, a living legend of country music, writes about
winning, losing and the meaning of baseball in this special column
keyed to the Baseball All-Star Game _ to be played on July 13 in
Boston _ and his new hit, ``The Greatest,'' which is about children
and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers recounts how he came to record the song, shares some
baseball-story letters he's gotten from fans and discusses what
baseball means to him in a funny, heartwarming essay that has all
the easy charm of his best songs.

AT 67, NEW DEAL REMAINS ROBUST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ It was 67 years ago that Franklin D.
Roosevelt accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination
and made a momentous promise: ``I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a
new deal for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Deal thrust government into everyday life. Before that,
most Americans _ except during war _ rarely had dealings with
Washington beyond voting. Indeed, as late as 1932, the average
citizen's only contact with the federal government was paying (or
not) his federal income tax or observing (or not) Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   After the New Deal, such isolation was nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all aspects of life _ social, economic, political _ were
subject to legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the actual legislation, however (and the myriad programs
that went with it), the New Deal changed forever how Americans
perceive government. Ever since Roosevelt, most citizens (and both
major parties) have come to believe government has a responsibility
to not only protect the public from general harm but to actively
promote its well-being and health.
</P>
<P>
   Through much of the '30s, such an activist government seemed
just what the country needed and wanted. America, four years into
the Depression, was in terrible shape when Roosevelt took office,
with 25 percent unemployment, mass layoffs, dust, drought and daily
foreclosures and bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   Some 9,000 banks had gone under after the stock market crash in
1929 _ 4,000 in the first 60 days of 1933. Starvation, despair and
talk of revolution stalked the land.
</P>
<P>
   FDR's first act as president, on March 5, 1933, was to declare a
bank holiday. For one week, the whole country ran on a cash-only
basis. It produced a camaraderie that only deepened when he held,
on March 12, the first of his ``fireside chats'' _ radio
announcements in which he reassuringly explained his goals to a
jittery public.
</P>
<P>
   During that week, Roosevelt pushed legislation through Congress
that restored the nation's faith in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   When the banks reopened _ and stayed open _ ``depositors wept,''
said one reporter. Roosevelt had, at one stroke, demonstrated the
power of the federal government. The nation's confidence, and its
spirits, soared.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next nine years, as the Depression ebbed and flowed,
the New Deal introduced a number of programs. Some faltered; others
were found unconstitutional; many survived.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the best-known survivor is Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Decried as ``destroying initiative and discouraging thrift'' and
feared because the numbering of all citizens reflected ``the lash
of the dictator,'' Social Security was to become the most popular
federal program in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   That program was a response to human misery; other New Deal
legislation was designed to prevent future misery.
</P>
<P>
   In the Depression's early years, thousands of people had lost
their savings as banks closed. To prevent a repeat, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation was set up. This insurance of bank
deposits is still in place today, and still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stock market crash was widely regarded as having
caused the Depression, the securities industry was a natural New
Deal target. In June 1934, at Roosevelt's urging, the Securities
and Exchange Commission was formed, introducing federal regulation
(and such niceties as full disclosure) to the stock market. The SEC
remains today, watchdogging the Dow and the dot.coms.
</P>
<P>
   Other New Deal legislation had little to do with ending the
Depression or preventing a new one; it was more a matter of the
federal government asserting its power because it could.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Federal Communications Commission had nothing to
do with poverty. Nor did the creative work of such artists and
actors and authors as Jackson Pollack, Orson Welles and Richard
Wright (all hired under the Works Progress Administration) do much
to enrich the nation's pocketbook, however it may have enriched its
soul.
</P>
<P>
   How much economic enriching did the New Deal actually do? Today
most economists believe the Depression ended not with the New Deal,
but when we chose to arm Britain against Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the New Deal, simply by letting Americans know that its
powerful government cared, had a profound effect on the nation's
confidence, helping us weather the crisis of a great depression
with our major institutions intact _ no mean feat with one out of
four Americans jobless and communism and fascism seeming to offer
alternate systems.
</P>
<P>
   These days, questions arise as our technology-driven ``new
economy'' collides with its New Deal legacy _ an omnipresent
government that seems to care about almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Do we need today the level of caring and government care we
needed during the '30s? Is the assistance the New Deal provided
during a stormy and terrible time useful _ or even desirable _ when
the sun comes out?

TO INSTALL OR NOT TO INSTALL, THAT IS THE QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Give it to me straight. Should I install the
Windows 98 CD that Microsoft sent me for free last July, or is
there something new out there that debugs the old stuff? Windows 95
suits my needs just fine, but you know the feeling you get when
there is an uninstalled disk sitting in your drawers!
</P>
<P>
   _Happy With 95
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HAPPY: Where I keep my disks is none of your business.
Sometimes I just like to warm them up before using them. There's
nothing wrong with that. I just have to remember to keep from
sitting down.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that the ``free'' Win98 CD actually came by way of
your computer maker, since Microsoft isn't exactly in the habit of
giving away free upgrades, as you Office 2000 upgraders are finding
out. It's pretty common practice, though, for manufacturers to cut
a deal with the Big Evil Corporation when a new version of
something is close to being ready so their customers can have the
latest and greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if you're happy with 95, just leave things the way they
are. Win98 is definitely an improvement _ thousands of bugs have
been fixed and several new features and utilities have been added _
but until Bill Gates figures out a way to put a gun to your head
and force you into it, you really don't have to upgrade, although I
understand that Microsoft Armbreaker 2000 is almost ready for
release.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm going to give you a chance to do something
for all your readers that, as far as I know, you've never done
before _ give us some actual, useful, usable information. How can I
upgrade my Windows 98 program using the Microsoft Web site?
</P>
<P>
   _Intermediate User
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INTER: Nice attitude. This is just a wild guess, but maybe
you should try following the instructions that are clearly
displayed when you click on Windows Update in the Start menu.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it feels like you're letting Big Bill rummage around
your underwear drawer, the updater is one of the nicest features
about Win98. It connects you to the Microsoft Web site, then sends
you a program that will poke around your system to see what version
of everything you have. Don't worry, you can tell it not to. Based
on what it finds, it recommends a number of updates. You pick what
you want, the download starts and you sit back with a cold one. The
downloaded stuff even installs itself.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never updated 98 at all, maybe you should consider
getting all the fixes at once by going to
www.microsoft.com/windows98/ and sending Bill 20 bucks for the
Windows 98 Second Edition upgrade. I hear he really needs the
money. He's down to his last $91 billion.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am a college student who will graduate from
Syracuse University in August. My idea is to open an online store
that allows people to purchase personal items (birth-control
devices, feminine-hygiene products, diet pills, adult diapers) from
the privacy of home. Please send me advice.
</P>
<P>

DRUG CZAR IN THE FIRING LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You're supposed to outgrow outrage.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK when you're a kid, when you still operate under the
innocent delusion that life is inherently just. But when you've
wandered around for a few more decades _ when you've seen the
extent to which human frailty and sheer, unmitigated stupidity
permeate the times in which we live _ then you're supposed to get
past outrage.
</P>
<P>
   You're supposed to adopt an attitude of cynical resignation.
Most of the time I can manage that. It's a sign of maturity, isn't
it _ the ability to live at peace with the available world?
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, though, I feel the outrage bubble up
again. It happens most often, I think, when I'm reminded of the
events of my youth. Vietnam, for instance. I've never lost my sense
of outrage over Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crummy, pointless war, a tragic, monumental
misjudgment. I opposed it and never fought in it. I spent my
military time in a nice, safe, stateside office putting out a base
newspaper. I figured I was lucky. And I was, too.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey wasn't so lucky. He was a career soldier, sworn
on his personal honor to fight in bad wars as well as good ones.
When President Clinton selected him as the nation's drug czar,
McCaffrey was the country's most decorated Army general. He had two
Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars and two Distinguished Service
Crosses. That's the nation's second-highest medal for valor in
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The other day in Albany, McCaffrey complained about the Pataki
administration's drug policies. He said they were misguided. And
Gov. George Pataki's people went right at him in response.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Lapp, Pataki's criminal justice honcho, said McCaffrey was
``ignorant'' of the situation in New York. An unnamed Pataki aide _
I could find out who, but I won't bother _ basically accused
McCaffrey of being a political operative trying to savage the
Republicans in advance of Hillary Rodham Clinton's expected Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lapp isn't a political type. She has a reputation as a capable
criminal justice technician with no partisan ax to grind. She could
have expressed her disagreement with McCaffrey in more measured
tones, I suppose, but honorable people can disagree on matters of
policy _ and do, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki aide who painted McCaffrey as a political hack,
though, that's another matter entirely. So is New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who got worked up a few months ago when McCaffrey
took issue with his stand on methadone treatment for junkies. With
typical venom, Giuliani called the general a ``disgrace` and a
``disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't heard Pataki or Giuliani do it, but other members of
their party have taken great glee in stomping all over Bill Clinton
as a draft dodger. That's fine with me, because he was.
</P>
<P>
   There's something profoundly repelling, though, about today's
politicians pretending that moral choices for young men in the
Vietnam era were as simple and uncomplicated as the choices their
fathers faced when Hitler was around. They weren't. Also, neither
Giuliani nor Pataki ever served. While McCaffrey, who's nobody's
political operative, was taking a .50-caliber bullet in his arm in
Vietnam, these guys were studying at fancy law schools. McCaffrey
bled for his country three times _ and has the Purple Hearts to
prove it _ while these wannabe tough guys were building political
careers in cushy, carpeted offices.
</P>
<P>
   Disagree with McCaffrey on drug policy? Hey, that's fine. Even
heroes can be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But to trash the guy the way Giuliani did? The way Pataki's
unnamed aide did?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but I'll never outgrow outrage over cheap stunts like
that.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The never-ending culture war
 &HT;    (Eds: This is the Teepen column that normally moves Mondays,
moving today in advance of the Monday holiday.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It only takes nanoseconds after any new item lands on the public
agenda these days before sides are chosen up and a new battle in
the culture war is declared. Consider, of all improbable matters,
urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl is an emerging concern, especially with swamped
suburbanites themselves, and not unreasonably. Suburbia has become
boundless, oozing toward the horizons with consequent increases in
air pollution and the human aggravation (and cramped family time)
born of hours spent in traffic. Center cities are left to struggle,
at huge economic and social cost to all of us. Green space is
rolled every 10 years in amounts equal to Connecticut and Rhode
Island combined.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of thought about all that would not seem to be untoward,
but if you've ever sat around with neighbors and grumbled about the
game of developer leapfrog, it may surprise you to learn you are
toying with environmental extremism, neosocialism and federal
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   All this because Vice President Al Gore a few weeks ago put
forward a modest Clinton administration proposal to help state and
local governments get a handle on growth. The key feature is a
low-cost bond program that could be used to preserve open spaces
and water resources and to leverage investment in planned growth
areas _ abandoned industrial sites, for instance. There's a boost
for public transportation, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing there is ideologically lurid. Yes, there's politics. The
political wisdom du jour says next year's presidential election
will go whichever way the suburban vote sloshes. Gore has noticed
there were 240 local controlled-growth issues on last year's
ballots and 70 percent passed.
</P>
<P>
   But if political, the matter needn't be intensely partisan. Many
of those issues passed in Republican electorates. Here,
classically, is a matter of legitimate public interest that by
rights ought to be attended to simply as a problem to be solved,
not as another bugle call to the ever-keen cultural rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the hyper-conservatives are having none of this mutual
problem-solving bull.
</P>
<P>
   According to them, the evil Clintonites, personified by Gore,
want to confiscate your car, deny you the American-dream home in
Bucolic Acres, force you to move into town (with Them!) and make
you ride buses. Gore, one conservative commentator says, is waging
a holy war _ ``a Jihad,'' no less _ against the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is plain crazy.
Federal policy _ freeways, subsidized FHA and GI Bill loans _
created suburbia. The political decisions that keep U.S. gasoline
taxes a fraction of what they are in other countries literally fuel
limitless expansion. It is hardly anti-capitalist to wonder if,
now, other policies might not be in order to check the unforeseen
excesses.
</P>
<P>
   The brawlers of the cultural and political right must think we
Americans love nothing more than to fight endlessly, they have us
doing so much of it.

THE TEXAS GREEN MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A panhandler from Texas came to town and in a
few hours near Union Square made $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush didn't even hold a cardboard sign saying ``Will
be whatever you want me to be for money.''
</P>
<P>
   The main thing we've learned about Bush is that he speaks fluent
Spanish. But so did Franco and so does Castro. Not that Bush is
such a bad guy, even if he's against women's right to abortion and
favors executing teen-aged criminals.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he's the governor of a state where the governor has
less power than a pickup truck dealer? He's quite personable, which
is his main selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bush's real second language is money, the same as that
other son of privilege, Vice President Al Gore. What we have here
is Andover vs. St. Albans, Yale vs. Harvard, the son of a president
vs. the son of a senator, one fund-raiser vs. another.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to hear either of them knocking elites.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is more elite, though, because he is a Republican _ a
Republican arriving after a dispiriting string of political duds
like Dole, Gingrich and, well, an older Bush. So before he's
stocked up on campaign sound bites, young Bush has picked up an
astounding $36 million in donations.
</P>
<P>
   He's made so much money without producing anything he should put
a ``.com'' after his name.
</P>
<P>
   If you think fund-raising irregularities are bad, consider this
scary fund-raising regularity: Since 1976, when the current
campaign finance system went into effect, the Republican and
Democratic presidential nominations have always gone to the
candidates who raised the most money in the year before the
election.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't over when it's over. It's over as soon as they're in
the clover. The election is more than a year away, and Bush already
is acting like he's president.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy has turned into dueling rubber chicken dinners. The
voter no longer counts. Power belongs to those who write big checks
to get ``access.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know this, but George W. Bush has done his first big
service to his country by making it $36 million clearer.
</P>
<P>
   What can we do? This is a nation built on a system of checks and
balances. The checks are rolling in, so it's up to voters to
provide the balances.
</P>
<P>
   Only your little votes can beat the powerful forces of boredom
and big money. I admit it. After years of cynicism, focus groups
and Clintonian triangulation, that sounds ridiculously like a Frank
Capra movie.
</P>
<P>
   But what can we do? I'm damned if I'm going to start exercising
my democratic rights by eating rubber chicken and writing big
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd like to see a race between Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J. Whatever their flaws,
they're men of character, discernible beliefs, interesting
histories and unconventional ways of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so they also have elite backgrounds, as the son of an
admiral and a Princeton graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The press and their parties are already writing them off because
$36 million is more important than character or issues.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough reason to consider them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if George W. Bush is elected president, it
will be a nail in the coffin of machismo. Americans will have put a
cheerleader in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a cheerleader at Andover, and recently I saw a yearbook
picture of him in his cheerleader sweater, megaphone in hand, and
he was cute. Even by Texas cheerleader standards.
</P>
<P>
   One good thing about Bush's windfall. Elizabeth Dole looks like
Southern-fried toast. That lady was getting way too scary. She
proposed a ban on federal subsidies for libraries that provide
access to obscene Web sites _ for adults, not just children.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this the woman married to the old guy in the Viagra ads on
television? There's nothing on the Web as bad as Bob Dole uttering
the letters ``E.D.'' and the words they stand for.
</P>
<P>
   They don't stand for ``Elizabeth Dole.''

 &HT;    FIREWORKS ARE BOOMING IN THE MILLENNIAL YEAR
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington , (f) financial and (l) lifestyle
categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparations for the new millennium have ignited a
boom in the fireworks business.
</P>
<P>
   Orders usually fizzle after the Fourth of July, but this year
they're skyrocketing, said Julie Heckman, spokeswoman for the
American Pyrotechnic Association
</P>
<P>
   Millennium celebrations will set a worldwide record for
fireworks displays, Heckman predicted. In the United States, there
will be a ``second season'' for consumer fireworks between
Christmas and New Year's. Normally, over 90 percent of the
firecrackers, Roman candles, cherry bombs and other at-home
fireworks favored by amateurs are shot off around the Fourth of
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a large response from consumers as well as
municipalities,'' said Gerry Serpico of the International Fireworks
Manufacturing Co. in Douglasville, Pa. ``New Year's Eve will be
really bang-up, but then the celebrations will continue all through
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More fireworks shows mean that more fireworks need to be
made,'' said Bret Swenson of Fireworks West Internationale in
Logan, Utah. The fireworks manufacturer has been filling orders for
the Fourth of July since April 1, he said, and on Tuesday will
start packing black powder and chemical colors into canisters meant
to celebrate the calendar change from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. fireworks industry had revenues of just over $425
million in 1998 and is expecting about a 30 percent increase in
1999, said Heckman. ``There will be a significant boom,'' but
financial forecasts are tricky because the celebrations will bridge
two years and much of the increased profit will be reflected on the
2000 ledgers rather than in 1999, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Large cities have budgeted for fireworks in their millennium
celebrations, but some small towns will probably wait and make
their annual community festivals ``more grandiose'' during 2000,
Heckman explained. Private organizations are also ordering
fireworks for parties all during the year, so the financial
windfall is expected to last until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a community fireworks display ranges from $2,000 or
so for low-level shells to light the sky for a few minutes to
$100,000 for a half-hour extravaganza with a multitude of low- and
high-level effects choreographed to music.
</P>
<P>
   To augment the fireworks that her firm makes, said Serpico,
``for this season, we've imported more than ever. Our product is
gone and we have shipments on the water coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks business has been pretty hot since the American
bicentennial, said Heckman. In 1976, a then-record 29 million
pounds of fireworks were set off in the United States. In 1997,
132.9 million pounds of fireworks were ``consumed,'' Heckman said.
``It increased fourfold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fireworks are Americana,'' she said. Displays routinely light
up the skies at baseball games, the Super Bowl, and theme parks
such as Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   For these shows, she said, pyrotechnic artists often mix shells
made in China, Italy, England, Australia and other foreign
countries, as well as domestic ones, to make an international
mosaic of light and color.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some innovations for millennium shows, she said.
``New patterns in the sky. New colors. We're seeing more pastels _
pinks, mint green, violet _ rather than just the traditional red,
white and blue. That's what makes a fireworks display so
wonderful.''

LAWMAKERS TAKE STEPS TO OPEN HEALTH PLAN'S BOOKS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alarmed by heavy losses and jobs cuts at the
UCSF Stanford Health Care, four California legislators have
introduced a bill to force the private hospital system to comply
with public records and disclosure laws.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators also called Thursday for a state audit and a
legislative hearing on what had gone wrong at the nonprofit
corporation that is owned jointly by Stanford University and the
University of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to find out the causes for this fiscal hemorrhage so
we can find ways to stop it,'' Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco,
said in a statement. Burton was joined in the legislation by
Assembly members Carole Migden and Kevin Shelley, both Democrats
from San Francisco, and Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Daly City.
</P>
<P>
   UCSF Stanford expects to lose $60 million this year and says it
will cut 2,000 jobs and may shut down parts of Mount Zion Medical
Center to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   UCSF Stanford spokesman Mike Lassiter had no comment on the
legislation. However, when the merger that created the hospital
system was being debated, proponents said it wouldn't work if the
hospitals had to operate under public disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to opening the hospital system to greater public
scrutiny, the bill would require its 16 board members to disclose
their personal holdings and potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   UCSF Stanford was formed in 1997 by combining the UC-San
Francisco's hospitals with the Stanford University and Lucile
Salter Packard Children's hospitals in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the state auditor issued a report saying the merger
would provide significant benefits to UC-San Francisco. Now, the
legislators say they want the auditor to focus on why the hospital
system has sunk so quickly into the red.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the losses, which are primarily from Mount Zion's
operations, result from inadequate reimbursements from Medicare and
Medi-Cal that are affecting academic medical centers nationwide. To
stanch the losses, administrators have proposed several options
including eliminating Mount Zion's emergency room and all or most
of its hospital beds.
</P>
<P>
   Unions and other critics say they believe poor management and
the merger have made things much worse, but contend neither their
assertions nor those of administrators can be verified without
access to the nonprofit corporation's records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us doubt the actual debt that they're reporting, and
this is the only way we're going to be able to see what is
happening at the hospital,'' said Karen MacLeod, president of the
UC-San Francisco chapter of the University Professional and
Technical Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, critics have singled out the hiring of about
1,000 new employees, payments to a consulting group hired to find
ways to cut costs, and what they say are high salaries paid to
administrators, which are not publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Migden said she hoped opening the system's books could help
avoid drastic cuts like cutting Mount Zion's hospital beds and
closing its emergency room. A hearing before the state Senate's
Select Committee on Government Oversight is scheduled for July 16
in San Francisco, a week before the UCSF Stanford board plans to
take up whether to cut programs at Mount Zion.

XTERRA SERIOUS ABOUT OFF ROADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Nissan Xterra is a basic sort despite its fancy
name and radical appearance.
</P>
<P>
   A straight-up sport-utility vehicle based on a pickup truck,
this is Nissan's entry into the niche of compact, affordable SUVs.
Shorter than Nissan's mainstream Pathfinder, the newly minted
Xterra treads its own path as a simple, rugged answer for those who
want a real off-roader without paying the premium.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it moves back to where SUVs started from, as trucks
with utility bodies. But it also looks ahead, one of the recent
crop of compact SUVs to fill in the gap left by the original
models, such as Pathfinder and the Toyota 4Runner, as they became
more complex, more luxurious and considerably more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Building the Xterra directly off the Frontier was a clever way
for Nissan designers to get into this range of SUVs without having
to spend a bundle on development. They also turned out something
quite different from the existing run of budget-priced SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike niche rivals Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V or Subaru Forester,
all built on car platforms, the Xterra is very much a truck, built
right on the chassis of the Frontier pickup, with old-style
body-on-frame design and a straightforward leaf-spring rear
suspension. As such, the ride may not be as sophisticated as the
more-established SUVs, but on the rocky trails, it's capable of
going where the big boys go.
</P>
<P>
   It's available either as a two-wheel drive, with a limited-slip
rear, or a full-fledged four-wheel drive, with shift-on-the-fly
four-wheel drive and a high-low transfer case for crawling over the
rough stuff. Either way, the ride height and appearance are the
same, and both are protected with skid plates underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Although Xterra may represent a distinctive new breed of
sport-utility vehicle, it's also along the same lines as the
original Jeep Cherokee, which is still alive and selling, at about
the same price range. Xterra is bigger than the Cherokee in every
dimension, and its stylish body and trim are sure to have greater
appeal to its young target audience.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing out there that's really akin to Xterra is the
Isuzu Rodeo, which has continued as a value leader.
</P>
<P>
   The base model Xterra can be had for about $17,000, with the
full-boat SE model topping just $25,000 fully equipped. The
two-wheel-drive test truck (this was a pre-production sample; a
four-by-four wasn't available) had every option on it except
four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   With a 104-inch wheelbase, Xterra has decent size, with enough
room inside for five regulation-size humans. The interior is
simple, even stark in some respects, revealing the budget price.
But it is comfortable and certainly workable.
</P>
<P>
   The styling, apparently inspired by Land Rover design, looks
adventurous and purposeful, and provoked quite a few favorable
remarks. From its no-nonsense blacked-out grille and bumper
assembly to the hump in the tailgate that houses a backpack or
optional first-aid kit, the Xterra seems ready for business.
</P>
<P>
   Topping it off is a macho-looking tubular aluminum roof rack,
complete with a unique, aerodynamic basket that can be loaded with
30 pounds of gear.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, our test truck was paradoxically equipped with a
sunroof that couldn't possibly be opened because of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The kick-up behind the front doors is accentuated by the window
styling and actually allows the rear seats to be a couple of inches
higher than the front seats. This is called stadium seating, and
makes the back seat a more pleasant place to be. It's also related
to the Xterra's pickup origins, putting passengers and cargo deck
where a pickup box would be.
</P>
<P>
   The rear-seat cushions can be removed and the seat backs folded
flush with the cargo bed.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned, the Xterra drives like a truck: some harshness and
jostling, some shake and rebound, especially from the archaic
leaf-spring rear. But all around, the Xterra is a kick to drive.
Especially when you get it off pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Our test Xterra did really well on the relatively tame dirt road
up from I-17 to Crown King. There are sharp elevation changes and a
series of hairpin switchbacks, which the Xterra boogied through
with style.
</P>
<P>
   The tester was equipped with the 170-horse V-6 and automatic,
not exactly a hot setup, but at least competent. The engine roars
as it works to bring the Xterra up to highway speed, though once
there, it cruises along quietly enough.
</P>
<P>
   If I were buying one of these, I'd go for the stick shift to
make better use of the engine's available torque.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a budget-level four-cylinder engine, which
generates 143 horsepower. That would probably be all right around
town, but pretty frustrating on the open road.
</P>
<P>
   A general fault of SUVs _ mediocre gas mileage _ weighs heavily
on the Xterra. I seemed to be putting gas in this thing every time
I turned around. Nineteen miles per gallon on the highway doesn't
really cut it.
</P>
<P>
   Fun, quirky, a little bit screwy (that sunroof thing), the
Xterra should be a certain hit for Nissan, which certainly could
use one. Watch for the interesting crew-cab pickup, a similar
concept to the Xterra but with a short pickup bed instead of an
enclosed rear section. &QL;

SMALL BUSINESSES STRUGGLE WITH RISING RENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For 22 years, Meng Chen has rented space for his
engineering firm in the South of Market area without feeling a need
to buy the property.
</P>
<P>
   But he was in for a shock when he received his new three-year
lease: His rent had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, one of many small-business owners feeling increasingly
squeezed by high-end Internet tenants and live-work loft
development in the area, knew he had to buy to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Internet software people getting money from venture
capitalists _ they just have money to spend, which we don't,'' said
Chen, principal of MHC Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Chen voiced the frustrations of a number of small-business
owners as well as artists and renters of modest means who live or
work in the rapidly changing industrial areas south of Market
Street in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on rents from the expanding technology companies and
loft development is forcing longtime small-business tenants _ once
the soul of this slice of San Francisco _ to trade rising rents for
hefty mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, San Francisco is one of the hottest markets in the
nation for U.S. Small Business Administration loans designed to
help tenants buy property.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, small businesses South of Market have leased, very
well and very comfortably. I think those days are over,'' said
Barbara Morrison, president of TMC Development, a San Francisco
nonprofit organization that helps businesses like MHC Engineers get
SBA loans to buy property.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see are people buying the real estate because they
see the volatility of the rental market. By owning your own
property, you can fix at least the housing operations,'' said Mark
Quinn, director of the SBA's San Francisco district office.
</P>
<P>
   Under a typical commercial lending program, the buyer has to put
down as much as 40 percent of the property's selling price, but few
small businesses have that kind of cash. Most business owners also
have a tough time getting long-term financing with competitive
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA lending program requires the business to put down 10
percent of the sales price, with 40 percent coming from the SBA and
the remaining 50 percent from the bank. Interest rates are based on
government lending rates, and the loans are for 20 years.
Businesses must go through a screening process for the loans, with
profitability and potential for expansion among the determining
factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the bank very comfortable,'' said Todd Hollander, who
heads Wells Fargo Bank's division for small-business lending in the
Bay Area. ``It's good for the bank, and it's good for the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the loans, most of the business owners trying to
buy property find themselves priced out of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Rupel of Rupel, Geiszler, McLeod Architecture recently
received a 90-day eviction notice from his rented suite on Brannan
Street to make room for a growing Internet company. He sees buying
property as the chance to stabilize his costs and control his
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand right now for this area is so high I don't know if
I want to deal with or compete with it,'' said Rupel, who has been
in the South of Market area for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chen considers himself lucky to be able to stay in the area.
After losing on five bids, he bought a $790,000 building at Eighth
and Mission streets using an SBA loan. He plans to move on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why did I have to buy at the top of the market?'' he asks
himself. ``Why didn't I buy two or three years ago? We just didn't
know.''

ALBERT WELCOMED HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The circle of life is complete now that Marv Albert is back at
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   No sense beating up on the guy anymore. He was sick and needed
help and now that therepy has worked its cure over the last two
years, why shouldn't the recovering be allowed to work in their
field of expertise?
</P>
<P>
   It's about redemption and forgiveness, and if Albert is willing
to subject himself to public ridicule, then so be it. NBC gets the
credit for taking care of one of its own. The network did the right
thing by firing him when he lied about his affair. And NBC Sports
Chairman Dick Ebersol is doing the right thing by giving, by all
accounts, the best NBA play-by-play announcer another chance at the
network level.
</P>
<P>
   Sports is the one field in which talent matters most. It also
helps to be friends with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very happy day for NBC Sports,'' Ebersol told
reporters on Tuesday. ``Marv has been a great friend to all of us
here for a long time, above all to me in particular. He is my
friend. He is a great talent.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Reaction has been one of inevitability. Everyone
knew Albert would be back. Just not this quickly. The process
started just 10 months after his plea-bargain deal in Virginia,
where he pleaded guilty to the misdeamnor offense of assault and
battery. Madison Square Garden Network rehired him to call the
Knicks game on its radio station and a 30-minute sports news show
called ``SportsDesk.'' Seven months later, Turner Sports hired him
to call NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   The new NBC deal calls for Albert to call as many as 15 NBA
games as well as hockey and boxing events during the upcoming
Summer Olympics. Fox Sports had made overtures to Albert to call
football games. Once Ebersol learned of the talks, he quickly moved
to secure his old pal.
</P>
<P>
   Like him or not, Albert is a good announcer. But more pressing
to NBC, and for that matter, the NBA, is how to increase ratings
for NBA games. The recent playoff series between the New York
Knicks and San Antonio Spurs was the lowest rated since 1991. With
NBC vowing to show more regional games, attaining higher national
numbers will be even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But ratings weren't the issue with Albert.
</P>
<P>
   Character was, and if Latrell Sprewell can find a home in
Manhattan, then certainly Albert can.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe when the NFL rights are available again, NBC can outbid
other network competitors and put O.J. back on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Juice will be something of a senior football
statesman, and his words will be worth a ratings point or two.
</P>
<P>
   Time healed Richard Nixon. It healed Albert.
</P>
<P>
   It can heal Simpson, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Cup draw
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup game on Sunday between USA and Korea
scored a 3.3 rating and 7 share on ESPN2 last Sunday. Those cable
ratings numbers are great when compared with those of other
programming that day. ESPN earned a 1 rating and 3 share for its
coverage of the Lysol 200 Nascar race and a 2.5 rating for its
coverage of the SaveMart/Kragen 350K Nascar race. The women's match
easily outperformed its head-to-head competition that night. The
New York Mets game against the Atlanta Braves on TBS pulled a .6
rating. ESPN managed only a 1.4 for its airing of the
Dodgers-Giants game.

BUT CAN CLACK SHOOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Kris Clack says he has never been a tight end,
fullback, or linebacker. That surprises Celtics general manager
Chris Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by looking at him, you'd think he could get a scholarship
to play college football,'' Wallace said of the former University
of Texas swingman. Clack, taken by the Celtics with the 55th pick
in Wednesday's NBA draft, once bench-pressed 320 pounds. He runs
the 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds. His vertical leap has been
measured at 37 inches. A fan in Austin swears he can throw a
football 85 yards. In 1998, he separated his right shoulder, an
injury that was thought to be season-ending. Three days later, he
shoved the shoulder into its socket and scored 28 points (with nine
rebounds) against Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, the man is an athlete. But can he shoot well enough to
make the Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question Clack will have to begin to answer on Tuesday.
That's a significant day for a couple reasons: it is the day Clack
meets his bosses in Waltham, and it is also his 22d birthday.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other questions, too. One publication lists him as
6 feet 5 inches; another has him at 6-3 3/4. What's his height?
``I'm 6-4 1/2 with no shoes on,'' he said Thursday. ``And 6-5 in
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also stories that he coasted after he was MVP of the
Nike Desert Classic in Phoenix, a predraft camp. Just over a month
later in Chicago, he supposedly was 15 pounds heavier and didn't
play as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always seem to bring up my weight,'' he said. ``But
that's just the way I'm built; I'm not overweight. If I had such a
weight problem, there wouldn't be a 37-inch vertical.''
</P>
<P>
   Clack certainly isn't a stranger to high school basketball fans
in the country. He was on the same McDonald's All-America list as
Ron Mercer, Paul Pierce, Stephon Marbury, Shareef Abdur-Rahim,
Kevin Garnett, and Antawn Jamison. He played for former Rhode
Island coach Tom Penders at Texas for three years and former
Providence coach Rick Barnes for one. He said he didn't have a
preference but, ``With Penders, it was wide open. It seemed like
the first person to bring the ball across halfcourt could shoot it.
With Barnes, it was a much more structured offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that Clack would benefit from a coach who is a
disciplinarian and who will help him develop more technique with
his jump shot. One of the things Rick Pitino will like about him is
that he talks of playing defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't see letting my man score 30 points,'' he said.
``I have a lot of pride in defense and when I compete, I want to
get into a guy with my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clack will get a chance to show what kind of defender he is when
he plays on the Celtics summer league teams. Wayne Turner, who
played for Pitino at Kentucky, also was invited to participate.
Wallace said the 6-2 guard from Mission Hill, now being represented
by Boston agent Frank Catapano, has ``semi-confirmed'' he will be
here. Derrick Battie, the brother of Celtics forward Tony Battie,
and guard Kevin Ollie also will be Celtic summer leaguers. The
Celtics didn't want to invite a lot of undrafted free agents to
camp because they want to see everyone play. There could be a
couple of players added later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One player who will not be playing summer ball with the Celtics
is 7-footer Ben Pepper. In fact, the team's second-round pick from
1997 won't be playing anywhere in the next couple of weeks because
of an ankle injury. Wallace said Pepper will be invited to the
team's summer camps after the '99-00 season . . . You don't have to
guess how Bulls vice president Jerry Krause plans to rebuild his
team. Draft picks Elton Brand, Ron Artest, Michael Ruffin, and Lari
Ketner are among the most physical players at their positions . . .
By now, most fans know that the Cavaliers selected Andre Miller
with the eighth pick, a pick that originally belonged to the
Celtics. But that doesn't mean the Celtics would have drafted the
Utah point guard at No. 8. Most likely, they would have taken
UNLV's Shawn Marion, a 6-7 small forward. Marion, drafted ninth by
the Suns, has several fans in Boston's front office . . . The
Mercer Watch: The latest rumor has the guard going to the Bulls for
Toni Kukoc. By itself, that trade doesn't work. But if other
players are involved on both sides, something could happen.
Remember, the Celtics also had Artest ranked among the draft's top
10 players . . . Wallace said he likes the way Everett's Pat
Bradley shoots but thinks the former Arkansas guard will have to
play point guard in the pros.

BIGGER HOUSE WON'T SHELTER OWNER FROM UNCLE SAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, July 5, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am single, 41, and contribute the maximum allowed to a
401(k) plan. I also have a regular IRA as well, of which I've
already made my $2,000 maximum contribution for 1999. My taxable
investments are all with Vanguard, including two tax-exempt money
market funds for reserves and emergencies, the Index 500 and Index
Growth, and a small amount in the Health Care fund. In addition to
my $52,000 annual salary, I am going to receive approximately
$96,000 in net stock option distributions over the next two years
from a recent buyout of our division. This is money that I do not
have a need for right now, or in the foreseeable future. In your
opinion, what is the best solution to shelter myself from Uncle
Sam? Should I open a Roth IRA, buy a bigger house, or put it all in
Vanguard Index 500?
</P>
<P>
   G.S., San Diego, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. The wild card here is the idea of buying a bigger house.
Usually when that's thrown in as an option, it's because the
questioner wants to buy a bigger house, and you'll have to decide
for yourself if that's really where you want to go. All I will
suggest is this -- buying a new house isn't going to shelter you
from taxes; in the short run, if you buy $96,000 more house, you're
going to pay taxes and insurance and maintenance costs on that
$96,000 more house, and when you eventually sell, Uncle Sam is
likely to be there to take notice.
</P>
<P>
   You don't mention how much is in your current IRA, but I think
an attractive option would be to take a portion of the windfall and
use it to pay the taxes on a transfer of your current IRA savings
to Roth accounts. This would create a nice balance in retirement,
with the Roth money being tax-free and providing you flexibility in
managing your withdrawals from the more sizable amount that you'll
probably have in the tax-deferred 401(k) account.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest, Vanguard Index 500 is certainly a very solid
long-term investment. But if you're certain that you won't have a
use for this money before age 59 1/2, consider investing in a
variable annuity account which Vanguard offers, with the investment
tracking the same index as the taxable fund. The advantage of the
variable annuity is that the growth within the account is
tax-deferred, much as in an IRA or 401(k) account.
</P>
<P>
   When you make withdrawals after age 59 1/2, you pay taxes on the
proportion of the money which can be attributed to internal growth;
the amount of the withdrawal which can be attributed to the initial
contribution is not taxable. But you will pay both taxes and a
penalty if the funds are withdrawn before age 59 1/2, except in a
few exceptional (and generally unpleasant) circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Another disadvantage is that in order to gain the tax deferral
that attracts most people to variable annuities, there is an
element of insurance provided in the product. This smidgen of
insurance does its job, but it also costs money, so you can expect
the returns from a variable annuity to run about one half of one
percentage point behind the returns of a comparable taxable mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Before you made such a move, try to estimate where your various
investments are likely to be once you retire. While moving your IRA
to a Roth account will give you added flexibility, buying a
variable annuity will serve to increase the amount of money on
which taxes will be levied upon withdrawal. You might eventually
decide on a three-pronged strategy -- paying the taxes to transfer
to Roth IRAs, putting some of the money into a Standard and Poor's
500 variable annuity, and putting the balance in Vanguard Index
500. But remember if you take the final step that while Index 500
in quite tax efficient, it is still almost certain to provide you
with regular, and growing, tax liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I read your column it seems most of these people have a
pretty good handle on what they're doing. Well, I make $110,000 a
year and don't have a lot to show for it in terms of investing for
myself and my family. I'm 46 years old and my wife is 40. We have
children nine and six years old. My retirement light has finally
come on. As of this date, we have a wide variety of investments,
mostly in a 401(k) and IRA accounts. Aside for money for the
children, the accounts now amount to $48,306. Reading the
</P>
<P>
   questions people write to you, it seems to me that the people
who write to you are light years ahead of me. How much should I be
saving based on what I'm making? What should I be doing so I don't
get killed by inflation?
</P>
<P>
   G.R., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, let's work backwards to see how deep a hole youre in
when it comes to retirement. A common approach is to calculate that
people will need about 60 percent of their pre-retirement income to
finance a fairly comfortable retirement. In your case that would
work out to $66,000 a year. But if inflation runs at a 3.5 percent
annual average for the next 19 years, you'd need $126,885 to buy
what $66,000 buys today.
</P>
<P>
   So what are you likely to have to meet those costs? Let's
estimate that you're putting $10,000 a year into the 401(k) plan,
and are fully funding both your IRA and your wife's. At that rate,
if you achieve 10 percent average investment returns you would have
$1,044,330 after 19 years -- a tidy sum, but not sufficient to meet
those projected retirement costs for very long.
</P>
<P>
   So how much should you be saving? If my assumptions about the
401(k) and IRA contributions are correct, you are currently saving
about 12.7 percent of your income. Many people set 15 percent of
income as a savings target. But it's also clear from the levels in
the various accounts either that you haven't been saving regularly
or haven't been saving for long. So my suggestion would be not only
to go to that 15 percent level, but to stretch beyond it if
possible to make up for lost time. If you were able to boost your
savings to 15 percent of income, the 19-year growth projection
would be to $1,178,067, using the same assumptions as above.
</P>
<P>
   If you could make the mammoth leap to 20 percent, the projection
would go out to $1,472,064. (But remember that it's better to set a
savings level you can live with and stick to the plan, rather than
to set your sights too high and find yourself regularly slipping
behind plan.)
</P>
<P>
   The picture isn't quite as bleak as I paint it. Whatever savings
level you decide on, maintain it as a percentage of income rather
than a flat dollar level -- thus every time you win a raise the
picture will grow brighter. Moreover, my guess is that there will
be some sort of Social Security program remaining in place when you
retire, and that could make the picture brighter still.
</P>
<P>
   But the main thing to do it save more, and keep doing it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The conservative reputation of New Englanders is not well
served by your advice against saving for a child's education in
their own name. Gifts under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, with a
good trustee, protect the child's assets against adverse outcomes
in divorce court, probate court, and bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   R.M., Bolton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. My frequent advice that parents save for college expenses in
their own names is based on the staggering escalation that is
expected for college expenses. The latest edition of ``Paying for
College Without Going Broke'' by Kalman A. Chany projects the
average annual expense of a four-year college to be $41,942 in
2013, with a figure of $16,310 for a public university in the same
year. For most people, facing expenses like that without applying
for some sort of financial aid would simply be impossible, and
accordingly it is wise to do everything you can do to maximize the
student's eligibility for financial aid -- and putting funds in a
student's name has precisely the opposite effect, reducing the
student's eligibility for assistance.

HIGGINBOTHAM'S WORDS OF WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people understood the duality of the Declaration of
Independence as did A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., the late federal
judge, legal scholar, Harvard professor and Presidential Medal of
Freedom honoree. It was Higginbotham who, in the midst of the
bicentennial of the American Revolution, dared to interrupt the
fireworks to ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the Declaration of Independence announce a self-evident
truth or a self-evident lie?''
</P>
<P>
   On this Fourth of July, it is important to remember
Higginbotham, who died last December. He combined a biting sense of
the nation's beginnings with an underlying irony for what the white
forefathers had set in motion. ``If the authors of the Declaration
of Independence had said `all white men are created equal' or even
`all white men who own property' they would have more honestly
conveyed the general consensus,'' Higginbotham wrote in his 1978
book ``In the Matter of Color, Race and the American Legal Process:
The Colonial Period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when they declared, as they did, that `all men are created
equal' without introducing any qualifications, they created a
document that put moral demands on all Americans who would ever
quote it.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham was not the kind to rail for a cancellation of the
fireworks or the Pops. But he insisted on people being honest with
what they were celebrating. You cannot understand America today
without being clear that the Declaration of Independence was
written in a cesspool of hypocrisy. The white colonists, with no
mention of slavery in the Colonies, vigorously depicted themselves
as slaves to the British.
</P>
<P>
   Josiah Quincy of Boston said: ``I speak it with grief. I speak
it with anguish. Britons are our oppressors. I speak it with shame.
I speak it with indignation _ we are slaves.'' John Adams said the
colonists were ``the most abject sort of slaves, to the worst sort
of masters!''
</P>
<P>
   When Rhode Island Governor Stephen Hopkins opposed the Sugar Act
of 1764, he said, ``Liberty is the greatest blessing that men enjoy
and slavery the heaviest curse that human nature is capable of.''
Higginbotham wrote, ``Of course, Governor Hopkins was not speaking
of the enslavement of blacks. Ironically, he argued that white
colonists were being enslaved by England because the Sugar Act of
1764 decreased the profits from Rhode Island's involvement in the
international slave trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Slavery, so fundamental to the economy of the United States that
it would go on for nearly nine decades after the Declaration, and
racial discrimination, so fundamental to the superior economic,
educational, and social position of white people that it was
legally encoded for nearly 190 years, received their silent
blessings in the Declaration. The Continental Congress struck out
Thomas Jefferson's only reference to the international slave trade,
the reference that criticized England for waging ``cruel war
against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of
life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never
offended him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the reference had survived, Higginbotham found it
hypocritical because it referred only to England and not to slavery
in the Americas. At the time of the Declaration, Jefferson had
posted a reward for the capture and return of one of his runaway
slaves. ``If, in Jefferson's phrase, the international slave trade
was initiated by `cruel war against human nature itself, why was it
not just as depraved for him to keep in lifetime servitude in the
Colonies those who had been so cruelly captured abroad or their
children?'' Higginbotham wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the declaration took on another life. Abolitionists used it
to urge the end of slavery. Martin Luther King Jr. implored America
to ``live out the true meaning of its creed _ we hold these truths
to be self evident, that all men are created equal.'' Higginbotham
found the declaration to be alive in the civil rights acts passed
in the 1960s, acts which guaranteed basic rights for ``all
persons'' or any ``individual'' on the basis of ``race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Declaration of Independence was so alive that Higginbotham
knew he was answering his own question. The declaration was a
self-evident lie that, despite the nation's murderous history of
supremacy and patronization, has been moved significantly closer to
that self-evident truth. It is still not reasonably close enough in
a land that remains infested with racism, sexism, homophobia, and
widening economic disparity.
</P>
<P>
   But it is close enough so that the proponents of equality now
have a taste of what the framers wrote. ``Once the drafters of and
signers of our Declaration made the decision not to weaken their
moral argument for nationhood by attempting to rationalize the lie
many of them were living,'' Higginbotham wrote, ``they made
inevitable the irony that the truth they espoused, and not their
example, would eventually guide their progeny to a society more
just than their own.''

OUTSIDERS ENHANCE CHEMICAL BROTHERS' EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS 
Surrender 
Astralwerks 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We start out in Kraftwerk-ville with altered man-machine vocals
intoning, ``Music triggers some kind of response,'' over and over
against techno-squiggles, guitar riffs, space-age synth dive-bombs,
and bracing break beats. It's called ``Music: Response'' and it is
clear we are in good hands, cared for by the happy, sly minds of
``brothers'' Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, the duo who gave us those
big block-rockin' beats of 1997 with ``Dig Your Own Hole.''
``Surrender,'' the Chemical Brothers' third album, gives us some of
the same but a lot more. With the third song, they give us New
Order-style dance-floor angst and slippery sexuality _ replete with
New Order/Electronic singer Bernard Sumner on guest vocals _ with
its mix of hooks and trance-rock, its sinuousness and disruption.
Shortly, it's the Beatle-esque entry (circa ``Rain'') with Oasis's
Noel (I am the Walrus) Gallager doing his bit, ``Let Forever Be,''
as he did on the last disc. The overall cheeriness is countered by
Gallagher's musings about spending ``a little lifetime sitting in
the gutter.'' (Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie also joins.)
Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval takes over for Beth Orton in the
sad-song chanteuse category and contributes a shimmering, watery
``Asleep From Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it all a pastiche? Is it all a stylistic rip from another era
done up with late '90s electronic gizmos? Is it too dependent on
outside collaborators? No, not really, or so what, who cares? are
possible answers. You can cite the reference points, if you wish,
but none of them get in the way of this delicious sonic assault.
``Surrender'' is somewhat less busy _ less acid-jazzy _ than its
predecessor. It is less exhausting an experience, but just as
rewarding. There are a multitude of levels to this CD; the moods
vary, the beats go nuts and then shut up, the idea of music as
adventure reigns supreme.
</P>
<P>
   Just as, say, the Cure survived post-punk and new wave, the
Chemical Brothers look to be surviving electronica. It is any
band's challenge to emerge from an era or sound, or, more
specifically, hyped-up expectations of that era or sound. One thing
the best electronica groups have done _ and the Chems are certainly
among them _ is bring dance audiences to rock, and vice versa.
Rowlands and Simons are not too hung up on what it all means. A lot
of this is instrumental music _ no lyrics to bother you _ and it's
a near perfect mix of music that functions on physical and cerebral
planes simultaneously . Wave after wave of smile-induing
psychedelia comes at you; you'd have to be made of stone to not
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   I have a lot of respect for albums that are well paced _ peaks,
valleys, and all that. This one is aces in that regard. ``Asleep
From Day'' is the calm in the eye of the hurricane, and then the
Chems and company gently crank up the space-dance rock on ``Got
Glint?'' There's an Indian strain in the gliding title tune, and
the final wind-down track is the celestial ``Dream On'' (no, not
that one) with guest guitarist-singer Jonathan Donahue from Mercury
Rev. ``Sleep and dream on . . . '' urges Sandoval, as Donahue and
pals paint gentle circles around and above her. It's a graceful
denouement, a soft rest after an exhilarating ride, reminiscent of
``Sad Song'' at the end of Lou Reed's masterpiece ``Berlin.''

A NATURAL PROGRESSION OF OZRIC TENTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the genre called progressive rock (or prog-rock) and a
lot of folks wince or run _ too pretentious, self-indulgent,
long-winded, unconnected to the primal spirit of rock 'n' roll.
When Peter Gabriel walked away from prog-rock kings Genesis in the
late-'70s, he told us, ``Progressive rock used to be about
exploring music and it came to be about using keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   All these things are often true. But then there's a band like
Ozric Tentacles, a London-based, vocal-free quintet founded by
guitarist Ed Wynne 17 years ago, starting a rare US tour. ``In
England, there aren't really any prog rock bands, although in
Europe there is,'' says Wynne. ``It's a funny thing, the label
progressive rock. In England, it tends to mean `too intellectual
for most people' and some people are afraid of that and its scary _
they feel it's out of their depth. Our music does get progressive,
but we start in a place where (the listeners) know where they are,
then lead out from there. A lot of progressive rock groups, they
throw you in at deep end.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozric Tentacles -- the name came for a name for an imaginery
breakfast cereal -- releases its 16th album, ``Waterfall Cities,''
on Tuesday on the indy Phoenix Rising. The Ozrics have never been
near a major label. ``Nobody ever asked us,'' says Wynne. ``We're
too strange for most major labels, too bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ozrics first became a hit on the English festival circuit,
playing shows up to six hours under the influence of various
stimulants. Their sound features cyclical motifs, bubbling
synthesizers, searing electric guitar leads. There are Eastern
strains, dub, space rock, jams. It's a mix of hippie and rave
aesthetics. ``When I first saw the raves kids have,'' Wynne says,
``when that started I thought, `Oh my god, what is this? People are
getting away with murder, anybody can do it,' and then I realized
that was a good thing _ put it on computer and off it goes. It got
more interesting and I started liking certain bits and a lot of
rave people started coming to our concerts. They saw all these
strange synths lying about, it was all instrumental, it's almost
like a bridge between prog-rock and rave.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynne, who is joined in the band by brother Roly on synths, sees
a difference between American and English psychedelia. ``The
American psychedelic tradition comes from blues end; in England
it's not that, it's a Hawkwind state of mind, different scales.
Rather than blues scales, we tend to go for Indian and Ethnic
scales, jam situations and space rock, which is very muchh
Hawkwind's thing. Ten years ago we were very much doing that but
we've branched out. It's hard to say from the inside (what we do),
but when we were cutting `Waterfall Cities,' we realized it was the
first one with didn't have the Hawkwind 4/4 drum beat. Maybe we're
shedding the last of that. In a way, we're almost freeer now to
explore any direction we like. One song has this Chinese-Japanese
sounding thing going on. Nothing like we've done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does Ozric Tentacles eschew vocals and lyrics? ``What
`message' can you put across with music like ours?'' says Wynne,
with a laugh. ``We have done two songs, total, with vocals, though
it's hard to determine what they're about. They're just words that
rhyme and abstract images. I've always been much more interested in
instrumentals. I know if i wrote lyrics I'd be very embarrassed. I
can't imagine singing, either. I'd much rather hide beyind guitars
and keyboards.''
</P>
<P>
   This impending tour is the Ozrics's first American sortie in six
years. ``It's very difficult to get there,'' says Wynne, ``
distance and visa situations, I guess. Last time, we got burnt
badly, lost masses of money.'' Not this, he avers. ``We have no
personal problems going to America, we made sure of that. We'll
have a happy time. We are trying for a real push, for the first
time ever.'' Expect a two-hour show with a full-blown lights.
</P>
<P>
   Opening up: A sextet called Star People who, says their
spokeswoman (aka Mistress of Star People/Truth Dissemination), come
from ``a concept band that comes from outer space,'' galaxy
unknown, ``drawn here by radio signals.''

   A FRIEND FROM LONDON WRITES ... ABOUT BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AT
EARL'S COURT: When Bruce said, ``I can't promise you life
everlasting, but I can promise you life right now,'' he was right.
His concert was exuberant and mature, raunchy and sensitive. His
youthful energy has been replaced with a more measured strength and
vitality thta was especially noticeable in the depth and force of
his voice. The E-Street Band was relaxed, showing obvious affection
for each other, and behaving like a gang having fun on the street
-- the happy version of the Jets and Sharks. Clarence Clemons isn't
quite the big man he has been, and although he still belted out the
sax solos, his introduction to ``The River'' was haunting, sultry
and sad. As he was joined by Bruce on the harmonica, the feeling
was heavy with nostalgia, even heavier with pain, as if, 20 years
on, the singer was still one of life's victims out of work ``on
account of the economy.'' Bruce's falsetto humming at the end
sounded like the cry of a wounded animal, and stunned the audience
into chilled silence. In other songs like ``Hungry Heart'' and
``10th Avenue Freeze-Out'' they came out of the shadows and back
into the light and just had fun. Whatever else has happened to
Bruce, he hasn't lost his hunger for life and fun. What really
stood out was how much the band seemed to be enjoying each other.
It felt as if there were a new agenda, one that comes with age and
maturity, family and responsibility. Although they could still
rock, have fun and carry everyone along with that, there was a
recognition that Bruce and the E-Street Band are a family riding
high on a reunion.

MCCAIN'S ACE IN THE HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ There's an Army out there somewhere for John
McCain. And a Navy and an Air Force, too, McCain enthusiasts
devoutly hope.
</P>
<P>
   If the veterans of America's military want a straight-shooting,
high-flying, damn-the-torpedoes military hero, McCain's their man,
and the vets are part of his plan. His strategy is simple: Survive
the early skirmishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, which is much more
important to him than Iowa, and then, like 10 other also-ran
Republicans, pray that George W. Bush implodes. The Granite State's
twin reputations for rock-ribbed patriotism and humbling
front-runners are McCain's pair of hole cards here.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of the dozen Republicans is running as an
anti-Clinton. Much talk of homespun virtues punctuates their stump
speechifying. But just as he was the only Republican to declare US
ground troops as the sensible way to defeat Milosevic, and just as
he is the only Republican four-square against soft money and the
existing campaign finance loopholes, and just as he is the only
heavyweight Republican to take on Big Tobacco and the telecom
lobbyists, he enjoys one other distinction:
</P>
<P>
   He's the only conservative arguing against ``the pervasive
public cynicism that is debilitating our democracy . . . cynicism
bordering on alienation.'' And he bravely admits it's not just
Clinton at fault. ``We who are currently privileged to hold public
office have ourselves to blame for this sickness in American public
life. It is we who have squandered the public trust. We, who have
time and again, in full public view, placed our personal or
partisan interests before the national interest, earning the
public's contempt with our poll-driven policies, our phony
posturing, the lies we call spin, and the damage control we
substitute for progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow!
</P>
<P>
   If you read no other political speech this year, go to
www.mccain2000.com and dig up his May 27 commencement speech at
Johns Hopkins. It'll make even liberal Democrats think about
sending a check to the most truth-telling candidate in either
party. I guess once you've been a POW for a sixth of your adult
life, you might as well tell it like it is. The Beltway scandal
culture may raise the premium on McCain's years in a Hanoi prison
after his jet was shot down. ``The most dramatic contrast we have
to the Clinton era is John McCain,'' South Carolina legislator
Terry Haskins told The Los Angeles Times. ``He's a national hero
known as a leader who tells the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain hopes to use South Carolina's early primary in a
pro-military state (two weeks after New Hampshire) to jack him into
contention in California. If Bush wins both Iowa and New Hampshire,
the Texan will be nigh unstoppable. McCain seems to be lowballing
Iowa, where his stand against ethanol (corn-into-fuel) subsidies
irks corn-growing, subsidy-fed farmers. So New Hampshire looks to
be make-or-break for McCain, 62, taking his last, best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore served in the Vietnam era, and George W. Bush the
Younger flew National Guard training missions in Texas. But
McCain's the man for veterans who feel they'd prefer someone who
mirrors their own life experience and sacrifices for the purposes
of patriotism. The fact that McCain does not demagogue his story or
mock those who've not been called upon to make the kinds of
sacrifices he had to face makes him attractive to a broad range of
voters who do not necessarily share his views on a wide range of
issues. He's managed to raise enough money to compete despite
alienating the deep-pocketed lobbyists who bankroll the campaigns
of others.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's is in the middle of the small-medium-large candidacies,
where none but Bush's is large among the Republicans. But in the
money chase, for '99's first six months, McCain is a respectable,
if distant, fourth overall. The heavy lifters siphoning $1,000
checks are Bush, $23 million; Al Gore, $18 million; Bill Bradley,
$11 million; and then way behind him McCain at $4.3 million, with
Elizabeth Dole and Dan Quayle around $3 million each. Absent from
this list of mendicants is Steve Forbes, most of whose money comes
from his vast personal stash.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, whose jihad against the corruption of the current
campaign finance system wins him few friends among the professional
lobbyists, this is a solid showing. ``The system has become
corrupted by the influence of soft money, and average Americans are
not represented any longer. And we need to clean it up,'' he told a
Nashua audience Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP voters who flock behind Bush's poll ratings seem
more comfortable with Bush's cash-drenched front-runnership than
McCain's hair shirt. Winnability is the Bush bottom line. The
latest Des Moines Register poll pegs Bush at 40 percent among Iowa
Republicans, Dole 13, and Forbes, off his most recent $10 million
ad outlay, at 10, with all other Republican candidates below 5
percent. McCain is spurning a $25-a-head Iowa straw poll at Ames,
calling it a lobbyists' hog fest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has to sneak up on Bush in New Hampshire, solidify that
showing in flag-waving South Carolina, then gallop into California
on the white stallion of reform, a warrior back from the wars
vowing to clean out the stable in D.C.

A SPIRITED TIME FOR GULLIKSON AS DAVIS CUP NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Technically, he is here among the ancients, playing in
the 45-and-over gentlemen's doubles. But Tom Gullikson's real
business is to keep an eye on his immediate tennis future. And no
matter how he fares among Wimbledon's senior citizens, the American
men in the main draw are giving him reason to frolic.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old US Davis Cup captain has watched two of his
players, Todd Martin and reborn team man Pete Sampras, advance to
the quarterfinals in this rain delay wrapped around occasional
serves and volleys. The third member of the American contingent
that will face Australia in the Cup quarterfinals at Longwood July
16-18, Jim Courier, came within a whisker of joining them before
Tim Henman put an end to his heroic performance in a five-set
fourth-rounder, one of three Courier matches to go the distance.
``At least I didn't have to look for a court to practice on for the
Davis Cup,'' Courier observed after his surprisingly long stay
here.
</P>
<P>
   And for what it's worth, a once and perhaps future Gullikson
patriotic protege, Andre Agassi, is also in the quarters, most of
which were washed away Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimbo played great,'' Gullikson says. ``Todd, Pete, and Andre
are playing great, too. It's great for US tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon Gullikson if he seems stuck on one adjective. He tends to
see things only in terms of superlatives these days, ever since his
cast of supposed rejects _ Courier, Martin, and Martin's doubles
partner, Alex O'Brien _ scored a titanic upset of host England with
a 3-2 first-round Cup victory at Birmingham in April. It was a
blockbuster series _ decided when Courier outlasted favored Greg
Rusedski, 8-6, in the fifth set of the concluding match _ and it so
revitalized the Davis Cup's stature that even the players became
interested in it again. Now that, Gullikson will tell you, was
really great for American tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who were there,'' he says, ``it was something
special we'll always share. Those who saw it wished they were
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a certain Greek-American kid tuning in at home in
Orlando, Fla., who happens to be the No. 1 singles player in the
world, perhaps in history. In January, Sampras, who had been guided
to the top by Gullikson's twin brother, Tim, resisted Tom's
entreaties to play in Birmingham _ or anywhere else the Cup would
be contested in 1999. A week after the latest American revolution,
he was on the phone to Gullikson, asking if the captain might be
able to use him in Boston _ in doubles only, so he wouldn't step on
Martin's and Courier's toes.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about team spirit . . .
</P>
<P>
   And over here, the red, white, and blue have been coated in
saccharine. Courier, Martin, Sampras, and Agassi _ all in their
late 20s, all basically fierce rivals and occasional uneasy Cup
allies throughout their careers _ have been bonding with a
vengeance. They have attended each other's matches, rooted one
another on, enthused over each other's victories. As Sampras puts
it, ``There's a lot of love in the air.'' Including Agassi, who has
vowed never to play Davis Cup again after the dismissal of team
physician George Fareed this year, though Gullikson holds out hope
for a change of heart, even if not this year: ``You never say
never.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Four Musketeer spirit, Gullikson says, ``I think they're
at a place where their place in tennis is secure. There's not that
intense competition of earlier days. They can relax and enjoy
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And the catalyst was Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the Davis Cup ties in my six years as captain,'' says
Gullikson, ``this is the most talked-about.''
</P>
<P>
   It has eclipsed even the peak achievement of his Cup reign, the
victory over Russia in 1995 that gave the United States the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in December,'' says Gullikson. ``There was football,
basketball, hockey going on. We got hardly any coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Now one measly first-round melodrama has transformed the Cup
into an Event. When the United States tries to raze Rafter _ and
Philippoussis and Woodforde and Woodbridge _ at Longwood, Gullikson
gleefully anticipates unprecedented attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they sold out all the seats at Longwood in 51
minutes,'' he says. ``That's why they had something like 20,000
calls in the first two hours after tickets went on sale. I've never
seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest is so great that Gullikson can't escape it. Before
coming here, he took his family on a cruise to the British Virgin
Islands _ ``My Wimbledon warmup,'' he says _ and he couldn't walk
into a pub without someone wanting to belly up to the Cup. ``The
people all were talking about it,'' he says. ``Especially the
American sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining. This is an idyllic time to be the
Davis Cup captain, usually a thankless position. The situation is
almost perfect for Gullikson. Only one thing could make it better,
but he knows he can't have that.
</P>
<P>
   Tim won't be there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of twins, they were inseparable. Tim and
Tom Gullikson basically were weaned on tennis. Tom remembers that
at age 5, when they became particularly rambunctious, their mother
would haul them across the street to the La Crosse branch of the
University of Wisconsin, which featured eight courts and a practice
wall _ the perfect toys to keep the boys from driving her crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we were 8, we were pretty good,'' says Tom. ``We
became court rats. We had each other to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Always, and in all sports. They didn't focus on tennis, playing
baseball, football, and basketball in season, in La Crosse and then
Onalaska, where the family moved when they were 12. At Northern
Illinois University, both played freshman basketball. And in
tennis, they became All-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But playing it for a living didn't occur to them, as much as
they loved the game. Tom coached his alma mater for a year, then
moved to the Chicago area as a teaching pro. Tim also was a
teaching pro, but he supplemented his income by playing _ and
winning _ some local events, whose fields included the occasional
ATP touring pro. Eventually, he persuaded some local businessmen to
bankroll him on the major league circuit.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Tom saw that his brother was experiencing some
success and figured, ``I can do that.'' He bet the house on his
ability, for there were no sponsors for him. He and his wife,
Julie, a schoolteacher, used the money they'd set aside for a
mortgage to fund Tom's ATP endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   They became decent journeymen despite their late start. Between
them, they won five singles titles _ Tom's came at Newport in 1985
_ and a dozen doubles. Tim reached the No. 18 ranking in singles;
Tom peaked in the 30s. In doubles, they cracked the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what helped us was having been teaching pros,'' says
Tom. ``Nobody had coaches traveling with them back then; there
wasn't enough money in it. But as teaching pros, we'd look for
players' weaknesses, discuss them, decide how to attack them.''
</P>
<P>
   They split for a year in 1982, ``when we got sick of one another
for a while,'' says Tom, but for the most part, the tour was just
an extension of La Crosse and Onalaska for them. They were together
more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim was the extremist,'' says Tom. ``He was always reading
books, trying new things. Every day with him was an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   They became known for their hustle and diligence, as players who
always gave it their best, never tanked. ``The Midwestern work
ethic,'' says Tom. ``I think that's what helped us as coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   That was their career path after their playing days ended in the
late '80s. Tom joined the US Tennis Association teaching program,
tutored the likes of Courier and Martin, and after Tom Gorman
announced his retirement as Davis Cup captain at the US Open in
1993, he got the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first tie as captain was in India in '94,'' he
says. ``Pete and Andre took a pass. I wondered who in the world I
could get to go. I called Jimbo, and the first thing he said was,
`Who else can we get?' He and Todd were there. They've always been
there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Tim assumed an even higher profile. He took
over as Sampras's coach, developed his grass game, and transformed
him into a Wimbledon champion, a Grand Slam perennial, the finest
player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the separation process began for the brothers, and
there was no stopping it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Australian Open, Tim began experiencing savage headaches.
Eventually, he couldn't leave his hotel room to attend Sampras's
matches. Finally, he flew home, where his condition was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four inoperable brain tumors,'' says Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras wept openly on a court in Melbourne after hearing the
news. Tom spent as much time as he could with his brother for the
next year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough, seeing him deteriorate,'' says Tom. ``I
couldn't do anything for him. I felt helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim died May 3, 1996, six months after Tom captured the Cup. In
his memory, Tom established the Tim and Tom Gullikson Foundation to
assist brain tumor patients and their families. As a further
memorial, he continues to run the Davis Cup team ``year by year,''
he says. ``As long as the players want me, I'd like to do it. If
they don't, I'll graciously step aside. I like the tennis, but not
the politics and recruiting calls.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing he won't abandon, no matter what his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of Tim every day,'' says Gullikson. ``I draw
inspiration from him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   So his team will have a surplus at Longwood.

`FIELD OF DREAMS' ENABLES ABCD TO GRANT SOME WISHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow keeps floating way above 10,000. It's hard to get a
dinner reservation at your favorite chic South End restaurant. And
isn't it time to think about trading in that '97 sedan you're
driving for a gadget-laden SUV?
</P>
<P>
   These are not concerns for the clients of Action For Boston
Community Development, otherwise known as ABCD. The economy is
chugging away at a record rate, but a few people have been left
back at the station. They are honest and hard-working, but for one
reason or another no one has punched their ticket. And that's where
ABCD, America's oldest-running anti-poverty organization, has been
stepping in for more than three decades. From Head Start to Fuel
Assistance, to Elderly Assistance, to dozens of valuable programs,
ABCD tries to be there for forgotten Americans of all races.
</P>
<P>
   With government funding not as reliable as it once was, ABCD
needs fresh sources of income to service its constituency. The
group found one last year. It was entitled ``Field of Dreams,'' and
it was a huge success in every way. Thanks to the extraordinary
generosity of Red Sox CEO John Harrington, a long-time ABCD
supporter, Fenway Park was made available. A dozen corporations
brought teams to play in a round-robin softball tournament. It is a
very safe statement to say that a good time was had by all, so much
so that most of the people who put teams out there last year are
looking forward to Aug. 6, when ``Field of Dreams II'' will take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a blast,'' says David Newton, who played first base for
Prudential Securities. Newton, an industrial bond salesman, put his
team together by securing interested people from his best clients.
``My only problem was that we got beat early,'' he says. ``This
year we're coming back with a stronger team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, competition. This supposedly benign affair does bring out
the Ty Cobb in the investment people, doctors, lawyers, and even
professional athletes (e.g. the Colorado Avalanche's Chris Drury,
who played for Preferred Temps) who will come together at Updike's
``lyric little bandbox of a ballpark'' five weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' says Newton. ``We had guys sliding headfirst
into home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Just being on the field where Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Yaz, and
Nomar have roamed brings out the little boy in just about
everybody. ``We had the feeling Fenway Park was ours,'' points out
Dr. George Thibault, the vice president of Clinical Affairs for
Partners Health Care, who proudly wore a number 6 last year in
honor of Stan Musial. ``It's a shrine to many of us who once
aspired to be ballplayers.'' This year's Partners team will be
co-captained by Dr. Denny Ausiello, the chief of medicine at
Massachusetts General Hospital, who caught for Harvard; and Dr. Pat
O'Gara, the director of clinical cardiology at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, who co-captained the Yale nine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thibault's team played in the first game last year shortly
after 8 a.m. ``It was a magical moment,'' he reports. ``It's one
thing to see the ballpark at night, but another to see it early in
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A major event like this doesn't just happen. Start with the Red
Sox, of course. Then factor in the superb organizational skill of
the Massachusetts Sports Partnership and the tireless efforts of
Becky Collet, the manager of sports marketing at John Hancock. This
year's tri-chairmen are Lou Eisenberg of Cosgrove, Eisenberg and
Kiley; Fred Bertino of Hill, Holliday; and the ubiquitous John
Sasso of Advance Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to give the players and corporations more bang for
their playing buck, the format has been altered this year. Rather
than a round-robin tournament, each team will play one six-inning
game, which will result in everyone getting a couple of at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Twins Enterprises will donate hats. JUGGS will provide two
softball pitching machines. Franklin will supply the softballs and
batting gloves. Aramark will provide a full menu at the concession
stand behind home plate. MASCO will take care of parking.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox even go so far as to provide a complete Fenway Park
batting experience. As each man comes to the plate, his picture
will be posted on the big screen in center field. How's that for
goose bumps?
</P>
<P>
   ``For my anniversary,'' says Eisenberg, a stalwart ABCD
supporter, ``my wife gave me photos of me at third base, me at the
plate, and my photo up on the board. How about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the depth of someone's baseball interest, the day
can be a spiritual experience. Take, for example, Charlie Orcutt,
president of Preferred Temps. ``You get to warm up in the visiting
bullpen. I was thinking, `This is where Al Luplow made that
phenomenal catch off Dick Williams in '65,' '' he says. It is
almost a given that Orcutt is the single most passionate CEO who
will be fielding a team. He attended Dave Morehead's no-hitter, and
he insists when the game started on that September afternoon there
were no more than 1,700 people in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   There are other revelations in store. ``I learned that the
infield dirt isn't as soft as you might think,'' says Eisenberg.
``It's more like cinder.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes it all work is the fact that the ultimate
beneficiary is ABCD. ``We feel very strongly about ABCD,'' says
John Hancock president David D'Allesandro, whose team will be back
for a second year. ``I'm not saying that universities, for example,
aren't worthy recipients of donations, but endowments are up
everywhere, whereas federal dollars are hard for someone like ABCD
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've never been one who believes in just writing checks,''
D'Allesandro continues. ``That's why the `Field of Dreams' is so
good for us. I feel when you can get employees involved, everyone
benefits. I think the people who play will get a lot more out of it
knowing they are helping a great cause. We at John Hancock have
literally hundreds of people who would like to be stepping on that
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Call 617 375-6000, extension 238. Meghan Sayce might be able to
help your Fenway-worshipping employees step on that grass.

BAUMHAUER LEADS ANOTHER CHARGE UP HAMBURGER HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As any diner or investor will tell you, there is steak and then
there is hamburger. This is a story about hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year after he resigned as chief executive of Unique
Casual Restaurants Inc., William Baumhauer has returned to again
lead the struggling Danvers, Mass. company. It isn't clear whether
that makes his biggest shareholder very happy.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief time he has been gone, Unique shares have sunk
further and management just barely headed off a proxy fight with
dissident stockholders who wanted to dismantle what was left of the
company and turn off the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhauer was the man who built Unique and its predecessor, Daka
International Inc., into a modest food-service empire that included
more than 200 dinner-on-a-budget Fuddruckers restaurants and
watched it later run into serious trouble. Like other Unique
executives, he did not return our calls this week.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhauer resigned last year to play an unusual long shot:
turning around the imploding Planet Hollywood International Inc.,
an eatery with glitzy movie-star investors but terrible business
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   He hired on as Planet Hollywood's president, working for chief
executive Robert Earl, with a compensation package that was highly
dependent on a stock turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhauer loaded up on 750,000 stock options with an exercise
price of $5 each. When Planet Hollywood shares continued to sink,
the options were repriced at $2.50 by the end of last year. If that
sounds like a sweet deal, consider Planet Hollywood's closing price
Thursday: 75 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives have been jumping ship ever since Planet
Hollywood blew a $15 million interest payment on April 1. The
company negotiated with lenders to restructure terms of its secured
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Now Baumhauer, an accountant by training, is presented with
perhaps the strangest turn of all since he got into the food
business 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He joined a young Fuddruckers business as its chief financial
officer in 1982, helped bring the company public the next year and
became president in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Boom and bust cycles followed and by 1988 he merged the company
with a small Massachusetts food service company and hotel business
to form what became known as Daka International. If you work at a
big company in Greater Boston, Daka may have once run your office
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Daka stock soared in the mid-1990s thanks to aggressive
expansion but fell hard in 1996, when it became clear the company
had overextended itself with an arrangement to provide food service
for Kmart Corp.'s stores, which numbered more than 1,800 at the
time. The deal fizzled before it ever got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Then next year, Baumhauer sold off the company's contract for
business to British caterer Compass PLC for $195 million in cash
and assumed debt. Unique Casual Restaurants was formed as a public
company to own the rest of the business, principally the
Fuddruckers restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a runaway success, and two weeks after Baumhauer
jumped to Planet Hollywood, Unique announced plans to sell its
204-store Fuddruckers group for $43 million. The announced goal was
to put more money into another, smaller budget restaurant chain it
owned in the Midwest, Champps Americana, but analysts immediately
speculated on the breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Unique's chief financial officer, Donald Moore, was put in
charge of the company on an interim basis and Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.
was brought in to help figure out what to do with the rest of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Moore quickly ran afoul of his largest shareholder, Atticus
Partners of New York, which owns about 16 percent of the company
and believed the interim CEO was getting too comfortable with his
new job and improved salary.
</P>
<P>
   Atticus Partners launched a proxy fight to take control of the
board, complaining that Moore appeared to be working on _ gasp! _ a
plan to rebuild the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to see the company's coffers, full of
stockholders' money, depleted in an ill-conceived plan proposed by
a manager with little experience running, much less quickly
growing, this type of business,'' wrote Timothy Barakett, a
managing member of Atticus Holdings. Barakett did not return our
call Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy fight was headed off by compromise in March. The board
was expanded by two to accommodate Barakett and another
Atticus-picked director. Barakett and one director from the
existing board would form a strategic committee of two to plot the
future of the company and its top executives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Unique says it has decided to remain independent, with
Moore back to his old job. And Baumhauer has his work cut out for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On fire? The initial public stock offering of Yankee Candle Co.
hit the market Thursday and jumped 34 percent to 24 1/8. The
Whatley, Mass. company, which makes and sells scented candles,
ended its first day of trading with a stock market value of about
$1.3 billion.

YOU CAN STILL FIND ESCAPE IN THE NORTH COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you pull into God's Country Acres campground ready for a
little wilderness therapy and the Winnebego next to you (parked so
close you and they can't open doors at the same time) keeps a TV
blasting. And those Jay Leno jokes are even lamer in summer reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Or you pitch your tent and get ready to snooze under the stars
and the whoops of a kegger orgy down on the riverbank rise to a din
when a battle ensues over whether the Knicks are a basketball team
or a bunch of thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what's bothering you just a little bit as this last
summer of the millennium gets underway?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is there aren't many places in New England where the
traditions of simplicity, quality, and beauty have not been glommed
over by fast-junk restaurants, trendy T-shirt shops, and ``trading
posts'' dealing authentic made-in-Taiwan Indian goods.
</P>
<P>
   Not that theme parks and scenic railroad rides don't have their
place in The Great American Vacation. But some souls still long for
the real unbesmirched outdoor experience where man meets a nature
that can still humble him, fill him with awe and unconditional
appreciation. There are still a few such places left. Here's a
six-pack:
</P>
<P>
   --While much of the Cape and the islands suffer from the
ceaseless development pressure caused by the effects of the
10-thou-Dow, there are a few getaways protected from Bochanization
of all places desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Although Provincetown is a summer tourist mecca with the best
restaurants on the Cape, the beaches of the National Seashore are
devoid of crowds in proportion to how far one is willing to walk
the beach. At some points along the 26-mile stretch from the
Province Lands Visitor Center and Nauset Beach in Orleans, the
walker is utterly alone with the open Atlantic, whose rhythmic
surging roll invites the muse that inspired writers from Thoreau to
Jack Kerouac, Eugene O'Neill, and Tennessee Williams, all of whom
stayed in squatters' shacks.
</P>
<P>
   Roughing it away from the crowds means hiking the strand, taking
your entire life-support needs with you, and that should include
lots of water. There are developed beaches _ Head of the Meadow
(Truro), Newcomb's Hollow (Wellfleet) along the way _ but the
passage between them is many miles where almost no one goes.
</P>
<P>
   --Every traffic jam that occurs after every ferry that arrives
at Martha's Vineyard reminds one of the hungry hordes of barberi
who swarmed across the frozen Rhine River trying to get their own
piece of beauteous Rome. Their sheer numbers changed unalterably
that which they desired.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, for this reason, Vineyard natives have restricted their
best beaches (Lucy Vincent and Squibnocket) to pass holders.
Temporary passes are available at some hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But travelers looking for the best Vineyard experience should
leave cars home and bike their way to the On Time _ Chappaquidick
Ferry. From here the Wasque Reservation and beach is quite nice,
generally uncrowded, and like the Cape Cod National Seashore, lends
itself to a long walk away from this world, temporary living on the
shore of Nantucket Sound. Repeat suggestion: Do not bring a car.
Buses and sandals can take you anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   --Nantucket's turf war is between the super-rich and the
mega-rich, but in stark contrast to the Vineyard the island has
managed to keep more than 100 miles of its coastline open to the
public. Despite the growing tackiness of downtown Nantucket, there
are still beaches on this island that rate as true getaways. Cisco,
on the southwest shore, is not one of them, but the stretch from
there west to Madaket boasts the best surf in Massachusetts,
perhaps New England. The farther west you walk, the more alone you
will be, where the pounding surf often deters families and large
groups with children.
</P>
<P>
   This 4-mile stretch between Cisco and Madaket is a more private
experience, and a better body surfing one than even Surfside Beach
itself, which gets crowded. Siasconset is tamer, and very
beautiful. Again, to enjoy the Nantucket experience, leave the car
at home. Bikes are perfect transportation here. Get it while it
lasts!
</P>
<P>
   --Leaping north, we find a New England enclave as beautiful as
it is poor. The late Vermont senator, George Aiken, named the
``Northeast Kingdom'' _ a tract of wilderness and farmland bordered
on the east by the Connecticut River and west by the 4,000-foot Jay
Peak, which stands out sharply like an obilisk. Mephremagog, a deep
30-mile long glacial lake that runs between Newport, Vt., well into
Quebec, draws the northern border, and the town of St. Johnsbury
and its environs mark the south.
</P>
<P>
   While Newport is a well-traveled region, drop down through the
rolling countryside to magnificent Lake Willoughby along Route 5A.
This is another deep lake surrounded by fabulous wilderness camping
once you wander away from the development surrounding the immediate
shore.
</P>
<P>
   Willoughby has a natural fjord at its southern end, created by
the abrupt rise of two mountains _ Pisgah and Hor. Hiking and
camping on these heights is as good as it gets. There's plenty of
room to park and leave a vehicle to hike into the woods. Do use
maps (DeLormes are best). The nearby towns of Island Pond, Orleans,
and Barton are also gateways to tremendous wilderness camping and
hiking.
</P>
<P>
   --Leave New Hampshire's Six Gun City and other White Mountain
blights at your back as you head north along Routes 145 and 3, way
up into the narrow neck of the state that inserts itself between
the forestland of Quebec to the west and Maine east.
</P>
<P>
   This lyrical land of green hills and deep water is the rise of
the 400-mile Connecticut River that runs south through four states
to Long Island Sound. The stars swing low here at night, for there
are no motel lights, curbside malls, nor even curbs or
streetlights, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The camping opportunities range from authentically rustic
fishing camps to organized camper parks, to random wilderness
everywhere. Hike into the Quebec borderland around Fourth Lake for
a real getaway _ accessible from Route 3. Or trek along the east
shore of First Connecticut Lake or Lake Francis for some of the
most beautiful unspoiled lakeside tenting, canoeing, fishing,
hiking you will find anywhere. Again, use topo maps and talk to the
locals.
</P>
<P>
   --The most effective conservationist in New England history was
Percival Baxter, who, in his tenure as governor of Maine, amassed a
tract of 201,000 acres of prime wilderness in central Maine and
made it a gift to his beloved state. The deed required only that
the land, Baxter State Park, be maintained forever in its natural
state. This very mandate makes Baxter, not an undiscovered
backwater, but an unspoiled region with many opportunities for
privacy and wilderness getaways.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelmingly dominant feature of the park is mile-high
Katahdin, a mountain that invites hiking by experts and
intermediates as well. Lots of hikers _ including Appalachian Trail
through-hikers _ are found around Katahdin, but those looking for
solitude should make tracks farther north into the vast lake
country known as Allagash Wilderness Waterway that offers getaway
camping and hiking almost at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   The big North Woods country is a serious undertaking, and should
be planned and well-mapped. Gravel-packed logging roads allow
access to the woods for nearly 100 miles north of Baxter. The
Forest Service and lumber companies that own this country will
require sign-in/sign-out for autos, and Baxter has a daily quota,
so call ahead.

ATTEMPT AT DIVERSIFICATION FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 04, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a state employee and have the opportunity to invest in a
deferred compensation plan. I contribute the maximum allowed, $150
a week, which is divided between Fidelity Growth and Income and
Fidelity Growth Company funds. My choices were random picks with no
rationale. I often wonder if I should have two funds with similar
names, or whether I should have chosen something else. The other
options were an income fund, a short-term investment fund, George
Putnam Fund of Boston, and Calvert Social Investment, Vanguard
Wellington, AIM Charter, Vanguard Institutional Index, AIM
Weingarten, AIM Constellation, and Templeton International funds,
or a life insurance investment. I have never had advice or talked
with anybody about these options. I am 53 years old and my home
will be paid off in eight years. I would like to retire by age 65.
</P>
<P>
   B.R., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your suspicion that your two holdings are too similar is well
founded, in my opinion. While Fidelity Growth and Income maintains
a balanced portfolio dominated by large-cap domestic stocks and
Fidelity Growth Company's portfolio is dominated by large domestic
growth-oriented stocks, there's not enough difference between the
two to provide you with very meaningful diversification.
</P>
<P>
   But before you begin making changes, we'll have to determine
when you're likely to call on this money. Let's consider two
possible intentions. One is that you'll let this money grow until
you retire and then put it to work to supply an income stream to
augment your retirement income. The second is that you'll be able
to get along on your retirement income in the early years of
retirement, and view this building fund as your buffer against
inflation when you're in your seventies and later.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the first case, your period of investment for growth in
principal will be shorter, and therefore you should be a little
more cautious. So I'd begin now by taking a tiny step toward the
kind of portfolio you'll eventually want, which is to have a
portfolio dominated by fixed-income issues twelve years from now.
But since 12 years is still a pretty long time, I'd start with a
baby step, putting perhaps a third of your ongoing contributions
into Vanguard Wellington, a fund which divides its portfolio
between stocks and bonds, with about a third of its assets on the
fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you don't expect to use this money to
produce income at the time of retirement and anticipate waiting
some years after retirement to draw upon it, I'd swap some of the
Growth Company shares for positions in AIM Constellation, a mid-cap
growth fund, and in Templeton International, so as to give you
better balance. I'd look for an overall portfolio balance which
consisted of 50 percent in Fidelity Growth and Income, with the
balance evenly divided among Fidelity Growth Company, AIM
Constellation, and Templeton International.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 38 years old and contribute $6,000 a year to a 401(k)
plan with no company match. Currently I have $15,000 in the plan,
with the money invested in Fidelity's Growth and Income,
Contrafund, Magellan and Overseas funds. In addition I have a Roth
IRA of $6,000 with Vanguard, invested in the Index 500, Health Care
and Horizon Aggressive Growth funds. I will continue the 401(k)
contributions and add $2,000 a year to the Roth IRA until I retire
at age 60. Are my choices diverse enough? What changes would you
make? How much will I have saved when I retire?
</P>
<P>
   J. A., Leominster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. To start with the last question, if we assume the ongoing
contributions and 10 percent average annual growth, the grand total
would be $768,219. But I think you'd have a better chance of
getting there if you improved your portfolio diversification.
</P>
<P>
   You don't spell out the amounts in each fund, but four of the
seven funds hold similar portfolios -- Fidelity Growth and Income,
Contrafund and Magellan as well as Vanguard Index 500 all hold
portfolios that represent a blend of growth and value large cap
stocks. Since three of these are in the 401(k) account where three
quarter of the contributions are going, it seems to me that what is
already an over reliance on this market sector will soon become a
serious overweighting. If I were you, I would swap Fidelity
Magellan for Fidelity OTC fund, and Vanguard Index 500 for Vanguard
Small-Cap Index.
</P>
<P>
   As for your fund selections, all seem solid to me with one
exception -- Vanguard Aggressive Growth (as the Horizon fund was
renamed late last year). This fund seems to me not to have lived up
to its promise; perhaps aggressive investing just doesn't match
Vanguard's style. Morningstar Mutual Funds now classifies its
portfolio as mid-cap value, which seems an unlikely focus for
aggressive growth. Although it has returned nearly 10 percent so
far this year, I'd look back to the scant .55 percent total return
of 1998, its two-star rating from Morningstar, and make a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's Mid-Cap Index seems to me a better bet. If you make
the changes I suggest, the effect is that all the holdings in the
Roth IRA will serve as minor themes to the overall portfolio, with
large-cap dominance continuing in the IRA, plus the minor themes in
mid-cap stocks (the OTC fund) and international stocks through
Fidelity Overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In suggesting these changes, I'm presuming that the holdings in
the various accounts are more or less equal. If not, I'd move
things around so the diversification works out like this: 50
percent in the large-cap funds which are now so dominant, 20
percent in mid-cap funds, and 10 percent each in small-cap,
international and health care.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have noticed that you frequently advise people to put money
in Fidelity Select Health Care fund. I am considering putting some
money in this fund, but have three main concerns. First, the fund's
managers are quite young and seem to have no prior experience in
the health care industry -- both were previously in charge of
totally unrelated funds. Second, the fund seems to be heavily
invested in pharmaceutical companies. Even though they can be very
profitable, wouldn't a fund invested in a broader cross-section of
the health care industry be better? Lastly, there has been much
talk about greater government regulation of health care. Were the
government to impose any price controls, the profitability of the
industry would be greatly affected. I realize that such regulations
may never come, but the possibility cannot be ignored. What are
your thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   R.M., Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Taking your points in order, I'll begin with the fund manager
issue. What you're seeing in the managers' career histories is
simply a reflection of the way Fidelity is organized. The fund
family makes it a practice to move managers through a diverse
investment disciplines, changing their jobs frequently and giving
them experience in a lot of different kind of markets. Do I think
it's ideal? No -- before it closed, my choice among the health care
funds was Vanguard Specialized Health Care, where the manager has
been at the job for more than 15 years. But on the other hand,
Fidelity's track record with its musical chairs approach to fund
management has been very good, and so has the record of this fund,
despite the relatively frequent change of fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, when I look at a heath care fund, what I don't want is a
portfolio touching all the industry bases. Funds which devote
significant parts of their portfolio to health care delivery
companies -- hospitals, HMOs and the like-- and to biotechnology
issues offer more risk than I an willing to assume. Fidelity Select
Health Care, like Vanguard Health Care and a few others, gives
short shrift to these industries, and to me that is a plus. Besides
for pharmaceuticals, the Fidelity funds also focuses on companies
making health care equipment, which is another end of the industry
where growth prospects appear very good to me.
</P>
<P>
   The government regulation issue is, of course troubling. And
anybody who has been following pharmaceutical stocks for the past
couple of months knows, these issues are under a lot of pressure as
politicians debate the cost of prescription drugs. I guess my
summary would be this -- the government has tried before to control
the health care industry, with very small concrete results. My
guess is that the latest efforts will end up much as previous ones
did. But, reflecting this final and considerable element of risk,
please note that when I recommend health care funds, I suggest that
they represent only a small percentage of a long-term portfolio.

<P>
   Worcester, Mass. _ The silver key dangles from a nail just
inside the door of Naim Bujubaj's barren flat in a working-class
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   For Bujubaj, a 26-year-old refugee, it is unclear whether it is
the key to his past or his future.
</P>
<P>
   It opens the door to his apartment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to use it,'' he said, squinting to try to hide his
tears. ``But I'm 90 percent certain that I will never be able to
use it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bujubaj's dilemma _ whether to return to his home or build a new
life in the United States _ has taken on new urgency in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO troops moved into Kosovo June 12, a growing number of
Kosovo refugees _ including many of the 329 who have resettled in
Massachusetts _ are considering returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go back, but I don't know how,'' said Zahir
Bacaliu, another Kosovar who recently settled in Worcester. ``If I
go back now, my house is burned and I don't know where I'd live.
</P>
<P>
   Those working with the refugees say Kosovars have a visceral tie
to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, they have fought so much for Kosovo,'' said
Albana Orgockacq, a social worker at the International Institute of
Boston, which has resettled about 65 Kosovars. ``If something could
change, they have to go back and be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 Kosovars have arrived in the United States since the
conflict began, said Eyleen Schmidt, a spokeswoman for the US
Immigration and Refugee Service, a branch of the Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Another 7,000 Kosovars in Macedonia have been approved to come
to the United States, but thousands of those refugees have returned
home instead, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have in my life is in Kosovo,'' Bacaliu said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacaliu24, left his corn farm in Kijeva, Kosovo, in May with his
mother, wife, two children, cousin and cousin's family after Serb
soliders ordered them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Their next journey, the Bacalius hope, will be a return to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like America, but I like my place more,'' said
XhemalBacaliu, Zahir's 27-year-old cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bay State social service agencies, including Lutheran
Social Services of New England, Catholic Charities and the
International Rescue Committee, have provided Kosovar refugees
financial assistance, temporary housing, job leads, and English
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO declares Kosovo a safe place, the United States will
allocate enough funds for the return trip home for all refugees who
choose to go back, Schmidt said. The free flight offer, however,
expires six months after Kosovo is deemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will have the right to apply for permanent resident
status.
</P>
<P>
   Luan Shala, 47, a music teacher and trombone player from
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, won't go back no matter how safe NATO
makes Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to live here and start a new life,'' said the
refugee who arrived in Worcester on June 23. ``I'm very afraid of
mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Shala was forced to leave his Pristina apartment May 5. ``The
paramilitary came with machine guns and told us to go to the
railroad station,'' said Shala, who continues searching for
information about his missing brother in Kosovo. ``They took our
money, our passports, any documents we had.''
</P>
<P>
   They gave him five minutes to gather all his belongings.
</P>
<P>
   That's three minutes longer than Naim Bujubaj had to pack his
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Bujubaj knew his departure was imminent. Just days before he
left, he found a cross in front of his door with the word ``dead''
scrawled across it. As he lay down to sleep that night, he thought
to himself, ``I think tomorrow I will be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks ago he, his sister, and his 24-year-old cousin,
Abediu Bujubaj arrived at Fort Dix, N.J., each with one bag holding
everything they now own.
</P>
<P>
   In better times, at the University of Pristina, Naim Bujubaj
studied economics while Abediu Bujubaj studied computers and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   They want to further their education in the United States so
they can master English. But they withdrew from Worcester
Polytechnic Institute because the aid they are receiving can barely
cover food costs, $550 a month rent, and utilities. They have
nothing left for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to stay here now,'' Abediu said. ``After this, we
will see what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the refugees, the Bujubaj cousins fear returning
while Russian troops remain in their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbian people and Russian people are the same,'' Abediu said.
</P>
<P>
   Naim doesn't know if his apartment back home is still standing
or _ as he believes likely _ was torched or looted by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   But he still won't throw away the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I escaped was the second time I was born,'' Naim said.
``I'd like to take the key to remember.''

ANTS NOT THE CAUSE OF SAGGING FLAGSTONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 04, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Our exterior flagstone terrace sags because ants diligently
remove sand from under the flat stones. Stonemasons have no
suggestions. A plastic layer on top of the sand would hold water,
and freeze. How about a layer of poison under the stones? What
poison?
</P>
<P>
   NAT PULSIFER, Ipswich, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, don't use a poison; it will not last long enough to be
of help. Second, I don't think it's the work of the ants that is
causing the sagging, but rather the sand was not tamped enough when
the stones were installed, so the stones dropped. I think the
solution is to lift the stones, install more sand and compact it
very thoroughly, then relay the stones.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic under the stones will deter the growth of weeds, but it
won't deter the ants. If you use plastic, use perforated plastic
for water to drain through, or an agricultural cloth, which also
allows water to drain. If you want to keep ahead of the ants, and
they are obvious on the terrace or their little hills are obvious,
douse them with boiling water twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the new house I am buying, the contractor used a Masonite
clapboard, rough side out and painted. Is that material any good,
or is there anything wrong with it?
</P>
<P>
   PAT LANGUZZI, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Masonite is a brand name for hardboard, a composite of ground
wood and epoxy pressed into a thin, hard sheet or board. There are
several other brands. It has a lot of good uses, but not, in my
opinion, as siding. As with all ersatz siding, it does not work as
well as wood, and must be kept heavily painted to stand up to the
weather. It is particularly susceptable to water. In fact, some
manufacturers are defendants in class-action suits over premature
failure and decay of the material. The above are opinions, but if I
were you, I would not buy that house, although you could take a
chance and hope the hardboard will last 15 or 20 years (not long
for siding). Then rip it off and put up cedar clapboards, red cedar
shingles and stain them, or white cedar shingles and let them
weather without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have been struggling for years to find a good
substitute for wood, cedar in particular. First they tried asphalt
siding (double ugh!), then asbestos cement (a health hazard if not
left alone), aluminum siding (it dents and loses its paint over
time), and vinyl (just ugly). Even now they are making an
asbestos-free mineral siding (clapboards and shingles), and the
publicists are singing its praises. It ain't wood.
</P>
<P>
   There are concerns that we are running out of wood, but other
sources say there is still plenty, and more can be grown. The only
substitute for wood is brick, and it is not really a substitute. If
you have a chance to buy a brick house, and can afford it, do so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a place on Cotuit Beach with a driveway and some areas
with 3/4-inch crushed stone. Weeds are growing like crazy through
it. I tried Roundup (an herbicide) but it lasts only two months. A
friend suggested using rock salt. What will work?
</P>
<P>
   JOE CALLAHAN, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could put agricultural cloth or perforated black plastic
under the crushed stone. This may last a while, but not forever.
Don't use salt; it will contaminate everything it touches. Bleach
will work, but you'd have to use a lot of it; bleach breaks down to
a harmless element when it comes in contact with the earth, but I
am not convinced it is that safe.
</P>
<P>
   So, try vinegar. It has worked for many persons with weeds
coming up through brick and flagstone patios. It is like acid rain,
but vinegar in the ground is probably least hazardous to the
environment and nearby plants. A treatment in the spring, when the
weeds emerge, should last all summer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband stained our red cedar shingles. First he washed
them down with bleach and water, which splattered on the windows,
causing indelible stains. I tried Clearvue (a super cleaner)
without success. Also unsucessful was Fantastic, paint thinner,
ammonia, and Spic and Span. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   JOAN LOVELY, Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. About the ony thing left is vinegar. Or Bug &AMP; Tar Remover,
designed to remove things from auto chrome and finishes. Or, as a
last result, try Never Dull Magic Wadding, sold in hardware and
building stores. It is designed to clean metal, but will also work
for glass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My gas burner for central heating is original with the house,
built 45 years ago. It's working OK, and a gas man said as long as
I clean it regularly, it will last forever. A plumber disagreed
with this advice, suggesting that I replace it when I can. Who's
right.
</P>
<P>
   G. McCULLOCH, Roslindale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. They both are. How's that for evading the question?
``Forever'' is a long time, but as long as the burner is working
well, and the heating bills are tolerable, keep it. It ain't broke,
so you don't have to fix it. On the other hand, a burner 45 years
old is probably not as efficient as modern burners, so the option
is to replace it when you feel like it or can afford it. I don't
think the need is urgent.

KERRY LOOKS BEYOND THE 2000 CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- ``I'm feeling a little decadent this morning,'' says
US Senator John F. Kerry. To prove it, he orders a Belgian waffle _
crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, another steam bath of a Boston day is heating up.
Inside, at a Four Seasons breakfast, everything is properly chilled
_ the air temperature, the atmosphere, the grapefruit juice.
Everything, surprisingly, except Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth's junior senator is warmer face-to-face than
his TV persona, dubbed ``the grinch'' by my 10-year-old son. He's
relaxed, whether exchanging pleasantries with Steven Grossman,
former national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, or
talking about the Republicans and their lack of a national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As Kerry and all Democrats know, the GOP does have one firm
agenda item: to recapture the White House. At the moment,
Republican hopes and prayers are vested in George W. Bush, the
Texas governor and son of a former president, whose life
intersected briefly with Kerry's at Yale. Did they know each other
as undergraduates? ``We crossed paths. Are there pictures of us
dancing naked on a bar together? No. I don't have that,'' Kerry
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Since politics is a game of possibilities, it is possible these
two might have crossed paths again on the campaign trail. But then
Kerry announced last February that he was taking himself out of the
running in the race for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is not about to publicly bemoan his decision. But you know
he knows the obvious. The nation's rallying around President
Clinton during last winter's impeachment trial had little to do
with respect for the man and everything to do with respect for the
office. Fallout from the Monica Lewinsky scandal greatly diminishes
Clinton during the final months of his final term. It also hurts
Vice President Al Gore, who looks much less formidable today than
he did when Kerry announced he would not join the field of
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I miscalculated how expensive it would be. Maybe it
would have cost $15 million instead of $25 million,'' muses Kerry.
But he doesn't sound too regretful about his decision, and why
should he? If you're Kerry, you're thinking the future could still
be very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gore will win the nomination and the presidency. But Gore
could also lose to Bush. Then the nation and the GOP will learn the
truth about ``compassionate conservatism.'' With politics the game
of possibilities it always is, it is possible neither the nation
nor the GOP will like the reality very much. If they don't, it is
quite possible the younger Bush could follow in his father's
footsteps _ right out of the White House after one term. If that
happens, why couldn't Kerry be the Democrat chosen to march back
in?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the future brings,'' Kerry says from
Washington, when asked about a 2004 scenario during a subsequent
telephone conversation. ``I'm open to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He shifts easily into national campaign-speak: ``We're in the
middle of a monumental transition, and most of our politics in
Washington is not grappling with what that means to the average
American. We're skirting around the problems.'' He defines one key
challenge as the daily conflict between work and family, between
parenting and trying to earn enough money to send our children to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, he says, is ``irrelevant to that in a sad way . . .
both parties to a degree.'' The irrelevancy, says Kerry, is rooted
in the cycle of rhetoric over action, of slogans over substantive
policy.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the centerpiece slogan of the burning-hot Bush
campaign _ ``compassionate conservatism''? Says Kerry: ``I'm
looking for the compassion on the Republican side right now. It
will interesting to see how that gets implemented . . . I'm tired
of slogans. I want to see the real program, the policy. I think
there's an incredible tension within their party that makes it
difficult to go beyond the slogan.''
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, Kerry would have to come up with specifics, too.
Now, he can just vent and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast in Boston, Kerry once again encounters Grossman,
the former national DNC head. They crack Yale and Princeton jokes
and the name of George W. Bush, the Ivy Leaguer in cowboy boots,
comes up once more. Kerry lifts his pant legs to display his
footwear. His shoes are shiny, sleek, and slightly tapered. They
are conventional, yes, but still capable, he could be saying, of
kicking a little butt.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time, senator?

THE BRAVE, UNYIELDING RADCLYFFE HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE TRIALS OF RADCLYFFE HALL 
By Diana Souhami 
Doubleday, 458 pp., illustrated, $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Radclyffe Hall had ambitious plans for ``The Well of
Loneliness,'' her grim saga about a woman who loves other women.
Used to the power and control conferred by independent wealth, she
was also ready to give polite society a poke in the eye. ``Having
attained literary success I have put my pen at the service of some
of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world. In a
word I have written a long and very serious novel entirely upon the
subject of sexual inversion. . . . So far as I know nothing of the
kind has ever been attempted before in fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hall was still not entirely prepared for the controversy
that erupted when her novel was published in England in 1928. The
British courts deemed it obscene, and copies were destroyed.
Support from the era's literary lights was tepid: Virginia Woolf
called it a ``meritorious dull book'' and E.M. Forster questioned
its literary worth. And Hall, who had been awarded the Prix Femina
for her novel ``Adam's Breed,'' was knocked off balance and would
never write anything as famous _ or infamous _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Souhami's tart, witty biography gives Hall her due in the
pantheon of gay and lesbian pioneers, but isn't about to nominate
her for sainthood. Truth and detail can be hard on heroes, and
Radclyffe Hall, known as ``John,'' is no exception. Entitled,
eccentric and reactionary, she adopted all the trappings of
Victorian patriarchy, down to the tweeds and sexual conquests. She
abjured feminism and modernism, yet she shocked the British
literary establishment by refusing to change pronouns or bend
gender. That wasn't enough to make her a great writer _ her plots
are sometimes implausible and her prose is tedious _ but it was
enough to keep ``Well of Loneliness'' in print for 70 years, and to
pave the way for bolder efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1880, Marguerite Radclyffe Hall was unwanted, uneducated
and dyslexic. Her parents divorced; her stepfather sexually abused
her. ``Dark forces informed her early years,'' Souhami writes.
``Abandonment elided with insecurity, hatred of her mother with
aggrandizement of herself. Unfairness called for justice and
violence for revenge.'' The patterns of her adult life began to
jell when she was 18, and her father died, leaving her a small
fortune. Already smitten by the young women who came to her
stepfather's house to take voice lessons, Hall used her money to
attain a kind of sexual freedom. ``She preferred to be known as
Peter, a sobriquet that did not stick. She swept her hair back from
her face, wore tailored clothes, wide-brimmed hats and plain but
expensive jewels. . . . Unmistakably lesbian, she was not going to
pretend a passing interest in men.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall pursued the life of a country squire and wrote sheaves of
bad poetry. Her life seemed unmarked by ambition or drive. In
August 1906, however, a trip to see a women's tennis tournament
changed her life. Watching the Wimbledon champion, Dorothea
Chambers, play a lesbian friend, Hall was introduced to Mabel
Batten. A buxom socialite with taste for luxury (and a closet full
of shoes), Batten was known for her very public misbehavior with
Edward, Prince of Wales. On holiday together with significant
others, Batten and Hall fell in love. The relationship would help
sustain Hall _ Batten edited Hall's first short stories _ until
Batten's death in 1916. It was Batten who gave Hall the name John,
which she used for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   But Batten, like other lovers in Hall's life, was doomed to be
one leg of a triangle. Hall carried on openly with Batten's cousin,
Una Troubridge, who ultimately usurped the role of amanuensis and
helpmeet. All her life, Hall seemed to build up stable
relationships in order to fracture them. Impulse control was never
a strong suit: She moved from country estates to London flats and
back again. She traveled Europe with a kind of moneyed mania, the
Lady Troubridge in tow. A Catholic convert, she indulged a lifetime
interest in the spirit world and consulted regularly with a psychic
medium. It's a wonder any writing got done at all.
</P>
<P>
   Like Oscar Wilde, Radclyffe Hall refused to wither away when
straight society condemned her. More than 70 years later, her
determination to defend her art and her own identity ring with a
clarity of purpose. She had the money and hubris to fight back.
Cast in the fine light of history, her testimony before a packed
gallery at Bow Street Magistrates Court looks courageous. ``Well of
Loneliness'' was published in Paris, and in the United States,
where the Society for the Suppression of Vice lost a censorship bid
in 1929. In fact, the book sold briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Hall lived until 1943. The fame she craved was forever tinged
with notoriety, but she holds an important place in the struggle
for the freedom of art and the freedom of thought. It's an
elevating legacy for a difficult and not always admirable woman.

MARKEY`S CYNICAL V-CHIP CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressman Ed Markey tried, unsuccessfully, to surf the
nuclear-freeze fad into the White House during the 1980s. Now he's
got a brand-new bag: dialing up the hype on the dopey ``V-chip,''
allying himself with prominent Democrats who are cynically preying
upon parents' insecurities after the Columbine High School
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Markey claims to have coined the term ``V-chip'' six years ago.
The V stands for ``violence,'' which the little semiconductor is
supposed to filter out of television broadcasts. After years of
wrangling, Markey and like-minded social engineers have browbeaten
the networks into adopting a ``voluntary'' ratings code. As of
Thursday, half of the TV sets made in America had to have the chip.
By January, all US televisions will have the device.
</P>
<P>
   Now Markey and newly minted family-value-crats like Connecticut
senator Joseph Lieberman (who, as Hartford Courant columnist Colin
McEnroe points out, pushes his ``values'' agenda in between the
anti-Semitic jokes on the Don Imus radio show) are trying to
Mau-Mau major newspaper publishers into printing the ratings codes.
In letters sent out earlier this week, Markey &AMP; Company urge
publishers to hop on the V-chip bandwagon, ``to assist parents in
your circulation area.'' By inference, newspapers that decline to
play along with Markey's charade will be deemed ``anti-family
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two major papers _ The Los Angeles Times and USA Today _
carry the full boat of age and content codes that the childless
Markey deems so important for parents to know about. (The V-chip
can be programmed without knowing the newspaper codes, a point that
Markey doesn't emphasize.) ``Dallas'' is content-coded ``LSV,''
alerting viewers to problems with language, sex, and violence. The
1955 Oscar-winning William Holden weeper, ``Love Is a Many
Splendored Thing,'' is coded ``violent'' on the American Movie
Classics channel. Give me a break!
</P>
<P>
   Some papers, like the Globe and The New York Times, print
partial parental guidelines. But other publishers have seen through
the hoax. Not only are the ratings ridiculous, the V-chip itself
has no supporters other than professional advocacy groups and
publicity-crazed politicians. According to a spokesperson, The
Washington Post's television editor has had two, possibly three,
inquiries about the V-chip ratings in the past 2 1/2 years. The
Post does not print the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bischoff, assistant managing editor of the Houston
Chronicle, says, ``We decided to see how the codes actually worked,
and how the readers would react'' before including them in TV
listings. Not only have the codes proved to be controversial, she
says, but ``we have not had one request from a reader to include
them. Not one educator, one parent, or one church group has written
or called any of us.'' Other than Ed Markey, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, it gets better. Despite reams of free publicity, the
V-chip is a complete bomb with consumers, too. ``No one cares,''
says Tweeter spokeswoman Anne-Marie Boucher. At her company's 26
New England stores, ``no one's coming in and asking for it.'' No
computer chip can substitute for legitimate parental controls. The
V-chip makes for good politics and jazzy press releases, but it has
nothing to do with parenting.

</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the ideological spectrum, we find right-wing
talk-show host Michael Savage of San Francisco threatening to sue
president-assumptive George W. Bush for hijacking the moniker
``compassionate conservative.'' According to his Web site, Savage
published a book entitled ``Savage Nation: The Compassionate
Conservative Speaks,'' and he has also conducted four
``compassionate conservative'' conventions in the San Francisco Bay
Area since 1995. For the moment, Bush spokesman David Beckwith has
been able to laugh off Savage.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what passes for conservative compassion. In an interview
with the Christian Science Monitor, Savage shared his feelings
about San Francisco's homeless population: ``I hate panhandlers'
guts.''

TRIPLE-FUN `LOLA' MAKES ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RUN LOLA RUN 
Written and directed by: Tom Tykwer 
Starring: Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu, Herbert Knaup, Armin
Rohde 
Running time: 81 minutes 
Rated: R (some violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' puts the motion back in motion pictures. The
only special effect it needs is Franka Potente's sweet, spirited,
and infinitely energetic Lola, who not only carries the film from
the figurative pop of the starter's gun but keeps on running the
race. She carries the film to giddy realms of zippy fun that no
Nike commercial ever dreamed of. Essentially, the film plays out
three versions of the same simple thriller: Lola's boyfriend, a
sweet dummkopf named Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), bungles a drug drop
while trying to work his way up the criminal food chain and loses
100,000 deutsch marks to a homeless man. Knowing he'll be killed if
he doesn't hand the money over to his boss, who expects it in 20
minutes, he desperately phones Lola.
</P>
<P>
   What then unfolds are three alternative scenarios, each
following hard on the heels of the last, one ending tragically when
Manni decides to hold up a supermarket. What stays the same from
variation to variation is Potente's rush through the streets,
stopping each time at the bank her father runs, with three
different results. The fun actually begins when she gets the phone
call, and we instantly glimpse from the expression on her face that
she knows Manni is dumb, loves him anyway, and speaks from
experience when she tells him not to even think of doing anything
until she gets there. Obviously, he's used to handing off his
problems to her, and she's used to solving them.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome hinges on what happens when Lola is nearly hit by a
car, or stops at a casino, or when Manni spots the derelict who
picked up his bag of money and made off with it. Not much, really,
in eventfulness, but writer-director Tom Tykwer, on his best
multimedia behavior, makes getting there more than half the fun.
The only real danger faced by ``Run Lola Run'' is that it risks
stumbling over its own cleverness as Tykwer dissolves the line
between film and video games. He films Lola and Manni in 35mm, but
otherwise hopscotches all over the media map, using video, black
and white, animation and a cascade of punchy visuals mixing
split-screen shots, quick montage, rapid successions of still
photographs, and even title cards.
</P>
<P>
   They're all pumped along by spiffy editing, a virtuosic
cinematographic melding of the various media and a boppy techno-pop
score. Yet ``Run Lola Run'' has more than technical slickness going
for it. It also achieves an emotional dimension, and that comes
almost entirely from what Potente manages to project as she hurtles
breathlessly through the streets of Berlin. She's scared, but she's
also unhesitatingly heroic, a strong, determined woman who trusts
her own brains, resourcefulness, and courage enough to shoulder the
job of saving her lover's life. ``Run Lola Run'' is worth seeing
just for the mix of brainsand heart shining from beneath Lola's
punked-out features. But the film also flies. Just the other day I
was complaining about the lack of smart , light summer
entertainment. Well, here it is. Go, go, go.

ACTING SIZZLES IN `SUMMER OF SAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SUMMER OF SAM 
Directed by: Spike Lee 
Screenplay by: Victor Colicchio, Michael Imperioli, Lee 
Starring: John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody, Mira Sorvino, Jennifer
Esposito, Michael Rispoli, Bebe Neuwirth, Patti LuPone, Mike Starr,
Anthony LaPaglia, Roger Guenveur Smith, Ben Gazzara, Michael
Badalucco 
Running time: 137 minutes 
Rated: R (strong graphic violence and sexuality, pervasive strong
language and drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' is Spike Lee's long hot film about the long
hot summer of 1977, brought to a boil by real-life serial killer
David Berkowitz, a.k.a. the Son of Sam. Although Sam lurks
unsettlingly around the edges of the film, it mostly deals with the
destabilizing effect he has on an Italian-American neighborhood in
the Bronx. It's a companion piece to Lee's ``Do the Right Thing,''
although it never reaches that film's level. That film's explosive
act of climactic violence had a force of inevitability. This one's
seems contrived. But if its overall architecture is flawed, its
behavioral detailing is urgent, and the tapestry Lee weaves of his
memories and impressions of that blistering season is visual
dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Lee brilliantly solves the problem of how to present Berkowitz
without turning the film into a splatter movie or a police
procedural. We see Michael Badalucco's Sam only in short bursts. A
couple of times we see him walk up to cars parked on dark streets
and shoot their occupants. A few times we see him threshing around
in his hellhole of a bedroom, where the insane buzz in his head is
counterpointed by the buzzing of flies on the soundtrack. After he
shoots a neighbor's dog that had been irritating him, the dog
becomes a featured player in his hallucinations, speaking in a
voice provided by Lee regular John Turturro.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the secondary madness on which the film means to focus,
and does, to frequently striking effect. Reworking the original
screenplay by Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli, Lee presents
the Sam violence, real as it is, as the catalyst for simmering
drives waiting to erupt in a community whose collective fear causes
its members to turn on one another. Superficially, the danger
brings the community together as the neighborhood guys, who take
their orders from Ben Gazzara's padrone, start carrying baseball
bats and moving into the vigilante mode in the name of protecting
their women. The posturing shores up their macho insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   But far from preventing trouble, it only brings trouble on,
especially given the pervasive fear of change threatening the
neighborhood guys as they feel their tight little lives beginning
to be pulled apart by social forces they can't stop, among them the
impending cultural warfare between disco and punk. Lee's
in-your-face style is the perfect delivery system for the tensions
_ and hormones _ eroding the communal bonds. As fear quickly turns
to anger, Lee unfurls a tapestry of an anxious, amped-up New York
that's cracklingly vibrant, includes such non-Sam-connected
setbacks as a blackout and looting, and is peopled by real icons of
the period, such as columnist Jimmy Breslin, who carried on a
public correspondence with the killer, CBS news anchor Jim Jensen,
and even Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But while his rendering of the Italian-American neighborhood is
supercharged, he's on rather less secure ground when it comes to
factoring in the too-obvious story arcs in the script. The latter
figured prominently in a little-seen but starkly affecting film
called ``Sweet Nothing,'' about a young husband who couldn't get
past a crack addiction and lost a terrific young wife played by
Mira Sorvino. In slightly different form, that story resurfaces
here, once more with Sorvino as the most sympathetic character in
the film, again playing a hurt and confused young wife, Dionna,
trying to figure out what she's doing wrong that her hairdresser
husband, Vinny, should be sleeping around and snorting coke.
</P>
<P>
   As played by John Leguizamo in the ensemble's most dynamic
performance, he's as much a victim of the madonna-whore complex as
of his drug addiction. Nor do the breakout impulses of his lifelong
buddy, Adrien Brody's Ritchie, push Vinny toward maturity. Vinny's
reversion to infantile rage and helplessness is comparable to Sam's
random killings, which obviously is what Lee had in mind. Brody
plays Ritchie with no condescension to the degree of silliness he
takes on when he adopts a spiked hairdo and a bad Cockney accent in
an effort to proclaim his new punked-out liberation from the
neighborhood narrowness.
</P>
<P>
   He's not made a shining hero. He also works as a dancer in a gay
strip joint and isn't above earning extra money by having sex with
this or that patron. Not occupying the moral high ground in fact
adds a measure of ease and comfort to his relationship with
Jennifer Esposito's restless Ruby, whose sexual explorations
predictably have caused her to be stigmatized as a whore in the
neighborhood by young men oblivious to their double standard.
Across the board, the acting sizzles. The characters are
behaviorally complex when they aren't being asked to subordinate
themselves to larger purposes. The interplay is dynamic. But the
same can't be said for the course of action into which the story
pushes them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if you don't quite buy the denouement, and I didn't,
and even if there are times when this or that line of dialogue
makes you wish the writers had demanded of themselves a
stereotype-purging rewrite, ``Summer of Sam'' is nevertheless a
richly evocative, often electrifying film that never gets too
sociological for Lee not to take an entertainingly sardonic
approach to the media's tabloid ways or to the schism expressed in
the split between punk and disco. When Dionna and Vinny venture
downtown to CBGB to hear Ritchie's group, but never go inside
because they're put off by the body-pierced clientele, they wind up
in a glumly downbeat orgy uptown in Plato's Retreat after being
denied entry to Studio 54. ``Summer of Sam'' may not succeed in its
grander ambitions, but it's one of the few summer films that has
any, and it covers the rest of its turf in firecracker style.

RHYTHM OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was the first reggae artist to perform in Africa, the first
in South America, the first in Japan. Jimmy Cliff has earned his
title of ``Reggae Ambassador.'' Ever since the film ``The Harder
They Come'' made him a star in the '70s, Cliff has carried his
peace-and-love vibe throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   It figures, then, that he's also the first reggae act to make a
broad millennium statement. His opinions and hopes for the next
century are expressed in his new album, ``Humanitarian,'' which
came out this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a record about bringing out the better side of our
humanity which, going into this new time, is going to be a
necessity,'' Cliff says from a Virginia Beach tour stop. ``The
motivating factor coming into this new time is not going to be
money. It's going to be man's humanity to man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album also talks about family, about one-to-one love,
about empowering yourself as an individual, and rising up as an
individual and achieving your goals, whether they be spiritual or
material.''
</P>
<P>
   These, of course, are not new topics for Cliff, the Jamaican
idealist who is perhaps best known for the hit, ``You Can Get It if
You Really Want,'' from ``The Harder They Come'' film, which itself
was about rising up from oppression.
</P>
<P>
   And no Cliff album would be complete without an antiwar message.
It comes in the new song, ``How Long,'' with such cogent lyrics as
``How long can this war go on? Every time I look and see another
baby cry/Every time I see another missile fly/How long can this war
go on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be about war in Liberia, or in Kosovo, or in Uganda,
or someplace else on the planet,'' Cliff says.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Cliff sounds revitalized _ and he credits this to an
exotic, four-week vacation/spiritual pilgrimage that he took
earlier this year _ the first long vacation he has taken during his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Egypt to check out the temples in Luxor, and that
was a very spiritual place,'' he says. ``And I went to Iran,
because I wanted to see the ancient ruins of Babylon. And I went to
South Africa, which had a profound effect on me spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost thought that I wanted to stop doing my music, so I
could travel for the rest of my life to historical places and
explore my soul within these places,'' he says. ``But after I came
back to Jamaica, I started getting that itch to do music again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff's itch has also been scratched by having a new record
label, Eureka Records, which is solidly behind him. Eureka is a
small indie based in Los Angeles. It's a pleasant change from the
days when Cliff was on a major label (Columbia Records) and felt
lost in the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually started out originally on a small label _ Island
Records in England _ and I've found through the years that working
with a small company is better for me,'' Cliff says. ``There is
more direct communication. It's not a big machine where you can't
really talk with people to find out what's going on. So I prefer
this kind of arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff has recorded for three decades, which allows him to speak
of himself as an ``epoch artist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an artist of one period. I expand over the periods,''
says Cliff, whose roots-reggae music has grown to incorporate
dancehall influences, Brazilian samba, and Caribbean soca. ``I
respect the music that we did a decade or two decades ago, but at
the same time, I stay in tune with what is happening today. Where
is the spirit of the people at this time? I try to make my music
fit in with the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff is now 50 years old, but if you ask how old he is, he
replies impishly, ``I'm living. I'm living and learning. I try not
to look at `Oh, I'm 50 or 52.' I just try to stay healthy and keep
a positive mind. And what gives me the most satisfaction is to be
creative, to make music, and to stay with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the current state of reggae music, Cliff says it is
evolving, too. He points to the influx of new artists _ one being
Shevell Franklin. She's known for singing the hit ``Dancehall
Queen'' with Beanie Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music scene in Jamaica is healthy,'' Cliff says. ``We are
at a stage now where I feel the music will shift to a new kind of
rhythm. Reggae music has always been an evolving music _ from ska
to rock-steady to rubba-dub to ragamuffin to dancehall _ and now
it's a stage where people are feeling for something new. It usually
happens at the end of a decade, going into a new decade.''

WHITNEY HOUSTON GETS TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whitney Houston will remain forever young to fans who first saw
her perform on Boston Common in the mid-'80s. She was a radiant
22-year-old ingenue who had modeled for such magazines as
Seventeen, Young Miss, and Glamour. And musically she had been
``groomed,'' as she put it, by her show business mother, Cissy
Houston, and by her first cousin, Dionne Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've listened and absorbed _ and now I'm ready,'' she said in
a Globe interview at the time.
</P>
<P>
   She was a striking package _ a singer/model with the highest
pedigree and cheekbones, but also a sanitized figure who played it
safe with gushy ballads and light 'n' breezy dance-pop. Still, it
made her the princess of Top 40 radio, as shown by her appearance
at the KISS Concert at Boston Garden in 1987 when she sang so
angelically that the crowd barely let her go.
</P>
<P>
   But today, there's a new Houston in our midst. Look at her
latest album, ``My Love is Your Love,'' which leaves the Goody
Two-Shoes image at home as she delves into contemporary, hip-hop
flavored tracks with street-hipster guests Missy Elliott, Faith
Evans, Wyclef Jean, and Lauryn Hill. ``Whitney as you've never
heard her before,'' says Arista Records boss Clive Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The new Houston profile: A tougher, more worldly, somewhat
scarred, and thoroughly grown-up 35-year-old woman who has a child
(Bobbi Kristina, 6) and a husband (Roxbury-bred Bobby Brown, who
has been tabloid fodder with his brushes with the law). The latest
brush was violating probation in Florida just a week ago when he
was charged with drunken driving after crashing Houston's car into
a condominium sign. He now faces up to 90 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has put a storm cloud over Houston's new tour,
which comes to the Wang Center next Wednesday and Thursday. But the
new Whitney is tough-minded enough to tell people to back off from
pestering her about her private life. ``I'm still in love with God,
I'm still in love with my husband. I've got a great marriage,'' she
recently told a journalist in Chicago, where she opened her tour
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Her mind-your-own-business stance also comes to the fore in a
new song, ``In My Business,'' written by Missy Elliott, who
observed the Houston/Brown marriage, then put it to song. ``Too
many people . . . say we won't last/They're predicting that it's
over,'' sings Houston. ``Should I believe them? They say I don't
need him/Don't they know I've made up my mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too ridiculous,'' Houston sings later in the song,
commenting on the gossip and tabloid intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as she told USA Today, ``They talk about (Brown) as this man
who has always been a womanizer. I always see the ladies walk up on
him, but he's a gentleman. A cordial kind of guy. Bobby's also a
sexy kind of guy _ and I don't mind him looking, as long as he
knows where home is. I look, too.''
</P>
<P>
   If truth be told, of course, far more people are looking at
Houston than at Brown. Houston has sold 100 million records since
her meteoric debut. That includes 13 million for her self-titled
debut album, which had three straight No. 1 singles in ``Saving All
My Love for You,'' ``How Will I Know,'' and ``The Greatest Love of
All.'' And 33 million worldwide for ``The Bodyguard'' soundtrack,
which remains the top-selling soundtrack of all time. The album's
first single, ``I Will Always Love You,'' also was the top-selling
single of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has reached diva-esque heights _ exemplified by her
stealing the show at the ``VH1 Divas Live'' taping this spring with
Tina Turner, Cher, Brandy, Mary J. Blige, and others. But Houston
refuses to let the ``diva'' label thwart her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up and look at myself in the mirror in the morning and
I think, `Diva? I don't know about that!' '' she said recently.
``It takes a couple of hours at least to turn into a diva.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a diva, at least according to the petulant definition of
the word, wouldn't interrupt her tour to make a surprise appearance
at the Gay Pride Pier Dance in New York, as Houston did on Sunday
night. She turned up in a simple black tank top and Dolce and
Gabbana pants to entertain 7,000 people at Pier 54 on 13th Street
with ``Heartbreak Hotel'' (not the Elvis Presley hit by the same
name, but a new tune by Faith Evans and Kelly Price) and ``It's Not
Right But It's Okay,'' penned by the 21-year-old Rodney Jerkins,
who also produced the Grammy-nominated ``The Boy is Mine'' for
Brandy and Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than stay in the shadows, as she did in her grooming
days, Houston has taken charge of career. For example, she's big
enough to sell out sheds and arenas, but she's avoiding them in
favor of small to mid-sized theaters, hoping to foster more
intimacy with the crowd. (Tickets at the Wang run up to a gaudy
$151, but her management says that those are ``golden circle''
seats and only 40 to 50 are being sold at that price.)
</P>
<P>
   Above all, this is no longer the woman who showed up at the KISS
Concert to sing to canned backing tracks. Houston now has a
seven-piece band, along with four singers and four dancers. The
former ingenue is calling the shots with the aplomb of a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   When she first played on Boston Common, Houston opened with a
rousing cover of Michael Jackson's ``Wanna Be Starting Somethin'.''
She started something, all right, and not even a fickle public, or
an unpredictable husband, can hold her back now.

CREATORS FOUL OUT WITH TRITE `HOOP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE HOOP LIFE 
Starring: Mykelti Williamson, Dorian Harewood, Rick Peters, Cirroc
Lofton, Dan Lauria, Raymond Anthony Thomas 
On: Showtime 
Time: Sunday night at 10 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showtime's ``The Hoop Life'' should be good TV. For one thing,
it's a ``Levinson/Fontana Production,'' meaning it comes to us from
the shop of Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, producers of two
extraordinary TV dramas, ``Oz'' and ``Homicide.'' And for another
thing, it arrives at a moment when cable TV is raising the bar on
series television, as HBO productions like ``The Sopranos,''
``Oz,'' and ``Sex and the City'' are showing up network programming
for the shoddy compromise that it is. If every network had three
series _ only three series _ at the quality level of ``The
Sopranos,'' well then, TV critics could moonlight as ministers in
the church of good vibes.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, ``should'' may be the most overrated word in the English
language. ``The Hoop Life,'' which premieres as a two-hour movie
Sunday at 10, is the sort of disappointment that reminds us of just
how very hard it is to create a series that's even halfway
original. The Showtime drama has not a hint of Fontana/Levinson
magic, as it dribbles through overfamiliar tales of a basketball
world ridden with corruption, hedonism, sexism, egoism, and the
occasional act of heroism. The characters are exactly the kinds of
cliches you'd expect to find in a sports-world soap opera, from the
innocent rookie and the sports groupies to the grumpy coach and the
philandering players. And the plot lines go through the motions of
salary disputes and media craziness with absolutely no finesse, no
mystery, and no comic relief. A far cry from ``Homicide'' or
``Oz,'' ``The Hoop Life'' resembles cheesy soft-core melodramas
like the WB's ``Rescue 77,'' or ABC's ``Push,'' both of which were
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   The action revolves around a fictional team, the New England
Knights, and a fictional NBA-like organization called the United
Basketball Association. (In keeping with the show's generic tone,
the specific location of the Knights is kept vague.) The team's
superstar guard is Marvin Buxton, whose uncontrollable brawling may
get him kicked out of the UBA. Teammate Greg Marr is a cocky
frat-boy type whose extramarital game-playing has gotten him thrown
out of the house. And Leonard Ferro is the gruff coach who is
forever having to defend his decisions to the general manager.
Meanwhile, a high school basketball phenom named Curtis Thorpe is
about to turn pro and get picked up by the Knights. But his
hard-drinking manager, who is also his uncle, gets him into some
serious contract problems. As the show jumps from one story to
another, only the business about Curtis and his uncle has any
resonance, hackneyed though it may be.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is better than the script. As the hotheaded Marvin,
Mykelti Williamson comes out of his compulsive fights without
looking too cartoonish, or, worse, too much the lovable lug with a
temper. And Cirroc Lofton tries to add some mystery to his Curtis,
as the innocent phenom learns hard lessons about the high-paying
world of sports. In the middle of a crisis regarding his future, he
sits by a hotel swimming pool looking effectively stricken. For a
moment, in a show that offers no surprises, you actually wonder
what Curtis will do. But most of the actors are defeated by the
mediocrity, unable to turn their underdeveloped, stereotypical
characters into anything like real people.

   FORD REWARD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's been said that good
words are worth much, and cost little. So often, the opposite also
holds true. Take, for example, the case of Kathleen Ford, who is
fighting with three jewelers over a $1 million reward she offered
to find the crooks who stole $6.2 million in jewelry from her Palm
Beach, Fla., house. The jewelers, who tipped police to two men
charged with taking her jewels over state lines, have sued Ford,
saying she's now trying to back out of the deal. Ford says the
reward is still on the table, that it was intended for the arrest
and conviction of whoever burglarized her house -- a distinct
statute that the two men have not been charged with, though both
were in possession of her stuff, and police think they did it. The
dispute has led to an agonizing and often silly parsing of words
among lawyers in depositions taken last month. ``We could probably
spend hours with the semantics,'' Ford's lawyer complained. Also,
one of the crooks is making a claim for the reward himself.

always in their 60s, married in an era when secular Communism
papered over ethnic and religious divisions. Now, most fear that
that any discussion of their love will channel toward their
doorstep the ethnic hatred that has left a wake of mass graves and
burned villages throughout the province. But, Bafti and Gordana
Miftari, both 60, are sturdy grandparentswith a lot to say. Their
simple words seem to defy the hateful gravity of a place where
people matter-of-factly toss out blanket racial epithets about
``wild animals'' or ``terrorists.'' (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

BUSH CAN GO WHEREVER HE WANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was George W. Bush on the TV screen, and you almost
expected to hear the familiar unseen announcer ask the familiar
question: ``Hey, Gov. Bush, you've just locked up the Republican
presidential nomination. What will you do next?''
</P>
<P>
   And the winner's reply: ``I'm going to Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor didn't visit Disneyland on Thursday, but he
was in California, adding to the unprecedented $36 million-plus in
campaign contributions that had rolled into the Bush-for-president
coffers as of Wednesday. If his mind-boggling money-raising hasn't
already guaranteed Bush the top spot on the GOP ticket in next
year's presidential election, it certainly has magnified his status
as the runaway front-runner for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised more money than Republican nominee Bob Dole
collected during the entire primary campaign in 1996. He has rung
up more campaign contributions than all his Republican opponents
combined. And he has raised more than the combined total of
Democratic candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised so much money that he may not find it necessary
to accept federal matching funds during the primary season. Which
means that he can campaign all-out in several states at once
without worrying about overly restrictive spending limits. Which
means that a mostly self-funded candidate like Steve Forbes won't
be able to do to Bush what he did to Dole: beat him up with a
barrage of attack ads while the front-runner is effectively
silenced by spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing outpouring of financial support for Bush must be
demoralizing to all the Bush detractors who have been insisting
that his gigantic lead in the presidential preference polls is a
mirage. One of the TV pundits said Thursday that the Bush
campaign's burgeoning bankroll indicates that the GOP's world-class
fund-raisers have decided that a Bush nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is one of those chicken-or-the-egg conundrums. Is
money pouring into the Bush campaign because his nomination is
inevitable, or is Bush's nomination inevitable because money is
pouring into his campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it doesn't much matter which came first or what caused
what. The bandwagon is rolling. Get on or get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's closest rival for the Republican nomination _ and we use
the word ``closest'' very loosely here _ is Elizabeth Dole, who
keeps saying she's in the race to stay despite the polls and
despite the fund-raising reports. The problem for Dole and most
other GOP candidates is that they will have to get by on whatever
money Bush spills on the way to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   About the only Republican hopefuls who aren't adversely affected
by Bush's money monopoly are Pat Buchanan, who has made a career
out of running presidential campaigns on a shoestring, and Forbes,
whose personal fortune can keep him afloat indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? Neither Buchanan nor Forbes has a prayer of
defeating Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So. The Bush-haters _ whoever and wherever they may be _ must
rededicate themselves to the proposition that Bush will defeat
himself, that he will make some horrendous gaffe or otherwise
reveal himself to be unsuited to hold the highest office in the
greatest nation on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Here is some advice for those who are barking up that tree:
Don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   As he has emphatically demonstrated in two successful campaigns
for governor, George W. Bush is a disciplined and determined
candidate who is simply not prone to self-destruction. His
opponents and the media can bait, badger and attack him till their
lungs give out and their Web sites crash; he will not be
intimidated, entrapped or tricked into dumb mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents' best hope now is that Bush will succumb to
overconfidence. But it's a slim hope, for Bush proved during a 1998
gubernatorial campaign that amounted to little more than a walkover
that he never takes a single vote for granted _ that he is
committed to running as if there's a chance he could lose.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he couldn't lose if he tried.

`SUMMER OF SAM': HOT, BUT NOT QUITE A SCORCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heat and fear rise palpably from the screen in ``Summer of
Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee's 13th picture is an astonishing, virtuosic film. It's
also a jarringly effective time machine nearly as lurid and
evocative a creation of New York in a specific, conflicted time as
Martin Scorsese's ``Taxi Driver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' leaves you reeling, invigorated by the sheer
aesthetic thrill of watching a craftsman at his best or, when
slightly less than that, a filmmaker who's a whole lot of fun even
when just showing off.
</P>
<P>
   Lee plunks you down right in the middle of the blistering summer
of 1977, where the pavement shimmers and polyester shirts cling to
the skin after a mere minute of disco dancing. Along with the heat,
New York City is in the grips of economic bleakness, blackouts,
looting and, of course, a serial killer armed with a powerful
pistol and deranged urges to kill women with long, dark hair.
</P>
<P>
   Lee heightens the off-balance feel by shooting the daytime
scenes with blurry darkness at the center, the edges hazily flared
with white light, replicating the effect of looking right into the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' is less about David Berkowitz _ a.k.a. the Son
of Sam _ than about the climate he helped create in the baking Big
Apple. Another director likely would have turned the tale into a
conventional thriller. We know that story: A psycho with a handgun
spatters the brains of brunette beauties across the interiors of
their boyfriends' jacked-up Camaros, while tense cops chew
toothpicks and drink coffee from paper cups wile working to capture
a killer who has been humiliating them by eluding capture and
writing eloquent letters to the tabloids. Not Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lee instead finds his story in an outer-borough ethnic
neighborhood, mapping their intimate stories against expansive
historic backdrops. As in his 1989 film, ``Do the Right Thing,''
the writer-director turns his camera on a close community of
vulgar, exuberant people whose friendships are frayed when new
external pressures exacerbate long-held internal frictions and
bigotries.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the picture is Vinny (John Leguizamo), a
hairdresser who overcompensates for his profession with a
blustering masculinity. Although married to Dionna (Mira Sorvino),
Vinny finds satisfying sex only extramaritally and spends most of
his time with the gang of buddies he grew up with in their
Italian-American Bronx neighborhood. They smoke and swear on their
walled-off street while standing beneath a ``Dead End'' sign (for
those needing their metaphors translated).
</P>
<P>
   Inchoately fearful of the outside world and its changes, these
guys strut with ease on their own turf. Lee, always able to summon
the best from actors, relishes showing us their cock-of-the-walk
confidence, their brutal passions unmediated by a gentling,
self-reflective intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Things start to deteriorate at the reappearance of Vinny's
childhood friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody), who returns to the
neighborhood from Manhattan adorned with the affectations of punk
music. His friends mock his spiky hairdo and British-flag shirt,
but they're more deeply disquieted by the outside influences he
represents: If this can happen to one of their own, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   As the summer's heat and the city's Son of Sam fear both rise,
Vinny and friends behave ever badly, and Lee crafts the downward
spiral of their lives with vigor and flair.
</P>
<P>
   A writer and director with an acute comprehension of human
behavior, Lee also understands actors, and his cast clearly trusts
him. From Leguizamo, Sorvino and Brody on down to the bit players
(notwithstanding the annoying Jimmy Breslin, playing himself), the
actors give exposed-nerve performances. The loves and betrayals all
make sense, and the characters' capacity for violence simmers so
near the surface that its brutal boilovers are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Lee shoots much of the picture in grainy, sun-bleached colors,
heightening the realism, and further boosts the effect by matching
onscreen brutality with a happy pop soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   A couple cuddling in a Lincoln Continental is murdered while
ABBA's ``Fernando'' plays, and a nasty fight between Leguizamo and
Sorvino following a misadventure in a Manhattan sex club is
accompanied by the same group's ``Dancing Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is less in command of his script (co-written by Lee, Victor
Colicchio and Michael Imperioli, the film's executive producer and
cast member of TV's ``The Sopranos''). While the constant
f-this-ing and f-that-ing echo how some people really talk, in a
movie it gets tiresome, and you wish the actors had been given
sharper lines.
</P>
<P>
   The story drags toward the end of its 140-minute running time,
and it's a testament to Sorvino's fierce portrayal of a woman doing
anything to save her marriage that you don't immediately see how
thinly conceived her character is. Had Lee edited the picture and
the screenplay with the rigor he applies to acting and
cinematography, the power of ``Summer of Sam'' would be a real
scorcher.

A LITTLE RESEARCH CAN BE A BAD THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This one will surely get me in trouble, but here goes.
</P>
<P>
   I was scanning the news wire last week when I spied a story that
sent me into convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A group of researchers _ studying female responses to different
types of male faces _ have concluded that we women are attracted to
more manly faces when we are ready to conceive. This, they said,
might suggest practical advice for men on the prowl. Something
about ``If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would never occur to a man that he's being
rejected because he has bad breath or because the object of his
affection simply isn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   No. A man can now blame a woman's menstrual cycle. And just to
prove they're still irresistible, they'll spend money on such
useless information.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, PMS is as good a reason as any to explain why Julia
Roberts would marry Lyle Lovett.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that ``When a woman is ovulating or ready to
conceive, she is likely to prefer men with more masculine features.
When she is menstruating, or least likely to get pregnant, she is
apt to prefer softer, more feminine looks.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I'd like to say is that there are a lot of
reasons to prefer a man with more masculine features, and ovulating
isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   I can say this because I'm a woman, and what I prefer in a man
isn't femininity. Come to think of it, when I'm ovulating I prefer
to be as far away from men as I can. Well, maybe not if Denzel's in
the room.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, I was at my sister Jo's place for dinner. We were
in the midst of doing our usual number on men when I started to ask
her about the study. Or more specifically, if there are times when
she finds her significant other more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   She said yes and told me there are also times when she looks in
the mirror and likes what stares back at her more than other times.
And she knows, she added, the exact moment when she's looking
particularly good to him.
</P>
<P>
   Before I can ask the second part of my question, she said: ``I
know what you're going to ask me. I saw that story. I don't want
NOTHING with feminine features.''
</P>
<P>
   So there. In my family, it's unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Now let me explain how you might get more accurate results from
a study like this. The researchers call when you are ovulating and
bloated from water weight gain. You have cramps and a blemish on
the tip of your nose that surfaces at the same time every month.
You're not exactly in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   Then, your husband comes home from work and wants some
attention. What will you do?
</P>
<P>
   (a) Run him a hot bath, where you'll be joining him?
</P>
<P>
   (b) Make him a bed of rose petals, where you'll be joining him?
</P>
<P>

pamper himself?

</P>
<P>
   Oops, forget that last answer. I don't want to seem too
immature.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, roll the tape again. The blemish is gone and
you no longer look like you're two months pregnant. You're feeling
pretty good about yourself. Your husband comes home from work, and
he wants some attention.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are calling again. What will your reaction be
this time to your husband's request?
</P>
<P>
   That's what I thought.

INMATE'S DEATH PROMPTS CHANGE IN RESTRAINT POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RENDAN LYONS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Unruly inmates at the Albany County jail will no
longer be strapped face-down in their cell bunks, a change prompted
by the death of a mentally ill inmate who was physically restrained
by guards and injected with a powerful tranquilizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective immediately, if a situation exists where it becomes
necessary to restrain an inmate for his or her own protection, a
device called a restraint chair will be used,'' Sheriff James L.
Campbell said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change comes as the state Mental Health Association
has asked Gov. George Pataki to expand the investigation of the
incident to include the State Police and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Quartararo, a Pataki spokeswoman, said the
investigation would continue to be handled solely by the Commission
of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their purview,'' she said. ``We have full faith and
confidence in their ability to carry out these responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said sheriff's investigators also are investigating the
death. Autopsy results to determine the exact cause of death won't
be available for several days, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Lee Richardson, 42, of Brooklyn was found unconscious in
his cell on the jail's mental health tier Monday night about 30
minutes after a nurse had given him an injection of Haldol, a
tranquilizer used by correctional facilities statewide to calm
inmates, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Guards checked on Richardson shortly after he was injected with
the drug but a nurse then found him unconscious 10 minutes later,
the sheriff said. He had vomited, and immediate attempts to revive
him failed, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The guards violated procedures if they left Richardson
unattended while he was strapped in his bunk, Campbell said.
Procedures require that inmates be kept under constant observation
if they are being restrained, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are still being investigated, Richardson was
strapped face-down in his bunk by jail guards to prevent him from
harming himself. But now, inmates will only be strapped in their
bunks if there are no restraint chairs available, Campbell said.
Even then, guards have been told to begin restraining inmates only
on their sides, which is considered safer than on the stomach or
back, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard for me,'' said Richardson's mother, Ruby. ``I
was surprised he was in such a facility and was not recognized
immediately as someone who should be in a facility for the mentally
ill.''
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic nearly 20 years ago,
she said, and has been taking medication for his condition for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was arrested June 10 after leading the police on a
high-speed chase.

   CHICAGO _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was in Chicago
recently as a guest of Illinois Gov. George Ryan. There was a
fundraiser to attend and backs to be slapped, but there was another
purpose to Giuliani's mission.
</P>
<P>
   He was here to stick it to Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As you'll recall, the first lady _ a native of the Chicago
suburb of Park Ridge and a lifelong fan of the Cubs and the Bulls _
recently pulled a brazenly cynical flip-flop when she abandoned
both teams for their New York rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Knicks fan now,'' said Clinton in an appearance at an
elementary school in East Harlem. It was her own personal Ich ein
Berliner.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asked, ``What happened to the Bulls?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did happen to the Bulls _ good question,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same day, Clinton happily donned a New York Yankees
cap and posed for photos at a White House ceremony for the 1998
World Series champions. (Her husband, ever the diplomat or perhaps
afraid of looking like a dork in a suit and a baseball cap, donned
the cap briefly, but held it by his side for the picture-taking
session.)
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Mrs. Clinton reiterated her newfound loyalties
during an appearance on the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Cubs fan,'' she said. ``But I needed an American League
team, because, when you're from Chicago, you cannot root for both
the Cubs and the Sox ... So as a very young girl, I became very
interested and enamored of the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh please. NOBODY from Chicago has EVER rooted for the Yankees.
It would be like David's family rooting for Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's not the switcheroo that offends me so much as the
condescending notion that any voter would fall for this ploy _ or
for that matter, that anyone would make an election choice based on
a candidate's favorite team. Why doesn't Clinton just come out and
say she thinks voters in New York state must be stupid rubes? Look
you silly people, I'm wearing your team's hat, I'm one of you!
</P>
<P>
   Serves her right that the scheme has backfired horribly, as the
savvy Giuliani has returned her serve with a series of perfect
backhanded sound bites. Before leaving New York for Chicago, he
told reporters, ``I want to go to see how the Chicago Cubs play. I
have never been to Wrigley Field, and this will be a great
opportunity to see Wrigley Field for the first time. But since I
don't come from there and never worked there, never lived there, I
never was a Cubs fan and won't pretend to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani arrived at Wrigley Field to see the Cubs take on
the Milwaukee Brewers, he faced the media pack surrounding him and
gleefully awaited the inevitable questions about team loyalties.
His response: Hillary is most welcome in the family of Yankees fans
_ but isn't it odd that even though he's been to hundreds of
Yankees games over the years, he's somehow never run into her, not
even once?
</P>
<P>
   The day after Giuliani's visit, Hillary's husband _ what was his
name again? _ swooped down on Chicago for a $500,000 fundraiser and
a speech on Medicare. He also made a stop at Wrigley Field _
reportedly even showering in the Cubs locker room that afternoon
before zipping off to that big fundraiser. (One presumes the Secret
Service cleared the showers before the president soaped up. The
idea of the most powerful person in the world saying, ``Hey
Morandini, got any shampoo I can borrow?'' is just too weird for
words.)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton dutifully posed with home run hero Sammy Sosa,
Cubs jacket in hand, but he grew a bit surly when reporters chided
him about his wife's recent flip-flop. Asked if he at least was
still a Cubs fan, Clinton replied, ``Yeah, and so is (Hillary) ...
Don't go playing press games here. This is sports, not politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not even sure what that means, but I'd like to remind the
president that it was his wife who started all this nonsense in the
first place. If she had simply said, ``Look, I'm considering a run
for the senate in New York, but I don't want to insult the
intelligence of New Yorkers by pretending I'm suddenly dumping the
Cubs and Bulls in favor of the Yankees and Knicks,'' she might have
scored a few points for honesty and loyalty. That kind of
I-won't-B.S.-you attitude is respected by Chicagoans and New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   So you're wrong Mr. President. It is politics, not sports. And
on that playing field, your wife is getting her tail kicked by Mr.
Giuliani.

<P>
   Air travel from Britain to many parts of the world will be
virtually impossible over the new year because of fears about the
millennium bug, it was claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   British airline pilots are threatening to refuse to fly to most
of eastern Europe and Asia, including the Indian subcontinent and
China. Insiders describe Africa as a ``no-go'' area, and Central
and South America are causing anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by the British Airline Pilots' Association
(BALPA) has found serious shortcomings in most countries'
preparations, especially those in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a rapid acceleration in the drive to make air
traffic control systems ``millennium compliant,'' flights from
British airports will be severely restricted from Dec. 31 to Jan.
3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   BALPA said it would be safe to go to northern and western
Europe, and the United States. However, some U.S. authorities have
questioned the readiness of airports dealing with internal flights.
</P>
<P>
   It is understood that pilots will refuse to fly over countries
where they believe little or no attempt has been made to cope with
the potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   A list of airports and regions thought to be unsafe will be
published in the next few weeks by the pilots' union with the help
of the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations.
</P>
<P>
   A BALPA source said: ``People will not have to worry about
travelling from Britain to a country over the millennium...we will
not fly to areas we regard as unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Darke, general secretary of BALPA, and the Transport
and General Workers' Union will fully back those refusing to fly on
safety grounds over the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for intercontinental flights from Britain could be low
over the four-day period as many holidaymakers will leave earlier
in the week and stay away until after the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The International Air Transport Association is also running an
inquiry, to be published in the summer. A spokesman at British
Airways, which supplied the chairman for the inquiry, said it would
not know which were safe routes until the report was finished. &QL;

   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL;

   The first piece in the jigsaw went back to Oct. 23, 1844 _ the
day after the world didn't end as William Miller had predicted. It
was then that his followers began the long process of coming to
terms with what they dubbed The Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new groups which sprang from the disillusioned
Millerites was the Seventh Day Adventists, whose recruits included
one John Kellogg, who developed for his brethren a special
vegetarian breakfast food called corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a movement doomed to schism. A washing machine
salesman called Victor Houteff led a breakaway called the Davidian
Seventh Day Adventists. And after Victor's wife and successor
Florence gathered the movement's 940 members together for another
unsuccessful Doomsday on April 22, 1959, it split again, with Ben
Roden and his wife Lois forming the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the succession should have passed to their son
George. But by then David Koresh was on the scene and things began
to turn from the merely eccentric to the downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the leadership issue, Ken Newport discovered, George
Roden dug up the remains of an 85-year-old Davidian who had died
some 20 years earlier, and challenged Koresh to a Resurrection
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle ensued and, though the police arrested everyone, no
one was convicted _ though George was given six months for contempt
of court for threatening the judge with plagues and herpes.
</P>
<P>
   George was later sent to an asylum after drawing a third
Davidian into a row over whether George or Koresh had been chosen
by God to be the seventh and final angel named in the Bible; when
the third man insisted it was neither of them but him, George
chopped him up with an axe.
</P>
<P>
   But it was none of this which prompted the Davidians' letters
and e-mails to Ken Newport suddenly to halt. Nor was it his
questions about the awful events at Waco, at which the FBI
acquitted themselves so poorly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cult members began to get wary when Dr. Newport started to
ask about their belief that Koresh is due to return from the dead
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Their massive documents on the Web revealed that a code-breaking
of a combination of dates in Revelation and the prophetic book of
Daniel suggested that Koresh would return on Aug. 6, at the head of
200 million horsemen (see Rev. 9:16) to cleanse the earth and
slaughter the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those of Koresh's followers who were not consumed in the flames
of Waco were to prepare for the event under the guidance of a
Davidian by the code name of The Chosen Vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Ken Newport began to find out who this might be that
all communication was ended with a final e-mail: ``We perceive now
that you are not a seeker after the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Newport continued to comb through what had already been
made available to him. The conclusions he was forced to make
disturbed him.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors to join Koresh's divine army they, too, would
have to be dead before Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reference to self-sacrifice in any of the
documentation. Rather there was the suggestion that the remnant,
under the direction of The Chosen Vessel, would have to be killed
by the same forces who killed Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic is clear,'' says Dr. Newport. ``It all makes perfect
sense if you take on board the hypotheses they start with. It is
entirely possible that they are provoking some horrendous
confrontation with the U.S. authorities.'' His estimate is that
around 40 to 50 individuals might be involved in such an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the world, security services have decided they have to
take this kind of thing seriously. The propensity of cults to turn
fantasy into grim reality is evident from a mere recital of names
like Jonestown, the Solar Temple, Heaven's Gate, Aum Shinri Kyo.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Israel recently expelled 14 members of a
Denver-based Doomsday sect called Concerned Christians, accusing
them of plans to attack the al-Aqsa mosque in an attempt to spark
off the apocalyptic war of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, the anti-terrorism squad is alive to fears that a
fanatical U.S. group has targeted the Millennium Dome for attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, the FBI is monitoring groups it fears are storing
explosives for some millennium outrage. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they have learned the lessons of Waco. When I contacted
them in Washington recently, their cults department was remaining
taciturn. The FBI knows that its strategists made fools of
themselves over Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they taken the trouble to find out anything about what was
going on in the heads of those in the Waco compound, they might
have defused the whole situation peacefully,'' says Ken Newport.
Instead, their actions seemed calculated to produce the worst
possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonization of the U.S. government which is found
ubiquitously in Seventh Day Adventist sources predisposed members
of the Branch-Davidian movement (nearly all of whom, including
Koresh himself, were drawn from the Adventist church) to view the
siege of their headquarters by the FBI as of apocalyptic
significance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorities added to such a perception by shining
unceasing lights into the compound, playing demonically loud music
alternately punctuated, one Waco survivor claimed, with the sound
of rabbits being slaughtered and of Tibetan monks chanting.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into the weird end-of-the-world scenario of those
final chapters of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dealing with a group which believed that, just
before the end of the world, the great Satanic power would seek to
destroy the last faithful remnant of God's people,'' says Dr.
Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder that, with all that going on outside their Mount
Carmel compound, Koresh's people thought that the eschatological
dawn had broken,'' he says. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The chilling thing is that all the ingredients for another
major incident are in place. And the logic leads uncompromisingly
to Aug. 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Only this time the FBI cannot say that they have not been
warned. &QL;

<P>
   SEOUL _ North Korea has softened its enemies in the South using
a weapon that no one could have imagined during the long years of
North-South confrontation _ cold noodles, Pyongyang-style.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans are shipping buckwheat, bean paste and liquor
here to satiate the appetites of South Koreans yearning for a taste
of life above the Demilitarized Zone that still divides the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The food is arriving here at a time when millions of North
Koreans survive on tree bark and the husks of corn kernels and the
country is getting millions of tons of emergency food aid from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is an unabashedly capitalist entrepreneur whose
Okryukwan Restaurant takes its ingredients, cuisine _ and name _
from the original restaurant founded on orders from the late North
Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting 10 tons of buckwheat a month for noodles,'' said
the owner, Kim Young Baek, who sees the venture as a marriage
between his own capitalist drive to open up North Korea and North
Korea's need for hard cash. ``We don't think about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all in accordance with the ``sunshine policy'' promoted
by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea to reduce border tensions
after years in which South Korea's national security law forbade
the least sign of Pyongyang influence in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   These days, bags shipped from the North Korean port of Nampo to
the South Korean port of Inchon litter the office of the Okryukwan.
Their labels clearly say ``DPR Korea'' for Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, a name banned in Seoul in print until a year or
so ago.
</P>
<P>
   The original Okryukwan in Pyongyang used to dish up 10,000 daily
servings, but now serves just occasional foreign visitors and VIPs,
Kim said. His own Okryukwan, meanwhile, can hardly cope with the
crowds lined up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Customers try not to think of the horrors of the Korean War or
the current suffering of starving North Koreans as they wait
happily for a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the North Koreans, but what can you do?''
asked Eum Seong Jin, a university student, standing in line with a
couple of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beside him, Shin Hyun Joo, working for an American company,
contrasted her response to the North with that of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents' generation went through the Korean War,'' she
said. ``Many left families behind in the North. They have strong
feelings. We don't have those feelings. It's like it's a different
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, all 360 seats on three floors were filled with diners
tucking in on the famous cold noodles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this place special is we know the recipe is
straight from Pyongyang,'' said Kim Ok Ja, visiting the restaurant
with her husband. ``The flavoring is different.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the result of the culinary skills of two employees: a
chef who holds a Japanese passport and was trained at the Okryukwan
in Pyongyang, and a defector who once worked at another restaurant
in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're training all our 27 cooks,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   To further guarantee authenticity, he has purchased hundreds of
chopsticks, ceramic spoons, plates and bowls from the North, all
displaying the label of the Okryukwan Restaurant. Some of them bear
the initials ``DPRK'' on the bottom. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who has been importing metal products from the North for
eight years, sees the restaurant as setting three precedents:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1991, when there was the first economic cooperation
between North and South, all the business was in the North,'' he
said. ``This is the first such business in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now all economic transactions between North and South
were based on crops and raw materials,'' he said. Now Koreans ``can
feel real cooperation since this is a service sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang, he added, ``is going to register the name of
Okryukwan in the South,'' and the South Korean government has
promised to accept it. ``That means, if a South Korean company
wants to sell anything in the North, North Korea will register its
brand as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes help account for the restaurant's popularity
among South Koreans curious about life in the North. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the food,'' said Park Yong Sub, an elderly man who
said he had come from his home town of Hamhung in North Korea
shortly before the Korea War. ``It's the idea of a taste from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's popularity has surged so fast that Kim hopes to
open another 10 just like it. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   He has the permission of the South Korean government, eager to
push reconciliation with the North, as well as the cooperation of
North Korean authorities, eager to export their products.
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is how long supplies can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the food shortage problem in the North, we
anticipate that the supply will not be stable,'' said Kim, who has
asked for three shipments of buckwheat a month as well as a ton a
month of mung bean, used in Pyongyang-style pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   He talks every day to representatives of a trading company in
North Korea, patching calls through Tokyo. A Korean-Japanese
company handles the paperwork for shipments that Pyongyang still
does not want to recognize as moving directly to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure where they get the buckwheat and the mung bean,''
Kim said, but he believes the North Koreans buy it on a free market
that has grown as government agencies break down. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Okryukwan attempts to live up to the reputation
of its namesake in Pyongyang. A painting of the original Okryukwan,
made by a North Korean artist, adorns the outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   There are no signs, however, of Kim Il Sung, the longtime North
Korean leader who ordered the establishment of the Okryukwan in the
early 1960s, or his son and heir, Kim Jong Il. ``We are completely
non-political,'' Kim, the restaurant owner, emphasized. &QL;

<P>
   One year before completing their home in Ross, Calif., Mary and
Bill Poland began scouting for a Valley oak, a picture-perfect
wide-branched tree that would exactly match the one depicted by
their architect in his sketch of their new home.
</P>
<P>
   After searching up and down the state, Mary eventually found one
_ a 30-foot, 50-year-old beauty for $12,500 _ at a nearby nursery.
</P>
<P>
   She reserved it, waited for her house to be finished, and then
had it brought over by truck and planted by her driveway, where it
offers shade for her house and takes the newness off her property.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell when the home was built. It has an old-world
look,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   Trophy trees: The trend was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   As people look to recreate the grand houses of the past (the
Polands' is 8,000 square feet, in the French Mediterranean style),
they want the trees around them to be just as lofty.
</P>
<P>
   Says Barry W. Starke, president of the American Society of
Landscape Architects, ``Older trees, the really large ones, used to
be bought by older folks, who didn't have the time to watch a tree
come into its glory. But now it seems the younger people with money
don't want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, trophy trees are American classics such as
maples, oaks, and beeches; most are found on farms and older
estates about to be subdivided or in large nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   A lush, ample copper beech, valued for its leaf color and
beautiful bark, can cost $25,000. A 60-year-old disectum Japanese
maple _ typically slow growing and prized for its delicate, lacy
leaves _ can command over $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Verderosa, a landscaper in East Hampton, Long
Island, trees and shrubs go through fashions, much like houses.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent hemlocks were popular a few years ago in the Long
Island/Connecticut region; now he says, the demand is for topiaries
at least 60 years old and big hydrangeas, preferably 50-plus (their
prices range from $20,000 to $30,000).
</P>
<P>
   Dallas landscape architect Caye Cook says that live oaks, cedar
elms, magnolias, and American sweet-gum trees are now status
symbols par excellence in residential neighborhoods and commercial
parks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Many new homeowners are surprised by the lead time trophy trees
require.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the tree's extensive root system must be pruned in
stages, a process that can last roughly a year and a half or the
time it can take for the architect to secure the proper permits
from highway authorities; sometimes traffic lights have to come
down.
</P>
<P>
   And the home's value? Says Jo Bishop, a Kentucky-based realtor
who specializes in affluent communities, ``Trophy trees can easily
add 20 percent to a home's value, especially on smaller
properties.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For over a year we have heard the pundits and pooh-bahs say that
weak foreign economies pose the biggest risk to U.S. markets and
its economy. The Thai baht crisis of 1997 was supposed to knock us
down. Same for the Russian crisis of 1998. Ditto the Brazilian
currency collapse of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these falling dominoes, the American economy has been
growing at better than 4 percent, and the Dow easily pierced 10,000
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ma &AMP; Pa investor, who ignored the foreign headlines and kept
funneling their savings into the market, proved smarter than the
swamis.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my willingness to turn the conventional claims on their
head and declare that stronger foreign economies pose the biggest
risk to the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds loony, I know. Had I said that a dozen years ago, when I
was teaching economics, I might have been tossed from Harvard Yard:
Economics is not supposed to be a zero-sum game.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the collapse of Asia has been a boon to U.S.
consumers and to many U.S. corporations. Thanks to devalued Asian
currencies, we've been getting TVs, microwave ovens, and computer
chips at bargain prices, so our consumer price index has stayed
amazingly low.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging markets (and a sagging Japan)
have reduced their purchases of such commodities as gold, oil, and
copper, allowing U.S. firms to snap up raw materials at record low
prices and wider profit margins. (True, U.S. exporters to Asia like
Boeing and Caterpillar have suffered, but most Americans don't work
for such firms.)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, as foreign companies enter bankruptcy, they stop
borrowing money. That has meant lower rates for Americans borrowing
to buy homes and cars. The result: low inflation, high stock
prices, and happy consumers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When the foreign economies heal, however, Americans will lose
these freebies. As Asian countries have begun to recover _ South
Korea is now growing at a 5 percent pace _ the value of their
currencies has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Their goods will look more expensive to U.S. consumers. Asians
will begin borrowing more funds for new investments; worldwide
interest rates will creep up. And stronger foreign economies will
use more commodities, including copper, oil, and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing market propels furniture,
refrigerator, and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-business sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 till now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   We have gotten used to falling prices for commodities and
foreign goods, deflation that has offset the inflationary pressures
of a tight labor market in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under this ``world rebound'' scenario, Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan might feel compelled to raise interest rates to
prevent a burst of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-2000, higher rates could put the brakes on the U.S.
economy, especially slowing the now surging car and housing
markets. (Remember, the housing market propels furniture,
refrigerator, and washer-dryer sales.)
</P>
<P>
   We could even tip into a recession, if the Fed jacks up rates
too high. Even though some U.S. exporters would enjoy the world
rebound, most consumers would feel the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ could the U.S. be better off if the rest of the world
remained in recession? Not for long.
</P>
<P>
   We have benefited from Asia's collapse in the same way that a
shopper benefits from a going-out-of-business sale, by picking up
existing inventory below cost. But once the shelves are empty,
there are no more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Asia's going-out-of-business sale could not last much
longer, because its firms were closing their doors. If we could
somehow keep Asia in recession, its manufacturers could not afford
to build more bargains.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, we are better off if the rest of the world is
strong. But the short run, from late 1997 till now, has been a
swell party for American shoppers. &QL;

LEARNING CHESS WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM BORIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past several months, Boris and I have met frequently so
he could impart his knowledge of chess to me.
</P>
<P>
   Boris is as good a name as any for a chess-playing computer who
speaks in mostly clear, but measured, computer speech. I decided to
call him that because it's more personal than his formal title:
Chess Academy from Saitek Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Boris will take the beginning player, teach him about each
piece, its relative value, how it moves and captures, and how it is
governed by the rules of chess. He will then take the
more-knowledgeable beginner by the hand to the opening game,
indicating which pieces to move through light-emitting diodes on
each of the chessboard's 64 squares.
</P>
<P>
   He'll lead players down the right path, then have players back
the pieces up to show what could have happened should they have
moved to the wrong squares or attacked with the wrong piece.
</P>
<P>
   He's a lightweight to carry (about three pounds of board,
computer brain and playing pieces, which are stored in a
compartment underneath the board), but a heavyweight to play _
estimated rating of about 2000 at 40 moves in two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 rating means that he plays around the expert-master
level. The rating of the average United States Chess Federation
tournament player is about 1450.
</P>
<P>
   Boris, however, has 100 playing levels, including 60
fun/handicap levels that give beginners and intermediate players a
crack at winning a game every once in a while. In addition, there
are 10 casual levels, 10 tournament levels, 10 blitz levels, one
tactical and one infinite level and eight levels for solving setups
where mate is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The board measures 8-by-8 inches; the entire machine measures
16-by-11 inches and is about two inches thick. The pieces are
silver and black; the king is two inches high. The playing surface
is pressure sensitive, and moved pieces are shown both by LEDs on
the board and by a LCD display to the right of the board. The
machine draws power either from an adapter or six C-size batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The big selling point about Chess Academy (a.k.a. ``Boris'') is
that it not only instructs beginning and intermediate chess, but it
talks as well _ and it talks a lot. There are 10 basic learning
categories, with 10 lessons in each category.
</P>
<P>
   Players can go through the lessons at their own pace, but they
take a minimum of about eight or 10 minutes each to move through.
So that works out to be a minimum of 13-plus hours of audio
instructions in a chess computer.
</P>
<P>
   Chess Academy isn't the cheapest dedicated chess-playing
computer around. You can find them for as little as $25, and they
play better than the average tournament player. Chess computers
that play at the 2200 level cost a bit more _ about $60 to $80 is
an entry-price range. The lowest retail price I've found for Chess
Academy is $157.50 (www.icdchess.com).
</P>
<P>
   For 13 hours or more of chess instruction, the price works out
to be about $12 an hour for chess instruction _ and that doesn't
take into account that there's a strong chess opponent left over
long after the instructions are finished. From that standpoint, the
price appears in the ballpark for a dedicated chess computer for
the casual home player.
</P>
<P>
   Chess Academy's competition on the teaching side, of course,
comes from chess software. ChessMaster 6000 from Mindscape Inc.
offers instructions for beginners, top-ranked play, and even voice
commentaries on games played against the computer. The software
costs about $30 to $45.
</P>
<P>
   Add $600 or more to that price if you don't have a computer
system on which to run the software. In addition, chess software
ties up the system, while a dedicated chess machine doesn't.
Players who learn on a computer screen's two-dimensional board
sometimes discover it's a different game when played in a 3-D
setting, too.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for the self-contained chess game: It's
portable, not even needing an external power supply; travels
easily; and packs away out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons begin with the rules of moving pieces, explore openings,
end games, tactics, mating combinations and other aspects of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   After each topic, players can play the computer and put their
knowledge to work in a game. A ``chess coach'' can be called upon
to automatically point out careless or poor moves to beginners. And
when the computer is set on its easiest mode, even an inexperienced
pawn-shover can manage a victory. Nudging the computer's
intelligence level up a notch provides for a more challenging game,
and helps the beginner gain experience.
</P>
<P>
   Saitek also offers smaller chess computers at lower prices. And
the company has a good way of grouping computers for novice,
intermediate and experienced players. It's as simple as A, B, C.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpha series is for beginners. All the computers in the line
begin with ``A.'' The Benchmark series has the Bullet, Blade and
Barracuda for players who want a stronger game. And the Connoisseur
line has names beginning with ``C.'' The Chess Adademy is in that
grouping.
</P>

   Drinking coffee could protect people from radioactivity,
according to scientists in India who have found that mice given
caffeine survive otherwise lethal doses of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Bombay injected
471 mice with varying amounts of caffeine and then exposed them to
7.5 grays of gamma radiation _ usually a lethal dose. But 25 days
later, 70 per cent of the mice given 80 milligrams of caffeine per
kilogram of body weight one hour before radiation exposure were
still alive. By contrast, all 196 of the mice not given caffeine
and exposed to the same dose of radiation had died.
</P>
<P>
   Higher doses of caffeine _ 100 milligrams per kilogram _ also
led to the majority of the mice surviving over the same period, as
did administering the drug just half an hour before irradiation.
But all those given a lower dose of 50 milligrams per kilogram
died, along with mice that were only injected with caffeine after
they had been irradiated.
</P>
<P>
   Kachadpillill C. George, who led the research, points to earlier
studies which suggest that caffeine reacts with the hydroxyl
radicals produced when cells are irradiated. This, he says, could
prevent the radicals from damaging cells and shutting down vital
bodily functions, such as the production of blood cells in bone
marrow. Bone marrow failure was the main cause of death among the
irradiated mice.
</P>
<P>
   George suggests that a better understanding of the protection
offered by caffeine might lead to improvements in the way that
radiation is used to treat cancer. His study is published in the
latest Journal of Radiological Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are cautious about interpreting George's
results, however. Peter O'Neill, a radiation researcher from the
Medical Research Council's Radiation and Genome Stability Unit at
Harwell in Oxfordshire, agrees that caffeine reacts with hydroxyl
radicals. ''But it may require very high concentrations in order to
protect cells from these radicals,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A cup of fresh coffee typically contains between 80 and 100
milligrams of caffeine while instant coffee contains slightly less,
according to Audrey Baker of the European Coffee Science
Information Center in Oxfordshire. A person weighing 154 pounds
might therefore need to drink at least 100 cups to receive the same
dose as the mice. However, George believes that smaller amounts of
caffeine might protect people from lower doses of radiation than
those used in his experiment.
</P>
<P>
   George is aware of the difficulty of extrapolating his data from
mice to humans. ''But at the same time,'' he says, ''it does
suggest that coffee might have some beneficial effects in
protecting against radiation.'' &QL;

   The smell from an old lady's armpits can raise your spirits, a
scientist in Pennsylvania claims. Her work also suggests that in
contrast, the scent of a young child does nothing to improve your
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Studies using animals have shown that smell is vital for
conveying information. Rodents can detect and transmit fear through
smell, for instance, and animals often identify a high-ranking
member of a group by its smell. A recent study has shown that
people can distinguish the body odor of both happy and fearful
people.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of body odor on people's moods has hardly been
explored at all.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Chen of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia
hoped to find out more. So she recruited 30 volunteers in six
different categories: girls and boys aged between 3 and 8, young
adult women and men in their early 20s and elderly women and men in
their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers all gave samples of their body odor by strapping
a gauze pad under each armpit and keeping it there for 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were not allowed to use any perfumes or
deodorants, or eat strong-smelling foods, in the four days before
the samples were collected. They could shower, but only with
unscented soap and shampoo. Odors were also collected from the
homes of all the donors and combined into a neutral control smell.
</P>
<P>
   Chen then asked 308 university students to complete a 36-part
questionnaire that assessed how positive their mood was. Then they
smelled the gauze pads from one of the six categories of people _
without being told what the smells were. After this, the students
answered the questionnaire a second time, this time with the
questions shuffled around.
</P>
<P>
   People who had inhaled the samples taken from old women's
armpits responded significantly more positively, Chen found. ''Old
women had an uplifting effect,'' she says. The smell of young men,
on the other hand, produced a depressive effect. In general, the
smell of older people improved mood, as did smells from females,
Chen will report in a future issue of the journal Physiology and
Behaviour.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Haviland, of Rutgers University in New Jersey, who
also worked on the project, says it's possible that hormones make
the body odor of young people signal aggression. But hormonal
changes may make the odor of older people, especially women, signal
that they are approachable. Alternatively, it could be that women
in their golden years are generally happy, and that their odor can
transmit this mood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The airborne chemicals that we collected from them _ ''l'eau
de grandmere'' _ may indicate that state,'' says Haviland. &QL;

   A few radar operators from RAF airborne early-warning aircraft
have taken their annual leave to coincide with the Wimbledon tennis
matches so that they can help the BBC anticipate rain at the
championships. The operators are working for David Morton, who runs
RaceNet Radar Systems of Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't stop the rain coming. But we can predict when it will
arrive to within a couple of minutes, so the BBC can reschedule its
programs,'' Morton says.
</P>
<P>
   RaceNet has developed a local weather radar based on the
hardware used on supertankers, but it needs skilled operators to
work with the proprietary software. A 2.5-meter antenna, mounted on
top of the 75-meter crane that the BBC uses for bird's-eye camera
shots, sends out a 9-gigahertz radar signal. The signal bounces off
any clouds that are heavy with water, which are displayed on a
computer screen as yellow patches. As a cloud moves, it leaves a
blue tail across the screen which shows which direction it is
moving.
</P>
<P>
   After plotting a cloud and its tail for six minutes, the team of
five operators calculates its speed and direction, and predicts
where it will be in 45 minutes and how long it will take to move
on. If the Wimbledon courts look a likely target, the team alerts
the BBC's Television Center in London, where staff line up
prerecorded programmes to fill the gap. &QL;

   A study of changes in wind patterns linked to global warming
over the past 50 years suggests they are slowing the planet's daily
spin by around half a millisecond every century. These effects open
up a new way of tracking the progress of global warming without the
uncertainties in simple temperature measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean currents associated with El Nio are already known to make
equatorial winds blow faster and boost the angular momentum of the
atmosphere. Momentum must be conserved, so the atmosphere steals
momentum from the Earth's rotation, making it spin more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite observations showed that last year's El Nio made days
drag on by an extra 0.4 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   Climate experts have suspected that steady global warming might
have a similar effect. Computer models of the effects of warming
point to the appearance of jets of fast-moving wind between the
troposphere and stratosphere, roughly 12 kilometers above the
Earth's surface. These would also boost the angular momentum of the
atmosphere, triggering a compensating slowing down in the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rodrigo Abarca del Rio of the French space agency's Toulouse
Space Center has looked for direct evidence of this. Over the past
50 years, the Earth's average temperature has been increasing by
around 0.79 C per century.
</P>
<P>
   Using wind data for the same period from the U.S. National
Centers for Atmospheric Research and Environmental Prediction,
Abarca del Rio calculated the angular momentum of the atmosphere.
He found it had increased in step with the temperature rise
</P>
<P>
   ''There has also been a net loss in angular momentum by the
solid Earth,'' he says. ''The data suggest that global warming has
caused a slowdown of the Earth at a rate of 0.56 milliseconds a
century.''
</P>
<P>
   This implies that global warming is responsible for almost
one-third of the slowing down in the Earth's spin scientists have
measured. It also suggests that the length of the day could provide
a means of monitoring global warming in future. Every 0.1 degree C
increase should produce a slowdown of 0.07 milliseconds, which is
easy to measure.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abarca del Rio says too many other complex effects
influence the Earth's spin, such as movement of molten rock beneath
its surface. Instead, he suggests using records on atmospheric
angular momentum, which have been kept since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Records of surface air temperature have been the main measure
of global warming,'' says Abarca del Rio. ''Measurements of
atmospheric angular momentum may be an easier and more reliable
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaki Satoh, a climate modeler at Saitama Institute of
Technology in Japan, agrees that the results could provide a new
and better way to monitor global warming. ''Atmospheric angular
momentum is increased by the El Nio event, so it is reasonable that
it should also increase with global warming.''  &QL;

   A unique population of tool-using orangutans is being threatened
by an upsurge in logging around the Suaq Balimbing research station
in the north of Sumatra, Indonesia. The apes fashion sticks into
probes with which they extract honey and insects from trees, and
dig out seeds from fruits protected by stinging hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Orangutans are found only in Borneo and Sumatra, and 90 percent
of them have been lost over the past century. The total population
was estimated at less than 40,000 even before the latest upsurge in
logging and the forest fires that have ravaged Borneo since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Suaq Balimbing orangutans live in an area of tropical forest
teeming with biting insects. ''It's a horrible place for research,
a fetid swamp, but it's orangutan paradise,'' says primatologist
Ian Singleton of the University of Kent at Canterbury, who has
recently returned from the area. Not only can the orangutans wield
tools, but they are more gregarious than most.
</P>
<P>
   The research station lies within the Gunung-Leuser National
Park. This is part of the Leuser Ecosystem, an area of tropical
rainforest extending over 2.5 million hectares. But the resignation
of Indonesia's President Suharto in May last year has created an
unstable situation. ''Because of the political uncertainty,
everyone is making the most of what they can get,'' says Singleton.
Loggers have been openly flouting regulations and removing many of
the large trees that provide the orangutans with their food.
</P>
<P>
   The apes are especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Even
selective logging has a drastic impact on populations. Females are
almost totally sedentary, and when large feeding trees are removed
they become malnourished. According to Kathryn Monk of the
Zoological Society of London, a scientific coordinator with the
Leuser Management Unit, half of the research area has already been
affected by logging. Even if the apes survive, she fears that the
disturbance could endanger their unique social behavior and tool
use.
</P>
<P>
   Some research students have even been threatened by loggers.
''In the past week, we've had meetings with local people and local
and provincial government. Everyone is giving their support,'' says
Monk. ''But in the longer term, we are concerned about encroachment
throughout the whole park.'' &QL;

WHY I WON'T WRITE ANY MORE ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great stories of modern journalism concerns R.W.
``Johnny'' Apple, the veteran national political correspondent of
The New York Times. In his younger days, Apple reported on New York
State politics and in the process scooped virtually all of his
colleagues in the Albany press corps.
</P>
<P>
   Back in those days, the Albany press corps used to gather after
work to play poker. Every night at the poker game, they would talk
obsessively about Apple, whose high performance and high octane
personality they both admired and despised.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, they decided such talk was counter-productive, so
they instituted a rule.
</P>
<P>
   The rule was that if you were going to talk about Apple at the
poker game, you had to pay five dollars for the privilege. For four
days thereafter, the poker game proceeded in stony silence.
Finally, on the fifth day, one of Apple's colleagues from the Times
marched into the room, threw fifty dollars down onto the table and
unburdened himself of a week's worth of Apple outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Some things must be said, regardless of the cost involved.
</P>
<P>
   And some things can't be said, because loyalty supercedes
candor. I am loyal to my cousin, Texas Governor George Bush. I put
that loyalty ahead of my loyalty to anyone else outside of my
immediate family. That being the case, it is not possible for me to
continue writing columns about the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist's allegiance must be to the reader. This is an
annoying and pretentious thing that journalists say, but it is, in
fact, true.
</P>
<P>
   Columns depend upon trust. The reader must know that the writer
is saying what he or she really thinks. A column is good to the
degree that it communicates real beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that genomics will fundamentally change science
and the global economy, so when I write columns that say that,
based on case studies that are relevant, you know on some level
that I am telling you the truth (as I see it). I am convinced that
Internet technology will fundamentally change the way we interact
and transact, so when I write columns that say that, I am telling
you the truth (again, as I see it).
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way for you to know if I am telling you the
truth about George W. Bush's presidential campaign because, in his
case, my loyalty goes to him and not to you. And there is no way
for you to know if I am telling you the truth about Al Gore's
presidential campaign because he and Bill Bradley are the only men
standing between my cousin and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   There will inevitably come a time when the Bush campaign does
something that I think is wrong. I won't write about it because I
am never going to write a column about my cousin that is not
sympathetic. He's family and I'm for him today, I'm for him
tomorrow, I'm for him as long as he's running for office.
</P>
<P>
   If for some reason he doesn't make it and decides to get out of
politics, then I'm for his brother Jeb from that day forward.
</P>
<P>
   Such a stance is antithetical to the columnist's first
obligation, which is to be of use to the reader. A columnist is
useless if his or her loyalty resides elsewhere. This is why the
Globe's Hiawatha Bray is such a good columnist. He doesn't care
whether Microsoft wins or loses. The only thing he cares about is
that you get the best available information about computer hardware
and software and are thus enabled to make smart choices about what
to buy and what not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years now, readers have complained to the Globe
about my Clinton columns (and, more recently, my columns about
Governor Bush). In the case of Clinton, it was argued that I
loathed him because he defeated my uncle, President George Bush, in
the 1992 election. The truth is, I loathed and loathe him because
he is loathsome.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaints about my Bush columns, all five of which I
thought informative and accurate, are not so easily dismissed. The
truth is I don't look at Governor Bush the way I look at Microsoft
or Putnam Investments or former Governor Weld. On some level, I
can't be honest about his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I want him to win not because I am convinced he would be a
better president than Al Gore (although I am convinced of that). I
really want him to win because I really want him to win.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I reserve the right to throw fifty dollars down on
the table from time to time and have at the latest outrage from the
Clinton team. And I will continue to write about political issues
and campaigns. But as a rule, those looking for commentary on the
year 2000 presidential election should look elsewhere. I'm out, due
to a prior commitment.
</P>

BUSH RECORD IN TEXAS IMPRESSES SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ If Silicon Valley leaders want to know how
George W. Bush would handle technology issues as president, they
should look no farther than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entrepreneurial heaven,'' Bush told 500 supporters
Thursday morning at a fund-raiser in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record on technology issues as governor of Texas has been
so pro-business, particularly on the thorny issue of tort reform,
that critics have questioned whether he has the best interests of
consumers in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But his drive to cut regulation and taxes on the industry has
won the support of the growing ranks of technology entrepreneurs in
Texas, and he is fast gaining friends and allies in the Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to 500 donors in Palo Alto, Bush preached to the
choir, supporting the technology industry's long-standing wishes to
get a permanent federal research and development tax credit, and to
allow more foreign workers into the country.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of the export of encryption technology, he said he
would allow companies to sell products overseas as long as products
could be just as easily bought from suppliers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record in Texas could be his strongest weapon as he seeks
money and votes in Silicon Valley, which has already become a key
battleground among candidates, Democratic and Republican, in the
2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton captured the support of many Silicon Valley
executives in 1992 and again in 1996. Democrats have been hoping
that Vice President Al Gore's work on technology issues would gain
him the favor of the region's donors and opinion leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the early buzz in the valley, as elsewhere, is about Bush.
In April, 55 executives from the area took out a full-page
newspaper ad urging him to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This week, technology leaders packed into his Bay Area
fund-raisers. Bush aides estimated that half the $1.7 million
raised at two major events in San Francisco and Palo Alto had come
from Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have this on the first (campaign) trip, I think it's a
very good sign,'' Gerald Parsky, chairman of Bush's California
campaign, said of the fund-raising totals.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush was elected governor in 1994, he had little exposure
to the technology industry. He began his career in the oil and gas
business in west Texas and made his fortune selling his interest in
the Texas Rangers baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   He came to power just as the technology sector in the Lone Star
State was hitting full bloom. Between 1990 and 1996, more tech jobs
were created in Texas than in any other state. The state is home to
such corporate heavyweights as SBC Communications, Dell Computer,
Texas Instruments and the Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Papermaster, an Austin software executive and Bush
supporter, recalls that the governor struggled at the start to
understand the needs of the complex industry, from the
telecommunications companies concentrated north of Dallas to the
software start-ups of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely had a learning curve regarding technology,''
Papermaster said. ``But he did not have a learning curve regarding
being an entrepreneur, and understanding how to grow companies
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bush tapped executives for his Science and Technology
Council, which he used to develop initiatives to help the industry
keep growing. Several of the group's recommendations were approved
by the Legislature, including a research and development tax
credit, expanded advanced placement classes at high schools, and a
beefed-up technology curriculum for the state's community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are still coming in'' from the council's efforts,
said Al Wargo, president and chief executive of the
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp., a consortium that
includes two dozen technology companies. ``Clearly, as far as
education goes, I think Bush does have a fairly nice track
record.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Bush signed legislation to reduce a state tax on
Internet access. The bill will keep residents from paying tax on
the first $25 of monthly Internet access costs.
</P>
<P>
   The flourishing economy allowed Bush and the Legislature to make
more significant cuts in the state's sales tax and in property
taxes, as well as an estimated $464 million in business tax cuts,
according to the governor's office. But in 1997 Bush was forced to
abandon a more ambitious tax reform effort that was strongly backed
by the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has no personal income tax, and its state franchise tax,
or business tax, does not apply to companies designated as
partnerships, including law firms, doctors' groups and consulting
firms. As a result, technology and other companies feel they bear
an unfair share of the business tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to address the issue by proposing cuts in property
taxes, while requiring the partnerships to start paying the
business tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened up a can of worms,'' said Jon Roberts, an economist
at Angelou Economic Advisors in Austin, which is now working for
Bush's economic development commission. Trial lawyers and doctors'
groups lobbied hard against the proposal, and the Legislature
blocked the reforms. But the effort signaled to technology
companies a desire by Bush to meet its policy goals, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   No single issue has endeared Bush more to the technology sector
than the governor's work on tort reform. Technology companies, in
Texas and in Silicon Valley, have long argued that they are at
higher risk from frivolous lawsuits, especially from shareholders
angered when a company's stock price drops. Bush has successfully
pushed legislation making it easier for courts to toss out
frivolous suits, and to limit damage awards.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Bush signed a Y2K bill, one of the first in the nation,
to limit liability to companies if their products or computer
systems go haywire starting Jan. 1, 2000. The bill requires
companies to alert customers about possible problems, and requires
a 60-day cooling off period before any lawsuits can be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the crowd of 500 Silicon Valley supporters, ``I will
take the side of innovation over litigation every single time.''
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer advocates in Texas say Bush has gone too far
in his push for tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been more responsive to the needs of business than to the
needs of private individuals and consumers,'' said Reggie James,
director of the Southwest regional office of Consumers Union in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of those things had to happen, especially (the
restrictions) on frivolous lawsuits,'' James said. ``But most of
their stuff was business interests that said, we're losing too much
money in these cases, so we need to do something to change the
playing field. That's not good public policy.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal government study has just told us what we
want to hear. Legalized gambling is okay. Games of chance won't
bring down the republic.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Relax and enjoy playing the odds, if you wish. You
might get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   A young Minnesota woman claimed a $150 million Powerball lottery
jackpot July 1, beating odds of 80 million to one. Tens of
thousands of eager players had waited patiently in long lines from
coast to coast in the days before the drawing for a shot at the
prize. The losers were out a few bucks but they did share a brief
anticipation of realizing their wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone was really worried that the blue ribbon
commission that spent three years and $5 million to write a
340-page report would order the casinos to close and the lotteries
to shut down. The political fix was in.
</P>
<P>
   As the fastest growing industry in the country, gambling is an
800-pound gorilla perfectly capable of protecting its interests
against government meddling, thank you. Congress and the White
House like the industry's hefty campaign contributions. State
governments like it because they get a piece of the take. And the
public likes it because it is nonviolent, easily accessible
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Those hypocritical moralists who routinely posture against sin
in Congress didn't blink an eye at the commission's benign
attitude. If there were enraged sermons from pulpits, nobody
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide Gallup Poll last week showed that 63 percent of
American adults approve of legalized gambling. Another study in
Demography magazine found that three in four church-goers regard
casino gambling as harmless adult fun.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission labored mightily
to agree. Gambling in many forms is here to stay and we may as well
get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a free country, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I am not interested in gambling. It is not
my thing.
</P>
<P>
   I once peered into the great casino at Monte Carlo and I have
wandered through flashy shipboard casinos. But I never have sat
down to play the wheel or any other game. I am not a poker-player.
Pulling the lever on a slot machine strikes me as boring.
</P>
<P>
   But neither am I a prude. I bet on horse-racing, although if I
pick the wrong horse in the Kentucky Derby for the umpteenth time
again next year, I may give it up. I have enjoyed bingo since as a
child I learned to play several cards simultaneously under the
tutelage of my parents in the Danish Hall in Sioux City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   I barely know Frank Fahrenkopf Jr, the former Republican
national committee chairman who is head of the American Gaming
Association. He's also its chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   But so long as federal regulations keep the industry crime-free,
as it now seems to be, I cannot see any cultural danger in it.
Gambling is a voluntary activity. Nobody is forced to enter a
casino or pick up a playing card. If you disapprove, don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a few people become addicted to gambling and blow the
family fortune. This is tragic. But occasional self-inflicted
financial irresponsibility is no reason to kill the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   The special commission put the number of pathological gamblers
at no more than 1.5 percent of the U.S. adult population. It
sensibly suggested treatment for them.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also warned that the industry is growing so
rapidly that it needs to be carefully monitored. Fine. A few new
limitations such as a ban on betting on amateur sports and raising
the gambling age to 21 make good sense.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission also took a poke at state lotteries, on the
grounds that government services should not be financed largely on
the backs of the low-income minorities and other poor people who
are the heaviest players. The commission urged states and
communities to consider a moratorium on new lotteries until the
social consequences can be further evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddlesticks. That is bleeding-heart liberalism at its
bloodiest. Lotteries are a clean way to get people to do
voluntarily what they resent doing through mandatory taxes, which
is to pay for education and other public necessities. If lotteries
offer impossible hope against insurmountable odds, so be it. A buck
is a cheap price to pay for a dream, however temporary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the federal government ought to consider expanding
rather than constricting the lottery concept. How about a
nationwide lottery to help finance Social Security and Medicare?
Don't laugh. Think about it.

   TOUR-DE-FRANCE (Paris) _ An air of profound pessimism hangs over
the sport of cycling these days, and it hangs heavier than usual
with the Tour de France, which begins Saturday, for it was during
last year's race that the cover was blown off the sport's
far-reaching drug problem. Since then, cycling, the sport that for
Europe has been a cultural treasure as well as a formidable
commercial enterprise, has suffered a collapse in credibility so
great that many of its riders, organizers and sponsors fear for its
future. A Special Report by Christopher Clarey and Samuel Abt.

 &HT;    GORE CAMP SHAKEN BY GROWTH OF BUSH, BRADLEY WAR CHESTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Midyear funding reports have sent shock waves
through Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, sparking a
staff shakeup and nervous reassessments of his chief challengers in
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has added a new media consultant, policy adviser and
pollster to his campaign inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Eskew, a former partner of longtime Gore media adviser
Bob Squier, is joining the Gore team, apparently as the campaign's
lead strategist. Squier, who had that role in addition to
responsibility for campaign ads, will now concentrate on media.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran pollster Celinda Lake will join Mark Penn's polling
operation, with special attention to the development of messages
related to family and women's issues. And Lauren Choi, a senior
official at the Treasury Department, will provide policy advice.
</P>
<P>
   The additions of Eskew and Lake pose some interesting dynamics
in the organization. Squier was miffed by Eskew's departure to form
his own firm following the 1992 presidential election. Last year,
their relationship was further frayed by Eskew's involvement in the
tobacco industry's effort to kill anti-smoking legislation backed
by the Clinton-Gore administration. Similarly, Lake has promoted
more liberal positions than has Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, denied that the staff
additions amounted to a shake-up of the Gore inner circle. ``We're
adding strong members to the team when appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the moves followed fund-raising reports this week that
suggest the vice president faces a real challenge from former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore continues to hold comfortable polling leads over
Bradley, ``we obviously have some stiff competition, and we want to
deal with it,'' said Roger Salazar, deputy press secretary for Gore
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley raised $11.5 million through the first half of 1999. And
while Gore collected $18.5 million, Bradley has enough in the bank
to mount a strong challenge against the vice president, despite
Gore's backing from a popular president and the White House
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown we can raise the funds we need to run a credible
race,'' said Anita Dunn, a Bradley strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said the vice president would prevail in the
Democratic contest despite Bradley's fund-raising prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised Bradley can raise money,'' said Gore adviser
Kiki Moore. ``But going into the third quarter, things get much
more difficult with no message and no ideas to propel him beyond
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week's funding reports signal worse problems down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp was stunned by the record-shattering $36.2 million
raised by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, raising worries that the
GOP front-runner could have enough money left over after securing
his party's nomination to begin media attacks on his Democratic
opponent well before the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore re-election campaign followed such a strategy
in 1996 against Bob Dole, who was forced to look on helplessly
after spending every campaign dollar to secure the Republican
nomination in the face of the $37 million challenge waged by
billionaire publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is seeking the GOP nomination again, and Bush's
aggressive fund-raising seems aimed not so much at Gore as at
enabling him to respond to Forbes in the primary campaign.

   Gore's new campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, denied that the staff
additions amounted to a shake-up of the Gore inner circle. ``We're
adding strong members to the team when appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the moves followed fund-raising reports this week that
suggest the vice president faces a real challenge from former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore continues to hold comfortable polling leads over
Bradley, ``we obviously have some stiff competition, and we want to
deal with it,'' said Roger Salazar, deputy press secretary for Gore
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley raised $11.5 million through the first half of 1999. And
while Gore collected $18.5 million, Bradley has enough in the bank
to mount a strong challenge against the vice president, despite
Gore's backing from a popular president and the White House
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown we can raise the funds we need to run a credible
race,'' said Anita Dunn, a Bradley strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said the vice president would prevail in the
Democratic contest despite Bradley's fund-raising prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised Bradley can raise money,'' said Gore adviser
Kiki Moore. ``But going into the third quarter, things get much
more difficult with no message and no ideas to propel him beyond
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But this week's funding reports signal worse problems down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp was stunned by the record-shattering $36.2 million
raised by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, raising worries that the
GOP front-runner could have enough money left over after securing
his party's nomination to begin media attacks on his Democratic
opponent well before the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore re-election campaign followed such a strategy
in 1996 against Bob Dole, who was forced to look on helplessly
after spending every campaign dollar to secure the Republican
nomination in the face of the $37 million challenge waged by
billionaire publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is seeking the GOP nomination again, and Bush's
aggressive fund-raising seems aimed not so much at Gore as at
enabling him to respond to Forbes in the primary campaign.

 &HT;    Unlimited expansion may be wave of future
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 4
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two frontiers loom on radio's horizon that may very well change
it more in the next 100 years than anything it has already seen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  COMPUTERS: Home computers have opened up a whole new way to
listen to the radio. With a simple click of the mouse and a pair of
headphones, millions of Americans are listening to live broadcasts
of country music from Nashville's WSIX-FM, New Orleans' jazz on
WWOZ-FM, adult album alternative on San Francisco's KFOG-FM and
traffic reports from KFI in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Radio Advertising Bureau, of the 10,500 radio
stations licensed in the United States, 4,300 have an Internet
presence. Of those, 1,100 feature audio, including Atlanta's WSB,
Jazz Flavors 104.1, WGST, Star 94, 96rock, 790/The Zone and 99X.
Even longtime local broadcasters Don Kennedy and Ludlow Porch have
jumped into cyberspace with Internet sites featuring big band music
and folksy chat.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the industry is still unclear, though both
broadcasters and advertisers are licking their chops at the revenue
and promotional possibilities of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SATELLITES: Technology now exists that allows a radio station
to be beamed off a satellite and broadcast coast to coast _ in
homes, cars and portable receivers. The arrival of this technology
is imminent. In June, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
signed a deal with XM Radio that will offer 100 satellite radio
channels of news, music and entertainment in cars in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. A teenager riding around the suburbs of Atlanta
may very well be singing along to the same song as a kid in Seattle
_ at the very same time. Satellite technology opens the door for
the possible creation of national radio stations, reaching not just
thousands of listeners, but millions. By 2005, industry experts
forecast that the satellite radio market will be more than a $2
billion industry.

 &HT;    Retro musicals mine '70's oldies in quest for Broadway goldies
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 4
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Millions of Americans have fond memories of the British
rock invasion of the '60s. But are we ready for a retro '70s
onslaught?
</P>
<P>
   Three London stage musicals are merrily thumping along with
25-year-old pop hits of loud, steady backbeats. One show even
features lapels as wide as bat wings and women's hair as poufy and
frosted as Farrah Fawcett's in her heyday.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Saturday Night Fever'' (adapted from the 1977 film) that
will begin previews on Broadway in September. It features
electrifying dance (but not much else) to recommend it. ``Mamma
Mia'' is a sure bet to follow across the pond. This out-of-nowhere
hit tells a sweet, appealingly goofy family tale by ingeniously
cobbling together old hits of the Swedish group Abba, inspiring Gen
X'ers and boomers in jeans and business suits to stand up and
boogie to reprises of ``Dancing Queen'' (Don't laugh: It's better
than you remember).
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul Train'' is also running, and judging from publicity
posters (``Afros'' that could barely fit through a door) the revue
lampoons '70s style as much as it celebrates such hits as ``Sexual
Healing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the key to the '70s mini-craze: tunes. The theater is now
reclaiming, under the banner of nostalgia, the generation of
pop-rock songwriters it lost a quarter-century ago. After ``Hair''
and ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' spun Top 40 radio hits, theater
music and pop-rock hits went separate ways. They're beginning to
come back together as aging '70s hitmakers (Elton John and his
``Aida,'' Paul Simon and ``The Capeman'') shift styles and venture
into the riskier waters of theater.
</P>
<P>
   There's less risk in repackaging old hits, as in the Bee Gees'
``Fever'' and Abba's ``Mamma Mia.'' Especially now that a graying
baby-boom generation, raised on rock more than theater, has the
disposable income for theatergoing (top London tickets cost
``only'' $55, about $20 behind Gotham rates).
</P>
<P>
   In ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the hits indeed keep on coming:
``Stayin' Alive,'' ``How Deep Is Your Love.'' The Brooklyn accents
are so well done you'd never guess this is a mostly British cast.
Director-choreographer Arlene Phillips brings the explosive energy
and cool control seen in her direction of ``Lord of the Dance.''
With a very large (47) cast, ``Fever'' slams you with a spectacle
of movement in the mirror-ball bedazzlement of the disco floor.
</P>
<P>
   But what the show has gained in athleticism, it's lost in heart.
The campy book by American Nan Knighton (``The Scarlet Pimpernel'')
makes Tony Manero (Ben Richards), the working-class Everyman who
lives to dance, even more of a sexist jerk than John Travolta was
at the beginning of the movie (``When can we make it, Tony?''
pleads one of his female admirers, in the sexual euphemism of the
day). Tony's redemption becomes even more jarringly sentimental,
unconvincing. Richards is an incredible dancer but lacks Travolta's
vulnerability and charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fever'' shapes up as Broadway's next ``Footloose'': a soulless
retread of a teens-in-mischief movie. An exercise in human motion,
not emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamma Mia'' has it both ways. It taps the decade's melodic
treasure chest without getting stuck in '70s camp. Catherine
Johnson's disarming book uses two time frames. In the present,
Sophie (Lisa Stokke), a 21-year-old English girl, plans a wedding
at the Greek isle hotel of her single mother (Siobhan McCarthy).
She secretly invites the three men who were involved with her
mother during the summer of her birth, one of whom might be her
father.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding reunites the mother with pals from a '70s singing
group (Louise Plowright as the peroxide bombshell; Jenny Galloway
as the short, funny one), and the women playfully reprise ``their''
hits as if they'd been the lead singers of Abba.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical context creates new dimension for Benny
Andersson-Bjorn Ulvaeus songs that used to sound so bubble-gummy,
almost creepily antiseptic, on the radio. ``Name of the Game''
becomes a poig-
</P>
<P>
   nant query from Sophie to the man who may be her father. When
chubby yet lusty Galloway challenges a hunky male to ``Take a
Chance on Me,'' the audience roars its delighted surprise. As we
wonder how Johnson will fit these old songs into her new story, the
book becomes a kind of Easter egg hunt for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s and the '90s generations are symbolically reconciled in
the cross-generational blowout of the wedding reception, to the
soaring strains of ``Dancing Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the show can keep the special chemistry of the British cast
(in other words, if Actor's Equity will loosen the hiring rules
that blocked ``Oklahoma!'' from crossing to New York), ``Mamma
Mia'' could be one of the most surprising of Broadway hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Fever,'' ``Mamma Mia''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fever'' at the Palladium, ``Mamma'' at the Prince Edward
Theatre, London. Open-ended runs.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``Fever'' is Broadway bound, but it's the far less
familiar ``Mamma Mia'' that would win Gotham cheers.
</P>

 &HT;    Red Cross chief: 'Job needs to be done'
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Steve Bullock was beginning his career at the American Red
Cross nearly four decades ago, he jokingly told colleagues that the
``folks at headquarters should get out of my way so I can run this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   His joke has become reality. Earlier this year, Bullock was
appointed acting president of the American Red Cross, an
organization with an annual budget of $2.2 billion, a paid staff of
32,000 and a volunteer base of 1.3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, 62, was an unlikely choice to fill the vacancy created
when Elizabeth Dole resigned the position. Not only was he the
first African-American to head the organization, he was the first
president to have worked his way up as an insider.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock joined the Red Cross because the organization's
humanitarian mission ``aligned'' with the work he wanted to do. The
Red Cross ``is in business to save lives and prevent and relieve
human suffering,'' he said during a recent visit to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He has wasted no time making an impact on the organization. ``My
time with you will be defined by action and tangible results,'' he
told Red Cross members this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not taken the position to baby-sit it,'' says Carol
Rittenhouse, chief operating officer for the Georgia Red Cross and
a colleague of Bullock's for more than two decades. ``He has
already done an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rittenhouse calls Bullock a ``walkabout'' person _ someone who
likes to be on the front line, willing to try new things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is also a great listener, with a very caring way about
him,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the Red Cross can consistently deliver on both
its emergency disaster services and everyday health and safety
services, Bullock stresses the need for stepping up its volunteer
programs. ``We need to be smarter and more creative in our efforts
to recruit volunteers and to make more effective use of those
volunteers. Volunteers are critical to our success.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Bullock wants to reach youth _ elementary school
kids through college students. ``I want to raise to a high level of
priority our involvement of and service to young people,'' he says.
``I want to return to the days (around 1940) when we had 20 million
members in the Junior Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   As the face of America changes, so must the inclusiveness of the
Red Cross, argues Bullock. ``We want our staff and volunteers to
look like the communities we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bullock started at the Red Cross as a caseworker in 1962,
it was inconceivable that a black person might one day lead the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross was part of the culture of those days,'' he
says. ``Blacks went to Brooklyn for their training, whites went to
Charlottesville, Va. There were certain jobs that (blacks) couldn't
hope for.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1976 Bullock was appointed executive director of the St.
Paul area chapter _ the first African-American to become a Red
Cross chapter head. In 1982 he was appointed chief executive
officer of the Greater Cleveland chapter, a position he still
holds.
</P>
<P>
   His accomplishments are all the more remarkable considering the
humbleness of his background. Growing up in Enfield, N.C., a
farming town of 6,000, he was the youngest of 22 children _ his
father was born in 1865 and lived into his 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned early about the importance of community,'' Bullock
says.
</P>
<P>
   And today the American community is covered by the Red Cross _
Bullock guarantees the organization ``will be there'' for any
disaster anywhere in the country. Now he wants to increase the
organization's international involvement. A trip to Macedonia two
months ago had a profound impact on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of (the refugees') stories would tear your heart out,''
says Bullock. ``People walked over dead bodies. They saw family
members killed, saw their homes burned over their shoulders, and
were told not to turn back or be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the midst of atrocity after atrocity, the best side of
people also emerged, he says. ``The human spirit is powerful, and I
see it everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why _ though his position takes him from one disaster
scene to another _ Bullock never expects to experience burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job needs to be done. You feed on seeing you can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross volunteers are needed for the organization's blood
drives, disaster action teams and community disaster education
programs. Mental health professionals also are needed to provide
counseling services for victims of disasters and administrative
support. For additional information, call 404-876-3302 or log onto
the Red Cross Web site at www.redcross.org/atlanta.

   HOUSING-FOR-MODELS (New York) _ The biggest threat to a New York
City model's well-being isn't bugs in her group-living housing
environment. Far more serious are the perils of light-fingered
fellow models, boredom when work is slow, too much partying _ and
men. The big modeling agencies in New York that provide group
apartments (almost all do) intend them as protected towers to guard
their Rapunzels, mostly from would-be boyfriends and cutthroat
party promoters, who bear no resemblance to Prince Charming. By

natural habitats across the country. By Patricia A. Taylor.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4)  
 (af)  
 By ANGELA TRIBELLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two pretty, young women were lazing in their sparsely
decorated living room, watching an ``X-Files'' video and
contemplating the evening's options. Go to the club of the moment?
A restaurant with an unlisted number? That new Stephen Dorff movie?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a third roommate of improbable beauty materialized at
the top of the stairs, luggage in hand, and though she caused a
racket dragging her suitcases down the steps, no one seemed to
notice, or care much, that she was moving out.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment door flew open, and three more beauties entered.
One bounded across the room to answer a cell phone call from home.
The others discussed the latest domestic disaster: someone had put
regular soap instead of powdered in the dishwasher and had flooded
the kitchen with bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   If it seemed these women were too good-looking, too
sophisticated and yet too domestically challenged to be true,
that's because this is no ordinary apartment. It's a model
apartment, a three-story town house in Murray Hill rented by the
Elite modeling agency to house its newest recruits, and one of many
such agency-run dwellings around Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In these dormlike apartments, young women sleep four or six to a
bedroom, roommates last as long as a carton of soy milk, and
privacy is a pipe dream. If a supermodel's measure of success is
her own duplex in TriBeCa and a pied-a-terre in Paris, then these
upstart models in New York are still a few notches below a ``Brady
Bunch'' bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bugs, in general, are a huge problem,'' said Conor Kennedy, a
director of development at the Company Management model agency, who
is in charge of finding and overseeing new talent. ``Teen-age girls
come to New York City for the first time and don't realize the
hazards of leaving cheese out for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to a model's well-being isn't bugs, though.
Far more serious are the perils of light-fingered fellow models,
boredom when work is slow, too much partying _ and men.
</P>
<P>
   The big modeling agencies in New York that provide group
apartments (almost all do) intend them as protected towers to guard
their Rapunzels, mostly from would-be boyfriends and cutthroat
party promoters, who bear no resemblance to Prince Charming.
</P>
<P>
   Newly signed models arrive every week in Manhattan from small
towns or foreign countries, often as young as 15 and away from
parents for the first time. They are too new to the business to
earn enough to pay for their own places, and so agencies provide
group lodging usually in doorman buildings and supervised by
chaperones.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a handful of the model apartments in the city, one
would expect a glamourous scene out of ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.''
But it's more like ``The Facts of Life,'' only with thinner
characters.
</P>
<P>
   A peek into the refrigerators of the apartments reveals yet
another potential threat to the occupants. At the Company
Management apartment in the Lower East Side the other day, the
refrigerator contained Boost lactose-free nutritional shakes,
organic blue cornflakes, salsa, mustard and three varieties of Eazy
Cheeze.
</P>
<P>
   But despite appearances, models are never forced to choose
between paying rent and eating. Most agencies simply keep track of
how many weeks the young women live in an apartment, and then
deduct rent _ $200 to $350 a week, depending on the unit _ from
their future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model's apartment is always an advance, and the rent is a
debt to us,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   For the models, the trade-off for flexible housing in a doorman
building is overcrowding and a lack of privacy. Single-occupancy
rooms are rare. Bunk beds are more common, and blow-up mattresses
serve in a pinch. Severine, a French model who lived in Elite's
apartment early in her career, recalled some of the difficulties of
stacked sleeping quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange experience,'' she said. ``You're asked to live
with maybe 10 girls, and you don't know them. I remember one girl,
she was calling, you know, sex on the phone all night. It was so
weird, you know, because in the bunk bed you can hear everything.
And I just wanted to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the women bond quickly, there is little incentive for
them to be held accountable to their roommates. ``The biggest
problem in a models' apartment is stealing,'' Kennedy acknowledged.
``There can be no decorations or adornments of any kind in the
apartment. Anything will be stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even eggs. ``One time a girl ate six eggs at once,'' recalled
Celesta Shanti Hodge, an up-and-coming star at Company Management,
who lived in the agency apartment. ``I went out, and 20 minutes
later, all my eggs were gone! Two-dollar falafels? I ate those
things every day. We really were starving models.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Cole, a former owner of Spy, a lounge in SoHo that was a
big model scene, once dated a model who was living in the
Wilhelmina International agency's apartment. ``This one girl who
was stealing everything was just (italics)out of control,''(end
italics) he said, drawing out the syllables. ``Eventually the
agency sent her back to Croatia, or wherever she was from. But
after she left, all the other girls woke up the next morning to
find out that she had taken all their designer shoes and split.''
</P>
<P>
   If an apartment houses more than four models, agencies often
hire a live-in chaperone. Straight men, of course, are out of the
question. Gay men are a better option, but women are preferred by
both the parents and the agencies.

 NEW YORK: the agencies.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to find the ideal chaperone,'' Kennedy said.
``What normal person wants to live with four teen-age girls from
Dubuque?'' Company Management forbids girls younger than 16 to live
in the models' apartment without a female relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be the mother of eight daughters,'' said
Karen Lee, the chaperone at the Elite town house. The other
morning, she knocked on the second-floor bathroom door, and
reminded the shower's occupant about an early appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Then she opened the door to one of the bedrooms, which held two
sets of bunk beds. Between the beds, an entire wall was covered
with fashion photos and beauty-product advertisements clipped from
magazines. On the wall beside a pillow, someone had scrawled in
crayon, ``I Love Curt Thompson.''
</P>
<P>
   Most agencies have extensive lists of rules for their
apartments' young tenants. David Grilli, who was hired by
Wilhelmina to straighten out its apartment three years ago when
several models were breaking house rules, remembered the strict
rules he devised. ``If they were under 18, they had to be in by 10
on weekdays, 11 on weekends,'' he said. ``No smoking, no drugs or
drinking, and no loud music. And no men were allowed, not even
their brothers or their fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   At ID Models, which has three apartments, all new models are
required to sign a document, agreeing to comply with house rules.
One item advises, ``Avoid lengthy conversations'' while on
bookings.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Like most agencies, ID considers its models valuable
commodities, and it doesn't want them becoming too friendly with a
rival agency employee who might try to poach them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is night life that worries Paolo Zampolli, the president
of ID, the most. ``When they start to go out, they're gone,'' he
said flatly. ``They don't work the next day. One girl that goes out
every night is enough to destroy the apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Going out is a bigger temptation for models who aren't working,
because those who do a full day's work are exhausted by 6 p.m.
Consequently, the models' schedules are designed to keep them busy.
Every morning, fledgling models call their bookers to confirm the
day's appointments, a full day of five to 10 casting calls, photo
shoots and ``go-sees,'' which are appointments at which models meet
prospective clients. Car services are reserved for the ``big
girls,'' the more established models.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls spend nine hours a day walking and taking the
subway everywhere,'' Kennedy said. ``They can't even afford cabs
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, models are encouraged to go to the gym,
rent a movie or collapse in exhaustion. That's when the phone
begins to ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was here before we changed the number, we used to have
promotions people from clubs call every night,'' said Leigh-Anne
Knight, a resident of the Company apartment. Over the last year,
Company has had to change its apartment's phone number three times.
</P>
<P>
   Club promoters, the worthy opponents of agency management in a
chess match for the models' attention, are paid to bring them into
clubs. They bombard agencies with faxed invitations, befriend
bookers and pay extra attention to newcomers, who are more likely
to let slip the apartment's phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a half-dozen promoters are calling for the same model,
who's probably moved out of the apartment by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember this one promoter, his name was Unik,'' Ms. Knight
said. ``He would ask for someone, and we'd say, `Oh, she's not
here,' and he'd say: `Well are you a model? Come to the club,
you'll get in free! Bring all your friends!'''
</P>
<P>
   To Lyndsay, who at 19 is one of the oldest models living in the
Elite town house, model-chasing men are old news. ``We had a couple
of incidents with people in the trees outside,'' she said, smoking
a cigarette on the terrace with Siobhan, one of her apartment
mates. ``But it hasn't happened recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndsay has been modeling since she was 13. ``In the last couple
of days, we've gotten five new girls, and they'll probably all be
gone by next week,'' she said. ``Unfortunately, not everyone
understands that you can't give away the apartment's phone
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Any safe distraction that encourages the teen-agers to stay home
and away from the clubs is promoted by the agencies. They knit tube
tops and purses. VCRs are de rigueur in the apartments, and the
films the models choose to rent can be revealing. While ``Something
About Mary'' seems to be a universal favorite, the Elite models
can't get enough of ``Beautiful Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   At the apartment belonging to Karin's, another modeling agency,
the popular flick has been ``Gia,'' a made-for-cable hit about one
model's losing battle against heroin and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real-life movie,'' explained Nanda Hampe, a German model
living in the apartment. ``It was not a movie where you could
laugh.'' &QL;

   Worcester, Mass. _ The silver key dangles from a nail just
inside the door of Naim Bujubaj's barren flat in a working-class
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   For Bujubaj, a 26-year-old refugee, it is unclear whether it is
the key to his past or his future.
</P>
<P>
   It opens the door to his apartment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to use it,'' he said, squinting to try to hide his
tears. ``But I'm 90 percent certain that I will never be able to
use it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bujubaj's dilemma _ whether to return to his home or build a new
life in the United States _ has taken on new urgency in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO troops moved into Kosovo June 12, a growing number of
Kosovo refugees _ including many of the 329 who have resettled in
Massachusetts _ are considering returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go back, but I don't know how,'' said Zahir
Bacaliu, another Kosovar who recently settled in Worcester. ``If I
go back now, my house is burned and I don't know where I'd live.
</P>
<P>
   Those working with the refugees say Kosovars have a visceral tie
to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, they have fought so much for Kosovo,'' said
Albana Orgockacq, a social worker at the International Institute of
Boston, which has resettled about 65 Kosovars. ``If something could
change, they have to go back and be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 Kosovars have arrived in the United States since the
conflict began, said Eyleen Schmidt, a spokeswoman for the US
Immigration and Refugee Service, a branch of the Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Another 7,000 Kosovars in Macedonia have been approved to come
to the United States, but thousands of those refugees have returned
home instead, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have in my life is in Kosovo,'' Bacaliu said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacaliu24, left his corn farm in Kijeva, Kosovo, in May with his
mother, wife, two children, cousin and cousin's family after Serb
soliders ordered them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Their next journey, the Bacalius hope, will be a return to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like America, but I like my place more,'' said
XhemalBacaliu, Zahir's 27-year-old cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bay State social service agencies, including Lutheran
Social Services of New England, Catholic Charities and the
International Rescue Committee, have provided Kosovar refugees
financial assistance, temporary housing, job leads, and English
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO declares Kosovo a safe place, the United States will
allocate enough funds for the return trip home for all refugees who
choose to go back, Schmidt said. The free flight offer, however,
expires six months after Kosovo is deemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will have the right to apply for permanent resident
status.
</P>
<P>
   Luan Shala, 47, a music teacher and trombone player from
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, won't go back no matter how safe NATO
makes Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to live here and start a new life,'' said the
refugee who arrived in Worcester on June 23. ``I'm very afraid of
mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Shala was forced to leave his Pristina apartment May 5. ``The
paramilitary came with machine guns and told us to go to the
railroad station,'' said Shala, who continues searching for
information about his missing brother in Kosovo. ``They took our
money, our passports, any documents we had.''
</P>
<P>
   They gave him five minutes to gather all his belongings.
</P>
<P>
   That's three minutes longer than Naim Bujubaj had to pack his
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Bujubaj knew his departure was imminent. Just days before he
left, he found a cross in front of his door with the word ``dead''
scrawled across it. As he lay down to sleep that night, he thought
to himself, ``I think tomorrow I will be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks ago he, his sister, and his 24-year-old cousin,
Abediu Bujubaj arrived at Fort Dix, N.J., each with one bag holding
everything they now own.
</P>
<P>
   In better times, at the University of Pristina, Naim Bujubaj
studied economics while Abediu Bujubaj studied computers and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   They want to further their education in the United States so
they can master English. But they withdrew from Worcester
Polytechnic Institute because the aid they are receiving can barely
cover food costs, $550 a month rent, and utilities. They have
nothing left for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to stay here now,'' Abediu said. ``After this, we
will see what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the refugees, the Bujubaj cousins fear returning
while Russian troops remain in their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbian people and Russian people are the same,'' Abediu said.
</P>
<P>
   Naim doesn't know if his apartment back home is still standing
or _ as he believes likely _ was torched or looted by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   But he still won't throw away the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I escaped was the second time I was born,'' Naim said.
``I'd like to take the key to remember.''

HOW STYLISH PEOPLE DON'T DESCRIBE THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 4) 
(jt) 
 By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea is that you're 200 years old and you can
choose from 50 items within your lifetime,'' said Tiffany Dubin,
the director of the fashion department at Sotheby's auction house,
describing the premise for a book on style she is putting together
with Ann E. Berman, a writer. ``So what are  &UR; you &LR;  wearing?''
</P>
<P>
   At a photo shoot for the book on Wednesday in the East 20s, Ms.
Dubin had assembled so many stylish types to answer her question
that the city must have experienced a kind of style vacuum in its
other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Boardman, a young woman with shiny hair and pink and
white skin, combined a charcoal gray tube top and a pair of gray
Prada acetate pants, an outfit she accessorized with her two
adoring miniature Yorkshire terriers, Jemima and Ellise, as well as
a black velvet and rhinestone choker and black Manolo Blahnik shoes
with rhinestone buckles. ``She's dressed for Studio,'' Ms. Dubin
explained, meaning Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boardman had brought a suitcase full of delightful and
artful items, like a hairy black Gucci bag, which was both
Daliesque and cuddly, and knee-high leopard print boots with
stiletto heels. ``Dolce?'' Ms. Dubin asked, stroking one.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly.
</P>
<P>
   As they were stuffing the dogs into one bag and the boots into
another, Ms. Boardman and Ms. Dubin were asked to define the word
``fashionista,'' now so embedded in the lexicon of fashion insiders
that it is being weighed for inclusion in the Oxford English
Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not one, though I wish I were,'' said Ms.
Boardman, who nevertheless joins Serena Boardman, her sister, in
Vogue's 100: The Best-Dressed List, a mini-magazine packaged with
this month's Vogue. ``I don't do it daily, meaning really dress,
and I think to be a fashionista you have to. My sister will kill me
for saying this, but I do think my sister is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin said, ``Oh, I aspire to be a fashionista, to be hip,
fun, ever knowing. I don't think fashionistas are victims. I think
they're the trend initiators, the ones who know the cool place on
14th Street to get the right T-shirt to mix with the Gucci pants.
Hamish is definitely a fashionista,'' she offered, meaning Hamish
Bowles, the famously dandified European editor of Vogue, who
arrived that afternoon to be photographed in a cinnamon-color
djellaba and Gucci tuxedo pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion junkie?'' asked Hollister Lowe, the photographer for
the shoot. ``Isn't that what we're talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   Milly de Cabrol, resplendent in a see-through painted chiffon
Ossie Clark dress, said: ``What is this word? I don't use it. I've
never toiled in fashion.'' Ms. de Cabrol is a decorator. ``I wore
Prada 15 years ago,'' she added. ``Also Ferretti. I knew Zandra
Rhodes when I lived in London. Honestly, I'm not trying to be
presumptuous, but obviously I have this visual. Maybe I am a
fashionista. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Should the neologism make it into the OED's next edition, to be
published in 2010, or its online edition, which will appear next
spring, the definition might read like this:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FASHIONISTA &LR; . n. A dedicated follower of fashion; in extreme
cases, a fashion victim. Usage: informal. Etymology: fashion + ista
(1993, North American).
</P>
<P>
   Neologisms are like little postcards from the culture that
spawned them, and so ``fashionista'' is keeping company in the
files of OED editors with words like ``meatspace,'' which is the
opposite of cyberspace and refers to the real, flesh-and-blood
world.
</P>
<P>
   Of ``fashionista,'' Eleanor Rand, an OED editor, said: ``The
word fills a linguistic gap created by the rise of haute couture as
a highly visible industry over the past couple of decades.'' She
spoke not in meatspace, but by e-mail. She continued:
``Etymologically, the suffix `-ista' derives from Spanish and is
cognate with the English suffix `-ist,' designating a devotee,
adherent or practitioner of the noun to which it is affixed. The
implication could be of religious devotion, in line with the
increasing view of fashion and image (and shopping!) as a new world
religion; alternatively, if the formation is influenced (as seems
likely) by the names of Latin American political organizations _
Senderista, Sandinista, Peronista, etc. _ the word can be
interpreted as marking out those involved with the fashion industry
as a movement or army, united in their devotion to the cause of
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the use of ``fashionista'' by database in magazines and
newspapers, including this one, is like watching a tiny Internet
company go public. There was a single citation in 1993, in a book
review in The New York Times for ``Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of
the Supermodel Gia'' by Stephen Fried, in which the reviewer quoted
``fashionistas'' from the book. It appeared three times in 1994 (in
The Charleston Gazette, The Dallas Morning News and The Chicago
Tribune) and 26 in 1995. The next year, there were 54 citations, 74
in 1997, a whopping 243 in 1998 and no fewer than 225 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling: ``Hail to the Fashionistas!'' screamed a
headline in The Evening Standard, a London newspaper, in an article
about the 1997 American spring fashion collections, in which
fashionistas were described as the ``fashion mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, In Style magazine quoted Donatella Versace saying:
``I am a fashionista and proud of it. I adore fashion. I like to
wear outrageous clothes, to make an entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   George Rush, the gossip columnist for The Daily News, flings the
word around his pages like salt on french fries, using it for both
models and fashion editors.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Saban, the night life columnist for the original
Details, estimated that the magazine's readership was 50 percent
fashionistas. ``On the low side, they're the severely and absurdly
dressed couture geeks, whose lives revolve around what's in and
where they're seated at the Paris shows,'' he said. ``On the high
end, they're the kids who simply make magic out of odds and ends
found around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Musto, the Village Voice columnist and E! contributor,
said: ``I use it, and I'm not really sure what I mean by it. I
guess, though, it means someone for whom fashion is like the
militia. It's that rigid and powerful, and they're a mere foot
soldier. Or it's one of those wonderful words like `tofu' that
could mean anything you want depending on the inflection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried, now the editor of Philadelphia magazine, said he coined
the word for ``Thing of Beauty,'' about the short life of a
drug-addicted model and the fashion industry in the late 1970s and
early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I believe I invented it, but maybe I shouldn't
presume,'' Fried said. ``Anyway, my intention was to solve a
problem in my book of how to describe the army of people that
descend on the set of a professional fashion shoot.'' In the book,
he distinguishes between the beautiful people and the beautifying
people, those he calls the fashionistas. ``I needed a word to
describe Polly Mellen and Way Bandy and the models and all those
random assistants,'' he said. Ms. Mellen is the legendary Vogue
sittings editor, now the fashion director at Allure, and Bandy is
the equally legendary makeup artist, who died in 1986. ``Now, they
use it to refer to themselves,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mellen, for one, said the word means nothing to her.
``Fashion victim?'' she hazarded.
</P>
<P>
   None of the beautifying people on Ms. Dubin's set would admit to
the title, either. ``No one has actually come out as a fashionista,
so I guess we're going to have to start outing people,'' Musto
said.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's time for a coup.

   NEW YORK _ Marjorie plays like a 30-year-old and entertains like
a 50-year-old,'' said Earl Crittenden, a political writer and law
student, who was awaiting his dessert at a dinner last Saturday
night. Marjorie Gubelmann was the hostess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gubelmann had taken over a room and the terrace at Club
Colette, a year-old Southampton satellite of a private eating club
in Palm Beach, Fla., to entertain 65 of her friends. And while the
club's core group of 400 members are mostly older Palm Beach
families, Ms. Gubelmann draws the younger set. She does so,
strangely enough, by giving parties in a staid and formal style
more familiar a couple of generations ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gubelmann, who by day helps invest her family's fortune, is
earning a reputation as an accomplished hostess, following in the
footsteps of her grandmother Barton Gubelmann, a society doyenne in
Newport, R.I., and Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   When Marjorie Gubelmann was a little girl in Palm Beach, she
used to sneak upstairs to raid her grandmother's jewelry box, then
return to show off at parties whose guest lists included King
Hussein of Jordan and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   At 30, Ms. Gubelmann still loves to wear her grandmother's
jewels. She has been dubbed B.I.T, or Barton-in-Training by Quest
and Hamptons magazines. And she entertains just the way her
grandmother did, the old-fashioned way, except that she is clad in
a shimmering lace over chartreuse satin Versace dress and has a
slightly different idea of royalty. Her guest list last Saturday
included Shoshanna Lonstein, Mark Gilbertson and Nicole Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person who floats in many different groups,'' she said,
standing by a candlelighted pink table, overlooking the seating in
the room. She likes to mix them up. ``It may be a little dangerous,
edgy, but it's more fun,'' Ms. Gubelmann said, playing with her
20-carat tanzanite ring, a gift to herself for her 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Before her party, she carefully placed her thick gold-edged
monogrammed place cards (with fleurs-de-lis in the corners) for a
formal seated dinner.
</P>
<P>
   She learned the art of seating from Glamma, as she calls her
grandmother. ``For spice,'' she says, ``you mix the great cellist
with the gay decorator. You mix up old boyfriends with former
girlfriends. And you put one fabulous person on one side, and one
person that no one wants to sit next to on the other, so the guest
is not completely punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner that night: lobster vinaigrette and rack of lamb. ``I
don't think people should be fed mesclun salad and chicken
breast,'' she said, adding that she doesn't believe in giving her
guests a choice about what they eat. ``My grandmother would serve
grits and oxtail stew at a formal dinner, and if you didn't like
it, well then you ate more beans or you went home and ate a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   She is equally opinionated about hors d'oeuvres. ``In Newport,
we serve cheese or bacon-wrapped water chestnuts,'' she said.
``Here, it's more about sushi.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending most of her summers in Newport, Ms. Gubelmann now
prefers the Hamptons, where, she says, the social life has more
variety. ``You can go to the Meadow Club and you can go to Puff
Daddy's,'' she said.

NEUTRAL FED STANCE AND A WARY EYE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is not in the business of trying to confuse
investors. With testimony, speeches and comments from its chairman,
Alan Greenspan, and other Fed officials, the central bank's
leadership has done its best to telegraph all its moves in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   That is why there was no surprise when the Fed announced on
Wednesday that its short-term interest rate target was rising a
quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the other half of the announcement was a surprise, and it
left many investors scratching their heads _ which ought to add to
market volatility on the road to the Fed's next policy meeting in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the rate increase, the Fed said it changad changed
its outlook on interest rates from a bias toward higher rates _ a
stance adopted at the May policy meeting _ to neutral.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the first question is what the switch means. The
second is why the Fed made it. Surely, the policy-making Open
Market Committee knew that the change would be interpreted
positively by investors and give the stock market a boost, making a
gentle slowing-down of the economy _ the ostensible purpose of
raising rates _ that much harder to achieve. Sure enough, all three
major market indexes hit new highs by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors saw the switch to neutral as a signal that one
rate increase would be enough to brake economic growth and curb
inflation. But that is hard to believe, given recent economic and
price data.
</P>
<P>
   Some 268,000 nonfarm jobs were created in June, the Labor
Department reported on Friday, while hourly earnings rose 3.7
percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing sector _ whose earlier slump had helped
restrain wage pressures _ is rebounding and gaining momentum. With
the stock market now recovered from its spring selloff and consumer
confidence at a 30-year high, it is difficult to conclude that
consumers, the backbone of this expansion, are about to rein in
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The new surge in oil prices, which last week jumped above $19 a
barrel, should raise inflation concerns. With that jump, and a
rebound in industrial commodity prices, we could be in for another
shocking leap in the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The 0.7 percent surge in April helped prompt the Fed's bias
toward higher interest rates in May and the actual increase that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the Fed's recent history shows that a move to neutral
does not rule out another rate increase, or even indicate that the
outlook for tamer inflation and growth is improving.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Fed went to neutral after each rate increase in
the 1994-95 run-up, a period when the federal funds rate, the
overnight interest rate on loans between banks, jumped from 3
percent to 6 percent in seven separate moves.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the language used to explain the shift to neutral
after the Fed's previous quarter-point rate increase, in March
1997, makes clear that the neutral bias referred only to the next
few weeks, until the committee is scheduled to meet again. ``While
additional policy tightening might be needed at some point, it did
not appear very likely that developments during the inter-meeting
period would require a further policy move,'' the minutes of the
committee meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the minutes, members who argued for a bias toward
higher rates said they could accept the neutral stance as long as
there was ``careful monitoring of new developments for any signs of
the need for prompt action.'' In other words, nothing was ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
   An echo of that emphasis on vigilance appeared in last week's
announcement, in which policy makers said they must ``be especially
alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the question of why the Fed spoke up about its
shift to neutral, knowing that investors would put the most
positive spin possible on the news.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that the Fed was locked in by its new
disclosure policy. In the past, such a change in stance was not
divulged until after the subsequent policy-making meeting, about
six weeks later. But beginning this year, the Fed has announced
changes in its leanings on interest rates immediately when the
moves were considered significant.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Fed may be trying to slow the economy with as little
disruption as possible. Greenspan said last month that he was not
aiming to prick any stock market bubble. He also said it is not the
Fed's practice to plan a series of interest-rate increases in
advance. Both goals were advanced by the return to a neutral stance
on the rate outlook.

FOR THE SUMMER, FLOWERS TO MATCH THE OCEAN AND THE SKY

   To some people, the phrase ``American blues'' conjures up images
of smoky nightclubs and B.B. King wailing away. To me, it brings to
mind a stunning array of native perennials. These flowers look
effortlessly beautiful in their natural habitats across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Their siren songs start in early-spring shade settings, where
the striking sky-blue flowers of Virginia bluebells and the soft
blue blossoms of American Jacob's ladder open. In late April,
fragrant swaths of blue woodland phlox sashay through my borders.
With their similar heights of one to two feet, the three are lovely
companions.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Amsonia flowers create a melody of blues in sunny to
bright shade areas. I have three kinds _ A. hubrectii, A. montana
and A. tabernaemontana. While their heights vary from one to four
feet, all feature two- to three-inch bouquets of tightly clustered
light blue flowers at the tops of their stems.
</P>
<P>
   Two more native blues, each with a hint of violet in their
color, tune up in summer borders situated in sunny to partly shaded
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Stokesias are two-foot-tall plants covered with two-inch wide,
asterlike flowers from late June into early September. Big lobelias
feature spires shooting up three to four feet, which are clustered
with half-inch flowers in August.
</P>
<P>
   All these reliable performers are available in garden centers or
mail order catalogs. There are four more, however, that are equally
handsome and carefree but little known.
</P>
<P>
   With their beguiling color tones, they are striking in summer
and fall borders.
</P>
<P>
   The first to bloom features sprays of royal blue flowers from
early summer through light frost. It has an unattractive popular
name, and perhaps this has contributed to its obscurity. Who wants
to brag about having HOARY SKULLCAP (Scutellaria incana) in their
garden? Yet, it is a member of the mint family, which loosely
translates into its being unappetizing to most munching animals. It
is native to dry, open woods and does well in full sun to bright
shade.
</P>
<P>
   Growing from two to three feet tall, hoary skullcap looks like a
cross between two other mint family members, with its foliage size
and shape similar to that of bee balms and its
three-quarter-inch-long flowers akin to those of salvias. Unlike
bee balms, however, hoary skullcaps are neither invasive nor prone
to mildew.
</P>
<P>
   The warmer the growing area, the earlier the bloom period for
AMERICAN ALPINE SPEEDWELL (Veronica wormskjoldii). In North
Carolina, for example, it usually flowers by the Fourth of July. In
my central New Jersey gardens, its rich blue six-to-eight-inch
spikes bloom for a four-week period starting in late July, a
refreshing sight in the humid heat.
</P>
<P>
   In bare spaces, unstaked plants look like contortionists: the
12-to-15-inch stems are not sturdy enough to bear the weight of the
flowers, which insist on remaining upright. Interspersing American
alpine speedwell among other sun-loving perennials will hide this
convoluted appearance. In my garden, its spikes, called racemes,
pop up among pale yellow Moonbeam coreopsis and blazing orange
butterfly weed, creating a colorful showcase.
</P>
<P>
   Botanists just can't seem to agree on what Latin nomenclature to
use for BLUE SAGE , a salvia with brilliant sky-blue flowers from
late August until frost. While all its botanical names start with
salvia, various books and catalogs list one or more of the
following as second or even third names: azurea, grandiflora or
pitcherii. Any of those names will steer you to a stunning blue
beauty that looks particularly handsome in full sun settings.
</P>
<P>
   One reference book says this plant forms arching fountains, a
graceful way of explaining that it, too, flops if not staked.
Unlike American alpine speedwell, which bends in almost a
right-angle formation, the thin three-to-five-foot stems of blue
sage tend to curve out before touching solid ground. I prop them up
by interspersing them with other late-season perennials like golden
Maryland aster and cerise-pink Alma Poetschke aster. This salvia's
stems and intensely blue one-inch flowers are so light that they
appear to float atop the other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the cool tones found in the other little-known blues, the
flowers of BOTTLE GENTIAN (Gentiana andrewsii) are a warm
robin's-egg blue. They are extremely unusual in that they never
open, and for this reason are also known as closed gentian. They
have the shape of a one-to-two-inch football.
</P>
<P>
   Everything I've read about this plant, which grows one to two
feet tall, says it is supposed to be grown in moist soils. But I
wasn't paying attention when I placed it in a rather dry sunny
border. That setting hasn't bothered it one bit in the seven years
I've grown it. I suspect that the foliage of surrounding
perennials, which provide protection from the sun's drying rays,
has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Though frost lays low most flowers by mid-October, it seems to
bring bottle gentian to life. Its clusters of chubby blossoms, the
color of late-day summer skies, irradiate increasingly bare
surroundings for almost a month.
</P>
<P>
   And the melody lingers even after the blue color fades. Thin,
tan flower husks remain as a sculpture before snows banish the last
remnant of American blues and close down the garden show for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hoary skullcap is available from the Primrose Path, R.D. 2, Box
110, Scottdale, Pa. 15683; (724) 887-6756; catalog, $2.

AIR FORCE FALL SHORT OF RECRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For the first time since Jimmy Carter was
president, the Air Force won't find enough recruits to fill its
enlisted ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force says it will fall 2,500 recruits short of its goal
in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, something that hasn't happened
since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, said readiness could be
jeopardized if the shortages aren't reversed, and he suggested that
Congress might have to take a fresh look at a draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a good possibility that if this trend continues,
we're going to very seriously look at the draft, at reviving the
draft again,'' said Ortiz, a member of a House Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The service has been in a prolonged recruiting slump and fell
2,578 recruits short of its year-end target of 33,800 personnel in
May, the San Antonio-based Air Force Recruiting Service said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has blamed the strong economy for the shortfall,
which has hammered the Army as well. The Army was shy of its
recruiting goal by 7,639 soldiers as May ended. The Navy and Marine
Corps exceeded their quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a booming economy, which we are grateful to see, but
it does mean that we have the lowest unemployment in about 30 years
and fierce competition for talented young people,'' said Lt. Col.
Tom Begines, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of opportunities in today's job market,''
Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters said. ``Competition is
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz and Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, see a continued
recruiting slump as a threat to readiness. Rodriguez, also a member
of the Armed Services Committee, predicted more reservists would
have to be called to active duty.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force met its recruiting goal last year by accelerating
the introduction of enlistees in the delayed-entry program, said
Sgt. John Hancock, a spokesman with the Air Force Recruiting
Service.
</P>
<P>
   This year the service began a first-ever paid television ad
campaign. The 18-month, $54 million broadcast campaign will run
through September 2000. A series of 30-second spots will air in
large media markets starting July 12.
</P>
<P>
   To slow the exit of service members, the Air Force has limited
the amount of time anyone can be deployed overseas to 120 days. It
also has dangled cash incentives to keep men and women in uniform,
offering re-enlistment bonuses in a wide number of job specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he wants the Air Force to sign up more Hispanics
with high school equivalency degrees, or GEDs. The service allows
only 1 percent of its recruits to hold GEDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people with GEDs are sharper than the ones who
graduated from high school,'' said Rodriguez, who dropped out in
the ninth grade but later graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said the Air Force's problem is rooted less in
recruiting than retention woes. He said Air Force recruiters are
doing as well as they did last year but can't keep up with the loss
of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force so far this year, however, has met its monthly
recruiting goals just twice, in October and June.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said the service wouldn't give up. ``You're not going to
see a white flag from us,'' he said.

PROBE FINDS SECURITY BREAKDOWNS AT LIVERMORE LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Months after allegations of Chinese espionage at
America's nuclear laboratories, foreign scientists without security
clearances continued to have access to the main computer at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, according to an Energy
Department investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation's findings, parts of which were released
Friday, also said that Livermore scientists may have mistakenly
placed classified nuclear information on that computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown in security at the lab in Livermore, Calif., was
uncovered by an investigative team from the new office of security
oversight set up by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in response to
allegations of Chinese spying at Livermore and at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The DOE team discovered the lax security in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Along with discovering weaknesses in computer security, the
investigation also found the lab failed to properly protect nuclear
materials and inadequately responded to physical attacks on the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The team's findings were presented Thursday night in a
classified briefing to members of the House Commerce Committee,
which plans to conduct its own review of the nation's nuclear
weapons research complex.
</P>
<P>
   The special DOE audit found that foreign scientists working with
the lab but based abroad could dial-up the Livermore computer
system even though they lacked security clearances, according to
Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley said the department also found that:
</P>
<P>
   -- Livermore scientists may have mistakenly placed classified
nuclear information on that computer system.
</P>
<P>
   -- The department had failed to adequately monitor e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   -- The lab's security forces did not have an adequate plan to
counter potential attacks by terrorists. Reaction time was slow and
not all ``pathways'' for potential access were adequately covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people should know that their nuclear secrets are
not yet safe and secure,'' Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation raised ``serious doubts'' about the
quality of day-to-day management and oversight of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Energy Department owns the Livermore facility, the
University of California manages it under contract to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not take an inspection by the Energy Department's
independent oversight office to find some of these serious security
problems,'' Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley and other key Republicans have expressed skepticism that
Richardson can solve the department's counterintelligence and
security problems without the creation of a semiautonomous agency
within the Energy Department to oversee all aspects of its nuclear
program. Richardson has strongly resisted such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about security at nuclear weapons facilities arose in
March as details from a congressional investigation began to
surface describing the loss of nuclear secrets to China in the
1980s and into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy intensified after Richardson directed the firing
of a scientist at the Los Alamos lab in early March after he had
been under investigation for possible espionage since 1996. The
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged with any crime and has
denied giving nuclear secrets to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's security review at Livermore was
conducted by inspectors from the new Office of Security Oversight.
Similar inspections will be made at the Los Alamos and Sandia labs
in New Mexico in the coming weeks, department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to conducting top-secret nuclear weapons research,
the Livermore lab also has nuclear weapons material on site.

SAN FRANCISCO TREATS: TADICH GRILL, AQUA NEAR EACH OTHER, BUT
WORLDS APART 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Monday, July 5) 
 
By DAI HUYNH  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's the hook: Both restaurants dish up
seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Now the catch: The Tadich Grill turned 150 this year; neighbor
Aqua, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the moody fog, the old meets the new in the 200 block of
California Street in San Francisco's Financial District. But more
than years separate two of the biggest fishes in this West Coast
dining pond. Although located only a few doors from each other, the
popular restaurants are miles apart in style and attitude. Think
Ralph Lauren vs. Sears or Daddy Warbucks vs. Homer Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fancy,'' admits Bob Buich, whose family has owned
the Tadich Grill since 1933. ``But we're fast. The service is good,
but it can be abrupt at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1849 by three Croatian immigrants, San Francisco's
oldest restaurant attracts locals and tourists alike. An unknowing
visitor might construe the waiters, dressed like stern doctors in
starched white overcoats, as downright rude.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's because people are waiting to get in,'' Buich
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Regulars know this. ``They're efficient,'' businessman Charles
Morton says. ``Their brusqueness stems from necessity, not by
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tadich Grill doesn't take reservations, and during the lunch
rush, the wait may range from 15 to 30 minutes. Most customers work
nearby in the bustling Financial District, and the experienced
waiters know these people have little time to kill. Hence the rush
to place the orders. Diners, however, can take their sweet time
chowing down on the pan-fried petrale sole fillet, deviled crab or
poached salmon with chopped egg sauce. But most are in and out in
half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Aqua, the wait can run 45 to 90 minutes without a
reservation. But time is less important here. Patrons compare
dining at this upscale seafood mecca to the restaurants in France
and Italy, where meals can last two hours or more. The plush,
silk-upholstered chairs were fashioned for long-term comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked three days in the design of the chairs so you can
really feel comfortable if you want to sit for three or four
hours,'' says Charles Condy, who co-owns the restaurant with
executive chef Michael Mina.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wait staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``They really pamper you here. They would wash your feet if you
asked them,'' a regular customer says as she leans over to smell
the elaborate flower arrangement in the ladies room.
</P>
<P>
   That smooth service comes with a price tag that leaves many
wallets feeling lighter. Lunch can run $40 and dinner $80 per
person, and this may not include a glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the most expensive restaurant in town,'' Condy
insists, ``but in order to do everything we do, there's a cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Aqua has 110 employees, including a human resources director,
rarely found in the restaurant industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a labor force that reflects the care in the
preparation of the food. For instance, you'll never get a lobster
or a shrimp in a shell,'' Condy says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are patrons likely to find any tartar sauce on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do that type of dishes,'' says 31-year-old Mina, who
received the Rising Star Chef Award from the James Beard Foundation
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   From the modest-sized kitchen emerge dishes with fusion flair,
such as flawlessly wrapped Japanese gift packages of ahi tuna,
smoked salmon, Chilean sea bass and dungeness crab. The
restaurant's signature appetizer is the $55 Caviar Parfait. The
3-inch-tall creation layers a light, spicy potato cake; chopped
eggs and onion; in-house-smoked salmon; lemony crme frache; and
Russian osetra caviar.
</P>
<P>
   For a main course, there are the Medallions of Rare Ahi Tuna,
surrounded by an intensely rich pinot noir sauce and served with
seared Hudson Valley foie gras. By the way, foie gras rules here,
making appearances on many of the dishes. Not to your liking? Then
opt for the Pecan-Crusted Loin of Hawaiian Swordfish, framed by
pancetta-wrapped shrimp dumplings and sweet corn pudding. Of
course, there's always the crowd-pleasing Lobster Pot Pie for $49
to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dishes are complex,'' Mina admits. ``My whole theory
behind cooking is balancing all the ingredients. So, if you're
going to use heat, then you must also use acidity and sweetness to
balance it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Aqua's neighbor has a less complicated view on seafood.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tadich Grill, patrons can have charcoal-broiled or
pan-fried rex sole, petrale sole, Pacific red snapper, rainbow
trout, halibut, salmon or swordfish. They're all reasonably priced
with few frills or thrills. You won't find truffle-infused oils at
this old-fashioned restaurant. Just the fish, a light butter sauce,
Long Branch potatoes and ... tartar sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Many old favorites from the Gold Rush days can be found here.
There's cioppino, a popular San Francisco stew similar to
bouillabaisse made with clams, shrimp, scallops and white fish in a
slightly spicy tomato broth. And then there's the notorious
Hangtown Fry, the scrambled eggs, bacon and oysters frittata named
in memory of the outlaws who requested it as their last meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would pick the hardest things to find to delay the
hanging, and eggs and oysters were very hard to come by in those
days,'' Buich says.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, Jack McGinity has eaten at the Tadich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here Monday through Saturday. They're closed Sunday,''
says the 70-year-old native San Franciscan. ``It's a guy's place. A
gal's place is next door at Aqua, where it's modern and sleek. Gals
go there, talk all day and sip their wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking around, it's easy to see why the Tadich was once
considered a stomping ground for the fellows. It hasn't changed
much over the years _ lots of suits sitting along the long bar that
doubles as a lunch counter. White-clothed tables line the walls,
and paneled booths offer privacy for the countless political,
financial and movie deals struck over the decades at this clubby
establishment. It's old San Francisco: feisty, boisterous and
in-your-face.
</P>
<P>
   Like many legendary restaurants, the Tadich has attracted
politicians, such as George Bush, Ted Kennedy and current San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown; financiers; and movie stars,
including Cary Grant, Danny Kaye, Bing Crosby and Doris Day.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua has served its share of luminaries, including the Rolling
Stones, Bill Gates and Ralph Lauren. But the real stars are the
oversized flower-filled urns casting shadows on the bare mocha
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to overdecorate a joint,'' Condy says. ``In the
beginning, we decided that there wasn't going to be lot of artwork
here because we were going to let our guests decorate the
restaurant, and they do. We have a really good-looking clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no dress code, Aqua's patrons easily could have
walked off the pages of GQ or Vogue. But this isn't the Helmut Lang
or Dolce &AMP; Gabbana crowd; it's Ralph Lauren's traditional chic and
Donna Karan's all-American.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Tadich, clothes are a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we don't talk about that here,'' says San Francisco
native Treut Sperry, 76. ``Now, if you want to talk about the old
days, I can tell you anything. I was here during the strike of
1944. I remember the feud between the Lees and the Wongs in
Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Susie! Where have you been?''
</P>
<P>
   Just think of ``Cheers,'' and you'll get the idea.

HERE'S WHY TO HAVE EUDORA LOVE AFFAIR  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any techno-pundit to name the ``killer app'' for the
Internet, and you're likely to get one of two answers _ e-mail or
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   You can put me in the first camp. While e-mail may not be as
sexy as the Web, it's the most-used _ and the most useful _
application. For most folks, it's the one thing that makes them
understand the importance of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic mail is responsible for bringing distant families
together, speeding negotiations, even running whole businesses. It
has completely changed our expectations of how quickly people
communicate with each other. The U.S. Postal Service earned the
derisive nickname of ``snail mail'' because e-mail is just so
darned fast.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular e-mail programs is Eudora. One of the
first e-mail programs available for Macintosh and then Windows
Internet users, it was initially free. Qualcomm, best known for
communications equipment and cellular phones, develops it, and it's
definitely a sideline.
</P>
<P>
   While there's still a free version, known as Eudora Lite, it's
the commercial version, Eudora Pro, that is the star.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OTHERS PALE TO EUDORA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been a serious Eudora user since I first got on the
Internet in 1992. I've tried every other e-mail application that's
come along since, including Netscape's Messenger; Microsoft's
Exchange, Outlook Express and Outlook; America Online's e-mail
component; even Pegasus, the other top free mail software program.
None of them comes close.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of Eudora Pro, 4.2, is the best yet. It's an
update to the version you're most apt to find on store shelves,
which is 4.1, for about $39. But its new features are so compelling
and so well done that this is more than just a minor upgrade. It
puts Eudora Pro in a class by itself.
</P>
<P>
   However, let me add a caveat. I would not recommend Eudora Pro
4.2 for everyone. It has a fairly complex set of features, and the
interface can seem cluttered to some. If you like your e-mail
software simple, you probably don't need this.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a relatively sophisticated e-mail user _ perhaps
one who is overwhelmed by e-mail volume, or who has multiple e-mail
accounts _ then Eudora Pro can make life much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it does all the things you'd expect a modern-day
e-mail program to do _ displays HTML-based and Rich Text Format
e-mail messages; includes a comprehensive address book; works with
either POP3 or IMAP e-mail servers; includes a spell-checker; and
will launch a browser when you click on a Web address in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EUDORA COMPLETES THOUGHTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the new features in 4.2 is auto-complete, which will
attempt to finish an e-mail address as you type it. It gets this
information from recently entered e-mail addresses. If Eudora
thinks the address being entered is similar to several different
ones, it offers a drop-down box list to let you choose.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic spell-checking also has been added. As you type,
misspelled words are underlined in red. If you want to add special
words _ such as names or unusual spellings _ to the dictionary,
Windows users can right-click and choose Add from the menu that
appears. (Macintosh users would click-and-hold with their
inadequate, one-button mice!)
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm also has beefed up the search functions in Eudora Pro.
You can now perform complex searches using Boolean terms, a type of
standard search language. If you use your e-mail folders like I do
_ as a kind of database for information you've received from others
_ this feature makes it much easier to find that needle in the
haystack.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora has always had one of the best systems for filtering
e-mail into folders as it comes into your system. This can be used
to pre-organize information or to banish junk e-mail. But fans of
filters know there's a problem _ sometimes you forget to look in
those folders to see what's new.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro 4.2 solves this with a unique solution that turns
text into speech. You can turn on a feature that will let the
computer read aloud the subject lines of e-mail being filtered into
specific folders. This can get annoying if you turn this on for a
folder that receives a lot of mail _ if you filter spam, you
wouldn't put this on your trash folder, for example _ so it's best
used for mail that's very important.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro also is the best e-mail software for managing
multiple accounts. Using a drop-down box available in the From:
field in the composition window, you can change the identity of the
sender. For example, you can pull in an e-mail from an account at
work and answer it via a personal account.
</P>
<P>
   If you already own Eudora Pro 4.0 or later for Windows or
Macintosh, you can upgrade for free to 4.2 by downloading an
updater at www.eudora.com. There's also a demo version of Eudora
Pro 4.1 at that same address, if you want to check out the look and
feel of the program.

MANAGING INJURIES KEEPS DOWN COSTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few years ago, companies got concerned about their
rising workers' compensation costs and launched aggressive
campaigns to get their employees back to work.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, which include assigning light-duty work and
continually monitoring injured workers, have allowed companies to
cut their workers' compensation expenses by 30 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But many companies don't use that same careful medical
management when employees suffer a non-job-related injury or
illness, such as an arm broken on a skiing holiday or chronic heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Those employees fall through the cracks, said Jerry Boyer,
president of the Precertification Center in Camp Hill, Pa., who was
trying to sell his nonoccupational management services at the
recent conference of the Society for Human Resource Management in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses and co-workers start to forget about them if they're off
for a long time, said Boyer, who set up a booth to lure human
resource managers to listen to what is becoming one of the hottest
topics in benefit management. Boyer calls it the ``bathrobe
syndrome'' _ the result of a recovering employee languishing at
home alone during the day.
</P>
<P>
   To combat it, Boyer said, his firm immediately contacts the
doctor who is treating an employee after an injury or illness is
reported and discusses how long the employee should be off from
work. That way, instead of just accepting an eight-week recovery,
the Precertification Center nurse can ask the doctor to initially
approve just two weeks and later re-evaluate the employee's medical
progress.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BRINGING EMPLOYEES BACK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more time that goes on, the less likely the employee will
return to work, said Richard Pimentel, senior vice president of
Milt Wright &AMP; Associates, an organizational design consulting firm
based in Chatsworth, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   An employee who has been off for three months is 75 percent
likely to return to work. That falls to 50 percent after six
months. After a year, the chance an employee will return to work
falls to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pimentel, who designs return-to-work programs from his office in
Las Vegas, said it's becoming critical for employers to design such
a program because aging baby boomers are needing more medical care.
In this tight labor market, employers can't afford to lose them.
</P>
<P>
   But few employers have taken that step. When Pimentel asked the
300 human resource managers who attended his presentation on
retention strategies how many actively manage the return of their
employees who are out on workers' compensation, most of the hands
shot up. But only a few _ four or five _ popped up when he asked
about active management of nonoccupational injuries.
</P>
<P>
   David H. Miller, an internist with an office in the Texas
Medical Center in Houston, has had plenty of experience dealing
with employers on workers' compensation cases. There are several
forms to fill out regarding acceptable light duty, expected return
to work and expected time of full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But an off-the-job injury? Miller said he can't remember an
employer calling to suggest light-duty work or asking to speed the
employee's return.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KEEPING IN CLOSE TOUCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgestone/Firestone Warren Plant in Morrison, Tenn., is
rare among companies in the way it handles such injuries. A company
representative calls every employee who is off with an injury or
illness, whether or not it's work-related, to let them know the
plant is concerned, said Fran R. Jones, organizational development
consultant. Each absent worker is also carefully tracked: Each
week, the health services and benefits coordinator meet to update
the status of each employee who is out on injury or illness.
</P>
<P>
   And all employees are eligible for restricted duty because the
plant wants people back to work, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   It's extremely shortsighted for companies to offer light-duty
work exclusively to employees who have been injured on the job,
Pimentel said, referring to the case of the pregnant Continental
Airlines ticket agent whose doctor said she couldn't lift more than
20 pounds. The Houston ticket agent asked the airline for a
temporary job change but Continental refused.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry doesn't have many light-duty positions
available and at Continental Airlines, the airline reserves the few
it has to those who have been injured in the line of duty, said
Continental spokeswoman Julie Gardner.

SLOW UPDATES ON NOTEBOOK MAY MEAN YOU BOUGHT A `PASSIVE-MATRIX'
DISPLAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a notebook computer _ a Toshiba Satellite
4525 CDS. I am not happy with the way the screen updates.
Everything is very slow. Also, whenever the system has been idle
for a while, a Toshiba ad comes up as a screen saver. What can I do
to speed things up?
</P>
<P>
   A: In general, the displays on most notebook computers _ and
particularly ``value'' models, such as that one _ are not going to
be as peppy as those on desktops. Some displays are faster than
others, however.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say whether the notebook you bought has an
active-matrix or passive-matrix (sometimes called a dual-scan)
display. However, from your description, I suspect it's
passive-matrix, and that may be your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Passive-matrix displays are, by nature, quite slow and are not
as bright as active-matrix screens. For example, if you try to play
a fast-paced game on a passive-matrix system, you'll see a lot of
ghosting and blurry images as the screen tries to keep up. With a
quality active-matrix display, the screen is virtually as speedy as
a traditional desktop monitor.
</P>
<P>
   With an active-matrix screen, each pixel on the display has its
own transistor controlling it. On a passive-matrix screen, one
transistor may control many pixels. Thus, the graphics are not as
nimble. I generally recommend that users avoid passive-matrix
portables _ though they are likely to be much less expensive. The
active-matrix version of the 2545 is $500 more than the
passive-matrix model, according to Toshiba's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you have the active-matrix model, you can try
turning off all the background programs _ virus checkers, etc._ and
reduce the number of colors in the display to 256. (Right-click on
the open desktop, choose Properties, then Settings. Click the
colors drop-down box to change it to 256.) While this won't look as
good as having high or true color, it will speed up your display.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I boot my PC up, at the end I get the following message:
CSUSEM32 has performed an illegal task. I then click OK and nothing
seems different about my computer. What is CSUSEM32?
</P>
<P>
   A: This file is part of CleanSweep, the utility from Symantec
(previously from Quarterdeck) that lets you remove programs and
clutter from your hard drive. The file is part of a component
called the Usage Monitor that tracks to see how often you use
programs. It uses the information to recommend seldom-used programs
you might be able to remove from your drive to gain space.
</P>
<P>
   It runs in the background (along with another component of
CleanSweep that watches for software installations), and if you
read these pages regularly, you know how I feel about background
programs _ they are more trouble than they are worth. My
recommendation would be to turn this off. There should be a setting
to do so in CleanSweep's preferences. Or, if it places an icon in
the Startup folder, remove it from there.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can usually determine what program a component
like this belongs to by doing a search for it with the Windows Find
feature (right-click on the drive in My Computer, choose Find). The
folder that holds it should give you a clue as to the parent
program.

HUNTING THE BETTER MORTGAGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, N.Y.)   (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abby Rodgers is not one to haggle. She buys cars at list. In
early April, in need of a mortgage, she turned to a large lender,
accepted tentative terms just under 7 percent, with no points, and
went away happy.
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks ago, when she went to lock in her rate, she was
told that the interest rate had gone up by more than a point, to 8
percent, adding $350 to her monthly payment, plus the lender was
charging one point (an upfront fee of 1 percent on the loan
amount). She decided to shop around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 24 hours, I was finding things in the low sevens,''
said Ms. Rodgers, a marketing director with the Coca-Cola Co. in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, mortgage rates _ which held steady at
about 7 percent over the winter _ have lurched up by three-quarters
of a percentage point, to their highest level in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage market, like the bond market, was ahead of the
Federal Reserve, which, in a long-anticipated move, increased the
overnight lending rate on Tuesday by a quarter of a percentage
point, to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates have yet to affect home sales, but they have
crushed the refinancing market and made it a wary time for buyers
in general. ``We've definitely been putting out fires,'' said Seth
Cohen, managing director of the Home Mortgage Acceptance Corp., a
Manhattan lender.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a little work, caution and creativity, home shoppers
may be able to trim their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodgers found her lower rate through www.bankrate.com, a Web
site that tracks loan rates. She and her husband, Andrew Pickens, a
lawyer with Gibbs &AMP; Bruns in Houston, gave their initial lender an
opportunity to match the better rate, but it declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At 7.25 percent, with 1.125 points, her new mortgage is still a
good deal when compared with average rates over the last decade.
Since 1990, the average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has been
8.27 percent, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher in
Butler, N.J., that tracks the market. The average since 1995 has
been lower, at 7.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For most consumers, the monthly payment is the bottom line. On
each $100,000 of a loan, the difference between 7.25 and 8 percent
means a payment increase of about $50.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find fixed rates too costly, or who need a lower
initial rate to qualify for a given house, an array of
adjustable-rate mortgages are available, including hybrids with
initial rates, often still under 7 percent, that can be adjusted
after 3, 5, 7 or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   With its low initial rates, an adjustable-rate mortgage can save
money for a buyer who does not plan to live in a house for a long
time. But a consumer should be careful to calculate whether the
savings would cover refinancing, should that be necessary down the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, the rate difference between 30-year fixed
mortgages and five-year adjustables had been about half a
percentage point, but the margin has widened.
</P>
<P>
   According to HSH, the average interest rate for a 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgage hit a 1999 peak during the week ended June 18,
at 7.78 percent, plus nearly one point. The average was 6.99
percent for a five-year adjustable-rate loan and 6.09 percent for a
one-year adjustable, both with less than a point.
</P>
<P>
   On a $200,000 loan, the difference between the monthly payments
on a 30-year fixed and a five-year adjustable would be about $109.
(The 30-year would be $1,436 a month for principal and interest;
the adjustable would have initial payments of $1,327.)
</P>
<P>
   A typical adjustable can go up or down two points at a time,
with a lifetime cap of six percentage points. But Keith T.
Gumbinger, an HSH vice president, cautioned consumers to check the
fine print, because many longer-term adjustables allow an initial
change of up to five points. Changes are typically tied to the
rates on Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers with extra cash can also cut their interest rates by
paying additional points. Each point will bring the rate down by an
eighth to a quarter of a percentage point, HSH said.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to make a bigger down payment or to
consider a ``floatdown'' option: For a fee, typically an eighth to
a quarter of a point, a consumer's rate can be adjusted downward if
prevailing rates fall during a given initial period.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers using the Internet should keep in mind that what is
advertised might not be what is available when they call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the Net as a tool,'' Gumbinger said, ``but don't neglect
looking in your local marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   HSH and other mortgage experts predict that rates will ease as
the year progresses, but they say there is still much uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbinger sees some similarities with the situation in early
1994, when rates were hovering around 7 percent before the Federal
Reserve pushed them higher. By midyear, a 30-year mortgage was at
about 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people got caught,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sees some differences now, both in consumers and the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly greater awareness of alternative
products,'' Gumbinger said. ``Consumer confidence is higher, and
there is less fear of higher interest rates.''

 &HT;    PORTIONS OF ATLANTIC AND GULF MAY BE CLOSED TO LONG-LINE FISHING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to protect migratory species such as
swordfish, shark and tuna, portions of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf
of Mexico may be closed to commercial and recreational long-line
fishermen by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   How long they would be closed could vary from a month in some
places to 10 years in others. The size of the areas and length of
time for each closure will depend on how much the government wants
to reduce the excess harvesting of young fish.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been caused by American and foreign fishermen
who use lines baited with as many as 3,000 hooks that can reach up
to 30 miles and are dragged behind vessels for 12 to 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, an average of 35,000 juvenile swordfish per year are
caught and released dead. That's 30 percent of the total catch,
according to the National Coalition For Marine Conservation, an
independent conservation group. Swordfish are the most common
victims of the ``bycatch'' _ fish that are undersized, underage or
illegally caught.
</P>
<P>
   The only continuous zone being considered for closure by the
National Marine Fisheries Service would extend from Charleston,
S.C., through the Florida Keys. In addition, parts of the Gulf of
Mexico from the Florida Panhandle to Louisiana might be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lent, chief of fisheries service's division for
management of highly migratory species, said she hoped a final
determination of what areas will be closed will be made by the end
of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the fisheries service, a part of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, considered closing
an area of the Florida Straits to reduce swordfish bycatch, but
Lent said the proposed area was too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order make it effective, we're going to have to go for a
larger area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hinman, president of a marine conservation coalition that
has been pushing for extensive closures, said long-line fishing may
have to be banned for a long time in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to reduce the bycatch by 50 percent, then that
area might have to be closed for 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fisheries service has been revising the plan for closures
since it began public hearings last October.
</P>
<P>
   A 21,000-square-mile area off the coast of New Jersey was closed
for the entire month of June in order to protect undersized bluefin
tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, long-line fishermen are working on a proposal to get
the federal government to buy them out.
</P>
<P>
   Since last November, the Blue Water Fisherman's Association,
which represents Atlantic long-line fishermen, has been working
with Sen. John Breaux, D-La., on a $15 million voluntary government
buyout of between 47 to 60 commercial vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Although no legislation has been introduced, Breaux said in a
statement, ``I have strongly encouraged the commercial and
recreational fishing groups to work together to find a common,
scientifically justified solution to reducing the bycatch of
juvenile swordfish and billfish in these fisheries while
recognizing very important economic issues for the fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. commercial fishermen argue that they are being
penalized for overharvesting by other countries. If U.S. waters are
going to be closed, they say, it's only fair for the government to
buy them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are offering voluntary buyouts for these boats,'' said
Nelson Beideman, executive director of the fishermen's association.
``This is long-term. We need to get this in the national arena so
it could eventually impact international fishermen who are
over-harvesting and catching these bycatch species.''
</P>
<P>
   Beideman said the ``bad players'' in long-lining are other
countries _ particularly Taiwan and Spain _ that haven't adhered to
quotas set up by the International Commission for Atlantic Tunas, a
25-member council that meets once a year and allocates specific
catch limits to each country.
</P>
<P>
   Hinman, of the conservation coalition, said he wants to see the
conservation plan implemented before buyouts are authorized.

`FIELD OF DREAMS' ENABLES ABCD TO GRANT SOME WISHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects phone number in last graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow keeps floating way above 10,000. It's hard to get a
dinner reservation at your favorite chic South End restaurant. And
isn't it time to think about trading in that '97 sedan you're
driving for a gadget-laden SUV?
</P>
<P>
   These are not concerns for the clients of Action For Boston
Community Development, otherwise known as ABCD. The economy is
chugging away at a record rate, but a few people have been left
back at the station. They are honest and hard-working, but for one
reason or another no one has punched their ticket. And that's where
ABCD, America's oldest-running anti-poverty organization, has been
stepping in for more than three decades. From Head Start to Fuel
Assistance, to Elderly Assistance, to dozens of valuable programs,
ABCD tries to be there for forgotten Americans of all races.
</P>
<P>
   With government funding not as reliable as it once was, ABCD
needs fresh sources of income to service its constituency. The
group found one last year. It was entitled ``Field of Dreams,'' and
it was a huge success in every way. Thanks to the extraordinary
generosity of Red Sox CEO John Harrington, a long-time ABCD
supporter, Fenway Park was made available. A dozen corporations
brought teams to play in a round-robin softball tournament. It is a
very safe statement to say that a good time was had by all, so much
so that most of the people who put teams out there last year are
looking forward to Aug. 6, when ``Field of Dreams II'' will take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a blast,'' says David Newton, who played first base for
Prudential Securities. Newton, an industrial bond salesman, put his
team together by securing interested people from his best clients.
``My only problem was that we got beat early,'' he says. ``This
year we're coming back with a stronger team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, competition. This supposedly benign affair does bring out
the Ty Cobb in the investment people, doctors, lawyers, and even
professional athletes (e.g. the Colorado Avalanche's Chris Drury,
who played for Preferred Temps) who will come together at Updike's
``lyric little bandbox of a ballpark'' five weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' says Newton. ``We had guys sliding headfirst
into home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Just being on the field where Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Yaz, and
Nomar have roamed brings out the little boy in just about
everybody. ``We had the feeling Fenway Park was ours,'' points out
Dr. George Thibault, the vice president of Clinical Affairs for
Partners Health Care, who proudly wore a number 6 last year in
honor of Stan Musial. ``It's a shrine to many of us who once
aspired to be ballplayers.'' This year's Partners team will be
co-captained by Dr. Denny Ausiello, the chief of medicine at
Massachusetts General Hospital, who caught for Harvard; and Dr. Pat
O'Gara, the director of clinical cardiology at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, who co-captained the Yale nine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thibault's team played in the first game last year shortly
after 8 a.m. ``It was a magical moment,'' he reports. ``It's one
thing to see the ballpark at night, but another to see it early in
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A major event like this doesn't just happen. Start with the Red
Sox, of course. Then factor in the superb organizational skill of
the Massachusetts Sports Partnership and the tireless efforts of
Becky Collet, the manager of sports marketing at John Hancock. This
year's tri-chairmen are Lou Eisenberg of Cosgrove, Eisenberg and
Kiley; Fred Bertino of Hill, Holliday; and the ubiquitous John
Sasso of Advance Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to give the players and corporations more bang for
their playing buck, the format has been altered this year. Rather
than a round-robin tournament, each team will play one six-inning
game, which will result in everyone getting a couple of at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Twins Enterprises will donate hats. JUGGS will provide two
softball pitching machines. Franklin will supply the softballs and
batting gloves. Aramark will provide a full menu at the concession
stand behind home plate. MASCO will take care of parking.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox even go so far as to provide a complete Fenway Park
batting experience. As each man comes to the plate, his picture
will be posted on the big screen in center field. How's that for
goose bumps?
</P>
<P>
   ``For my anniversary,'' says Eisenberg, a stalwart ABCD
supporter, ``my wife gave me photos of me at third base, me at the
plate, and my photo up on the board. How about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the depth of someone's baseball interest, the day
can be a spiritual experience. Take, for example, Charlie Orcutt,
president of Preferred Temps. ``You get to warm up in the visiting
bullpen. I was thinking, `This is where Al Luplow made that
phenomenal catch off Dick Williams in '65,' '' he says. It is
almost a given that Orcutt is the single most passionate CEO who
will be fielding a team. He attended Dave Morehead's no-hitter, and
he insists when the game started on that September afternoon there
were no more than 1,700 people in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   There are other revelations in store. ``I learned that the
infield dirt isn't as soft as you might think,'' says Eisenberg.
``It's more like cinder.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes it all work is the fact that the ultimate
beneficiary is ABCD. ``We feel very strongly about ABCD,'' says
John Hancock president David D'Allesandro, whose team will be back
for a second year. ``I'm not saying that universities, for example,
aren't worthy recipients of donations, but endowments are up
everywhere, whereas federal dollars are hard for someone like ABCD
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've never been one who believes in just writing checks,''
D'Allesandro continues. ``That's why the `Field of Dreams' is so
good for us. I feel when you can get employees involved, everyone
benefits. I think the people who play will get a lot more out of it
knowing they are helping a great cause. We at John Hancock have
literally hundreds of people who would like to be stepping on that
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Call 617 357-6000, ext. 238. Meghan Sayce might be able to help
your Fenway-worshipping employees step on that grass.

   Earlier this year, I was driving a car with New York plates in
San Francisco. I stopped for gas at a large self-service station on
one of the city's main streets. As I pulled up, I noticed a couple
of young men, not employed by the station, working as ``windshield
cleaners,'' as often seen on street corners in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Each man was busy wiping windshields, going right to work on
cars as they pulled in. One of them soon walked up to me but
instead of cleaning the windshield, he stood off a few feet in
front of my car. I was prepared to tell him I wasn't interested in
his ``services'' when he said, ``If the car has New York plates, we
always ask first.'' I said, ``No thanks,'' he nodded and said,
``Fine'' and went off to work on cars with California licenses. I
wonder what kind of New Yorker he met that made him decide it was
necessary to ask first!
</P>

   Alene Marx's 5-year-old granddaughter, Isabel Phemayotin,
complained to her mother that her almost 3-year-old sister had
called her ``stupid.'' Her mother explained that her younger sister
had probably heard the word from bigger children and very likely
didn't even know what it meant. ``Do  &UR; you &LR;  know what `stupid'
means?'' her mother asked Isabel. ``Oh yes,'' she replied. ``It
means that you are a really bad driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of years, two doves have made the adjoining
fire escapes of Robert Roth and Karen Ogulnick their breeding
ground. They come back periodically to lay their eggs, sit on their
nest and wait for their babies to hatch. Recently, Mr. Roth and Ms.
Ogulnick saw two men scraping away the rust on the fire escapes and
they also noticed that the nest had been abandoned except for one
egg. When the workers left, one of the birds returned to sit on the
egg. Two days later, when a newborn dove was in the nest, the
workers came back, this time to paint, and one of them mentioned
that the mother dove had been flying back and forth, looking at
them.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the workers returned to put on a second coat of
paint. Mr. Roth and Ms. Ogulnick wondered if the baby dove could
survive all this and looked to see if there was any sign of life in
the nest. They were pleasantly surprised to find that the workers
had improvised a makeshift shelter _ a canopy made of cardboard,
wire and string that was protecting the dove from dripping paint.

   Carl Feinberg went to his health plan's Web site to look for a
participating dermatologist. That evening he told his wife, Toby,
that he had found some dermatologists in Manhattan with interesting
names. Had he found a listing for I.C.A. Rash, she asked in jest.
No, he said, but he did find a Dr. Leonard Bernstein, a Dr. Doris
Day and a Dr. Alan Greenspan.

   Skipp Porteous and his wife, Barbara Simon, were walking along
Ninth Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets one recent Saturday when
they noticed a letter carrier stop in front of a four-story
walk-up. The man honked a bicycle horn attached to his mail caddy
and then entered the building. Curious about the procedure, they
waited for him to emerge. He said his name was Al Gibson, that
elderly people lived in the building and that he always honked the
horn to let them know that their mail had arrived. It saved them
fruitless checking and difficult trips up and down the stairs.

   The young executive on a sidewalk on the Upper East Side was
speaking emphatically into his cell phone. Was it a critical moment
in an important deal? As Hattie Gottlieb Bradlow got closer, she
heard his end of the conversation: ``Listen to me now. You'd better
calm down or you're not going to get any ice cream for a very,
very, long time!''

   My husband and I had tickets to a concert at Carnegie Hall, but
he was unable to go. It was a cold night, and I shivered as I tried
to sell the ticket for the $20 it cost. With no takers, I offered
it to an elderly gentleman standing close to me for $15. He said,
no, too much money. A little later I asked whether he would pay
$10. The answer was still no.
</P>
<P>
   As the starting time drew near, I decided to give the old man
the ticket, went into the concert hall and took my seat. In a short
time, a huge young man sat down next to me. I asked if he would
mind telling me where he got his ticket. ``Not at all,'' he
replied. ``A little old man sold it to me for $20.''

   It was a beautiful, sunny afternoon. There was a light breeze,
and the fountain at Lincoln Center sparkled. Three of us,
concertgoers, were enjoying the weather and the view when we were
approached by a man in jeans, carrying a camcorder. He handed us a
picture and explained that it was of his Aunt Lily and Uncle Tony
and that they were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. He
was photographing people around New York asking them to wish Lily
and Tony ``Happy Anniversary.'' We were happy to accommodate, held
the picture, waved and called ``Happy Anniversary, many more, good
luck, good health.'' The nephew thanked us, packed up his equipment
and went on to get further greetings. We felt we had contributed to
a New York moment and become an integral part of an interactive art
piece.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of potent thunderstorms will erupt across the upper
Middle West Saturday as very humid air surges northward across the
Plains. A system of storms will develop early Saturday across the
eastern Dakotas, southern Minnesota and northern Iowa as a
fast-moving stream of humid air from the south converges over the
region. Heavy rain and severe weather are possible. Rainfall
exceeding two inches is possible and large hail and winds gusting
to 60 miles an hour or more are also possible. Storms will rumble
into the western Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Another cluster of heavy thunderstorms will develop later
Saturday across eastern Montana and the Dakotas. Severe weather is
possible, with tornadoes also posing a limited risk. Storms will
spread to Minnesota and the western Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   A volley of heavy thunderstorms will soak parts of Florida as
upper-level disturbances moving westward over the Atlantic combine
with developing sea-breeze fronts to lift very humid air. Isolated
thunderstorms will accompany the leading edge of the sea breeze
along the Gulf Seaboard from the upper Texas to the western Florida
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clusters of heavy thunderstorms will erupt across
parts of the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians as very warm and
humid air interacts with a weak but efficacious disturbance moving
eastward from the Middle West. The Northeast Seaboard, after the
broken line of thunderstorms moved across the region Friday, will
be relatively rain-free, even though humidity will be moderate to
fairly high.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Rain-maker &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 inches of rain fell at the Coral Springs Aquatic
Complex in southeast Florida during June, the salient monthly total
in the water-logged region of the state. While rain from tropical
systems can enhance summer rains, there would be no definitive
rainy season in Florida without the faithful sea breeze. Because
the sun heats the sea and land unevenly, a sea breeze frequently
develops along Florida's Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. As it moves
inland, the leading edge of the sea breeze lifts steamy air over
land, often sparking thunderstorms that can make the rainy season
very rainy.

YANKEE DOODLE DANDIES: BUSH AND GORE NOT REALLY SUCH BORES  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Commentary Editors _ TIMELY for 4th of July)   From The Economist magazine  
 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The flags are out, the barbecues smoking, but this Fourth of
July in America has an odd feel about it. It seems more like Labor
Day 2000, the date next September that will kick off the
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two front-runners, Al Gore for the Democrats and George W.
Bush for the Republicans, are all but nominated and anointed. There
seems almost no point in dragging things on for another 14 months,
through tedious caucuses and primaries and party conventions.
Surely it's all over now.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent inevitability of these two candidates springs,
first, from money. Gore raised $18.5 million in the first half of
this year, scaring off all his rivals except Bill Bradley, a former
senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush raised $35.5 million, a record. And both have netted
almost all the political endorsements that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus armed, they will proceed into primary elections in which
three big, delegate-rich states _ California, New York and New
Jersey _ have moved up their vote to March 7, much earlier than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   If these three plump for the same candidate, the parties'
nominations will be tied up then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets are not impossible, of course. On the Democratic side,
Gore _ for all his attempts to distance himself _ may find he
cannot shake the disreputable shade of Bill Clinton, and may suffer
more than he supposes from Bradley's popularity in the states that
vote on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, where ten rivals are squeaking around
him, George W. may yet be tripped up by his rakish past or by his
father's old ailment, foot-in-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
   For both men, the close embrace of their party establishments
may damage them with voters. But by the same token, it is hard to
imagine _ short of giant scandal _ that either party will now
abandon the candidate on whom it has staked so much.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this turn of events seems depressingly
undemocratic. The political debate has apparently ended before it
has even begun.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Republicans and left-wing Democrats alike are
dismayed, even furious, that the field has been left to two bland
centrists whose mottoes (Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' and
Gore's ``practical idealism'') seem no more than vapid mush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fears are misplaced. Yes, there will probably be two
centrist nominees; but that has very often been the result of the
primary process in recent years. Looking beyond the primaries to
the election itself, the prospects are as tantalizing _ and as
unpredictable _ as they have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   First, the candidates themselves. It is true that both are,
broadly speaking, centrists, but important distinctions are
emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a meddler, whereas Bush believes in keeping government
in check; Bush is an unabashed free-trader, but Gore hedges his
enthusiasm with conditions; Bush has pledged not to raise taxes,
Gore has kept his powder dry.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, these positions mean little to voters lulled
along on the eighth year of an economic boom. And Alan Greenspan's
decision this week to raise interest rates by just a quarter of a
point, never mind that it was the first increase for two and a half
years, will do little to disturb their equanimity: the change had
been widely expected and when it came the markets applauded
politely.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact remains, labor markets are too tight to avoid
wage-pressure indefinitely; and Wall Street remains exuberantly
overextended. These are risks.
</P>
<P>
   By election day, voters may well be asking themselves which
candidate, Bush or Gore, will do less harm to the economy. Looking
further ahead, voters must ask which man can meet the country's
biggest social-policy challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Two of America's costliest entitlement programs, Medicare
(health care for the elderly) and Social Security (pensions), will
go bust within a generation if they are not reformed. Both need
thoroughgoing change, not tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   Such change is made possible by budget surpluses that may be
$500 billion larger than estimated just last February. But it is
not yet clear which candidate would be braver.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is more inclined to keep Medicare and Social Security
solvent by spending budget surpluses on them. Bush may be willing
to privatize Social Security by introducing individual retirement
accounts (as The Economist would like) but he may well succumb
instead to an across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   So this election is wide open and its effects long-lasting; and
not just in respect of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the
Republican majority is so slender that it might well be overturned
_ and popular loathing for the House Republicans means they could
suffer on election day even if Bush triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   If either candidate has coattails that reach right down to state
level, he can influence the party balance in the state legislatures
which, after 2000, will be redrawing the lines of congressional
districts (hence affecting future elections).
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, whoever wins will have the chance to change the color of
the Supreme Court. At present, the court has a very narrow, but
highly active, conservative majority which has been working, most
notably, to change the balance of power between the federal
government and the states.
</P>
<P>
   With two or three retirements likely to come in the next
presidential term, the conservatives could either be strengthened,
under Bush, or, under Gore, consigned to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In all these ways, the election of 2000 could prove more
exciting, and more decisive for the course of America, than many
before it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Gore and Bush caravans roll remorsely on, crushing
all before them; even if next year's primaries have all the
suspense of a seaside Punch and Judy show; even if neither
candidate puts a foot wrong (and that makes a lot of even-ifs), the
American political scene has seldom been so open to change.
</P>
<P>
   There is everything to play, and vote, for. &QL;

LAWMAKERS PUSH TAX BREAK FOR FIRMS DEVELOPING AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 4)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some lawmakers are pressing for tax credits to
encourage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop a
vaccine against AIDS and other deadly infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a leading voice in efforts to fight
AIDS, and Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the
House Ways and Means Committee, have proposed legislation that
would provide a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the money
invested in developing vaccines for AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Small start-up companies could pass a portion of the credit onto
investors who finance their research and development into such
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi says AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, combined, kill more
than 7 million people a year worldwide. But pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies are not rushing to discover vaccines
against them because of difficulties in developing the vaccines and
because the market doesn't look lucrative enough. Most of the
people who need these vaccines live in developing countries where
there is little money to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, says the
answer is designing a research and development tax credit that
``could speed development of preventative weapons against these
diseases, potentially saving millions of lives and billions of
dollars in treatment costs and productivity losses.''
</P>
<P>
   She says vaccines are the best hope to bring AIDS, which infects
16,000 new people a day, and other epidemics under control. ``But
accelerated research efforts are needed if we are to develop these
vaccines as soon as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is drafting similar legislation in
the Senate, says incentives for firms to develop these vaccines are
urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a crisis of enormous proportions,'' Kerry said.
``People can't afford the vaccines and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Snow, a member of the board of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy
Coalition in Berkeley, Calif., describes the situation as one of
``market breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow says preventative vaccines, as opposed to medicines to
treat the diseases, are the only way to stop AIDS, malaria and
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can keep somebody from getting sick, it's way better
for them and way better for the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While drug companies are sinking billions of dollars into 113
new AIDS treatments, few of these are vaccines, according to the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only a single AIDS vaccine is in the advanced stages
of testing. That vaccine is being developed by a small, 60-employee
South San Francisco biotechnology firm, VaxGen, rather than a large
pharmaceutical maker.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies
accepting the tax credit would be required to work with public
health groups and governments to find ways to get the vaccine to
people around the world who need it.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure intend to add it to a large package of
tax cuts that Republicans hope to pass before Congress begins its
summer recess on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, signaled earlier this week he plans to extend an
existing R&AMP;D tax credit that would give a wide range of firms a 20
percent tax credit for new research and development. The
Pelosi-Kerry bill would lift that credit an additional 10 percent
for firms developing the vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's unclear whether the tax bill would include
Pelosi's bill, according to Ways and Means spokesman Trent Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   A tax lobbyist said the bill won't move forward unless President
Clinton fights for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need the White House to get on board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hasn't weighed in on the bill, although
President Clinton in May 1997 set a national goal of developing an
AIDS vaccine in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Other pending AIDS-related legislation includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- A bill introduced in April by House Democratic Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., Pelosi, and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., that
would give states the option to expand their Medicaid programs to
provide treatment for low-income, HIV-positive people who have not
yet shown symptoms of full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend antiviral therapy for those who are newly
infected with HIV. However, Medicaid doesn't define people with
early infection as disabled and, therefore, many low-income people
can't get the drugs and health care they need.
</P>
<P>
   -- A bill introduced this week by Pelosi and Rep. Connie
Morella, R-Md., that would expand and better coordinate AIDS
prevention programs and would give states or cities more control to
tailor prevention programs to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., plan
to reintroduce a bill this month that would require state public
health departments to report cases of HIV infection to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. It would also require states to
confidentially notify partners of people diagnosed with HIV or
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 states currently require some form of partner
notification. All states are required to report cases of AIDS, but
several states with relatively high HIV infection rates, including
California, do not report cases of HIV. Last year, the measure died
in both chambers.

   -- Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., plan
to reintroduce a bill this month that would require state public
health departments to report cases of HIV infection to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. It would also require states to
confidentially notify partners of people diagnosed with HIV or
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 states currently require some form of partner
notification. All states are required to report cases of AIDS, but
several states with relatively high HIV infection rates, including
California, do not report cases of HIV. Last year, the measure died
in both chambers.

PRESBYTERIANS DEBATE, BUT DON'T DECIDE, ROLE OF GAYS IN CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presbyterians meeting in Fort Worth had lunch at Billy Bob's,
billed as the world's largest honky-tonk. They had other surprises,
including a musical program at the new Bass Performance Hall and an
appearance by one of Cowtown's favorite sons, concert pianist Van
Cliburn.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no surprises when delegates to the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A) General Assembly got down to business. Once again,
the role of gays in the church dominated their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   And they settled nothing. They rejected an attempt to remove
language from the church Book of Order banning gay ordinations. But
they also voted to study the matter and take it up again in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opted again for a cooling-off period,'' said the Rev.
Christopher Harris of Garden City, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   This year's assembly was marked by unusual consideration for
opposite points of view on gay issues. I watched those on both
sides arguing their views. Then they would join hands in a circle
to pray for God to give them the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Goss, a youth delegate from Elmwood, N.J., emotionally
pleaded for inclusion of gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been black, or a woman, or homosexual, but I feel
their pain when they feel excluded from the real life of the
church,'' said Goss. ``I don't think anybody should have to feel
that pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marvin Donaldson of Warren, Ohio, declared: ``Should we
twist the truth to fit our own lifestyles?''
</P>
<P>
   Freda A. Gardner, a retired Princeton Seminary professor who was
named moderator, the church's highest elective office, praised the
way the gay issues were debated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we Presbyterians are trying harder than ever to live
together in our diversity,'' she said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Church spokesman Jerry Van Marter, who has attended 24 General
Assemblies, thinks he knows why delegates debating gay issues were
more conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many realized for the first time that we could really split
over this, and it frightened them,'' Van Marter said.
</P>
<P>
   Gay advocates had urged deleting a church law adopted in 1996
that bans gay ordinations. It says ministers, elders and deacons
must live in ``fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a
man and a woman, or chastity in singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates voted to keep the gay ordination ban. But they asked
for creation of new materials on gay issues and for churches to
begin intense study of whether gays should be ordained. The matter
is to be taken up again two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   George Pepper of Fort Worth, an assembly observer, said he
wishes the denomination had settled the gay ordination question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can delay, delay, delay, and you never resolve anything,''
said Pepper. He favors the right of local congregations to make the
decision on whether gays should be ordained.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists were pleased by some developments.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Janie Spahr, a Presbyterian minister who is a lesbian,
was honored with a Women of Faith Award for her work with a
national ministry to gays and lesbians called ``That All May Freely
Serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was defeated on the convention floor, gay
advocates saw it as a small victory that the Committee on Church
Orders and Ministry voted 24-14 to recommend removal of the
``fidelity and chastity'' section prohibiting gay ordinations.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Presbyterians believe the gay controversy finally
will be settled in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 20 years in a row we've supported language
prohibiting ordination of gays and lesbians, and we will continue
to do it,'' said the Rev. Carmen Fowler, pastor of the Rabun Gap
Presbyterian Church in Rabun Gap, Ga. She is a member of the
Presbyterian Coalition, a conservative organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a movement of people in the pews, and I think we stand
for what most people in the church stand for,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Marty, a renowned observer of American religion who spoke
at a breakfast during the convention, urged patience on gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes the church 250 years to settle anything,'' Marty
said, noting that in 1950 the meeting he was addressing would have
been all-male and all-clergy. He said people can't predict what the
church will be like in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a loving God is in control.''

AT A WEDDING, IT'S STILL NOT IN TO BE OUT 
FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By BOB MORRIS  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So it's 1999 and you're gay. So what? Your boss is
gay. Ellen's gay. Will of ``Will and Grace'' is gay. Rupert
Everett, who is gay and played a gay man in ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' is now playing Mr. Right in ``An Ideal Husband.'' The
media understand you. Your neighbors do, too. So do your parents.
You're well integrated and well connected. In fact, without being
boring, you're as self-actualized as any post-modern urban gay
person can be.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day _  &UR; poof! &LR;  _ you're reduced to a quivering mass of
neuroses. You've been invited to a wedding. Not a commitment
ceremony for same-sex couples. But a straight wedding, where you're
seated with some pleasant, provincial people who want to know which
side _ bride or bridegroom? _ you're on, and then start asking your
partner question after question about what he's doing there until
they force him to declare, for all to hear, that he's not your
 &UR; business &LR;  partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For gay people, weddings are always a reminder of being
outsiders,'' said Charles Silverstein, an Upper West Side
psychologist and the author of several books about homosexuality.
``Even when people are welcoming, as they usually are these days,
weddings can be extremely alienating experiences. They raise all
sorts of ambivalence and take on a meaning far greater than any
party ever should.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems more ironic than romantic that June, the month for
weddings, is also the month for gay pride. Nothing tests gay pride
more than straight weddings, many gay men and women say. For those
who live in any of the nation's ever-so-inclusive gay-friendly
cities, weddings provide that increasingly rare opportunity to feel
ashamed, or at least self-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage, of course _ from Romeo and Juliet, Henry VIII and the
Duke of Windsor to Dennis Rodman and Adam Sandler in ``The Wedding
Singer'' _ is a frequent source of trauma, and wedding anxiety is a
nondiscriminatory phenomenon that crosses religious and sexual
lines. But for gay men and women, the quintessential rite of
heterosexual life presents a unique set of anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal Ayyildiz, a Manhattan writer, was invited to be a member
of a wedding party by a bride he had known since the fifth grade,
but the bridegroom's parents were not happy when they learned he
was bringing his companion. At the rehearsal dinner at a country
club in Roanoke, Va., Ayyildiz said, he and his boyfriend were the
only two of the 40 guests not assigned seats. They ended up
circling around and around the room, to their mounting
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that the groom's mother had panicked at the idea
of a gay couple and didn't have places for us,'' Ayyildiz said.
Eventually, the bride's parents offered seats at their table.
</P>
<P>
   Ayyildiz's experience was an exaggerated example of what most
gay people report at weddings, where brushes with overt homophobia
are rare; much more common are subtle, often unintended _ and
sometimes self-inflicted _ causes for uneasiness. ``When you're
around people who aren't around gay people that often,'' said
Steven Druckman, a freelance writer, ``you start watching
everything you're doing, even how you lean back in your chair and
put your arm around your boyfriend's shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Druckman and his partner are recuperating this weekend after an
entire month of weddings, where, he said, he endured more than a
few withering looks. ``Often one of the families doesn't want you
there, so you end up feeling like pariahs,'' he said. ``I wanted to
dance with my boyfriend, but he said he didn't think it was right.
You can't just assert yourself at such a large social gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ronald Hellman, an openly gay Manhattan psychiatrist, who
was united in a big family-oriented commitment ceremony last month
with his male lover, a Reform rabbi, could not quite work up the
nerve to dance at a straight wedding held the week before his.
``We're about as out as we can be, but we couldn't dance,'' Dr.
Hellman said. ``Dancing is very ritualistic, and it's very heavy.
You need to know you're in a safe gay space before you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Bessey thought he was safe when he was invited to walk a
bride down the aisle at a recent wedding. Then the bridegroom's
family objected because he was gay. So the bride decided to defuse
their anxiety by seating Bessey, a producer for ``Entertainment
Tonight,'' with her fiance's family at the rehearsal dinner. He
didn't flinch. Rather, he turned up the charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at a wedding,'' he said, ``I will do everything in my
power to make sure that people feel good about each other.''

</P>
<P>
   In modern society, in fact, from Oscar Wilde to Isaac Mizrahi,
gay people have often developed senses of humor as defense
mechanisms, making them particularly entertaining as hosts and
guests. They are often called upon at weddings to serve as
toastmasters, or to offer last-minute style tips about the bride's
bouquet or the bridegroom's mother's shade of lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems to be our job to loosen things up and provide
a spark,'' said Ted Kruckel, a press agent, who also believes that
gay men buy the best presents. ``Weddings are by their nature
staid. Gay people bring a sense of levity to the event because it's
so irrelevant to our lives. And of course, we're needed. I often
find myself being asked to make a toast that will be a nice tonic
to the tedium of the proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Nathan recalled working with the florist Robert Isabell on
the splashiest New York wedding of the late 1980s, that of Laura
Steinberg and Jonathan Tisch, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Gayfryd Steinberg called a week before her stepdaughter's
wedding to say it was ``too formal and stuffy,'' Nathan said. To
counteract the pomposity, he hired a Brazilian band on stilts and
booked a snow machine to blow white feathers around. ``That was my
great contribution as a gay man to New York culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan's sardonic tone is echoed by other gay men and women, who
say they are subtly irked by what they perceive as a double
standard: called upon to enliven the weddings of others, they are
legally forbidden, of course, from having weddings of their own.
Druckman, who is getting back in the saddle for another wedding
next weekend, said that as much as he hates the affairs, he
wouldn't mind having one of his own if they become legal. ``That
way, I can get my own blender,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When her brother announced that he was getting married, Ann
Northrup felt a little resentful as well. ``There I was in a
relationship for 15 years, and my brother was telling me that there
are so many economic advantages to marriage that it seemed like the
smartest thing to do,'' said Ms. Northrup, an Act Up member and a
host of a cable show called ``Gay U.S.A.'' ``I cursed him out, and
he ended up apologizing for the next 20 minutes.'' At his wedding
reception, she made a toast that got her a laugh. ``I announced
that my brother and I shared the same taste in women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Jon Robin Baitz, meanwhile, recalls being in the
middle of a toast at his brother's wedding, when he noticed that he
was speaking to a sea of frozen faces. ``I was joking about
maturity and commitment,'' said Baitz, who has been in a gay
relationship for many years. ``I thought I was just being honest.
But I guess I didn't realize that I was talking about love in a
cynical way that was very gay and inappropriate. I often end up
feeling like I've stubbed my toe at weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many gay people feel uneasy when they are not invited to take a
companion to weddings. One New Yorker has been invited to a wedding
this month by a woman he has known for years. But the bridegroom's
family is pressuring the bride to discourage him from bringing
anyone with him. ``I completely want to participate in her
wedding,'' he said. ``But all my other friends have been invited to
bring a guest. You don't want to make a fuss when people are
already stressed out to the extreme with family politics at a
wedding. But I really don't want to go alone. I guess the book of
etiquette hasn't been written for people like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Landers may not be able to give gay marriage her full
support (``It flies in the face of cultural and traditional family
life as we have known it for centuries,'' she has written). But
salespeople at Tiffany's, Macy's and Barneys are doing everything
they can short of breaking into song to make gay people feel good
about registering for commitment ceremonies. Barneys even has a
form to fill out that doesn't use the words bride and bridegroom,
but rather partner and partner. There's a new book called ``The
Essential Guide to Lesbian and Gay Weddings.'' There are clergy
members who will officiate (although not necessarily in an official
capacity) and a vast segment of society that is looking for ways to
open up to same-sex couples and wish them well. Still, many gay
people aren't interested in aping the ceremony and social
institution of marriage until it becomes legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, for all their resentment and paranoia (not always
justified), many gay people know that weddings are a trial that
everyone must bear, gay and straight. Dan Savage, who writes a
syndicated advice column, ``Savage Love,'' gets lots of letters
about weddings. ``They've become so institutionalized that they're
hollow and empty and depressing for everyone,'' he said, ``and not
just for the gay people who feel slighted because they can't have
their own legal wedding that's hollow and empty and depressing,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Savage went to the wedding of his boyfriend's
fundamentalist Christian brother in Spokane, Wash. He arrived ready
to explode at the slightest offense, and ended up feeling, in
addition to bored, welcome and at ease. ``These days, tolerance is
the norm,'' said Savage, who chronicled his experience for Out
magazine. ``So spending all your time at a wedding trying to figure
out who really likes you and who doesn't is exhausting and
paranoid. I think that in the absence of the real tolerance we hope
to find, the appearance of tolerance can be just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Blum, a well-known wedding planner, agrees. ``If gay
people are acting paranoid or unhappy at weddings,'' said Ms. Blum,
who often finds them acting otherwise, ``it doesn't help an already
tense situation.'' While she says she has never seen any homophobia
at the weddings she has planned, Ms. Blum has seen lots of
bridesmaids who look as if they were ready to kill or die, often
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's not easy being a gay person in a straight world,''
said Ms. Blum, who is 45 and divorced. ``But it's not easy being a
single woman, either.''

WORKHORSE UTILITIES GET ANOTHER LOOK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world is often a strange place, but the marketplace is
supposed to be rational.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, then, the counterintuitive move in utility stocks,
which because of their high dividend yields and low growth rates
are often seen as bonds dressed up as equities.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, bond prices have fallen like a stone,
and interest rates have shot up. Yet, since the end of March, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's Utilities index has risen by 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, that sort of move doesn't make a lot of sense.
Rising interest rates should make bonds more competitive with
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Are utilities still a good proxy for bonds? What is going on in
this $300 billion industry? Steven I. Flieshman, an electric
utility analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., took some time last week to
discuss these and other issues. Here are some excerpts: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Isn't it unusual for utility stocks to do well in a
period of rising interest rates?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the group as a whole is still down for the year, so
it's not like we are doing great. And until two or three months
ago, the electric utility index had acted pretty much in tandem
with the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   We were somewhat surprised that happened because deregulation is
changing the industry and fewer companies are paying high
dividends. So I am not surprised there has been some delinkage. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is that to say there are no ties between utilities
and bonds?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Utility stocks can often be a leading indicator of where the
bond market will go.
</P>
<P>
   We look at the spread between the 30-year Treasury bond yield
and the 55 utility stocks we follow. Historically, that spread has
averaged between 50 basis points and 60 basis points. Currently,
the spread is about 130 basis points, which is as high as it has
been since late 1994. So you could speculate that bond yields may
have risen too much. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Market rates have been rising because of
expectations that the Federal Reserve is going to raise short-term
rates. Why are rising rates good for utility stocks?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As a group, since the mid-1980s, utilities tend to perform
worst after periods when the Fed eases rates and best in the months
ahead of Fed tightenings.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as the Fed starts to tighten, the desired
outcome is to slow the economy, which makes growth sectors like
technology less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in times of higher interest rates, it is better to own
shorter-duration securities than longer-duration ones. In that
environment, higher-yielding utilities are a better performing
asset than a growth stock. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Speaking of growth, hasn't deregulation prompted a
number of utilities to look beyond their original markets?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The industry is splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are exiting the power generation part of the
business, which is the part that is turning very competitive, and
are just focusing on distribution, which remains regulated.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution companies are lower-risk, and more predictable.
Consolidated Edison is a company that sold off most of its power
generation and is focusing on distribution. It is one of the few
big companies that is going in that direction, and it is a pretty
low-risk, unsexy sort of investment.
</P>
<P>
   The second group is focusing on the competitive power generation
and related businesses, like marketing the power to both the
wholesale and retail buyer. The focus of these companies is clearly
to boost their growth rates. The split between these two groups has
accelerated over the last year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are there stocks you like in both camps?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On the growth side, we like companies like Duke Energy, Peco
Energy and Texas Utilities. Part of the Peco and Texas Utilities
stories is restructuring, which is happening as deregulation occurs
in their states. My price target for Duke is the mid-60s, and the
low 50s for Texas Utilities. (The stocks closed on Friday at
$55.4375 and $42.4375, respectively.)
</P>
<P>
   On the distribution side, Sierra Pacific Resources and Nevada
Power are merging, a deal which should close in late July. Because
they are in the nation's highest customer-growth state in terms of
electricity sales, they are good bets.
</P>
<P>
   Another category we are looking at is telecommunications. A lot
of utilities had fiber in the ground themselves, and many have
rights of way that allow them to put it in the ground. They are not
huge competitors to the regional Bells, but, over time, if the
values of the telecommunication franchise don't get brought out in
the price of the utility stock, these telecom properties will be
spun out.
</P>
<P>
   The big story in this area is Montana Power, whose stock price
has about tripled. But I rate it ``accumulate'' with a price target
of $80. A stock we still like is Conectiv Inc., with a target of
$29. (Montana Power and Conectiv closed on Friday at $70 and
$25.1875, respectively.)

WHAT IS IT ABOUT PROSPERITY AMERICANS CAN'T SEEM TO LOVE?

 (For release Sunday, July 04, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our lovely, rambunctious country on this, her birthday, has
never been better off when it comes to our prosperity, standing in
the world, military might, cultural influence (OK, for good or for
bad), public health and life expectancy, and a dozen other measures
you could think of.
</P>
<P>
   But in the heart, the soul or the gut, depending on where you
locate any kind of national sense of emotional well-being, our
dread notion of something missing looms large. It's not just
because the Republicans hate Bill Clinton and blame him for
everything from corn blight to halitosis. And it's not just because
the various news media make their money by encouraging audiences to
cringe on a daily or hourly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam, it appears, is having a senior moment, a bit of a
bout of self-doubt. The old guy is dwelling more on what he doesn't
have than what he has. Maybe you could call it a revolution of
risen expectations. We're the richest, the most powerful, the
least-threatened people in history. Our economy market is the envy
of the world. The stock market, now more Main St. than Wall St., is
in nose-bleed territory.
</P>
<P>
   We just won a war where, for the most altruistic of reasons _
stopping mass murder, rape and pillage of Hitlerian scale, in a
remote land that could do us not one bit of good _ and we did it in
total synch with civilized Europe, and, remarkably, with not one
combat casualty.
</P>
<P>
   If you had dared forecast eight years ago that on the eve of the
millenium, the economy would be booming, home ownership at record
levels, inflation barely flickering, the Dow over 11,000, Europe in
the palm of our hand, all the Asian economies taking their cue from
us, and no other nation in any kind of position to do us anything
in the way of serious harm, you'd have been mocked. No one would
have believed it possible.
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget in balance? A monstrous federal surplus
piling up, just begging to be divvied up? A national anti-smoking
crusade that is saving thousands of lives annually? A head start on
curbing the curse of indiscriminate gun availability? A genuine
economic revolution _ the Internet _ that promises to put more
power, choice and efficiency in the hands of the common citizen?
All this and more, but no balm for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Like spoiled children, egocentric kids who always got what they
whined for, we grump about whatever we feel like grumping about.
This manifests itself most commonly _ that is to say with
mind-numbing regularity _ when any Republican strays within
shouting distance of a cable television sound boom. The rude
reception given victorious Gen. Wesley Clark by Republican senators
cheap-shotting our Kosovo victory shows just how petty Washington
is now.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there are no sentient beings left in America who are not
thoroughly familiar with the sins, mortal or venial, of omission or
comission, of Senor Clinton. But just as surely, the dire
predictions of his enemies have fallen woefully wide of the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican consensus in Congress was that Clinton would:
wreck the economy; destroy the military; alienate our allies; be
too tough, not tough enough, or weathervane-ish in handling Russia,
China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, you-fill-in-the-blank. In fact,
Clinton's biggest problem came from trying to weasel out of a
tawdry romantic liason with a young woman of colossal ditziness. Of
course, he should have known better. It reminds us that in
politics, as in life, the most painful and regrettable wounds are
those that are self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   It is the wounds our country inflicts on itself that are most
painful. Battlin' Billy C. is the Olympic champion of
self-inflicted wounds. He wins, hands down. But President Pinocchio
soldiers on. Left for dead a dozen times in his reign, he proved
anew in Kosovo he's still the most important player, period.
</P>
<P>
   But falling on one's own sword is not Clinton monopoly. Exhibit
B has to be Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel whose rampage so
disheartened everyone that his job classification is being
obliterated. Exhibit C in the Hall of Self-Inflicted Wounds has to
be the Republican leadership in DC. Those Krazy Kops in Kongress
have lost one House speaker (Newt Whatsisname), a second was
defenestrated before seizing the gavel (Dr. Bob Livingston, I no
longer presume), and the third should have his mug on a milk
carton, he's been missing in action so long (Dennis Hastert, if
you're keeping score).
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit D would be the news media, collectively, for constantly
performing worse than the public expects us to. TV ratings are
down, newspaper circulation is going the wrong way, and our
collective product has been trivialized, dumbed-down and cheapened.
But for every seller there has to be a buyer, and therefore I
annoint the news-consuming public as Exhibit E in the Dept. of
Self-inflicted Impairment.
</P>
<P>
   So vast is the catalogue of self-inflicted wounds as our dear
old land treads millenium-ward that it makes no sense to keep
going. But there is a final point: it's what happens after the
self-inflicted wound that matters.
</P>
<P>
   In this category, Clinton is a master. We know a lot less about
the ability of his putative successors in this realm. George W.
Bush is the man of the moment. The Texas governor's harvest of $36
million in campaign loot over just six months marks him as the GOP
Golden Boy. But we've yet to see how he handles himself in the
clinches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's success in shaking down the plums from the money tree is
so great, I say he should skip the election and go straight to Mt.
Rushmore. But nobody gets that kind of free ride. Why the
Republicans expect Bush to escape the sort of media acid that
bathed Clinton is beyond rational explanation. Do they think it
only rains on the other guy?
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming unexpected setbacks is what separates the survivor
from the roadkill. Bill Clinton, for all his sins, is a survivor.
George Bush has not been tested. If he's only half as good as
Clinton in the survival game, that would probably be good enough.
Same for Al Gore, or any of the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual winner will be the one who figures out how to lead
a country that doesn't want to be led. There are a dozen
Republicans running on variations of the
boy-is-this-country-in-bad-shape theme. The America my father grew
up in couldn't stand Depression. My America seems to find
prosperity intolerable.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world that still reverberates with the conflicts of World
War II, it isn't really surprising to learn that Dr. Seuss, beloved
creator of ``Hop on Pop'' and ``Horton Hears a Who,'' sharpened his
artistic skills drawing political cartoons of Hitler and Mussolini.
Nevertheless, it is fascinating to realize that the shadow of
fascism lurks beneath the shell of Yertle the Turtle and that Uncle
Sam is a distant antecedent of the Cat in the Hat. Whether these
discoveries say something about the seriousness of Dr. Seuss or the
cartoonish nature of American culture is another question.
</P>
<P>
   Born Theodor Seuss Geisel in 1904, the author was in midcareer
when World War II came along. He had published his first children's
book, ``And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,'' in 1937,
but that book, which had been rejected by 27 publishers, was only
modestly received, as were several others that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss was far better known in those days as an illustrator
of Flit bug spray advertisements. His years creating cheerful
depictions of insect extermination, combined with the sensibility
of a children's author, served him well when he turned his
attention in 1941 to political cartoons for the newspaper PM. Now,
for the first time, these cartoons are to appear in one volume,
``Dr. Seuss Goes to War,'' a book published by The New Press and
edited by Richard H. Minear that should be in stores in September.
</P>
<P>
   An innovative left-wing tabloid that accepted no advertisements
(which helps explain why it folded after eight years), PM
flourished briefly in a New York newspaper culture that boasted
seven dailies. Geisel brought himself to the editors' attention
with an unsolicited cartoon attacking Virginio Gayda, the Fascist
editor of Il Giornale d'Italia. Soon Geisel was a PM regular,
zipping off hundreds of cartoons from 1941 to 1943 condemning U.S.
isolationism, appeasement, anti-Semitism and racism; attacking the
Rev. Charles E. Coughlin as anti-Semitic and Charles A. Lindbergh
as pro-Nazi, and, most of all, urging that the United States enter
the war. (Dr. Seuss' liberalism did not save him from falling into
occasional ethnic generalizations, like depicting
Japanese-Americans as an ``honorable fifth column.'')
</P>
<P>
   These cartoons bear the unmistakable stamp of Dr. Seuss' zany
style, a hyperanimated world where animals and people seem
interchangeable and quaint complex machines (like a pedal-operated
tank for Mussolini) roll comically along. There is, as in his
children's books, a pervasive geniality, a sense of whimsy, a
feeling that Norman Rockwell characters have fallen through the
looking glass, but no farther.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the dark side of Dr. Seuss. In a cartoon dated Dec.
9, 1941, titled ``The End of the Nap,'' a beleaguered American
eagle in an Uncle Sam hat is rudely awakened by tiny, identical
Japanese soldiers variously shooting a slingshot, wielding a
mallet, giving Uncle Sam a hotfoot. They all look like naughty boys
in need of a spanking _ this, two days after some 2,300 Americans
died at Pearl Harbor. But of course stark depictions of treachery
are not always useful in getting men to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   All four of Geisel's grandparents emigrated from Germany in the
19th century, and he grew up in Springfield, Mass., far from the
world of Grimm's fairy tales, in which children push old crones
into ovens and there's a wolf in grandma's bed. For all their
outrage and urgency and honest indignation, Dr. Seuss' political
cartoons often display an American ease, a calm conviction that the
war will be won, that goodness will triumph and that disorder, like
the mess the Cat in the Hat makes, will eventually be cleaned up.
They're a useful reminder of how necessary childish fantasies
really are.

<P>
   MEDICARE-CLINTON-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's new
Medicare proposal seemed to be something more than another
ritualistic exercise in policy-making by a waning administration.
It seemed, instead, to be one last attempt to come to grips with a
nation's conflicted, contradictory needs and desires on the shape
of its health care system _ and an acknowledgment of recent
history's painful lessons. In fact, many of the tensions and
faultlines that have marked one of the main political conflicts of
the 1990s, the battle over health care, were present. By Robin
Toner. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-SOCCER-REVIEW (Rio de Janeiro) _ Soccer may be the king
of sports here, but only the men's version of the game seems to
wear the crown. Not one of this year's matches of the Brazilian
national women's team has been televised live, sponsors have shied
away from any association with them, and hard-core fans who can
recite the entire roster of the 1950 men's World Cup squad are hard
pressed to name even one player on the current women's team. By
Larry Rohter. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DEBT-REVIEW (Washington) _ In announcing that the federal budget
surplus would be even more than anticipated, President Clinton
likened the government to a profligate consumer suddenly endowed
with the means and discipline to get out of debt and save for the
future. The actual American consumer, however, is not nearly so
fiscally virtuous. Minutes before Clinton's announcement, the
Commerce Dept. released data showing that consumers are headed in
the other direction by spending more money than they earn. By
Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHERS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Democrats are
increasingly portraying health care, gun control and drug abuse as
women's issues on the grounds that mothers worry about their
children. This represents a peculiar paradox: The party that fought
hard to make sure women were not defined simply as the bearers and
rearers of children is now casting women in those terms, or at
least appealing to their maternal instincts along those lines. By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-HEALTH-REVIEW (Washington) _ At a time when managed
care has put greater distance between doctors and their patients,
the Internet is filling the gaps. Millions of Americans are going
online for medical information, mostly about specific diseases and
drugs, fueling a free-for-all on the Web, where thousands of sites
are offering some type of health information. Investment money is
pouring in. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   BALLPARKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the ongoing demise of old
baseball stadiums and the advent of new ones. Ballparks don't evoke
the same wistful nostalgia as they did a generation or two ago.
Mention the demolition of Ebbets Field in 1960 and many
Brooklynites still weep. But with five new major league stadiums
set to sprout up around the U.S. in the next 12 months,
sentimentality has been put on waivers. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-FUNDRAISING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Even though he has done it
faster than anyone else, George W. Bush is not the first Texan to
raise several gazillion dollars to run for president. He is the
seventh. But money doesn't always buy the White House _ of the
seven Texans, only Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and George Bush in 1988
actually won presidential elections. By Adam Clymer. (NOTE: story
is tentative and may be held or recast with broader focus)
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with the Honduras teen's hoax and Russia's alcohol-related
drownings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-EVIDENCE-REVIEW (Djakovica, Yugoslavia) _ Kosovo is a
huge crime scene, and the evidence seems obvious. But meeting the
exacting standards of a court of law _ even an international
tribunal _ is a different matter. There are still specific criminal
acts to be proved and a chain of evidence to be established before
Yugoslav leaders can be held to account. And there are cold scenes
_ bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by departing Serbs. The sites themselves have been open to
the elements, sometimes for more than two months. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DECOYS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A major surprise of the NATO
air campaign against Yugoslavia Serbia was the extent to which the
Yugoslav military was able to successfully use ground decoys such
as fake tanks to cause NATO to strike targets that weren't real. By
Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-KURDS-REVIEW _ A solution for Turkey's tensions with the
Kurds may seem obvious: reach an accommodation, as done in Northern
Ireland, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and elsewhere. But for
centuries, Turkey's territory has been steadily shrinking. Fear of
losing more worries many Turks, and when they hear Kurds demand
autonomy or cultural rights, they sense the start of secession. By
Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   NAZI-LAWS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Nuremburg Laws of Hitler's
Germany rank among the most chilling documents of the 20th Century:
They helped set the Holocaust in motion by legally excluding Jews
from German life. But until the opening last week of an exhibit at
the Jewish-oriented Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, they
had never been put on public display. Some excerpts.

acts to be proved and a chain of evidence to be established before
Yugoslav leaders can be held to account. And there are cold scenes
_ bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by departing Serbs. The sites themselves have been open to
the elements, sometimes for more than two months. By John Kifner.

<P>
   An oil driller, a maker of industrial cutting tools, an
acquisition steel producer and a paper company. Those were the
kinds of blue-collar stocks that fueled returns of the
top-performing mutual funds in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Such value stocks, as well as small-capitalization issues, came
roaring back during the spring, shoving aside the large-company
growth stocks that had dominated the market for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of three of the top-performing funds talked about
the quarter just ended and looked ahead to the rest of the year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year of emphasis on growth and large-cap companies,
when investors were not at all interested in value or small-cap
companies, valuations simply reached the extremes,'' said Dennis
Delafield, 63, co-manager of the $102.1 million Delafield fund with
Vincent Sellecchia, 47. Delafield, which owns small- to mid-cap
value stocks, was the No. 15 performing United States diversified
stock fund for the quarter, up 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors might not care about the companies we own, but
industrialists do,'' he said. ``They look at companies with free
cash flow and modest valuations, and they acquire or invest in
those companies. And that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Delafield made money when Getronics, a Dutch company, acquired
Wang Laboratories, in which he owned shares. The company, based in
Billerica, Mass., was known for word-processing systems but now
services desktop computer systems and networks. Getronics bought 91
percent of the company in mid-June for $29.25 a share, a 50 percent
premium to its price at the start of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another winner was Kennametal, a Latrobe, Pa., maker of
industrial cutting tools. Its earnings for the fiscal year ended in
June 1998 were depressed because of a troublesome acquisition and
the market's general disregard for such stocks last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has rebounded 76 percent since March as a cost-cutting
program began to bear fruit and the company named a new chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Delafield is now looking for clues to the direction of the world
economy. ``What happens the rest of the year depends on what
happens in Europe and to interest rates,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is going through a rotational correction,'' said
Jim Crabbe, 54, co-manager of the $98.7 million Liberty-Crabbe
Huson Special fund with John Johnson, 62. The fund, a small-cap
blend fund, returned 29.6 percent in the quarter, for ninth place
among domestic diversified equity funds. ``Some parts of the market
are still very overpriced, but there are some tremendously good
bargains, particularly among smaller companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's performance surge stands in stark contrast to its
five-year return through June 30 _ negative 1.08 percent,
annualized. The fund had been hurt severely because it shorted big
stocks; it stopped doing so about a year ago, but that didn't solve
the fund's problems. Last year, he said, ``we owned a lot of
economically sensitive stocks, and we got our clocks cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Crabbe's biggest recent winners was Marine Drilling, a
Houston company that performs offshore drilling for the oil and gas
industry. The company's share price plummeted when oil stocks were
pounded at the end of last year. But that changed this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cutback in drilling for quite some time,'' he
said, ``but as people saw the price of gas increasing, they
anticipated the company would start drilling again.'' The stock
gained 24 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another successes for the fund was Ispat International, a Dutch
steel producer, up 56 percent. Ispat bought Inland Steel, the
American steel company, in the spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Crabbe expects the stock market's gains to continue broadening,
reaching more small stocks. And the economy, he said should keep
growing. ``There doesn't seem much danger that it won't continue
plugging along at a pretty rate,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investor optimism about the world economy was a big factor in
fund performance for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors started becoming more aware that the U.S. economy
was very strong and that world economies, especially Asia, were
flat to getting better,'' said Robert J. Martorelli, who runs the
$547.2 million Merrill Lynch Phoenix fund, a mid-cap blend fund
that took the No. 12 place among domestic diversified equity funds,
returning 29.1 percent. ``In that kind of environment, cyclical
companies tend to perform well.''
</P>
<P>
   Martorelli, 42, said he was buying oil and gas and other
cyclical stocks at the end of 1998 and early 1999 ``because that's
where the value was.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his biggest winners was the LTX Corp., of Westwood, Mass.,
a maker of equipment for the semiconductor industry. LTX
experienced slackening demand during the economic debacle in Asia
last fall, but its stock rebounded as Asian economies stabilized,
Martorelli said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he liked LTX because demand for its new type of
chip-testing device was growing rapidly along with the market for
multifunctional chips used in increasing numbers of products. The
stock rose 177 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another success was Champion International, the paper company
based in Stamford, Conn. Martorelli said he bought the stock in
March because it was selling for the biggest discount to asset
value among companies in its industry. Nothing happened in company
operations to cause the subsequent rise in the stock price, he
said, but investors thought paper prices had bottomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champion has a lot of earnings leverage, so a relatively small
gain in paper prices produces incrementally larger gains in
earnings,'' he said. Champion shares rose 17 percent in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Martorelli expects value stocks to continue climbing as the
economy keeps growing. ``Strong economic expansion takes the
cyclical risk out of our stocks, so investors can look at paper,
chemical and steel companies and know that the demand for the
products will be there,'' he said. ``Besides, relative to the
growth stocks that we had to watch grow endlessly over the last
three to four years, these stocks are just cheap.''

PARTIES PLOW INTO FIGHT OVER FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats and Republicans are in a political range
war over which party is the true friend of the nation's rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on a top Democrat's ill-advised comment that his
party was writing off rural America in the 2000 elections,
Republicans have plowed into the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   They have gleefully noted that the ``writing-off'' remark was
made by Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., while his father, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., was busy filibustering the farm spending bill in
the Senate over an unrelated health care issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farming community in America is hurting,'' said Sen. Jeff
Sessions, R-Ala., at a GOP rally staged in front of gleaming farm
equipment. ``And when they find out that Patrick Kennedy has
written off rural American and Ted Kennedy is attempting to block
the passage _ through a hostage procedure _ of a legitimate and
effective farm bill, I think they are going to be even more
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic spokesman said the comment by the younger Kennedy,
who chairs the party's House campaign committee, was made in the
context of gun control. He quickly retracted it, but the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the GOP assault, farm-state Democrats complain
that Republican critics wouldn't know a ``corn cob from a corn
dog'' and that the GOP has been behind hefty cuts in farm programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, House Republicans voted for the original Freedom to
Farm Act, which eliminated the safety net that protects farmers
when prices collapse,'' said the House Democratic organization in a
position paper. ``Today, with commodity prices at record low
levels, farmers have come to deride the GOP plan as the `Freedom to
Fail Act.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the evolving fight is as much about image as
it is congressional races since farmers don't have the numbers to
swing all that many elections. Yet both parties are eager to be
tied to the values many Americans still associate with small-town
life.
</P>
<P>
   YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
</P>
<P>
   This is one honor that Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., could have
done without.
</P>
<P>
   Public Campaign, a watchdog group devoted to reforming campaign
finance laws, recently award Hollings its annual Golden Leash
award, which symbolizes captivity to special interests, for his
support of a banking overhaul the group says would hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Miller, the group's director, suggested Hollings supported
the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 because of roughly $250,000
in campaign contributions the banking industry gave his Senate
campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else would explain his puzzling anti-consumer position on
this important bill from a senator who has a long history of
pro-consumer stands?'' Miller asked.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hollings dismissed the award as meaningless,
noting that the senator was honored last year as a ``hero'' by the
Consumer Federation of America. Spokesman Maury Lane said Public
Campaign should focus on the problem of gimmicky budget practices
instead.
</P>
<P>
   PRAYER AND POLITICS I
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to reassert itself in the political arena, the Christian
Coalition kicks off a massive voter registration drive this holiday
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right group, founded by Pat Robertson, wants to
register 1 million conservative voters by the November 2000
election. The campaign will focus on thousands of churches across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro-family voters will be the crucial swing voters in the
upcoming election,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be wishful thinking. The Christian Coalition has
watched its fund- raising efforts falter and has struggled with
some key staff departures in recent years. At the same time, the
group recently lost a battle with the Internal Revenue Service over
its disputed claim that it is a nonpartisan group entitled to
tax-free status. The coalition has long supported Republican
candidates, a fact that seems unlikely to change.
</P>
<P>
   PRAYER AND POLITICS II
</P>
<P>
   Following up on their endorsement of the Ten Commandments, House
Republicans tried to push a bill through Congress calling for a
national day of ``prayer, fasting and humiliation before God.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure won a majority of votes, it failed to
garner the two-thirds margin needed for passage under the special
rules governing the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The measure won 275 votes with 140 opposed and 11 voting
present. Several Southern Democrats were among those who voted
present.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said her present vote indicated her
support for the idea of prayer in general, but also reflected her
unease with the idea of government-sanctioned prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have a right to tell people how or when to
worship,'' Clayton said.

AD SLOGANS CAN BE DANGEROUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, July 5)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While recent news stories may suggest otherwise, guns are really
quite safe.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the message (I think) in the ad campaign of the
National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is trying to get
Americans to think of guns as sporting equipment rather than
murderous weapons that were used to kill 10,744 Americans in 1996,
4,643 of whom were children or teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Wall Street Journal, Doug Painter of the ad
firm Porter Novelli suggested that the whole gun control
controversy really boils down to an image problem. (How many tragic
stories have we read in the newspaper of a child being rushed to
the emergency room with a 9-mm image lodged in his chest?)
</P>
<P>
   For many urban Americans, says Painter, guns are associated with
``crime and violence as opposed to hunting and skeet shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Painter, unfortunately, does not explain why so many urban
Americans deliberately overlook their many fine hunting and
skeet-shooting opportunities. Perhaps they are too busy playing
cricket and polo or ironing their whites for their next croquet
tournament. Either way, it is clearly a matter in need of further
study, financed, of course, by a nice, fat federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   To correct this shocking display of ignorance on the part of
urban Americans, the NSSF has come up with a thrillingly original
ad to explain why guns are safe when used properly.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of a Ruger shotgun are the words, ``The
very fact that it can be dangerous is what makes it safe.''
</P>
<P>
   If you inhale enough bus fumes I think you'll agree with me that
this is a terrific slogan, perhaps the best since chicken baron
Frank Perdue's slogan ``It takes a tough man to make a chicken
tender'' was mistranslated in Spanish to read ``It takes a hard man
to make a chicken aroused.''
</P>
<P>
   Rereading this slogan, the first thing that pops into my mind,
other than the notion to eat a lot less chicken, is: Why didn't the
tobacco industry think of this first?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how many more people would take up smoking if the
tobacco companies had come up with a slogan like, ``The very fact
that 400,000 Americans die horrible, agonizing tobacco-related
deaths each year is exactly what makes smoking safe!''
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about the statistics, an ad man could decry the
fact that many Americans associate cigarette smoking with lung
cancer and emphysema and death rather than beach parties, ski
vacations and casual sex with attractive 21-year-old models, which
is really what smoking is all about.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman might add that cigarettes are safe if smoked
responsibly and that a teen who's got his hands occupied lighting a
Marlboro is a teen who's not slamming another clip into his AK-47.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, might create some ``bad blood'' between the
tobacco industry and the gun lobby, but I doubt that it's anything
they couldn't overcome. Indeed, once the American public comes to
accept the fact that the more dangerous something is, the more safe
it is, it's just a matter of time before the proponents of other
hazardous activities are making use of the same slogan.
</P>
<P>
   The coal industry would get all the miners it needs with a
slogan like, ``Sure, there's a risk of explosion and black lung's
pretty much a sure thing and let us not ignore the very real
possibility that you'll drown or be buried alive under 10,000 tons
of rock, but, what the heck, that's what makes mining safe!''
</P>
<P>
   Rattlesnake milking, bomb defusing, tornado spotting _ all are
activities that could enjoy an image boost with the help of a
carefully worded ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And I bet inner-city polo would start getting the respect it
deserves, too.

FILLING A SKILL SHORTAGE, CLOSE TO HOME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill., S.D., Ariz. N.Y.)   (af)  
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dan Lopez was a freshman at Oak Grove High School in San
Jose, Calif., a teacher asked his class if anyone was interested in
being the first to try a new program that would prepare students
for careers in the travel and tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a lot of work. There would be extra classes and
internships in the field over the summers. But the internships were
paid, and Lopez, whose parents had not attended college, hoped
participating would improve his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would open up another avenue that would be
possible not just in the here and now but in the future,'' said
Lopez, who followed through and joined the program, sponsored by
the National Academy Foundation. Now 23, he is working this summer
as a manager at a Homewood Suites hotel and will be a senior at San
Jose State University in California in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is also looking forward to meeting President Clinton this
week, as the foundation gets a high-profile endorsement for its
pioneering work linking high schools and corporations to prepare
students for jobs in growth industries.
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled to announce plans on Thursday for an
Academy of Information Technology, to be financed in part by Lucent
Technologies and based on the model established by the foundation,
a nonprofit organization founded and championed by Sanford I.
Weill, the chairman of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Since the establishment of a financial services academy in 1982
at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, nearly 20,000 teen-agers,
most of them from minority groups, have graduated from academy
programs, which now involve about 300 schools across the country.
About 90 percent of the graduates go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great believer that this country has been an incredible
place for creative people and entrepreneurs, and I think it's very
important that people who have that kind of opportunity give back
to our society and make it a better place,'' Weill said by
telephone. ``The things that work best are when you get the private
and public sector working together in concert.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a theme that resonates with the president's agenda this
week. Clinton is planning to visit several of the nation's most
economically distressed regions with industry executives who are
already investing in them in some way _ and who will exhort others
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic
Council, said the goal is to prompt corporations to see
underdeveloped communities as new markets, rather than focuses of
charity. ``The focus of this trip is untapped potential,'' he said.
``We are exhorting corporations to understand that these are
mutually beneficial programs. Giving disadvantaged youth the
opportunity to learn job skills is as critical for future economic
growth as it is for social fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled to start the visits Monday in
Appalachia. Then, in East St. Louis, Ill., he will meet with Hugh
McColl, the chairman of Bank of America. Later, Clinton will go to
Pine Ridge, S.D., and Phoenix. The last leg of the trip will take
him to Watts in Los Angeles and to Anaheim, Calif., where the
National Academy Foundation will hold its annual teacher training
session and awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the technology academy comes on the heels of a
Commerce Department report affirming the frequent complaints of
information technology executives that there are not enough
qualified workers to meet the demand. The industry has also come
under criticism recently from Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., and
others for not employing more blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology is a complicated area of curriculum
that most schools are not focusing on,'' said David Ford, president
of the Lucent Technologies Foundation. ``We believe this will help
address the industry's need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has agreed to donate over $1 million, or one-quarter of
what it will cost the National Academy Foundation to develop the
program. The plan calls for 10 schools to start the pilot program
in September 2000. But the foundation will first have to solicit
the remainder of the funds from other information technology
companies, in an industry whose newest companies are not exactly
known for philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Weill and Lucent's chairman, Richard McGinn, who are close
friends, plan a meeting to encourage other donors to step forward.
</P>
<P>
   The technology academy would be the third theme curriculum for
the foundation. The first, which trains students for jobs in the
financial services industry, was created by Weill in 1981, when he
was chairman of Shearson Loeb Rhoades.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Finance opened in 1982 and expanded in 1986 to
include an Academy for Travel and Tourism. Citigroup contributes
about $2 million annually to the foundation's programs. Other
underwriters include American Express, the Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
Foundation, Bloomberg LP, Sallie Mae, the McGraw-Hill Companies and
Marriott International.
</P>
<P>
   The formula, which also requires active participation by local
business executives, appears to have worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I was in the academy, I thought business was only one
thing, like being in an office all day with a bunch of numbers,''
said Eloisa Chavez, 18, a graduate of the Academy of Finance and
Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan. Ms. Chavez, of the
Bronx, who now attends Williams College, said an internship at
Standard &AMP; Poor's taught her that business is as much about people
as it is about math.
</P>
<P>
   The academy provided other kinds of training, too. ``Every
Wednesday, our Academy of Finance coordinator would tell us to
dress up as though you were going to a business job,'' she said,
``and if you didn't dress up, he would get on your case.''

ROOSEVELT'S CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 04, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the last Fourth of July celebration of the century, what, if
anything, can be said with confidence about the path that has
brought the United States to its present point?
</P>
<P>
   To veterans of the political wars of the last quarter-century,
the news last week was slightly dizzy-making. Growth has been so
much more robust than anticipated that the White House predicted
that budget surpluses over the next 15 years will be much greater
than expected _ an extra $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare can be extended, Social Security preserved, taxes
trimmed _ and the entire federal debt eliminated by 2015, according
to Office of Management and Budget calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do others disagree with the numbers _ not private
economists, the Federal Reserve Board, or even Republicans. Stock
markets set records on the news. So did presidential fund-raising
by George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   To check my bearings, I went back and looked at the article with
which I enlisted as a foot soldier in the tax revolt 25 years ago.
It was a cover story in Forbes magazine, illustrated by pies sliced
variously, each labelled with little flags: US, USSR, China, Japan,
Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The tag line asked, ``How Big A Slice Should Government Take?''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, we had to fight hard to get that article into
print. The editor explained: Since Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal
had become the basic social compact of US life in the early 1950s,
it was considered impolite _ slightly crackpot, even _ to complain
about taxes.
</P>
<P>
   I was given a partner, a Rhodes scholar whose duty was to keep
the story respectable. (He quoted his Oxford tutor, J.R. Lucas:
``Poverty is an evil and great poverty is a great evil, but it is
not the same evil as lack of freedom.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the article concluded jauntily, ``The tax
rebellion of the mid-Seventies may look like the old, simple
pocketbook issue. In fact it is the beginning of a fight to keep
the US from becoming another Britain or Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of this sort of thing around in those days. The
Dow Jones Industrial average was struggling to stay above 1,000.
Inflation was nearly 10 percent a year and rising. Politicians
around the world were struggling towards some kind of realignment _
no one yet knew exactly along what lines.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of analyses were offered, high and low: Friedrich
Hayek and Milton Friedman, James Buchanan and Ronald Coase, Martin
Feldstein and John Taylor, Howard Jarvis and Barbara Anderson,
George Gilder, David Stockman and Jude Wanniski.
</P>
<P>
   (My friends and I jokingly called our crude variant ``T&AMP;P,'' for
taxes and prices. We meant what economists soon enough would again
be calling political economy. The lesson I took away was that there
was no thought in a journalist's head that some economist somewhere
wasn't also working on, more clearly and more deeply.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing almost all of us had in common: We felt we were
fighting against a dominant political and economic consensus whose
shorthand was ``the New Deal. Most of us still liked FDR, but we
considered that his principles of coalition-building were impeding
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Then Paul Volcker was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board by Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980.
The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion started in 1982, and by the time it is finally
interrupted by the next recession, there will have been 20 years of
nearly continuous growth. Nor has it been just the United States.
The rest of the world has grown, too, and rapidly become more
integrated.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War ended. There was worldwide boom.
</P>
<P>
   How then to understand what had happened? The ``tax revolt''
quickly became half a dozen schisms: there were tax-cutters,
privatizers, de-regulators, re-moralizers, globalizers, good
housekeepers, creative destructionists, and those of us interested
in putting a narrative on the whole.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhodes scholar went to The Washington Post. I came to The
Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, we concentrated on the inflection points in US
history. The 1980 election was like that of 1932 _ the beginning of
broad political consensus that would last a half century. And
indeed it was a generationally-based expression of the ``zig-zag of
politics,'' in Robert Nozick's phrase.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, too, we experimented with a more global view. The
economic revolution of the 20th century was like the democratic
revolution of the 18th or the social revolution of the 19th _ a
worldwide movement of irresistible and irreversible force. This
also seemed to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly in the 1980s it was clear that there would be no
turning back the clock. Ronald Reagan had his own messages:
deregulation, privatization, and open markets. But in social
matters, and with respect to the architecture of the mixed economy,
he was a steward for Roosevelt's programs: federal withholding,
Social Security, conservation and national parks. Reagan possessed
a temperament like that of Roosevelt; routinely professed
admiration for him; from certain angles he even looked like him.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century was the century of Roosevelt. His presidency
dominates it as clearly as that of Lincoln commands the 19th.
Lincoln saw the national government as responsible for the
preservation of the Union and put the proposition that ``all men
are created equal'' at the center of its policy.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt accepted the government's ultimate responsibility for
the well-being of the market economy, and wrote a new freedom _
freedom from want _ into the national charter. ``The New Deal'' was
a short-term political coalition among interest groups whose
ability to galvanize commitments lasted the usual two generations.
But Roosevelt's deeper vision of the community is still with us.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan understood this. So did George Bush. Bill Clinton,
whose stewardship of the Republican mandate in the '90s has turned
out to be not very different from Dwight Eisenhower's willingess to
carry out the program of the New Deal in the '50s, was educated
from childhood in the New Deal. George W. Bush seemingly
understands, and that accounts for his presumed electability.
</P>
<P>
   And the 21st century? Put me down among those who think the
great struggle of the 21st is going to be about greater equality in
distribution, starting with education.
</P>

ARRESTS POINT TO GROWING USE OF TEENS FOR DRUG SMUGGLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ After catching a 16-year-old girl speeding
through the streets here with $32 million worth of cocaine openly
stacked in the bed of her pickup truck, authorities believe drug
smugglers are enlisting teen-agers in increasing numbers to skirt
adult laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many kids do you know that drive around with seven hundred
pounds of cocaine in their pickup?'' Doug Krockenberger, head of
U.S. Customs Service investigations here, asked Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no fear; it was so brazen,'' Krockenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   That incident unfolded late Wednesday when the girl pulled off a
road leading from the Rio Grande and cut in front of a Customs
agent heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Customs officials in Laredo arrested a 17-year-old
boy and charged him with smuggling 24 pounds of cocaine worth an
estimated $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has caught the eye of officials in El Paso, where the
number of juveniles arrested on marijuana-smuggling charges is
expected to climb 50 percent in 1999 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of cross-border
cases involving juveniles,'' El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriguez
said. ``The trend is alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   El Paso officials expect juvenile smuggling arrests to top 150
this year, as compared to fewer than 100 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has gotten so out of hand in far West Texas that
Rodriguez is working with television stations to produce public
service announcements warning juveniles not to risk a smuggling
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adult smugglers are reluctant to put themselves on the line,''
Rodriguez said. ``There is a perception out there that juveniles
get a slap on the wrist'' if they get caught.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of years or decades behind bars in a federal prison
system that has no parole, they face probation or a tour at the
Texas Youth Commission followed by deportation, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike El Paso and most other border cities, juveniles caught in
Laredo with significant loads of drugs are taken to federal court
rather than being turned over to country prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Adult smugglers frequent Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, discos to enlist
teen-agers to drive loads into El Paso or sneak them through narrow
drainage tunnels running between the United States and Mexico, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For a 200-pound load, which would be worth $100,000 on the
streets of El Paso, a teen-ager could earn $500, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 16-year-old driving the truck was taken before
U.S. Magistrate Marcel Notzon and ordered held at the Webb County
juvenile detention facility.
</P>
<P>
   She was caught after a brief chase that ended abruptly when she
pulled into a dead end street in South Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   And the 17-year-old was arrested at an international bridge here
after a dog sniffed the 25 pounds of cocaine wrapped in foil and
hidden in the quarter panels of the car he was driving.

   ISRAEL-ORTHODOX (Bnei Brak) _ With the laboriously negotiated
permission of rabbis, a dozen ultra-Orthodox Israelis are stepping
out of their cloistered religious universe to train in a three-year
social work program at one of the two largest Israeli universities,
Bar Ilan. It is almost unheard of in Israel. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   TOUR-DE-FRANCE (Paris) _ An air of profound pessimism hangs over
the sport of cycling these days, and it hangs heavier than usual
with the Tour de France, which begins Saturday, for it was during
last year's race that the cover was blown off the sport's
far-reaching drug problem. Since then, cycling, the sport that for
Europe has been a cultural treasure as well as a formidable
commercial enterprise, has suffered a collapse in credibility so
great that many of its riders, organizers and sponsors fear for its
future. A Special Report by Christopher Clarey and Samuel Abt.

<P>
   CAR-PHONE-BAN (Brooklyn, Ohio) _ It is illegal to drive while
talking on a cell phone in this Cleveland suburb, apparently the
only place in America with such a ban. Mayor John Coyne, 82, who is
in his 52nd year in office, and who can recall a time when people
survived without driving automobiles or talking on telephones, let
alone doing both at once, believes it is just a matter of common

All-Star Julius Erving said he is the father of tennis sensation

since her birth. He said it would be his first and only statement
about her.

RESIDENTS QUIVER AT THOUGHT OF SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER RETURNING TO
EL PASO AREA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, July 4) 
 
(Eds.: Virginia Resendiz de Maturino is cq) 
 
By MICHAEL RILEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ While the accused serial killer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez has sent a shiver across an entire nation, the
possibility that he might return to this border town in the West
Texas desert has created something close to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Families have begun to bar their doors at night and skittish
residents have claimed to see the train-hopping Resendez-Ramirez
around every corner.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say that in the last two weeks, they have received
more than 100 reports from people in El Paso claiming to have seen
the accused killer. Resendez-Ramirez's mother lives in a modest
house in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, just across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those calls have come since the admission by the U.S.
Border Patrol that they arrested him near here just a month ago,
then mistakenly let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is pretty paranoid,'' said Cynthia Acosta, 24, who
runs a sandwich shop in downtown El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   She said that because her father is away, her 12-year-old
brother has nailed all the windows shut and props up a chair behind
the front door at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come the authorities can track down anybody with a simple
parking ticket, but they can't find a guy who is supposedly not in
full control of his senses?'' Acosta asked.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has slipped through a massive national manhunt
involving thousands of federal, state and local law enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, however, he seems to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, making a panicky call from a back bathroom, believed
Resendez-Ramirez was playing pool in the barroom out front, say
police. Another person saw him standing in the check-out line at
the local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can understand that there are legitimate concerns on the
part of the public,'' said Special Agent Al Cruz of the FBI's El
Paso office. But, he added, ``there has been nothing to
substantiate or confirm the fact that he was here during some of
the reported sightings.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Resendez-Ramirez's mother lives in Juarez and that
authorities believe he once held a steady job at a packing plant
there are helping to spread the worry.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has been linked through fingerprints and other
physical evidence to the deaths of eight people in Kentucky,
Illinois and Texas. Police in one Northeast Texas community think
strongly that he killed there. The murders occurred near railway
tracks, and authorities believe that he is traveling primarily by
train.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso sits on a major east-west rail corridor, and has rail
lines leading into Mexico. The wide plane of tracks that cuts
through the city has suddenly become, at least in residents'
imagination, a way Resendez-Ramirez might try to make it back to
his native Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in town, especially those who live near the railroad
tracks, are very concerned. Who wouldn't be?,'' said Dan Williams,
city editor of the El Paso Times. ``The guy's family lives right
across the border. If you live near the train tracks, you're going
to lock your door.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here are taking it a little more in stride.
</P>
<P>
   The El Paso police aren't devoting any special resources to look
out for Resendez-Ramirez. Some of the sightings authorities have
checked out; others they eliminated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people call in and say `I saw him, but I don't remember
where.' That doesn't help us much,'' said Detective Armando
Fonseca.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border in Juarez, Resendez-Ramirez is hardly
well-known. Most express surprise that the suspected killer has any
connection with this booming industrial city. Authorities say he is
not considered a suspect in any of the string of homicides
involving young women this decade.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's neighbors say they have never seen Resendez-Ramirez
visiting. He was reared by an uncle in central Mexico. The only
children the neighbors have seen at the house belong to
Resendez-Ramirez's stepfather, a retired military man.
</P>
<P>
   Barraged by the media, Resendez-Ramirez's mother _ Virginia
Resendiz de Maturino _ has secluded herself in the house, said
Manuel Rosas, 35, who runs a tiny corner store.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a regular customer, but in the last couple of days, we
haven't seen her. The last time was just after the news about her
son came out. She looked worn out and very sad,'' said Rosas.
``This kind of thing always hits the mother hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the horror of Resendez-Ramirez's supposed crimes,
neighbors say they are still a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the doors around here are locked tight at night,'' said
Elva Porras, 44, talking under the shade of a tree on the narrow
street where Resendez-Ramirez's mother lives. ``There are some
tracks near here. We're all a little worried he might come around
to see his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosas said he believes the precautions are a little more active.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet under every bed or behind every door, there's a pole or
a stick,'' he said. ``Just in case he comes back.''

 (For release Monday, July 5)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal government study has just told us what we
want to hear. Legalized gambling is okay. Games of chance won't
bring down the republic.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Relax and enjoy playing the odds, if you wish. You
might get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   A young Minnesota woman claimed a $150 million Powerball lottery
jackpot July 1, beating odds of 80 million to one. Tens of
thousands of eager players had waited patiently in long lines from
coast to coast in the days before the drawing for a shot at the
prize. The losers were out a few bucks but they did share a brief
anticipation of realizing their wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone was really worried that the blue ribbon
commission that spent three years and $5 million to write a
340-page report would order the casinos to close and the lotteries
to shut down. The political fix was in.
</P>
<P>
   As the fastest growing industry in the country, gambling is an
800-pound gorilla perfectly capable of protecting its interests
against government meddling, thank you. Congress and the White
House like the industry's hefty campaign contributions. State
governments like it because they get a piece of the take. And the
public likes it because it is nonviolent, easily accessible
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Those hypocritical moralists who routinely posture against sin
in Congress didn't blink an eye at the commission's benign
attitude. If there were enraged sermons from pulpits, nobody
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide Gallup Poll last week showed that 63 percent of
American adults approve of legalized gambling. Another study in
Demography magazine found that three in four church-goers regard
casino gambling as harmless adult fun.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission labored mightily
to agree. Gambling in many forms is here to stay and we may as well
get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a free country, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I am not interested in gambling. It is not
my thing.
</P>
<P>
   I once peered into the great casino at Monte Carlo and I have
wandered through flashy shipboard casinos. But I never have sat
down to play the wheel or any other game. I am not a poker-player.
Pulling the lever on a slot machine strikes me as boring.
</P>
<P>
   But neither am I a prude. I bet on horse-racing, although if I
pick the wrong horse in the Kentucky Derby for the umpteenth time
again next year, I may give it up. I have enjoyed bingo since as a
child I learned to play several cards simultaneously under the
tutelage of my parents in the Danish Hall in Sioux City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   I barely know Frank Fahrenkopf Jr, the former Republican
national committee chairman who is head of the American Gaming
Association. He's also its chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   But so long as federal regulations keep the industry crime-free,
as it now seems to be, I cannot see any cultural danger in it.
Gambling is a voluntary activity. Nobody is forced to enter a
casino or pick up a playing card. If you disapprove, don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a few people become addicted to gambling and blow the
family fortune. This is tragic. But occasional self-inflicted
financial irresponsibility is no reason to kill the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   The special commission put the number of pathological gamblers
at no more than 1.5 percent of the U.S. adult population. It
sensibly suggested treatment for them.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also warned that the industry is growing so
rapidly that it needs to be carefully monitored. Fine. A few new
limitations such as a ban on betting on amateur sports and raising
the gambling age to 21 make good sense.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission also took a poke at state lotteries, on the
grounds that government services should not be financed largely on
the backs of the low-income minorities and other poor people who
are the heaviest players. The commission urged states and
communities to consider a moratorium on new lotteries until the
social consequences can be further evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddlesticks. That is bleeding-heart liberalism at its
bloodiest. Lotteries are a clean way to get people to do
voluntarily what they resent doing through mandatory taxes, which
is to pay for education and other public necessities. If lotteries
offer impossible hope against insurmountable odds, so be it. A buck
is a cheap price to pay for a dream, however temporary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the federal government ought to consider expanding
rather than constricting the lottery concept. How about a
nationwide lottery to help finance Social Security and Medicare?
Don't laugh. Think about it.

Miller left the governor's office in January, the Clinton

   FORD REWARD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's been said that good
words are worth much, and cost little. So often, the opposite also
holds true. Take, for example, the case of Kathleen Ford, who is
fighting with three jewelers over a $1 million reward she offered
to find the crooks who stole $6.2 million in jewelry from her Palm
Beach, Fla., house. The jewelers, who tipped police to two men
charged with taking her jewels over state lines, have sued Ford,
saying she's now trying to back out of the deal. Ford says the
reward is still on the table, that it was intended for the arrest
and conviction of whoever burglarized her house _ a distinct
statute that the two men have not been charged with, though both
were in possession of her stuff, and police think they did it. The
dispute has led to an agonizing and often silly parsing of words
among lawyers in depositions taken last month. ``We could probably
spend hours with the semantics,'' Ford's lawyer complained. Also,
one of the crooks is making a claim for the reward himself.

   KOSOVO-MIXEDCOUPLE _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ When Bafti married
Gordana 35 years ago, their love was unremarkable. Today, it seems
unimaginable. He is an ethnic Albanian and she is a Serb. Very
infrequently in Kosovo one hears of mixed couples. They are almost
always in their 60s, married in an era when secular Communism
papered over ethnic and religious divisions. Now, most fear that
that any discussion of their love will channel toward their
doorstep the ethnic hatred that has left a wake of mass graves and
burned villages throughout the province. But, Bafti and Gordana
Miftari, both 60, are sturdy grandparentswith a lot to say. Their
simple words seem to defy the hateful gravity of a place where
people matter-of-factly toss out blanket racial epithets about
``wild animals'' or ``terrorists.'' (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

NAME THAT INTEREST RATE: SORTING OUT THE ECONOMY'S SIGNALS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Ky., Maine, Ill.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The inflation debate has been whittled down to a single issue.
</P>
<P>
   No longer does anyone fret much about shortages in the great
array of goods and services that Americans consume. Sure, there can
be temporary scarcities and bottlenecks, and short-lived price
spikes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the Federal Reserve, only one kind of
shortage has the potential to be inflationary in the late 1990s: a
labor shortage. And that, too, may be losing its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   There is indeed a labor shortage. The statistics are clear, the
main one being the unemployment rate, which came in Friday at 4.3
percent for June. People are getting jobs everywhere, even in the
inner cities where entrenched joblessness is finally giving ground.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, inner-city people ride streetcars to the
last stop, then take taxis the final few miles to jobs at suburban
companies. To get the workers, the employers pay the taxi fares.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, which allow companies to tap the nation's
remaining pools of idle workers, help postpone the day when
corporate America might really have to bid up wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are definitely better in the inner city,'' said
Katherine S. Newman, an anthropologist at Harvard's Kennedy School
of government who works in such neighborhoods. ``But you would have
to see the lines of the unemployed shrink by a lot more than they
have before you would see major increases in wages.''
</P>
<P>
   By past standards, after 24 months with the unemployment rate
under 5 percent, those major increases ought to have appeared
already, if not in the inner cities then elsewhere in the country.
Pay is rising, of course, but not yet by enough to force companies
to try to raise prices. Until that happens, the Federal Reserve
cannot justify pushing up interest rates sufficiently to slow the
hiring by slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who argue that a significant acceleration in
wages is just around the corner. But strangely, even though the
unemployment rate has fallen below 4.5 percent since last November,
wages and salaries have risen more slowly in recent months. There
is deceleration, not acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The same deceleration also applies to the corporate cost of
health insurance and other benefits. And economists are scrambling
to explain the anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no smoking gun,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor
economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, everyone agrees that companies have become a lot
more agile at fending off wage increases, while labor's bargaining
power has declined along with union representation. As one
substitute for raises, companies offer stock options, which do not
show up in the Labor Department's employment cost data. And
one-time signing bonuses lure workers without obliging an employer
to raise the pay of comparable workers already on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Labor productivity is clearly part of the explanation. It has
risen smartly in the last two or three years, which means that
workers are producing more for the same hourly pay, at least for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   At a grittier level, service companies, particularly telephone
call centers, distribution centers and clerical operations, have
become more mobile. For example, dozens have relocated to northern
Kentucky, where unemployment was relatively high, and to towns in
Maine where shuttered shoe factories and paper mills left pools of
not-very-expensive workers. Government subsidies also encourage
companies to move.
</P>
<P>
   In a new study, two labor economists, Alan B. Krueger of
Princeton and Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard, find that the
unemployment rate may be kept artificially low by the very sharp
rise in the male prison population. Prisoners are not counted as
either employed or unemployed; if they were on the street, many
would show as unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the aging of the work force; older workers are
less likely to be unemployed. And don't forget the growing
temporary-help industry, which keeps people off unemployment rolls
between permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Adjust today's unemployment rate for these three factors, and it
would be around 5 percent, the study finds.
</P>
<P>
   On a different plane, some experts explain the deceleration in
wage growth by arguing that workers have become used to a low
inflation rate and therefore settle for smaller raises, which seems
strange when people are so much in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps job insecurity inhibits them. The National Opinion
Research Center at the University of Chicago asks people how likely
they think they are to lose their jobs. ``The percentage of those
who answer `very likely' has not fallen all that much since the
last recession,'' said Thomas Smith, director of the center's
General Social Survey.
</P>
<P>
   The list of explanations will certainly grow if the nation's
tight labor market keeps failing to push up wages significantly. No
one will collect these explanations with greater interest than the
Federal Reserve's policy makers. They cannot push up interest rates
much beyond last week's quarter-point rise without a significant
rise in labor costs as justification.

SAMPRAS A VICTOR AS PHILIPPOUSSIAS WITHDRAWS; AGASSI, HENMAN,
RAFTER GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A day late, but definitely not short on
talent, Wimbledon's four male semifinalists took advantage of a
break in the interminable drizzle that has made a scheduling
nightmare of this Grand Slam tournament's second week and
identified themselves Friday. They took a variety of routes to
arrive at their shared destination.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras, the defending champion, squeaked into the semis
thanks to an injury default by his swift-serving opponent, Mark
Philippoussis. Patrick Rafter, wearing his customary white war
paint to ward off the sunshine, slipped through on adrenaline. Tim
Henman, carrying the burden of the host nation's expectations,
soldiered into the last four for the second straight year. And
Andre Agassi, so bald and clean-shaven that he has begun to
resemble a newborn from the shoulders up, outwitted Gustavo Kuerten
and the Graveyard Court in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the five-time champion on the hunt for a place in the
record books alongside the all-time Grand Slam singles leader Roy
Emerson and his dozen majors, backed into the semis when the
seventh-seeded Philippoussis defaulted with a left knee injury 52
minutes into their match. Sampras was trailing 4-6, 1-1 when the
Australian heard ``a click'' in his knee after hitting a backhand;
then he felt the knee seize up as Sampras launched his seventh ace
to put him ahead 2-1 in the second set. It was later determined
that Philippoussis sustained torn knee cartilage and will be out
4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and say I really fended off Mark today,''
said Sampras, who doublefaulted three times in his opening service
game en route to dropping his first set of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras will next face his golfing buddy and doubles partner,
the sixth-seeded Henman, in a rematch of last year's semifinal. The
American, 5-0 against Henman, will again assume a villain's role in
front of a rabidly partisan audience that hasn't seen a homegrown
Wimbledon men's champion since Fred Perry in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Against Philippoussis, Sampras came away feeling like a bit of
an unintended villain. ``I mean, he was outplaying me, and I can't
sit here and feel good about it,'' Sampras said. ``It's kind of a
mixed emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman, the British No. 1, used 19 aces to thump 38th-ranked
Cedric Pioline, the only unseeded quarterfinalist, 6-4, 6-2, 4-6,
6-3, and later expressed pleasure about the opportunity to tackle
Wimbledon's incumbent champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you want to win the tournament, you also want to
beat the very best, and when you look at Pete's record here, you
know it's second to none,'' Henman said of Sampras, who has lost
just once here in the last six years and has a lifetime record of
51-5. ``I think that record is self-explanatory; he's one of the
best players, for sure, that's played this game and I've learned a
hell of a lot from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman will, weather permitting, turn from a Sampras fan to a
Sampras foe on Saturday. ``When you put it in simple-man's terms,
there are two things that are going to happen,'' the Englishman
said. ``I'm either going to win or I'm going to lose, it's as
simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Rafter, a two-time defending U.S. Open
champion who hadn't passed Wimbledon's fourth round until this
year, reached the semifinals with a run-and-gun performance against
the eighth-seeded Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Martin served for the fourth set at 5-4, but
doublefaulted. In the subsequent tiebreaker, Rafter quickly grabbed
a match point with a sweeping backhand pass and celebrated a 6-3,
6-7(5-7), 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-3) victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big milestone for me, and I want to keep it
going,'' said Rafter, who next collides with Agassi, the 1992
Wimbledon champion.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes of the Agassi-Rafter match include the No. 1 ranking
as well as a place in the Wimbledon final. Agassi is currently on a
12-match unbeaten streak that began with last month's title at the
French Open, where he became the first man to complete a career
Grand Slam since Roy Emerson did it in 1964, and just the fifth man
in his sport's history, to win all four slams. (Laver won his
second Grand Slam in 1969.) Friday, Agassi punished Kuerten, 6-3,
6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be in the semis these days and not feel good
about your game,'' said Agassi who, at 29, was the oldest of the
semifinalists. ``I'm never happy until it's over, as far as being
comfortable goes, but I felt good about the way I executed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for facing Rafter, a player he defeated here in the third
round in 1993 but who has won three of their last four meetings,
Agassi was sanguine. All except for one thing. ``It is a little
distracting playing someone with a ponytail,'' he joked.

 &HT;    Patriotism available in many flavors
 &HT;    EDS: EMBARGOED for Sunday, July 4
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Southern way to celebrate the Fourth of July is
with watermelon, barbecue, fireworks and pride. It's not a
cyber-holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In the true spirit of America, it's important to remember that
the holiday means different things to different people. Whether
you're a veteran, a historian, a patriot or just curious, the whole
idea is that your point of view is just as good as the next
person's. That may be about as close as you can get to the real
meaning of the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, let's make our first stop at a site called
Free-Market.Net's Fourth of July Features at
www.free-market.net/features/july4/. Along with some other features
that we'll discuss in a minute, there's a section where you can
record _ for others to see _ your own thoughts on the Fourth of
July.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have some hefty competition since, in that same section,
you'll be able to read what Thomas Jefferson had to say about the
Fourth. Many historians consider Jefferson the most learned of the
presidents. You can read his complete remarks, made June 24, 1826,
but in part, he said that the creation of America was: ``the signal
of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance
and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to
assume the blessings and security of self-government. That form
which we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbounded
exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or
opening, to the rights of man.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same page, you'll find patriotic images (the owners of
the site make it clear you are welcome to copy any of the images
for use on your own page), a selection of patriotic documents
including the Declaration of Independence, a list of books on
American independence and the Fourth of July, and various contests
built around a patriotic theme.
</P>
<P>
   Our next page also helps provide some context for the holiday.
It's called the American Heritage Page, located at
www.infoporium.com/heritage/. You'll find a gallery of the
presidents where biography and history on each president is
provided, as well as a section on various politicians _ a truly
diverse group ranging from Davy Crockett to Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe you want fireworks instead of politicians. If that's
the case, you'll find a page simply called Fourth of July a good
place to visit. You'll find this page at
www.netm.com/4th/index.htm. The first thing you'll see is a Java
animation of fireworks bursting in air.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if you have fireworks in mind as part of your own Fourth,
you'll find some good tips for family safety around fireworks
(although the best tip probably is to leave the fireworks to
professionals ... and to note that setting off fireworks is illegal
in many areas).
</P>
<P>
   The patriotic importance of the holiday also is covered on the
page, with everything from facts about the American flag to a copy
of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because food and picnics long have been part of the
day, you'll want to visit a page called Mr. Dell's Potato Salad.
You'll find the page at www.mrdells
</P>
<P>
   .com/s5.htm.
</P>
<P>
   With the notion that most people don't need help or a recipe to
grill hamburgers or ribs, this page provides a fine recipe for
potato salad.

 &HT;    Renewing respect, not subservience

   ATLANTA _ Old Woman: ``Hey, little girlies, have you seen my
turkey?''
</P>
<P>
   Group: ``Yes, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Woman: ``Which way did he go?''
</P>
<P>
   Group: ``So, so.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Woman: ``Will you help me find him?''
</P>
<P>
   Group: ``Yes, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Woman: ``Get ready, let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the call-and-response chant of a game we played when
I was a child. We began by choosing a leader, who was designated
the ``old woman.'' She would stand before a group of us as we stood
behind a line drawn in the sand. When she finished asking the
prescribed questions and ordered us to follow her, we all sang out
repeatedly, ``Shoo, turkey!'' and chased the leader, who magically
became the runaway bird. The person who caught her then became the
next leader, with the authority to ask the questions and direct the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   Though oblivious to it at the time, I now realize this game
incorporated fundamental manners and discipline so ingrained in our
behavior that, even in play, once one of us had been declared an
adult, the group graciously acknowledged that status with ``ma'am''
or ``sir,'' even if that adult later turned out to be a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   We had been taught at home and school to show civil deference to
all adults for no other reasons than that they were older and in
charge. Within these parameters, we enjoyed a certain freedom. We
understg three miles to a library. For that matter, I cannot
imagine, in today's world, letting them do it.
</P>
<P>
   We even had a few books at home, but not a third of what my
children have today. Unfortunately, most of them were novels that
were beyond my ability to read. We did have a full set of Rudyard
Kipling, however, which I read until the covers fell off.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best reading material around my house were the
National Geographic where I not only learned about the world, but
the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Still a third of my summers were spent at my grandmother's
house, where the only thing to read were the comic strips on the
backs of cereal boxes. I read them each about a billion times
during the course of that few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Without computers, it was a cinch that we wouldn't have computer
games. The closest thing was testing your television vacuum tubes
at the drug store. After four or five hours, that lost its thrill,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Even outdoors wasn't as good in my day. I didn't live near any

POLITICAL PARTIES STAKE OUT AGENDAS IN WAKE OF PROJECTED BUDGET
SURPLUS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pity the poor deficit hawks circling these days
over the White House and Congress, both places now giddy at the
prospect of untold riches with which to satisfy constituents either
hungry for tax cuts or new programs.
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal contrarians calling for caution can hardly get a word
in edgewise in this great debate that so many politicians here
never thought they would witness: What to do with the burgeoning
federal surplus?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, both the White House and the Congress announced new
revised budget surplus figures that projected an extra $900 billion
to $1 trillion over 15 years. The brightest scenario would mean the
federal surplus would accumulate to nearly $6 trillion by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who plans on spending these `guesses,' either on tax
cuts or spending programs, has no right to call himself either a
conservative or responsible,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas,
who has long championed fiscal restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But, the view of Stenholm and other conservative ``Blue Dog''
Democrats that Congress deal with the debt and Social Security
before committing itself to spending money it doesn't yet have,
likely will lose out. The pleas by Republican moderates that its
conservative leaders take a deep breath on tax cuts appears headed
for the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both political parties last week staked out their
agendas for the summer, and each side thinks it has a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and many Democrats want to set money aside to
save Social Security, pay off the national debt, expand Medicare
with a new prescription drug program, provide targeted tax cuts to
encourage savings, provide relief for child care and long-term
care, and increase spending for education and a handful of other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans want to set aside money for Social Security,
pay down the debt, reform Medicare, and give the rest of the money
_ an estimated $1 trillion over 10 years _ back to voters in the
form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big surpluses make all of those things possible, which is a
nightmare for fiscal conservatives,'' said Robert Bixby, policy
director of the bipartisan Concord Coalition, the budgetary
Cassandras since 1992. ``We're concerned that all you're doing is
sowing the seeds for a very big deficit down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Bixby noted the forecasts project that half of the expected $6
trillion surplus comes in the final five years, 2010 through 2014.
And, the idea that anyone can forecast that far ahead is
questionable. ``Any economist will tell you you're in a dream
world,'' Bixby said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the nation's economic boom, which has poured unexpected
billions into federal coffers, still provides an unprecedented
landscape for politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Clinton, said the surplus is
``the dramatic symbol of the transformation that Bill Clinton has
presided over. We have gone from having the largest deficit in our
history to having the largest surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renewed his call last week that America take stock of
its challenges and meet them while the strong economy enables the
government to respond. For the past couple of years, Clinton
repeatedly has cited as a moral duty tackling the systemic problems
of health care and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Clinton will tour pockets of poverty, from the
Kentucky mountains to the Mississippi Delta, from an Indian
reservation to the Watts section of Los Angeles, to highlight the
business opportunities there for corporations searching for new
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surplus is the hard-earned product of our fiscal
discipline,'' the president said last week as he announced the
revised figures. ``We should use it to prepare for the great
challenges facing our country _ caring for our parents, caring for
our children, freeing our nation from the shackles of debt so that
we can have long-term sustained economic prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives see the surplus as the hard-earned product of
too many taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is trying desperately to spend the surplus
before we have it,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who favors
returning to the taxpayers all the money not earmarked for Social
Security or Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear that either we give it back to people in
the form of tax cuts or it's spent in Washington,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that, with tax cuts, if Congress' predictions turn out
wrong the money can be recouped later. If new programs are created
they remain on the books indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm maintained Republicans are united on the tax cut issue,
but in the House, the GOP members in charge of appropriations
repeatedly have complained this year that internal spending caps
have made it impossible to adequately fund necessary government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have real conflict in the House,'' predicted
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, House Budget Committee chairman.
``Because many of us are getting tired of them (moderate
Republicans) coming into this House saying they want smaller
government and then at the same time trying to figure out how they
can break the agreement and break the caps. It's not up to the
Republicans to unilaterally disarm, and increase Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected windfall should provide the nation with an
opportunity to take stock and decide what kind of country it wants
to be as it steps into a new century.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis predicts the debate over the fiscal direction of the
nation will be a major dividing line for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Bixby has his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really sense a grand philosophical debate. What I
sense is people saying now we have a big surplus, let's go back to
what we were doing before. Republicans want big tax cuts, and
Democrats want to create new entitlement programs. It's sort of a
revert to form rather than a rethinking of the wheel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are dangerous times for a deficit hawk,'' Bixby said.

 &HT;    PORTIONS OF ATLANTIC AND GULF MAY BE CLOSED TO LONG-LINE FISHING
 &HT;    EDS: Recasts lede

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to protect migratory species such as
swordfish, shark and tuna, portions of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf
of Mexico may be closed to long-line fishermen by the end of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   How long they would be closed could vary from a month in some
places to 10 years in others. The size of the areas and length of
time for each closure will depend on how much the government wants
to reduce the excess harvesting of young fish.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been caused by American and foreign fishermen
who use lines baited with as many as 3,000 hooks that can reach up
to 30 miles and are dragged behind vessels for 12 to 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, an average of 35,000 juvenile swordfish per year are
caught and released dead. That's 30 percent of the total catch,
according to the National Coalition For Marine Conservation, an
independent conservation group. Swordfish are the most common
victims of the ``bycatch'' _ fish that are undersized, underage or
illegally caught.
</P>
<P>
   The only continuous zone being considered for closure by the
National Marine Fisheries Service would extend from Charleston,
S.C., through the Florida Keys. In addition, parts of the Gulf of
Mexico from the Florida Panhandle to Louisiana might be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lent, chief of fisheries service's division for
management of highly migratory species, said she hoped a final
determination of what areas will be closed will be made by the end
of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the fisheries service, a part of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, considered closing
an area of the Florida Straits to reduce swordfish bycatch, but
Lent said the proposed area was too small.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order make it effective, we're going to have to go for a
larger area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hinman, president of a marine conservation coalition that
has been pushing for extensive closures, said long-line fishing may
have to be banned for a long time in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to reduce the bycatch by 50 percent, then that
area might have to be closed for 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fisheries service has been revising the plan for closures
since it began public hearings last October.
</P>
<P>
   A 21,000-square-mile area off the coast of New Jersey was closed
for the entire month of June in order to protect undersized bluefin
tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, long-line fishermen are working on a proposal to get
the federal government to buy them out.
</P>
<P>
   Since last November, the Blue Water Fisherman's Association,
which represents Atlantic long-line fishermen, has been working
with Sen. John Breaux, D-La., on a $15 million voluntary government
buyout of between 47 to 60 commercial vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Although no legislation has been introduced, Breaux said in a
statement, ``I have strongly encouraged the commercial and
recreational fishing groups to work together to find a common,
scientifically justified solution to reducing the bycatch of
juvenile swordfish and billfish in these fisheries while
recognizing very important economic issues for the fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. commercial fishermen argue that they are being
penalized for overharvesting by other countries. If U.S. waters are
going to be closed, they say, it's only fair for the government to
buy them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are offering voluntary buyouts for these boats,'' said
Nelson Beideman, executive director of the fishermen's association.
``This is long-term. We need to get this in the national arena so
it could eventually impact international fishermen who are
over-harvesting and catching these bycatch species.''
</P>
<P>
   Beideman said the ``bad players'' in long-lining are other
countries _ particularly Taiwan and Spain _ that haven't adhered to
quotas set up by the International Commission for Atlantic Tunas, a
25-member council that meets once a year and allocates specific
catch limits to each country.
</P>
<P>
   Hinman, of the conservation coalition, said he wants to see the
conservation plan implemented before buyouts are authorized.

alt.fan.monty-python it's nothing special, just a typical day on
the Web discussion board that's devoted to the silliest group of
Britwits ever assembled: Monty Python's Flying Circus.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about this 30-year-old comedy troupe (the brainchild
of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry
Jones and Michael Palin) that continues to attract _ and encourage
_ nonsensical behavior?
</P>
<P>
   What causes these seemingly normal people to spend hours online,
engaged in heated Dadaesque debates on things like ``the
differences between African and European swallows,'' or ``the pros
and cons of Spam''? Is it just the sheer silliness?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Silliness, it seems, knows no era or boundaries. But to
dismiss Python fans as a bunch of people goofing around is too easy
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many other silly TV shows throughout history,
from ``Green Acres'' to ``Seinfeld,'' but none of them has inspired
the same manic, cultish hold that Monty Python exerts over its
fans. So, if it's not strictly the silliness, then what is it?
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, there was a popular expression that went
``The revolution will not be televised.'' Well, little did we know
then, but not only was the revolution televised, it was called
Monty Python's Flying Circus.
</P>
<P>
   To the wizened Python fan, the series is more than just a funny
sketch program. It represents a social and cultural revolution as
important as the advent of Beatlemania. To these fans, Python did
more than make jokes about dead parrots, funny walks and
lumberjacks. It was an insurrection that came to us disguised as a
television comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Python was subversive, a ``revolution in the head'' that
forever changed the way its fans viewed the world and their place
in it. Sure, Monty Python made us laugh, but it also made us think
and then question; question society, ourselves, why we laugh and
what we laugh at. Monty Python was more than just funny, it was
dangerous because it attacked ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The following is a brief example of Python's power to provoke
while still tickling our funny bone. The setting is a darkened and
somber television studio dressed for what appears to be a religious
discussion program.
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer, played by John Cleese, sits with a monsignor in
full clerical garb with skull-cap. Opposite him sits a
tweed-suited, old Oxford don figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good evening, and welcome once again to the Epilogue,'' Cleese
says. ``On the program this evening we have Monsignor Edward Gay,
visiting pastoral emissary of the Somerset Theological College and
author of a number of books about belief, the most recent of which
is the best-seller, `My God.' Opposite him we have Dr. Tom Jack:
humanist, broadcaster, lecturer and author of the book, `Hello
Sailor.' Tonight, instead of discussing the existence or
nonexistence of God _ they have decided to fight for it.'' (Stage
lights come up, curtains open. A wrestling ring is in the
background.)
</P>
<P>
   Though the idea of two religious figures fighting to prove the
existence, or nonexistence, of God appears on the surface to be
simply a silly sketch, Terry Jones (Python writer/actor and a
well-respected medieval historian) once pointed out that it was
this same basic principle that was the idea behind the Crusades.
Silly? You decide.
</P>
<P>
   Like many fans, I first became aware of the power of Python in
1974, when PBS began broadcasting the television series. Never
before had I seen a show so willing to take chances and push at the
boundaries of convention.
</P>
<P>
   Like that scene in ``The Wizard of Oz'' where Dorothy steps from
her bleak black-and-white world into the Technicolor tapestry of
Oz, Monty Python was a revelation. Monty Python not only colored my
world view, it cemented my budding desire of becoming a writer. (I
was later fortunate to meet and befriend many of its cast members,
and was privileged to briefly be writing partners with the late
Graham Chapman.)
</P>
<P>
   Now here it is some 25 years after my initial introduction to
Python, and 30 years after the show's formation. After all this
time, after shows like ``South Park'' and ``Beavis and Butthead,''
there has yet to be a show that is as radical, as ``completely
different,'' as Monty Python's Flying Circus.
</P>

Archives, author of the new book ``The Non-Inflatable Monty Python

MOSCOW ROASTS UNDER RECORD HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Forest fires marching on Moscow, gloomy forecasts for
the harvest, and a rapidly mounting death toll in the waterways
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   These are the bitter fruits of the best summer weather in memory
in Moscow, where a month of record-breaking hot and dry weather has
wrought havoc in this normally chilly northern clime.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the Russian capital have approached 90 nearly
every day for almost a month. New Englanders, suffering through a
heat wave of their own, may think this is nothing to write home
about. But consider that June was the hottest month in Moscow since
Russia started keeping such records 118 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been one of the deadliest for swimmers who have
flocked to the city's swimming holes to beat the heat. Police said
140 people drowned in Moscow last month, just 10 fewer than the
death toll for all of last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually arid weather has helped create a fire hazard
unseen here in years. Hundreds of acres of woodlands outside Moscow
are burning uncontrollably, with over 50 new blazes each day. Most
of the fires are in areas with large peat bogs, which are hard to
extinguish. No matter how much water firefighters pour on the
blazes, the peat quickly dries out and begins burning again in the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Rubtsov, fire chief of the region surrounding Moscow,
said his troops were lacked equipment and manpower to put out the
blazes and were concentrating on keeping them from consuming
villages. Even that is not always possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to stop it'' from spreading to a local
settlement, ``but we are running out of water,'' Lieutenant Renat
Kirillov, in charge of firefighters battling a blaze in a region
southeast of Moscow, told NTV television as thick smoke billowed
behind him. ``We need about two weeks of rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts indicate he will not get it. July promises to be only
slightly cooler, and while there will be some rain, the hot and dry
pattern is expected to persist.
</P>
<P>
   That is bad news for Russia's farmers, who are facing a second
poor harvest in as many years. Russian agricultural officials are
predicting a disappointing 55 million tons of grain, a tad better
than last year's disastrous crop, but far less than the 70 tons
they had hoped for. Crops were dealt a one-two punch by
unseasonably cold temperatures in late spring _ it snowed in Moscow
on May 15 _ and now the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Beleaguered Muscovites, no fans of prolonged stretches of hot
weather even without the fatalities and other bad news, have
struggled to explain the unusual heat and the grim news it has
brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is a geo-magnetic disorder,'' said Olga
Nikolayeva, a former aerospace engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific explanation,'' commented the popular
daily Moskovsky Komsomolets on this week. ``There is nothing left
to do but look for some paranormal phenomenom.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the deaths and fires are concerned, carelessness
appears to be a more likely factor. Firefighters say 90 percent of
the fires are started by picnickers who forget to put out their
campfires. Police say alcohol is involved in most of the drownings,
many of which have been registered in areas not designated safe for
swimming. Muscovites frequently disregard ``no swimming'' signs and
plunge into ponds and rivers around the city that are unguarded,
polluted, or otherwise unfit for bathing.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have warned that children, elderly, and people
with heart troubles ought to stay out of the heat. Gennady
Osipenko, Russia's first deputy health minister, called the
situation ``extreme,'' and while he denied press reports of an
increase in strokes and heat-related illnesses, he said ``we can
expect unpleasant things.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to say everyone is unhappy about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this rate, who needs southern France?'' asked Marina
Serova, a topless sunbather in a hilly park in a western Moscow
suburb. It is not unheard-of for Muscovites in secluded parks like
this one to bare all in their bid to catch a few rays, and Serova
was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Others are profiting from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My business, it goes without saying, is booming,'' remarked
Vladimir Kovalyov, who sells air conditioning.

 &HT;    Clinton to give Miller foreign investment post
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton plans to nominate former Gov. Zell
Miller to serve on the board of the Overseas Private Investment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment to OPIC's 15-member board is the first offer
from Clinton that Miller has accepted. Before Miller left office in
January, the Clinton administration had offered to name him
secretary of the Navy, according to U.S. Sen. Max Cleland, who
serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The OPIC appointment was attractive to Miller because it will
not require him to move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like working in public-private partnerships,'' Miller said.
``I can't confirm (the appointment), but it is the kind of
public-private partnership that appeals to me. OPIC is one of the
best examples of a public-private partnership in the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   OPIC encourages economic growth in developing countries and
emerging markets by financing and protecting U.S. investment
overseas. OPIC has accumulated reserves of more than $3 billion and
has supported investments worth nearly $112 billion in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first one that the governor has bit on,'' Cleland
said. ``It's wonderful news for Georgia because Georgia has more
and more companies that want to invest overseas. I will be glad to
lead the nomination, and we hope to get the governor confirmed in
record time.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House refused to comment on reports of the job offer.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, one of the first of the nation's governors to strongly
support Clinton's presidential aspirations, played a key role in
getting the Arkansas governor elected to the White House. Georgia
was the first state to deliver a Clinton victory during the
Democratic primaries in 1992. Miller also delivered the keynote
address at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, which nominated
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The OPIC appointment finally gets Miller officially working in
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton feels so strongly about Zell as a public
servant and someone who has helped him so much, he wanted to have
him on his team,'' Cleland said. ``Governor Miller has declined
other offers. I think now the president and the governor have found
a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton almost had found a match when he offered Miller the post
of Navy secretary. Miller, a former Marine, has told friends the
Navy post appealed to him. He had also been mentioned as a possible
secretary of Education, a post that would have allowed him to draw
on his experience as a college professor and his work with HOPE
scholarships and pre-kindergarten programs.

MILITARY HISTORIAN PUTS VIVID CAST ON WORLD WAR I 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During World War II, John Keegan and his family were evacuated
from London to Taunton in the western English countryside. While
German bombs fell on London, he grew up listening to stories about
his father's service in World War I. ``He was a very gentle person,
a most unlikely soldier,'' Keegan said in an interview, ``but it
was the most important experience of his life.'' And hearing about
it became one of the most important experiences of his son's life.
</P>
<P>
   There never was a possibility that Keegan might one day find
himself in battle. A bout with tuberculosis in his teen-age years
left him partly lame, disqualifying him for the military. Now 65,
he says he has never regretted not being a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a child of the war and I was fascinated by it,'' he
said. ``I took a tremendous interest in what was going on around me
and was old enough to read news magazines.'' Later, after studying
military history at Oxford University and teaching at the Royal
Military Academy at Sandhurst, he followed a natural course and
became a military historian.
</P>
<P>
   For years he has been considered one of the best, a master of
war and military tactics. With his 14 books and his experience as a
military correspondent of The Daily Telegraph in London, he has
devoted his life to the single subject of war.
</P>
<P>
   His 1976 book, ``The Face of Battle,'' which focused on the
common soldier and the common officer, is a cornerstone of military
history. In his other works he has analyzed conflicts from the U.S.
Civil War to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his new book, ``The First World War,'' which has
received enthusiastic reviews, he deals in depth with an event that
has recently become an object of greater public attention in novels
as well as in nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First World War was a tragic and unnecessary conflict'' he
writes. It ``ended the lives of 10 million human beings, tortured
the emotional lives of millions more, destroyed the benevolent and
optimistic culture of the European conflict'' and led directly to
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, he said during a recent visit to New York,
``Bolshevism and Fascism would have been minor movements,'' and
``Hitler might have lived out his life as a Viennese dropout.''
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Keegan's work from that of other historians
is that he has approached his subject not as an academic but more
as an investigative journalist, one with a novelist's eye for
conjuring the atmosphere and immediacy of men in battle. ``The
First World War'' is a vivid, step-by-step account with, in typical
Keegan fashion, a strong sense of narrative. If the book seems to
the reader like reliving the war, it was even more disturbing for
the author to write.
</P>
<P>
   As it came time to write about each skirmish, he was always
aware of the approaching loss of life. He said that he would think
to himself, ``Here come another 200,000 casualties.'' This was
particularly true when he reached the battle of Passendale in
Belgium. In his book, he calls this 1917 clash ``the most notorious
land campaign'' of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly what was coming up,'' he explained as he sipped
a glass of bourbon at his Manhattan hotel. The rugged looking
writer speaks with the self-assurance of a television commentator.
``It was a dreadful battle because it was fought in West Flanders,
very near the sea. More than three years of shelling had destroyed
the drainage system. So when it rained, and it rained heavily in
the fall of 1917, the ground became a swamp. You get these awful
descriptions of men plodding forward up to their thighs in mud. The
soldiers get hit, they fall down and they drown in mud.'' Nearly
70,000 British soldiers died in that battle and 170,000 were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Although Keegan writes with astonishing immediacy, he confessed
in ``The Face of Battle'' that his was an outsider's view of war:
he had very little idea of what it was like to be on the front
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several wars and many books later, does he still feel that
way?
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it must be worse than my imagination suggested,''
he said. In his work for The Telegraph he has occasionally been
near battles, once in Lebanon, another time on maneuvers on the
U.S. battleship Missouri. More often he has visited battlefields of
the past, a necessary part of his research. He has been everywhere
from Gettysburg to Gallipoli, hoping to find something unexpected.
For example, he was surprised to discover the smallness of
Gallipoli: so much fighting in so limited a space.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan says that many of his early images of war came from films
and novels. One of his criticisms of Stanley Kubrick's World war I
movie ``Paths of Glory'' is that the film was ``too neat and
tidy.'' In contrast, he said, ``the first half-hour of `Saving
Private Ryan' is the most terrifying, realistic thing ever done in
the cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fictional representations of battle, one of his
favorites is ``A Farewell to Arms'': ``It is an absolutely
marvelous book. Professional historians who read it can't shake off
the influence.''
</P>
<P>
   His new book paints detailed portraits of men at war. One of the
most intriguing characters is British general Douglas Haig, who
managed to ignore the casualties and ``to be untouched by the
suffering.'' ``He was a strange man, a very cold fish,'' Keegan
said. ``A good general but a defective person.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan wrote his book at his home in a farming village in
Wiltshire, a calm, bucolic environment. Nevertheless, he had to
fight his own depression and ``overcome a series of emotional
barriers'' as he wrote about such horrendous events. But he pushed
on, always keeping his equilibrium about his research. ``Dr.
Johnson said the writing of history only involves powers of the
lower imagination. Its demands are much less than those made by
lyric poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of his books has been preoccupied with a central theme. He
wrote ``about groups of men'' in ``Six Armies in Normandy'' (1982)
and about generals in ``The Mask of Command'' (1987). Then he moved
from naval history to ``The History of Warfare'' (1993) and ``The
Second World War'' (1990), which was pegged to the 50th anniversary
of that conflict. He viewed that war as ``a great morality play, a
story of good against evil which isn't true at all about the First
World War.''

AFTER YEARS OF STRIFE, MUSLIMS CAN LIVE OPENLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina _ Early in each broiling day,
late into each cool night, the calls-to-prayer of the muezzim echo
across the city with an intensity that is noticeably greater now
than in the years before ethnic warfare reshaped Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets outside the mosques, far more women wear
traditional Muslim dress than when Bosnia was an ethnically
integrated place. But, perhaps of equal import, they often are
arm-in-arm with friends in sharp European fashion _ clothes which
would not pass the modesty test in many Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
   Here no one blinks, save admiring young men.
</P>
<P>
   Three years of bitter fighting against Orthodox Christian Serbs
and Roman Catholic Croats has electrified the consciousness of
Bosnia's Muslims, who after nearly a century of repression now have
a rare chance to freely express their religion and culture.
</P>
<P>
   How they do it will be important not just for their futures
here, but also for prospects for peace and reconcilliation
throughout the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   If they become insular, alienated, or more orthodox, the dream
of foreigners and former Yugoslavians to restore a multi-ethnic
society in the region is likely doomed. If, despite all the Bosnian
Muslims have suffered, they continue to embrace Europe as well as
Islam, they could create in Sarajevo the new capital of the
Balkans, a city untainted by the nationalistic histories and
animosities of Belgrade and Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolerance and reconciliation are favored words
internationally,'' says Raisu-L-Ulama Mustafa Ceric, Islam's
leading scholar-priest in the Balkans. ``We need more than that.
First we need understanding and acceptance of each other as we
are.'' He stresses the last three words, and uses them often.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, the basics of Bosnian Muslim identity have
changed as a result of the war, in which Serbia and Croatia tried
to divide Bosnia between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, ``Muslims were the most indifferent of the
religions, the most open to other communities,'' says Seid Smaikic,
the mufti of Herzegovina, a southern part of the country which
still is bitterly contested between Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got nothing for giving up our identity, for the mixed
marriages, for all the efforts of the Muslim community to meet the
others half way,'' Smaikic says. ``We gained nothing in their eyes.
It came to the point where you had to say `I am what I am' and
return to your own religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Klein, a Franco-American diplomat active in postwar
reconciliation efforts both in Bosnia and Croatia, says before the
war Muslim faith was ``a thin veneer. People ate pork, drank,
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war made them think `Why are we being killed here?' So
they asked for help, and the Arabs and Persians saw an opening to
build a foothold into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The awakening of a more-heartfelt identity and the offers of
assistance from the Islamic world both had the potential to change
profoundly the focus of Bosnian Muslims. But the foreign alliances
did not take, and the religious resurgence seems entirely moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand Afghans, Libyans, and other would-be holy
warriors showed up, and some film footage from the war shows them
leading charges into almost-certain death. But they could not
inspite the local Muslims to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Funds still flow from some Arab states to Muslim units of the
Muslim-Croat army, much as Croatia supports Croat units; the
massive support for schools and mosques also is coming in,
principally from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The funds for support of religious institutions are refurbishing
buildings and reviving communities devastated in the war but, as in
the case of the military aid, they are not changing Bosnia's
Muslims deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has no right to prescribe how one will dress,'' says
Ceric, whose wife wears traditional Muslim clothes and whose
daughter does not. ``Neither will we be prescribed to by some
circle in Iran. The principle in the Koran is there is no
compulsion in religion. But also there is no compulsion in
secularization.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermann F. Eilts, a Boston University specialist on the Middle
East and Islam, says such independence of thinking and practice,
along with their ethnic roots and geographical location, combine to
keep Bosnia's Muslims on the periphery of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sympathy for them, but they don't really fit into the
mainstream,'' says Eilts. ``First they are Slavs'' whose ancestors
converted to Islam during the 500-year rule of the Ottoman Turks in
Bosnia. ``Second, they are often lumped together with all the rest
of Europe as past of the `Crusader experience.' There is suspicion
of them, and of the Kosovars, because they don't follow the dress
codes and religious practices'' strictly enough.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims also have been
viewed with suspicion by European leaders because of their
religion, a reality that Serb abnd Croat politicians have sometimes
used effectively against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe (the late French President Francois) Mitterand is
suffering in hell now for what happened in Bosnia,'' Ceric says. He
and other leaders of Western Europe in the early 1990s were ``only
too willing to believe (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic
telling them that we were fundamentalists, and that he would finish
the job (of repression) quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the war almost four years in the past and many parts of
Bosnia are humming with reconstruction activity, Muslims are
sharply divided in their understanding of the current state of
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In Mostar, in the south, there are separate universities,
electric companies, water companies _ everything between Croats and
Muslims is separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't even have a soccer match without it being a political
question,'' says Mufti Smaikic, whose whitewashed office in an
restored riverside mosque is decorated with sumptuous carved woods
and beautiful, pastel-tinted caligraphy donated by foreign Muslims.
``All this was destroyed during the war,'' he says. ``The
aggressors were trying to destroy our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, the Muslim perception is that the Croats ``want
the European Union, the West, to tire of this, and pull out. Then,
they think, they will take over... and the Muslims will
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ceric, the leading Muslim of the whole region, says the
trends are positive for his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of dividing Bosnia between Serbs and Croats is
still there, but it is weaker now than a year ago, and it will be
weaker still a year from now,'' he says. ``These forces are
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites a host of developments, such as the rebuilding of
mosques in Banja Luka and the return of Muslims to Prijedor, as
signs that ``the prospects are better.''
</P>
<P>
   But most important, he says, upcoming generations will be better
able than their parents and grandparents to understand the unique
position of Bosnia's Muslims, and accept it as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust more the young people than the old ones,'' Ceric says.
Based on their experience in this war, ``generally speaking, this
younger generation understand that they have one foot in the
European circle and one in the Islamic circle. They won't give up
either.''

 UNDATED: World War.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He continued, ``We may not have gone into the Second World War
for moral reasons, but overridingly toward the end it became a war
of moral imperative.'' He said he was convinced that were it not
for World War I, there might not have been World War II. And at
various times in the first war, he said, if either side had
demonstrated ``a willingness to stand down, they could have stopped
the crisis.''
</P>

   ``The war interrupted and in many ways destroyed one of the most
creative periods in European life,'' he continued. ``It didn't have
the same effect on the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   His book is filled with odd but relevant details. For example,
he notes that the use of the steel helmet in World War I was the
first reversion to armor since the 17th century. At the same time,
there was an abundant use of horses, one for every three men:
``Horse fodder was the single largest item shipped to the British
Army in France.'' One of the great advantages of gasoline is that
``it's much more compact than hay and oats.''
</P>
<P>
   Two enemies, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Czar Nicholas II, were
cousins who spoke to each other in English. When war broke out, he
said, ``it was the collapse of their professional world: they bade
farewell to each other with tears running down their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the use of trenches prolonged the campaign by
setting up a permanent line of defense. While the English and
French suffered privations in trenches, the Germans comfortably
settled into them and in some cases brought in furniture and
electricity and made them seem like homes at the front. ``The only
moment when either side could have hoped to win a quick outright
victory was right at the beginning, in the first month or two. Once
they started digging those trenches, they were in for a long war.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, tanks _ a new weapon _ shortened the war. It
is remarkable, he said, how quickly tanks went from conception to
reality, in contrast to Tomahawk cruise missiles, which were 20
years in conception. ``The Germans tried to make a tank, but it was
a very bad one. They thought other factors like command were more
important, that intellect could battle the opponent.'' Disagreeing,
Keegan said, ``Ultimately, technology is decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if war was an art, he said, ``Boxing can be elegant, but
when one or both fighters decide to go for the knockout, then
there's nothing elegant or artistic about it. When two armies
mutually decide to go for a knockout, it's brute force and
willpower.'' But, as he believes, in certain cases war, at least a
limited war, is a necessity: ``Sometimes you have to fight, however
reluctant you may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan has vigorously objected to Clausewitz's conviction that
war is a continuation of political relations by other means. For
him, war and politics are distinct and separate. As he once wrote,
``Politics must continue, war cannot.'' By that he means world
wars. In that sense, his study of the bloodiness of the past has
made him more sanguine about the future: ``We're not going to have
wars like the First or Second World War.''

HISTORY AND TIGERS AND THE 4TH, OH MY! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Bullwinkle used to say, there's nothing up my sleeve. But
just watch how I weave the Declaration of Independence and a bunch
of Siberian tigers into the same column.
</P>
<P>
   The act of a desperate critic during TV's annual summer swoon,
you say? Perhaps. But even if they're as dissimilar as moose and
squirrel, ``The Declaration of Independence'' and ``In the Shadow
of the Tiger'' do share a dubious distinction: a Saturday night
time slot on a holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the kiss of death in programming circles. That
would be Sunday at, say, 10 a.m. But let's call it the kiss of a
near-death experience, which actually might be appropriate for
Christina and Joseph Pontecorvo. The Seattle-based filmmakers are
the producers of ``In the Shadow of the Tiger,'' airing as part of
Discovery Channel's ``Wild Discovery'' series. The documentary
required three trips to the Russian Far East, and at least one
encounter with a not-too-happy Siberian tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tiger was ensnared (so it could be fitted with a
signal-transmitting collar), a filmmaker usually has one or two
what-the-heck-am-I-doing-here moments before the animal is
tranquilized. For the Pontecorvos, it was when they and a couple of
scientists working with the University of Idaho's Hornocker
Wildlife Institute approached the slightly annoyed tiger and really
got its fight-or-flight juices going.
</P>
<P>
   With only two toes caught in the cable snare, the tiger lunged
left, then right, and then directly at the camera Joseph Pontecorvo
was holding a few yards away. Happy to report the cable held fast,
and the Pontecorvos succeeded in completing their first
documentary. As nature specials go, it's fairly standard stuff. Not
exactly in the National Geographic stratum, but worthy of an animal
lover's attention. Even though a disclaimer at the end mentions
that some of the actual tiger footage was obtained at a breeding
enclosure and not in the wild, Joseph Pontecorvo's camera work is
arresting and exceptionally well lit. The writing, for which both
Pontecorvos take credit, is not as scintillating, leaning more to
the cliched than to the adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hourlong film, narrated by actor Peter Coyote, nobly
takes viewers into a little-known environment where a few hundred
magnificent animals are struggling to keep going while the world
around them keeps putting up stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   For a much less esoteric topic, The History Channel uses old
movie clips, unexpected background music and those now-familiar
``dramatic re-creations'' to keep people awake through a one-hour
look at the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   This entry in the ``Save Our History'' initiative will probably
satisfy history buffs and trivia freaks, but the casual channel
surfer may have a hard time staying glued to it. Harry Smith
narrates in between the offerings of talking-head historians who
enthusiastically share what they know about the declaration, but
it's about 30 minutes more than this history lover could handle
without a nap.
</P>
<P>
   The ``original'' Declaration doesn't exist, or at least it
hasn't shown up yet on ``Antiques Roadshow.'' The manuscript
ratified on July 4, 1776, from which a Philadelphia printer typeset
150 ``broadsides,'' has never surfaced, though 25 of the parchment
broadsides still exist in various museum and library collections.
Meanwhile, the handwritten parchment copy hanging in the National
Archives is a facsimile ordered by the Second Continental Congress
on July 19, 1776, and signed by 56 delegates on or after Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing they stayed with the Fourth of July for the holiday.
Celebrating the Second of August just doesn't have the same oomph.
Besides, it's too close to Labor Day.

<P>
   The stock market's turn from big growth stocks to smaller issues
and value stocks in the second quarter was good news for investors
with diversified portfolios, including the five money managers who
assembled hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has been a largely
unbeatable benchmark for several years. But this quarter, three
managers beat the index, which rose 7.06 percent, and ther other
two did not miss by much. In comparison, the average diversified
domestic equity fund tracked by Lipper Inc. rose 10.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The winner for the quarter was Eric M. Kobren, president of
Kobren Insight Group and editor of Fidelity Insight in Wellesley,
Mass., with a return of 12.74 percent. His portfolio of
all-Fidelity funds excelled because of big stakes in Fidelity Small
Cap Stock, which rose 18.38 percent, and Fidelity Value, a new
addition, up 25.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversification does make sense, exactly for periods like last
quarter, when we saw some of last year's biggest laggards come to
life,'' Kobren said. ``That's why we don't rely on short-term past
performance to guide us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobren credits much of his winning performance to his shift last
quarter out of Fidelity Spartan Government Income, a bond fund, and
into Fidelity Value, a stock fund. ``I'm still a believer in active
fund management,'' he said, ``but there's little doubt that asset
and investment style allocation will determine most of your
portfolio returns.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans no changes to his portfolio. ``Going forward, I
wouldn't expect the deep cyclicals that moved so quickly so far to
dominate uninterrupted,'' he said. ``But I do think they could
continue to be market leaders through the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each
quarter by Lipper Inc. of Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges,
transaction costs and taxes, because most retirement money is held
in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any funds
open to new investors and can shift money quarterly. From the
outset of the competition, in July 1993, the managers were asked to
pick portfolios intended to grow for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-load Fund Investor in
Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers
with a gain of 157.94 percent since the contest began. In that
time, the five managers' portfolios have risen an average of 132.25
percent, compared with a 250.66 percent return for the Vanguard 500
Index fund, which mimics the performance of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Harold R. Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla.,
took second place in the quarter, with a gain of 11.63 percent.
``As is so frequently the case, the gurus who have recently
counseled that all is for naught except large-cap domestic growth
stocks timed it wrong,'' he said. ``Diversification hasn't died _
at least not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Evensky is making only one change _ to replace Barr Rosenberg
Market Neutral, which was 11 percent of his portfolio and has
turned in disappointing results since he bought it in December
1997. ``Although I'm a patient investor, recent performance has
been not only disappointing but inexplicable,'' he said. ``I
obviously made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proceeds, he is putting 7 percent of the portfolio into
Vanguard 500 Index and adding the remaining 4 percent to his
position in Vanguard Value Index.
</P>
<P>
   A well-diversified portfolio also helped Susan Dziubinski, who
edits the Morningstar Fund Investor. She took third place for the
quarter, with a gain of 10.75 percent, helped by her strong
overseas holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest winner wass Liberty Newport Tiger, which invests in
Asia's smaller markets; it returned 28.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dziubinski is replacing the Yacktman fund, which has
underperformed its mid-cap blend peers for three years, and adding
the proceeds to T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth.
</P>
<P>
   She is staying with mid-cap stocks, she said, because they
``have less volatility than small-caps but tend to do well when
small-caps do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who took first place in the first quarter on the
strength of his big domestic holdings, tumbled into fourth place
for the second quarter, with a gain of 6.96 percent. But he plans
no changes to the domestic holdings in his portfolio, half of which
is invested in Vanguard 500 Index and the Vanguard Total Stock
Market Index.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two index funds include value stocks, and we do have some
small-stock representation,'' he said, adding that Baron Growth
(formerly Baron Growth and Income) was now focusing more on smaller
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But he is reshuffling his international holdings. He is reducing
his 10 percent position in T. Rowe Price European Stock to 7.5
percent, is eliminating his 5 percent position in Montgomery
International Growth and is buying Strong Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international portion had been overweighted in Europe
because the Pacific had not been doing well, but things have
changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Strong Asia Pacific because one-quarter of its stocks
are in Japan and the balance are in other parts of Asia. Most other
Asia-Pacific funds invest predominantly in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who advocates
``socially responsible'' investing, took last place for the
quarter, with a gain of 6.16 percent in his portfolio of mostly
mid- to large-cap stocks. To increase his stake in smaller stocks,
he is selling Bridgeway Social Responsibility, a large-cap fund
that was 10 percent of his portfolio, and putting most of the
proceeds into two funds that own smaller stocks: 5 percent to Ariel
Appreciation and 3 percent to Citizens Emerging Growth.
</P>
<P>
   He is adding the remaining 2 percent to Pax World, a balanced
fund, to build up the defensive part of his portfolio. ``Today's
market is so volatile that adding a bit of bonds will protect the
overall portfolio,'' Brill said.

PROBE FINDS SECURITY BREAKDOWNS AT LIVERMORE LAB 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Months after allegations of Chinese espionage at
America's nuclear laboratories, foreign scientists without security
clearances continued to have access to the main computer at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, according to an Energy
Department investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation's findings, parts of which were released
Friday, also said that Livermore scientists may have mistakenly
placed classified nuclear information on that computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown in security at the lab in Livermore, Calif., was
uncovered by an investigative team from the new office of security
oversight set up by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in response to
allegations of Chinese spying at Livermore and at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The DOE team discovered the lax security in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Along with discovering weaknesses in computer security, the
investigation also found that the lab failed to properly protect
nuclear materials and was inadequately prepared in the event of a
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   The team's findings were presented Thursday night in a
classified briefing to members of the House Commerce Committee,
which plans to conduct its own review of the nation's nuclear
weapons research complex.
</P>
<P>
   The special DOE audit found that foreign scientists working with
the lab but based abroad could dial-up the Livermore computer
system even though they lacked security clearances, according to
Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley said the department also found that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Livermore scientists may have mistakenly placed classified
nuclear information on that computer system.
</P>
<P>
   _ The department had failed to adequately monitor e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ The lab's security forces did not have an adequate plan to
counter potential attacks by terrorists. Reaction time was slow and
not all ``pathways'' for potential access were adequately covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people should know that their nuclear secrets are
not yet safe and secure,'' Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation raised ``serious doubts'' about the
quality of day-to-day management and oversight of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Energy Department owns the Livermore facility, the
University of California manages it under contract to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not take an inspection by the Energy Department's
independent oversight office to find some of these serious security
problems,'' Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley and other key Republicans have expressed skepticism that
Richardson can solve the department's counterintelligence and
security problems without the creation of a semiautonomous agency
within the Energy Department to oversee all aspects of its nuclear
program. Richardson has strongly resisted such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about security at nuclear weapons facilities arose in
March as details from a congressional investigation began to
surface describing the loss of nuclear secrets to China in the
1980s and into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy intensified after Richardson directed the firing
of a scientist at the Los Alamos lab in early March after he had
been under investigation for possible espionage since 1996. The
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been charged with any crime and has
denied giving nuclear secrets to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's security review at Livermore was
conducted by inspectors from the new Office of Security Oversight.
Similar inspections will be made at the Los Alamos and Sandia labs
in New Mexico in the coming weeks, department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to conducting top-secret nuclear weapons research,
the Livermore lab also has nuclear weapons material on site.

PASSIONS' CREATOR IS VETERAN OF DAYTIME DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(For release Sunday, July 4 or thereafter)  
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The idea of setting a soap opera in history-rich
New England had been rattling around in soap guru James E. Reilly's
mind for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   There'd be all that atmosphere to draw on _ white churches with
steeples, town squares, spooky graveyards, the fall colors. The
characters could range from the haves and the have-nots to the
wanna-bes and the never-will-bes, with a few off-center townsfolk
thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   And Reilly being Reilly (he was ``Days of Our Lives''' head
writer when Marlena, possessed by the devil, burned the town church
and levitated above her bed), he might also throw in a touch _ or
more _ of the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born ``Passions,'' NBC's newest soap opera, which
debuts Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 20 years in daytime (TV), without realizing it, I was
probably making mental notes for this,'' said Reilly, who moved
from New York to Los Angeles to supervise the first year's
production for the new show, which films in Studio City. Location
scenes will be shot in Camden, Maine, and in the Fisherman's
Village waterfront area of Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard. For a
few initial scenes, three actors and a camera crew went all the way
to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ```Passions' is going to be a classic soap that's been
repackaged for the next millennium,'' Reilly promised. ``It's going
to be about family, and it's going to be romantic. And it's going
to have lots of secrets; secrets provide surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, it's serene and calm, like the swans swimming
on the town pond. But underneath, it's totally different, as it is
in any small town.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has given Reilly _ who over the past two decades has either
been head writer or part of a writing team on eight soap operas on
all three major networks _ unprecedented say in getting the new
soap off the ground. He's been the man behind everything from
choosing the locale to selecting the music for the opening credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only things I haven't had anything to do with are
makeup and costumes,'' Reilly said with a laugh. ``But I've lived
with this (show) in my head for so long. I tend to visualize my
scenes. I have to have a working model in my head. I will close my
eyes and I will see these characters coming in to a restaurant, so
the restaurant must have a certain look.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual to give a series creator/head writer that kind of
power. But this !ital!is!off! the script doctor who's turned a
half-dozen flagging series around, luring new viewers with one
outrageous plot turn after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NBC has complete confidence in Jim,'' said
``Passions'' executive producer Lisa Hesser, who sees herself as a
facilitator, a sort of operations manager to make Reilly's tales
come alive on screen. ``He has a proven track record, and I think
any network would have loved to have him come and tell his story
there. The key to a successful soap is a singular vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Reilly's most important decisions, besides locale, have
been naming the series and casting 22 contract players, plus actors
to play recurring characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name `Passions' came to me literally at the last minute,''
he said. ``Finally, I asked myself, `What basically is happening on
this show?' If you had to put it down to one word, it really
!ital!is!off! passions of all kinds _ love, hate, life, hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Unwittingly, Reilly scored a major casting coup: He hired Liza
Huber, 23-year-old daughter of soap diva Susan Lucci (``All My
Children's'' Erica Kane), to play socialite Gwen Hotchkiss, whose
boyfriend happens to be the heir to the town's old-money fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Huber was one of a slew of actresses who auditioned, and ``she
fit the character best,'' Reilly said. ``I didn't know she was
Susan Lucci's daughter until after she was hired.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's glad to have her aboard. In addition to having
impeccable credentials _ a degree in film production from the
University of North Carolina, acting studies at the Lee Strasberg
Theatre Institute in New York and rave reviews in her off-Broadway
debut in ``Four Dogs and a Bone'' last fall _ Huber has grown up
around soap operas and knows the grueling work that's involved,
Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Huber said she's thrilled to have a sizable role on the new
soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never would have hired me if they didn't like my work,
but to know I got it on my own is wonderful,'' Huber said. The work
has been nonstop so far, ``but I've grown up on sets, seeing how
busy it is, so I have no trouble with that. And I love it. I
!ital!love!off! it! It's like doing a play a day. It's quick, but
we're trying to get in as much rehearsal as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   While Huber's famous mom is overjoyed to see her offspring snag
a prime soap role, she's staying in the background so her daughter
can shine on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only advice she gave me is what you'd expect: Be honest
with (delivering) your lines, be gracious to the people you work
with, be professional, and do your best,'' Huber said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Huber, most of the new soap's cast members are relative
unknowns. But Reilly hired a veteran actress _ Emmy winner Juliet
Mills, who starred in the early 1970s prime-time series ``Nanny and
the Professor'' _ for a pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might consider Mills' character, Tabitha Lenox, a
witch. Reilly describes her as ``the town oddity. All I can say is
she's someone who manages to do things that other people can't ...
Of course, it !ital!could!off! turn out to be more sinister.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, there's that supernatural theme again.
</P>
<P>
   And what better place to lure the spirits out than a fictional
town founded in the mid-1600s?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the center of great loves, great hates, great
passions for 350 years,'' Reilly said of Harmony, the town he
created in his head. ``It's the one area of the country where you
wouldn't be surprised to see ghosts. I think there's a reason
Stephen King has placed most of his works in New England. It lends
itself to that, ever since Ichabod Crane and the Headless
Horseman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ichabod Crane may have had an easier time of it than this
new show, which replaces just-canceled ``Another World'' after a
35-year run.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet and in fan magazines, the most vocal of ``AW's''
2.5 million longtime fans have soundly denounced NBC for canceling
their favorite show, vowing never to watch another NBC soap,
especially ``Passions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly knows he's facing an uphill battle to secure the new
daytime series a place in viewers' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that negative element, which we can't help,'' Reilly
said. ``But we'd like `Another World' fans to stick around to see
what we have to offer, and we want to bring in young viewers, too,
so they can grow up with `Passions' like their mothers and
grandmothers did with `Another World.' We hope they'll just give us
a chance _ and we hope we'll be around for decades to come.'' &QL;

SAMPRAIS PASSES INTO SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ No, it wasn't a hallucination. This really was
Wimbledon. It just looked like the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The men's singles quarterfinals Friday were spiced by a couple
of potential previews of the US-Australia match at Longwood in two
weeks. On the court, the Americans and Australians split. In the
trainer's room and the interview room, the United States earned an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Top seed Pete Sampras, who has vowed he would play only doubles
at Longwood so as not to horn in on the US incumbents, got a pass
into Saturday's semifinals when No. 7 Mark Philippoussis was forced
to withdraw with a left knee injury while leading, 6-4, 1-2. After
an MRI and an examination by an orthopedic specialist, the injury
was diagnosed as a torn cartilage that will sideline Philippoussis
for 4-6 weeks, meaning he won't be in Boston. In his place,
Australian captain John Newcombe named 17-year-old Lleyton Hewitt,
who has traveled with the Davis Cup entourage for two years but
hasn't played a match.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, No. 8 Todd Martin _ for whom the official Wimbledon
term ``gentlemen's singles'' was coined _ dropped a gritty 6-3,
6-7, 7-6, 7-6 decision to No. 2 Patrick Rafter, then offered to
relinquish his Cup singles position to Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate import, the main order of business _
determining the champions of the world's most prestigious tennis
tournament _ is at last coming into focus. Belatedly, to be sure,
because rain has wreaked havoc with the schedule, which means both
men's and women's semifinals will be Saturday and the finals
Sunday, wretched weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   At least the final fours have been determined. Andre Agassi,
looking untouchable since his astounding French Open triumph,
ruined the Brazilian festival on Court 2 by brushing aside No. 11
Gustavo Kuerten, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. And Tim Henman, the Great Wight
Hope _ and the rest of Britain's, too _ banished former finalist
Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. So it will be Sampras-Henman
and Agassi-Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women, Alexandra Stevenson became the first survivor
of the qualifying tournament ever to reach the Wimbledon semis,
dispatching fellow qualifier Jelena Dokic, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. Unseeded
Mirjana Lucic was the second long shot to cash in, ousting 1998
runner-up Nathalie Tauziat, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, rallying from a 3-5
deficit in the deciding set. The two kids _ Lucic, 17, and
Stevenson, 18 _ will be overwhelming underdogs against the No. 2
and 3 seeds, Steffi Graf and Lindsay Davenport, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of gallant gestures, Martin aced the field. After his
grueling loss, he was asked if there were any way Sampras might
wind up playing singles at Longwood, especially if he wins this
tournament for the sixth time in seven years. Sampras, remember, is
a late-comer, having bypassed the United States' first-round Cup
match at Birmingham, England, where Martin, Jim Courier, and Alex
O'Brien posted a stirring 3-2 triumph that has inspired
unprecedented American interest in the competition. Sampras then
asked in, but only to play doubles, because he didn't feel it would
be fair to displace Martin or Courier.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Martin said, ``I would volunteer'' to defer to Sampras in
singles. ``I think Pete should be playing singles, and I don't know
if Pete thinks that, I don't know if Gully (US captain Tom
Gullikson) thinks that, and I don't know if Jim thinks that, but I
want our best team out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Martin somewhat couched his noblesse oblige, saying, ``I
don't necessarily feel like I'm the one that should not be
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows there's no way Gullikson will sit out Courier,
whose five-set triumphs over England's finest, Henman and Greg
Rusedski, paced the Americans at Birmingham and who had a
spectacular run here before losing to Henman in a five-set
fourth-round match. So guess who that would leave out.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said Thursday that the players' preferences won't be
the deciding factors, anyway. ``All I'll say is that Pete is on the
team,'' he said. ``He gives us the maximum amount of options and
flexibility. I'm the captain and I reserve the right to make the
decision. We'll at least have a team discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, Martin's willingness to play only doubles would
make that discussion a lot less tense.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise for those familiar with Martin, whose talent
is exceeded only by his courtliness. That was evident Friday during
one of the biggest matches of his life when he several times
overruled calls by umpire Andreas Egli and awarded points to
Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical _ and noble _ occurred at 2-2 in the fourth
set with Martin serving at 15-30. As his serve landed, he noticed a
ball from an adjacent court drop on Rafter's side and immediately
called a let because he felt Rafter could be distracted and the
point should be replayed. Rafter never saw the ball and fired a
return that eluded Martin. Egli called the let, Rafter protested _
and Martin concurred, telling Egli, ``I wouldn't have gotten to
that ball, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no such fortune for Rafter's would-be Australian
teammate, Philippoussis, who clearly had Sampras in trouble on
Centre Court after the first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he was outplaying me,'' said Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   But at 1-1, deuce, in the second, Philippoussis lunged one way
for a backhand volley and his right knee went the other.
Philippoussis played out the game, but on Sampras's ensuing serve,
he stood stone still _ and not by choice. After being examined by
the trainer, he was forced to abandon the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I landed, I sort of fell awkwardly,'' he said. ``I felt
like I landed OK, but I heard a click and I grabbed it and I
thought nothing of it until he hit a serve. Then when I sort of
jumped forward to split-step, my knee just gave way and I heard a
huge click. And then again on the second serve, I split-stepped and
I heard a big click again, and I obviously knew right there. I
mean, I was extremely worried, and it just got stiffer and stiffer,
and then when the (trainer) came out, I thought there was no
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, who was broadcasting the match on Australian TV, had
to cope with the fact that he won't have Philippoussis to face the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it hurts our confidence,'' he said. ``But
certainly we would have been going in hoping Philippoussis could
win at least one of his two singles. I'd have to say the odds have
shifted slightly to the US instead of being 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   But first they have to take care of the final details over here.

BERGOMI TO STAY HOME AND NURSE AILMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga has something in common
with Sunday's opponent, the New York/New Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga returned for Friday's practice at Babson College without
the high-profile Italian player that he has been seeking. But,
unlike the MetroStars, Zenga's team appears to be galvanizing for a
playoff campaign _ with or without foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Bergomi, the former Inter defender who announced he
would visit the Revolution this month, apparently is out of the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beppe wants to stay in Italy and rest because he has some
physical problems,'' said Zenga, who traveled to Italy after the
Revolution's 2-0 loss to Dallas Saturday. ``The door will always be
open for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga hoped to use his relationships with former opponents and
teammates to replace Dutch defender Richard Goulooze, who left the
team this week. But Zenga was hampered by the low wages of Major
League Soccer and the fact that MetroStars general manager Charlie
Stillitano had approached potential candidates first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked with a lot of players in Italy,'' Zenga said. ``And
every time, they said the same thing: `Walter, you are in America
now, do you know Stillitano in New York? Because he has already
talked to me.' New York must have talked to 1,000 players.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga has adopted a realistic attitude about the combination
of modest budgets and unambitious acquisition policies of the MLS.
He added Mario Gori, a 26-year-old Argentinian defender, from Miami
in exchange for veteran midfielder Edwin Gorter last week. And the
Revolution are expected to next week audition JoJo, a Mozambican
wing midfielder whose full name is Jorge Miguel Moreira Larrouy
Fernandes. JoJo, 28, has played for Boavista, Penafiel, and
Belenenses in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is a big name or not, we want a good player,''
Zenga said. ``You have to choose what is best for your team. And
the player has to understand my philosophy. The important thing is
for them to have a good attitude about playing with us in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for one foreign player and we have three or
four possibilities. We want to be 100 percent certain. We have 20
good players now and we have a great lockerroom, and everyone knows
what we want to accomplish this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution (15 points, 15 games) hold a 3-point lead over
fourth-place Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference. They have home
games against the MetroStars and Los Angeles (July 11) before the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only got 3 points but we deserved 9 points against
Columbus, Tampa Bay, and Dallas,'' Zenga said. ``The days will come
when we can play bad and still get 3 points in a game. But I am
happy with the mentality and philosophy of the team. If we keep
playing like this, the results will come soon.''

playoff involving Canada, Cuba, El Salvador, and Haiti . . . Jamar

Santos are expected to join the Boston Bulldogs for a Tuesday match

EVOLUTION OR CREATION IN THE CLASSROOM? SOME SAY THERE'S ROOM FOR
BOTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAIME JORDAN and JENNIFER AUTREY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as historical debates are revisited from time to time, so
is the seemingly age-old debate about how the origin of man should
be taught in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, groups like the National Academy of Sciences
say that evolution should be taught with no mention of the biblical
version of creation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some church leaders say they want creation
science offered as an alternative to the cut-and-dried theory of
natural selection, which holds that species emerge over time.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences published a book this year
reiterating its 15-year-old position that the theory of evolution _
and not religious beliefs _ should be taught in every public school
biology classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this time, the academy provided examples of how a person can
believe in God and still believe in evolution _ a position many
religious scholars would agree with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in any way that science is at odds with the
Bible,'' said Jeb Airey, pastor of the North Arlington Christian
Center in Arlington, Texas. ``I think that science is a complement
to the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, there is a false belief by some that religious people
can't be scientific, said Scott Youngblood, president of the
Arlington Ministerial Association and pastor of St. Barnabas United
Methodist Church in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this misinterpretation that somehow you can't be smart
and religious at the same time, and I think that not to be the
case,'' Youngblood said. ``Every theory has holes; many scientists
acknowledge the mystery in it to be God.''
</P>
<P>
   Considered the nation's pre-eminent scientific organization, the
National Academy of Sciences was chartered by Congress in 1863 to
advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's new book, designed for ministers, parents and
anyone interested in the issue of teaching evolution, follows last
year's release of another National Academy of Sciences publication
specifically designed to show teachers how to explain evolution and
how to answer questions about creation _ complete with mock
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a one-two punch,'' said Eugenie Scott, executive
director of the El Cerrito, Calif.-based National Center for
Science Education, who sat on the steering committee for both
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Several local biology teachers say the issue has never been
contentious in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Davis has taught biology at Lamar High School in Arlington
for 10 years and has spent about 24 years in the classroom. He
describes himself as a Christian and believes the Bible is a work
written by men but inspired by God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe in Jesus Christ,'' Davis said. ``The first thing
I think about at the beginning of the day is to try to pattern my
life after Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said he can't deny the scientific evidence from carbon
dating and fossils that humans existed several million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the discussions about evolution have come up often in
his classroom through the years. He occasionally finds himself
answering the question: ``If man really came from apes, then why
are apes still here?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he patiently explains that scientists have found
evidence not that humans came from apes but that apes and humans
evolved from a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, he said, the students rarely get upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to always present the information and let the kids make
their own choice. If they ask my opinion, I tell them,'' he said.
``As a science teacher and a Christian, I never belittle anyone or
make them feel bad when we talk about evolution. It's too important
of a topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngblood, however, said it's not that easy for many Christian
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of our teachers are Christians,'' he said. ``They
are following as best they can the guidelines they've been given
not to teach religion. For most of our teachers, that puts them
from time to time in a bit of a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first week of classes at Central High School. As the
bell rings for third period, Karen, the newest teacher on the
faculty, walks into the teachers' lounge. She greets her
colleagues, Barbara and Doug ...
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, Barbara, thanks for letting me see your syllabus
for Bio I. But I wanted to ask you about teaching evolution. I
didn't see it there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't see it on my syllabus because it's not a separate
topic,'' Barbara said. ``I use evolution as a theme to tie the
course together, so it comes into just about every unit. You'll see
a section called `History of Life' on the second page, and there's
a section called `Natural Selection.' But I don't treat evolution
separately because it is related to almost every other topic in
biology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute, Barbara,'' Doug says. ``Is that good advice for
a new teacher? I mean, evolution is a controversial subject, and a
lot of us don't get around to teaching it. I don't. You do, but
you're braver than most of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of bravery, Doug,'' Barbara replies. ``It's
a matter of what needs to be taught if we want students to
understand biology. Teaching biology without evolution would be
like teaching civics and never mentioning the United States
Constitution ...''''

WEBBY AWARDS LEFT TO PEOPLE'S CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Webby Awards, which fancy themselves the
online equivalents of the Oscars, are making a rash (but probably
quite profitable) move: They're going to take nominations from the
general public, instead of relying on a relatively narrow panel of
plugged-in experts to choose honorees.
</P>
<P>
   The move was perhaps inevitable, given that the awards honor the
best of the relentlessly grass-roots World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   But with the number of Web sites rocketing toward 1 billion, and
Web sites struggling to find new ways to become known, the judges
shall be busy.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, which runs the
awards, is charging an entry fee of $50 per nomination, which
should eliminate at least a handful of would-be applicants for the
24 categories ranging from ``activism'' to ``weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if you win, don't count on a lengthy acceptance speech.
They're limited to a blissfully short five words, forcing an
economy of speech that would be the envy of Calvin Coolidge and
haiku masters everywhere. If all that still hasn't daunted your
dreams of Web eminence, go to www.webbyawards.com for futher
details before Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JUMPING SHIP
</P>
<P>
   It takes a brave man to leave behind the comforting bosom and
very deep pockets of AT&AMP;T for a relatively little-known competitor.
And it takes a brave and crazy work force for 13 of his colleagues
to come along with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Miller and many of the key people with AT&AMP;T's digital
music subsidiary, a2b, did just that about two months ago, leaving
the Death Star for the entrepreneurial haven of Reciprocal Inc.
</P>
<P>
   It was a somewhat curious time to move. AT&AMP;T had gone on a
massive buying spree, diversifying itself from the nation's biggest
long-distance phone company, with one of the biggest Internet
service providers, into the nation's biggest cable TV operator with
a piece of both cable-modem service providers, Home and Roadrunner.
</P>
<P>
   Given that wide-ranging Net presence, a2b's audio encryption and
compression technology was suddenly much more central to AT&AMP;T's Web
dreams of making money selling music and much else online.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller wanted to go with a smaller, more entrepreneurial
company, so he, chief technology officer Howie Epstein and 12
others jumped to Reciprocal.
</P>
<P>
   Where he landed wasn't well-known outside the nascent digital
music business, in part because Reciprocal has gone through a
couple of name changes since it was founded by Japanese giant
Softbank.
</P>
<P>
   But the big boys knew the company well, and have been lining up
to cut deals and buy a piece of Reciprocal when possible. Softbank
still owns a chunk, but so do Microsoft, Reuters and a couple of
prominent venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   And since the a2b crew joined, Reciprocal has made a flurry of
notable partnerships that will help it shape the future of music
online.
</P>
<P>
   Reciprocal, like a2b, creates software tools that allow a music
maker, such as a record company or band, to control how digital
versions of their songs can be distributed over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to allow the content owners to establish the rules,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   With those software-enforced rules, for instance, a band could
let fans download a song for free, as long as they gave the band
their e-mail addresses and other information. The band in turn
could use that information to sell their fans other releases and
merchandise and to notify fans of concert and television
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the record business, the biggest reason why fans of a
particular artist don't have new music from that artist is they
don't know about it,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Or the band could let a fan listen to a downloaded song three
times, or for a month, or six, before Reciprocal's encryption
software locked up the tune until the fan paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of software controls are a record-company response
to the widespread popularity, particularly on college campuses
where music-mad students have access to high-speed Net connections,
of pirated songs compressed with the MP-3 standard. Without such
controls over digital copies of music, no one in the
multibillion-dollar business can make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming mainstream,'' Miller said. ``Can we turn it into
a business? We think so. If we make it easy, and provide a vast
repertoire, I do believe it could be the best thing to happen to
the record business since the advent of the CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Reciprocal and a2b aren't the only companies creating these
tools. In the past six months, a series of companies large and
small have jumped into the digital music business, including such
heavy hitters as IBM.
</P>
<P>
   And on the other end, the record business is slowly embracing
the idea of digital music as more than a way to pirate
good-sounding tunes. Several of the major record labels, and many
small ones, have begun selling music in some way online.
</P>
<P>
   And another big step took place this week, when the industry's
Secure Digital Music Initiative released its final technology
specifications, detailing the security features that need to be on
the gadgets and gizmos you'll buy this holiday season, so they can
listen to legal copies of the digital music you download from your
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means for normal human beings is that this
announcement will make music much more easily available from
artists that people have heard of and might be interested in
buying,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was the record business's response after losing a
pivotal lawsuit last winter against one of the first handheld MP-3
players, the Rio PMP-300 from Diamond Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Since that lawsuit in Los Angeles was decided (and the appeal
lost a couple of weeks ago), things have changed a great deal.
Diamond even signed a deal to use Reciprocal's technology on the
next version of the Rio, the PMP-500, which is slated for release
in several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about turning the corner from conducting a series of
responsible experiments,'' Miller said. ``I'll be interested in
what happens when interacting with the technology just disappears,
when getting the music is as easy as picking up the phone and
getting a dial tone. We have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOME OF THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   As our world gets more heavily populated and polluted, one
likely source of future conflicts will be over access to drinkable
water and other basic but endangered resources, the United Nations
says.
</P>
<P>
   A Woodland Hills-based company and related nonprofit
organization are trying to find ways to help head that off, selling
modular housing that uses environmentally friendly and
self-contained technology, then plowing part of the profits back
into the foundation, which will do research and help advise
less-developed countries about how to deal with resource problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aquarius EcoSystems Inc. is the for-profit company, selling
modular structures that use some of the geodesic-dome construction
techniques developed by Buckminster Fuller, and outfitting the
structures with such Earth-friendly technologies as solar panels to
cogenerate electrical power, said Aquarius CEO Dave Sanders, a
former government engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The housing also is tied in with a broader self-sufficiency
approach that encourages organic farming and soil-building
techniques, Sanders said. The company advises buyers on how to use
those techniques as part of creating a self-contained life that
treads lightly upon the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose the easiest way to state the goal is we're about
raising consciousness that sustainable technology is the direction
we need to move to ensure the health and well-being of our
progeny,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to establish a demonstration community built
around its housing and utility systems in Hawaii, and to move part
of its operations there. For more information, check the company
Web site at www.aquarius-es.com.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the company's founders also have set up a nonprofit
organization, the Light of Life Society, which will research
sustainable technologies, and consult with countries and regions
that are facing resource shortages, Sanders said. The society's Web

NOTES FROM THE GAMING UNDERGROUND
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's stock prices have soared in Japan on word that the
Game Boy Color may get an attachment, perhaps through a cellular
phone, that will allow it to get e-mail and download games from the
Internet, according to reports in a Japanese paper and the trade
publication MCV.
</P>
<P>
   This is getting a little wacky, but perhaps no more so than
using your Palm Pilot or other handheld PC to access the Web (or
using it to play games).
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo isn't announcing any specific add-ons for Net access
yet, but consider this another devolutionary step for the mutating
PC, as it becomes part of everything and not just a separate box on
a desk at work or in the back bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ANIME PLUG OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Two thumbs up (I get to use both hands) for ``Queen Emeraldas,''
the latest from Leiji Matsumoto, who previously created
``Starblazers'' and ``Galaxy Express 999.''
</P>
<P>
   Emeraldas is a scar-faced space pirate queen with an engaging
gravity and style about her. The driven young boy who is something
of a protagonist is somewhat annoying, but the animation has great
style and a rich visual texture that I liked a great deal.
</P>

titles as well, including films based on such games as Tekken, Sin,
Sonic the Hedgehog and Panzer Dragoon Saga.

PHONING AND DRIVING DON'T MIX IN CLEVELAND SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Ohio _ It is illegal to drive while talking on a cell
phone in this Cleveland suburb, apparently the only place in
America with such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Coyne, 82, who is in his 52nd year in office, and who
can recall when people survived without driving automobiles or
talking on telephones, let alone doing both at once, believes it is
just a matter of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten a little out of hand, don't you think?''
said Coyne, noting that some cars now have computers, fax machines,
even televisions. ``Pull off the road if you want to use an
electric shaver, if you want to put on lipstick, if you want to use
a cell phone. But if you're driving, for goodness sakes, then keep
two hands on the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded on three sides by the city of Cleveland, this older
suburb of factories, strip malls, modest bungalows and ranch
houses, with a population of about 11,000, might not seem like a
trend-setter. But it was Brooklyn, in 1966, that passed the first
law in the nation to require the use of seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Talking on the phone while driving here carries a penalty of
$100, plus $45 in court costs. So far, the police have only issued
warnings. More than 100 people have been stopped for the offense
since the ordinance took effect in March.
</P>
<P>
   The grace period will end ``in a reasonable time period,'' said
Coyne, after the town posts some no-talking-while-driving signs and
people become familiar with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief James Maloney said he thinks most people know about
the law by now. ``When a squad car passes, you see them jump off
the phone and hide it under the dash.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the ban was fueled by an accident near City Hall,
when the automobile of an elderly motorist was rammed by a driver
talking on his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney witnessed the accident. ``The guy was so engrossed in
his telephone conversation, he just slammed into the car stopped in
front of him at the light,'' Maloney said. ``Even after the crash,
the guy still had the phone in his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Brooklyn, no town or state outlaws talking on the
phone while driving, according to Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington. But
some countries, including Israel, ban cell phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said the federal safety agency, while cautioning that
phones can be a distraction for some drivers, has not focused on
them as a particular danger.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 35 million cell phones in the United States, a
figure that is growing fast. Not so many years ago, cell phones
were seen as a toy for hard-charging business executives or those
who liked extravagant flourishes. But they have become fixtures of
middle-class life.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, a trade group that opposes the Brooklyn law,
said the issue is not the telephone, but the driver. He said the
telephone industry has been running ads and sending mail to remind
people to drive safely while using a cell phone. Some states,
including California, Wisconsin and Utah, have campaigns that do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said there are many things besides a telephone that
could distract a driver, such as ``the kid in the backseat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While driving, with or without a cell phone, you have to
exercise a series of good judgments,'' Wheeler said. ``Should I
turn around now and look at the kids in the back? Is this a good
time to change the radio station? Is it the right time to have an
argument with my spouse?''
</P>
<P>
   He said new technology has often sparked worries about road
safety. Some states once drafted legislation to ban radios from
cars.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When windshield wipers were first introduced, people
said, `These things are going to be hypnotic _ people won't be able
to drive _ better stay with the goggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a terrible hazard, cellular phones, in Wheeler's
view, have made American roads safer.
</P>
<P>
   He said nearly 100,000 calls a day are being made from cars,
just to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the ban on driving and talking has prompted mixed
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy law,'' said Tony Justice, a 35-year-old foreman
at an electroplating factory, who said he depends on a cell phone
to make arrangements to pick up his daughter after work. ``Some
people can actually talk and drive. And for people who can't
function, well then, just ticket them for bad driving.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Dan Peters, a 27-year-old tile installer,
jail time would be too easy for some chatty drivers. ``They speed
up, slow down, speed up, hit the breaks,'' said Peters. ``I think
their driving follows the rhythm of their phone conversations. It
drives me crazy. They should pass this law everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has fielded more than a few calls about the town's
policy, most of them positive.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the calls have been dialed from cell phones in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to be such a part of people's lives,'' Coyne said,
``they can't help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For passing motorists who might not be familiar with the local
ways of Brooklyn, the mayor said, the police show some
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, `Look, there's a law in Brooklyn, so please get
off the phone.'''

MARIO PUZO, 78, AUTHOR WHO CREATED `THE GODFATHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Puzo, the best-selling novelist and screenwriter who
created ``The Godfather'' and made the Corleones the most famous _
and infamous _ of Mafia families and an enduring myth on the
American cultural landscape, died Friday at his home in Bay Shore,
N.Y. The cause was heart failure, said his agent, Neil Olson. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   When Puzo wrote ``The Godfather'' in the late 1960s, he did it
reluctantly. His first two novels had received favorable reviews,
but earned him a total of $6,500. At 45 and in debt, he believed
that as a writer he was going downhill fast. But he had some
favorite stories to tell about the Mafia, and, for the money, he
decided to write a book about Italian Americans in organized crime.
From the author's account, he had scant encouragement from
publishers, and received an advance of only $5,000. But after the
book was published in 1969, it became one of the most phenomenal
successes in literary and cinematic history.
</P>
<P>
   The novel was the No. 1 best seller in the United States, and
was on the New York Times Book Review list for 67 weeks. It was
also the most popular novel in England, France, Germany and other
countries, and sold more than 21 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Then it tripled _ or quadrupled _ that success when Francis Ford
Coppola filmed it. With a screenplay by Puzo and Coppola, the film
made reputations (for the director, the writer and many of its
stars), earned millions of dollars, won Academy Awards for the
screenwriters, among others, and became the most quoted movie of
its time, with phrases like ``my father made him an offer he
couldn't refuse'' entering the American lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   The film outdid the book in popularity and in critical respect.
When the movie opened in 1972, Vincent Canby, in his review in The
New York Times, called it ``one of the most brutal and moving
chronicles of American life every designed within the limits of
popular entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Marlon Brando as the patriarchal Don Vito Corleone and Al
Pacino as the college-educated son Michael who eventually takes
control of the family business, the Corleones edged their way into
respectability. The film was far more than a gangster melodrama; it
was a sweeping portrait of a family that was as devoted to its own
sense of values as to violence. It was also a commentary on greed
in a capitalist society.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the movie's success was
that it was repeated again and again, as ``The Godfather'' spawned
``The Godfather Part II'' (1974) and ``The Godfather Part III''
(1990), with all three screenplays written by Puzo and Coppola.
Playing various Corleones, Brando, Pacino, Robert De Niro and James
Caan gave some of their most memorable screen performances, as did
Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton in other roles. Recently there was
talk about a possible ``Godfather Part IV,'' tailored to another
Italian-American movie star, Leonardo de Caprio.
</P>
<P>
   As the Corleones entered popular mythology, they were surrounded
by contradictions. Were they villains or heroes, or some hybrid of
the two? Don Vito Corleone and his sons were feared and admired _
and later they were often parodied. With the help of Coppola, Puzo
had humanized people who in other fictional and cinematic forms had
often been condemned and reviled. The Corleones were, first of all,
a family, and there was a bond that extended through the sequel
(which incorporated a prequel), as more and more people throughout
the world were touched by their story.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his insights into crime and crime families, it was
assumed that Puzo wrote from first-hand experience. One of the
oddities of the Puzo career is that, when it came to the Mafia, he
was very much an outsider. As he wrote in 1972 in ``The Godfather
Papers and Other Writings,'' ``I'm ashamed to admit that I wrote
`The Godfather' entirely from research. I never met a real
honest-to-god gangster. I knew the gambling world pretty good, but
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   After the book was published, he was introduced to several
gangsters who, he said, ``refused to believe that I had never been
in the rackets.'' He added, ``But all of them loved the book.'' And
later they loved the movie, although the author was sometimes
subjected to the charge that ``The Godfather'' was unflattering to
Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seemed as if the person with the strongest doubts
was Puzo himself. ``I wished like hell I'd written it better,'' he
said. ``I wrote below my gifts in that book.'' He preferred his
second novel, ``The Fortunate Pilgrim.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no denying that ``The Godfather'' and the
Corleones totally transformed the author's life and made him one of
the most popular and one of the wealthiest of novelists.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Puzo was born in Hell's Kitchen on the west side of
Manhattan. His parents were poor Italian-American immigrants from
Naples (not, like the Corleones, from Sicily). His father, who was
a railroad trackman for the New York Central Railroad, deserted the
family when Mario was 12, leaving his wife Maria to raise their
seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were, of course, gangs on the New York streets,
Puzo stayed clear of them and conformed, he said, to the
``formidable'' structure of his family. As he later recalled, his
mother often told to stay home because ``only bad things happen to
you outside.'' Puzo once referred to his boyhood environment as
``the stone city.''
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to a new edition of his second novel, ``The
Fortunate Pilgrim,'' Puzo said that his mother was the model for
Don Corleone, the Godfather (who was played as an old man by Brando
and as a young man by De Niro). ``Whenever the Godfather opened his
mouth,'' he wrote, ``in my own mind I heard the voice of my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that novel began as a book about himself but was taken
over by the character of Lucia Santa, based on his mother: ``My
mother was a wonderful, handsome woman, but a fairly ruthless
person.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 television dramatization of ``The Fortunate Pilgrim,''
Lucia Santa was played by Sophia Loren.
</P>
<P>
   Puzo began writing stories in high school and dreamed of making
writing his career, but, as a young man, in common with his father,
he worked for the New York Central Railroad. After Army service in
Germany in World War II, he attended City College of New York on
the GI bill. Bruce Jay Friedman hired him as an assistant editor of
a group of men's magazines (Male, Men, etc.). For those magazines,
Puzo wrote action stories, many of them versions of World War II
battles.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling Puzo in those days, Friedman said that his memories
all have to do with ``size _ the size of his appetite'' for food
and for reading books: ``I have a picture of him sitting in a chair
with not one but six volumes in his lap, wetting his finger and
taking `tastes' of each one.'' And, he added, ``the enormity of his
laugh: always filled with amazement at some quirk of human
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Puzo was working on his first novel, ``Dark
Arena.'' Published in 1955, it dealt with an American veteran of
World War II who returns to Germany to look up his former mistress.
Nine years later he published ``The Fortunate Pilgrim,'' an
autobiographical novel about an immigrant Italian-American family.
A reviewer in the Times Book Review called it ``a small classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still supporting himself and his family (his wife and five
children) as a freelance writer, he began ``The Godfather.'' When
the paperback rights to the book were suddenly sold for $410,000,
he telephoned his mother. She misunderstood and thought he said
$40,000. Three times he told her the real figure, and then she
said, ``Don't tell nobody.'' Earlier, his mother had been skeptical
about his work. After ``The Godfather,'' she called him ``a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   While writing the screenplays for the ``Godfather'' movies with
Coppola and winning two Academy Awards, Puzo also was a writer on
other films (including ``Earthquake,'' ``Superman,'' ``Superman
II'' and ``The Cotton Club'') and continued his career as a
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``Fools Die'' in 1978 (about gambling in Las Vegas),
and sold the paperback rights for $2.55 million. He then returned
to some of the themes in ``The Godfather'' with ``The Sicilian'' in
1984. ``The Sicilian'' was filmed by Michael Cimino in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth K'' was a novel about a Kennedy cousin who becomes
president of the United States in the next century. ``The Last
Don,'' published in 1996, was turned into a six-hour television
miniseries the following year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Puzo bought a house on Long Island in Bay Shore and
over the years expanded and remodeled it. As his friend, Joseph
Heller, said Friday, ``It was a model house in a development and he
asked them to leave the furniture. He was quiet, modest and
unassuming. He never asked a favor and he always granted a
request.'' In at least one respect, he was changed by his success.
``He was always a gambler,'' said Heller, ```and he gambled for
higher stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Camille Paglia in The New York Times in
1997, Puzo said, ``I fancy myself an Italian peasant who's living
comfortably on his little farm.'' Four of his five children lived
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   After Puzo's wife, Erika died in 1978, her nurse, Carol Gino,
became his companion. In addition to Ms. Gino, he is survived by
his five children, Virginia McLauglin, Eugene, Anthony, Joseph all
of whom live on Long Island and Dorothy of San Francisco; by nine
grandchildren; his sister, Evelyn Murphy, and his brother, Antony
Cleri. In 1991, Puzo had quadruple-bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Before he died, he had completed ``Omerta,'' a new novel that
Random House is scheduled to publish next summer. He considered
this book the third in his Mafia trilogy (after ``The Godfather''
and ``The Last Don'').
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 interview, Puzo said he was ``a Romantic writer''
with ``a sympathy for evil.'' He attributed the popularity of ``The
Godfather'' to a ``disenchantment with the American justice
system,'' as well as a craving for close family ties. ``I hate
violence,'' said the father of ``The Godfather.''

CLINTON'S MEDICARE PLAN: A SOLID STEP ONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton promised to issue his own plan to reform
Medicare when his appointees to a bipartisan federal commission,
whose chairman was Sen. John B. Breaux of Louisiana, blocked
agreement last March.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made good on that promise last week, releasing a plan
that he says would cover prescription drugs for the first time;
eliminate co-payments and deductibles on preventive services like
cancer screening; raise deductibles for clinical laboratory and
physician services, and inject more competition from private
managed-care plans. In general, Democrats reacted approvingly and
Republicans suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Lemieux, who was a senior economist on the Breaux
commission, now has the same title at the Progressive Policy
Institute, which is affiliated with the centrist Democratic
Leadership Council. He discussed the plan's strengths, weaknesses
and prospects last week. Here are excerpts. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Would the Clinton plan provide adequately for the
elderly?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Clinton makes an important start by bringing drug coverage
into the Medicare benefit package. But Medicare benefits would
still be skimpy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Medicare would cover about $2,000 of the
first $5,000 of pharmaceutical costs. Patients would pay all drug
costs above $5,000 a year. Nor would the Clinton plan provide
stop-loss protection _ a cap on out-of-pocket medical costs _ which
is offered as part of many private-sector plans. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Would the Clinton plan bring soaring Medicare costs
under control?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Clinton proposes to raise Medicare outlays even higher over
the next 10 years, though by a small amount. Breaux's plan would
have brought Medicare costs down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer Breaux's proposal because it would put a cap on the
contribution of general tax revenues to total Medicare spending.
Clinton's idea of tossing $800 billion of general tax revenues into
Medicare over the next 15 years could make Congress complacent,
willing to sit back while the program is flush rather than make
tough decisions to control costs as the baby boomers begin to
retire. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q (italics)What are the Clinton plan's strengths?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Its best point is an intriguing proposal to create
competition among the government fee-for-service plan and private
managed-care plans by allowing beneficiaries who choose inexpensive
plans to pay lower monthly premiums. The elderly cannot do that
under the current setup. No matter which plan you pick, you pay a
full premium of about $45 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton plan, you could receive a discount, even a
complete waiver of the monthly premium. This would be very
important to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The president also wisely proposes to raise the deductible for
physician services at the pace of inflation. That's important for
controlling costs over time. Though he could have gone further _
perhaps by combining all Medicare deductibles into one _ his plan
would make a good start. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What changes would make the Clinton plan better?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. He could adopt some good parts of the Breaux plan. The
government agency that runs Medicare, HCFA, has a conflict of
interest. It supervises the private Medicare plans. It also runs
the government's fee-for-service plan. The danger is that by
setting the rules of competition, it could disable the private
plans. The answer to this problem is to set up a separate board to
supervise the private plans, leaving HCFA to focus its attention
solely on running the best fee-for-service plan possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another suggestion would be to provide a more generous drug
benefit for families most in need, perhaps by excluding higher
income families from government subsidies. If future budgets allow,
we could add more subsidies later. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is there hope for action this year?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The president gave Congress political cover for taking up an
issue that it has traditionally been scared to touch.
</P>
<P>
   The big news is that the budget constraints have been partially
lifted. New budget estimates have handed Congress an extra $1
trillion over the next 15 years. Even with the new money, real
reform will be painful, requiring Congress to impose new limits on
the elderly. Clinton made a start when he proposed raising some
deductibles and co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats feared the Breaux plan would hurt the elderly.
Republicans are suspicious of the cost of the Clinton plan.
Hopefully, there will be room for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As the president knows, the most important thing we can do for
the future is pay down the national debt. Second is improving the
big entitlement programs like Medicare and controlling their costs.
With solid proposals from the president and Breaux, there is no
excuse for failing to enact Medicare reforms this year.

<P>
   For an entrepreneur who was down on his luck, it was almost too
good a deal to pass up
</P>
<P>
   Wally Amos had long ago lost control of Famous Amos, the cookie
company he founded in 1975, and even the right to use his name or
the famous likeness of himself with his salt-and-pepper beard,
Panama hat and embroidered Indian shirt. He was reduced to calling
his own cookie line ``Uncle Noname,'' and the business was
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March, Keebler Co., Famous Amos' new owner, offered Amos
a two-year contract to promote his old brand. And Keebler was
willing to let him use his name for his own business.
</P>
<P>
   Amos was hardly in a position to play the tough negotiator. Yet,
after sampling the Famous Amos cookies that Keebler was selling, he
couldn't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow or another caramel coloring had been added and I don't
know why that was,'' the 63-year-old Amos said, the lines in his
forehead becoming more pronounced. ``And they were using a real
low-grade vanilla flavoring and I always used vanilla extract. One
of the first things I shared with Keebler when we met was that I
couldn't promote the product they were currently selling, that if I
were going to be a part of it we had to make some adjustments so
that it could be closer to a Wally Amos product.''
</P>
<P>
   Keebler, a unit of Flowers Industries that inherited the
reformulated cookies, agreed to the terms. Rejiggering the
ingredients was a small price to pay for the chance to increase
sales. ``Certainly, Wally Amos carries the namesake, so it was an
obvious place to look'' for a spokesman, said Bruce Grieve,
Keebler's vice president for new business development. ``People
really know the name and so many people still recognize the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Amos' fussiness, which could have blown his chance
for a comeback, highlights a conundrum that is common among
entrepreneurs: They are often strong on concept but weak on
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out when to turn over the day-to-day management of a
growing startup to a partner or salaried professional is one of the
keys to business success, and those who wait too long can easily
lose control. ``An entrepreneur has an enormously high energy level
and has a very low attention span typically,'' said Paul Karofsky,
executive director of Northeastern University's Center for Family
Business. ``They can conceptualize brilliantly but then struggle to
implement.''
</P>
<P>
   Another trait they share is the zeal to promote their creation
like no one else. So more than a decade after losing his company,
it is no surprise that Amos is back bragging about Famous Amos,
like a proud father showing off his now-grown first-born.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he was pitching the cookies at a food marketing
trade show in Chicago. In June, he made appearances at
supermarkets, where shoppers who still recognize him shake his hand
and often toss a bag of Famous Amos cookies into their carts.
Meanwhile, he has been promoting his new role in marketing material
that says ``welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a full-circle kind of thing,'' said Amos, who still
flashes the toothy grin he sported on cookie packages and
television talk shows two decades ago, though his chocolate-colored
face these days is creased with more lines.
</P>
<P>
   He started the original Famous Amos Cookie Co. with $25,000 from
singers Marvin Gaye and Helen Reddy, celebrity friends he knew from
his days as a talent agent. The company sold $300,000 in cookies
that year, and by 1982, revenues reached $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Amos was a rising star. His hat and shirt were added to the
Smithsonian Institution's advertising collection. In 1986,
President Ronald Reagan presented him with one of the first
``Awards of Entrepreneurial Excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   But the heady times would soon end. A high school dropout who
eventually earned a general equivalency diploma, Amos knew little
about business basics and failed to hire managers who did. By 1985,
the year before America's free-market president was hailing him as
a hero, his company lost $300,000 as revenue slipped to $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   And though few people knew it, Amos' personal affairs were in
such disarray that, during the worst of it, he was 15 months behind
on the mortgage for his house in Hawaii. ``I was in Salt Lake City
doing some promotion and I discovered that day that my house had
been auctioned off,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a friend, Amos eventually got the house back.
Ever the optimist, he views the experience as yet another reminder
of the power of faith and positive thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit around starting to feel sorry for yourself, and
blaming everyone else for your position in life, it is like being
in quicksand,'' he said. ``In quicksand, if you start flailing all
about and panicking with each movement you go in deeper, but if you
just stay calm and look about chances are you'll see a twig or
something you can reach to pull yourself out. Or, if you stay there
long enough someone will come and rescue you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight being what it is, Amos is now able to reflect
philosophically on the low points. But ``it was a shocker at
first.'' He sought help to save the company, and ultimately
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Several investors stepped in, but Amos said they inevitably took
more of his equity stake each time and never stayed long enough to
turn the company around. In 1988 the company lost $2.5 million, and
the Shansby Group purchased it for $3 million. Amos became a paid
spokesman but left in frustration the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd lost the company really because I didn't use to listen to
people a lot because I was Famous Amos,'' the founder now admits.
``The first couple of years after I left Famous Amos, I didn't even
make cookies anymore, and I used to always make cookies at home. I
didn't even want to talk about chocolate-chip cookies, really. I
shaved my beard and stop wearing hats.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even without Amos on board, the Shansby Group began to turn
the business around, cutting costs and pushing sales through
vending machines. With the company propped up, it sold Famous Amos
to President Baking for $61 million in 1992. Keebler acquired the
brand last year, becoming its fifth owner, when it took over
President Baking Co.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Amos' cookie craving returned. In 1992, he started
producing high-priced hazelnut cookies under the name Wally Amos
Presents. But Famous Amos sued, claiming trademark infringement, so
he changed the name to Uncle Noname.
</P>
<P>
   By then, competition in the gourmet-cookie business had
intensified, and Uncle Noname could not keep up. ``It was just an
uphill battle, looking to establish a new cookie company without
having the resources and still in the minds of everybody being
Famous Amos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amos once gain found himself in a money-losing venture on the
verge of collapse. Debt mounted to $1.3 million and Uncle Noname
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1997, emerging just
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   His entrepreneurial spirit intact, Amos switched to a line of
low-fat and fat-free muffins. Now, under terms of his deal with
Keebler, he has regained the right to use his name and sells the
muffins as Uncle Wally's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can even use my picture on here,'' he said, seemingly
astonished.
</P>
<P>
   He now leaves the day-to-day operations of his company, which is
based in Hauppauge, N.Y., to a partner, Lou Avignone, who is a
former owner of a larger food distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's poor financial history, and the fact that
Uncle Wally's muffins have not become the huge hit with consumers
that Famous Amos cookies once were, the business had modest
revenues of about $3 million last year and the product is winning
fans, Avignone said. The muffins, for instance, are a leading brand
in Pathmark supermarkets in the New York area and are available
nationally in stores such as Costco warehouse clubs and Edwards
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Letting an industry insider run the business has freed Amos to
pursue a wide range of other interests. He frequently travels,
giving motivational speeches or working on behalf of charities like
Literacy Volunteers of America, of which he is spokesman. He has
co-written several books of inspiration, including one capitalizing
on his failures at Famous Amos. It is entitled ``Man With No Name:
How the Founder of the Censored Cookie Company Lost Everything,
Including His Name _ and Turned Adversity Into Opportunity.'' And
he has become somewhat of an e-mail junkie, sending a network of
cherished friends and associates regular, morale-boosting messages.
And with his Keebler deal, Amos is back on the promotional circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Keebler would disclose how much the company was
paying him to bite into Famous Amos cookies in public and urge
people who spot him in airports to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like Dave from Wendy's,'' said Clive Chajet, president
of Chajet Consultancy, which advises companies on brand-building
strategies. ``If Dave left Wendy's and came back after 10 years
because things had not gone well the message is signaling change
that `We're going back to the way we used to be.' That's not a bad
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will take more than Amos' paid seal of approval to
revive the brand. In addition to getting closer to the original
recipe, Keebler also plans to introduce new flavors, such as toffee
chocolate chip and chocolate chip and walnuts, and to use its vast
resources to get the brand before more consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can dramatically increase distribution of the brand and
that is everything from building its presence in convenience
stores, mass merchandisers, obviously grocery stores and drug
stores,'' said Grieve of Keebler.
</P>
<P>
   Amos is happy to do his part. And even though he has no
ownership in Famous Amos and is making Uncle Wally's his priority,
he acknowledges that his first company is still in his blood.
Whatever his former ties to it, he said, ``I will always be Famous
Amos.''

GOVERNMENT INTERVENES TO KEEP BRAZILIAN BANK SOLVENT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The Senate has approved a measure that
erases $3.4 billion in questionable securities from the books of
Banco do Brasil, a move that may have averted insolvency at the
191-year-old bank, Latin America's largest.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure, which transferred responsibility for the
securities from the bank to the federal treasury, has raised
considerable concern among investors about how such large amounts
of risky securities could be so easily shuffled around in Brazil by
high-ranking officials with little accountability.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved by the Senate late Wednesday, reversed an
earlier decision that had made Banco do Brasil responsible for the
questionable bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Originally issued by the city of Sao Paulo years ago during a
period of rampant fiscal mismanagement, the bonds have a face value
of $3.4 billion. But the bonds are considered highly risky and
perhaps worthless because they may have been issued illegally and
it is unclear whether Sao Paulo will honor them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is horrific to find such a skeleton lurking around,'' said
Winston Fritsch, the president of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson's
Brazil subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of the bonds to the federal government could lead
to a closer examination of how Brazil manages its financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports by local news organizations, the municipal
authorities in Sao Paulo used a loophole in fund-raising
legislation to sell bonds for the purpose of honoring debts
resulting from lawsuits. In effect, however, city officials used
proceeds from these securities for such purposes as paying civil
servants or financing public works.
</P>
<P>
   Sao Paulo authorities used a close relationship with Banespa, a
bank then under control of the state government, to make this
practice feasible. While other banks avoided the bonds, Banespa
bought them. Banespa nearly failed in 1995, and the federal
government subsequently took it over. The bonds were later
transferred to Banco do Brasil, which is also run by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how and why that happened remains unclear. But some news
reports have suggested that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
administration offered to wipe Banespa's slate clean of the
securities in exchange for the political support of Paulo Maluf, a
former Sao Paulo mayor and presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   As part of such an agreement, the reports have said, the city of
Sao Paulo, where the current mayor is a protege of Maluf, would be
freed from honoring the bonds. And Maluf, with an eye on his own
political future, would be freed from the stigma of having issued
billions of dollars of bonds that might be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both Cardoso and Maluf have denied that such an
orchestrated agreement was made. Still, the result, in which
federal funds must now be used used to cover fiscal mismanagement
in Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, has caused concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine New York sold bonds to pave its roads, pay its police
and so on,'' said Raul Velloso, an independent economic consultant
specializing in public finances. ``Then New York said it couldn't
honor the bonds and the rest of the country was told to do so.
Would you be upset?''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure allowing Banco do Brasil to transfer the
portfolio to the federal ledger is not expected to worsen an
already worrisome budget deficit because the loss from the
securities on the municipal and state levels was already accounted
for in previous deficit estimates, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real fear is of discovering huge problems like this in the
future,'' said Masaru Nakayasu, the chief economist at the
Brazilian unit of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

STOCKS ADVANCE STRONGLY, INVESTORS UNDAUNTED BY RATE HIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a day when investors and traders had their sights
set on the long holiday weekend, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose almost 73 points Friday, reaching a new high for the first
time in seven weeks. The two other marquee stock indexes set
records for the third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, where pre-holiday trading finished early, at
2 p.m., prices were unchanged to slightly higher, although the
Labor Department reported stronger-than-expected job growth in June
and said that hourly earnings had jumped 3.7 percent in the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   For the stock market, this week's rally seemed more like one
that would follow a Federal Reserve rate cut, rather than the
quarter-point increase in its short-term interest rate target that
central bank officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished up 5.6 percent for the week, its best
performance since October 1998, when the recovery began from the
stock selloff during the height of last year's global financial
crisis. The NASDAQ composite index rose 6.8 percent for the week
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors seemed to be buoyed by the other Fed announcement
this week _ that it had shifted its interest rate outlook from a
bias toward higher rates to neutral.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished Friday at 11,139.24, up 72.82 points, or 0.7
percent. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 10.26 points, or 0.7 percent, to
1,391.22. The NASDAQ climbed 34.83 points, or 1.3 percent, to
2,741.01.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bond market, there is much more concern about the
Fed. While the stock market is at new highs, interest rates _ even
after falling sharply this week _ are still above where they were
in May, when the Fed first indicated that a rate increase was in
the offing.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 100
11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
stayed at 6 percent. On Wednesday, the yield had dipped to 5.96
percent. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to
Fed interest rates moves, was unchanged 5.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report that 268,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs were
created last month led analysts to say that another rate increase
was still likely _ although in the immediate wake of the Fed
announcement Wednesday, many had thought one rate increase might be
enough to slow economic growth and curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing the Fed said told me that a rate increase was off the
table,'' said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J.P. Morgan
Securities, adding that upcoming data, including June's Consumer
Price Index and July's jobs report, will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   William Dudley, the chief U.S. economist at Goldman, Sachs,
agreed. ``The conditions that prompted the Fed to act this time,''
he said, ``will probably be in place at their next meeting'' in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had a hard time, however, explaining why the bond
market did not sell off after the jobs report was released. Trading
was light and that often results in distorted moves. And although
another rate increase may be ahead, the statement the Fed made on
Wednesday led some investors to conclude that the central bank will
not have to raise interest rates sharply to slow the economy, as it
did in 1994. In seven moves then, the Fed raised the federal funds
rate _ its short-term interest rate target _ to 6 percent from 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And if no big interest rate run-up is expected, then rates may
be near their peak, which would make buying now attractive to many
bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are more inclined to be buyers on the dips'' in bond
prices, Connor said, because they think that interest rates will
not move much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the stock market performance is a little easier. The
healthy economy is good for corporate earnings and interest rates
have not moved high enough yet to cloud the outlook. If the Fed
gets the economy to slow with just two or three quarter-point rate
increases, interest rates should begin to decline again, giving
stocks some added support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are not high enough to kill off the very
positive outlook for corporate earnings in the second, third and
fourth quarters,'' Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First
Albany Corp., said.
</P>
<P>
   But because Friday's rally came on below-average volume on a day
when many traders were away, a new look on Tuesday could make some
investors take a pause at these new highs.

STEVENSON BECOMES FIRST QUALIFIER TO REACH WIMBLEDON SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ With a curtsey in every direction and a
giddy grin on her face, 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson, the San
Diego phenom who selected Wimbledon for her professional coming-out
party, Friday became the first female qualifier ever to reach the
semifinals here, a coup she achieved by defeating another
qualifier, 129th-ranked Jelena Dokic of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson used an abundance of power and sheer determination to
overwhelm Dokic, the 16-year-old Belgrade-born stylist, in the
resumption of their rain-wracked quarterfinal, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. Dokic
had been serving for the second set Thursday when drizzle and
darkness postponed its resolution overnight. And Friday Stevenson,
whose controversial run here now includes official confirmation
from the basketball Hall of Famer Julius Erving that he is her
biological father, was by far the stronger contender.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely semifinalist also emerged from the day's other, and
somewhat overlooked, quarterfinal when 17-year-old Mirjana Lucic
recovered from a 4-6, 3-3 deficit against eighth-seeded Nathalie
Tauziat and, when their rain-postponed encounter resumed Friday,
upset last year's runner-up, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. The 134th-ranked Lucic,
who now tackles the seven-time champion Steffi Graf, became the
lowest-ranked player to reach a Wimbledon semi in the Open Era.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stevenson, Lucic is no stranger to parent-generated
controversy. After losing in the second round here last year, Lucic
fled Zagreb and relocated in Florida with her mother and siblings
after accusing her father/coach, Marinko, of physical and emotional
abuse. But Lucic has put her family strife behind her and, assisted
by coach Joe Giuliano, has focused on fine-tuning the power game
that not only won her comparisons to Graf but two years ago carried
her to a title in her first professional event.
</P>
<P>
   Now both Lucic and Stevenson, now coached by Craig Kardon,
Martina Navratilova's final mentor, hope to disrupt the progress of
the two veterans who stand between them and an all-teenage finale
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always my favorite player, definitely, but she
definitely won't be my hero tomorrow,'' said Lucic of Graf, who
holds a 2-0 edge in their head-to-head meetings. Graf, the
30-year-old German, seems to be hitting yet another zenith
following last month's French Open championship, which brought her
a 22d career slam.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson made it clear that Sampras, and not third-seeded
Lindsay Davenport, her semifinal opponent, has always been her
favorite player: ``I didn't really follow her,'' said Stevenson.
``I mostly followed Pete Sampras and the guys. I just think it will
be a great match; it's going to be good for American tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch Stevenson, groomed for greatness since she was
3 by the same succession of coaches who mentored the five-time
Wimbledon champion Sampras, was assisted by 15 aces, one shy of the
women's record at Wimbledon, in her defeat of the equally
precocious Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Stevenson nailed down her spot in the semifinals by
breaking Dokic in the sixth game of the final set. Dokic started
the game with a doublefault, popped out another to trail 15-40, and
blooped a forehand volley long to fall behind 4-2. Though Stevenson
doublefaulted on her first match point, she converted her second
when Dokic sent a forehand crosscourt out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, you'll see a bit more of Dokic in the future,''
said Dokic afterwards. ``It's tough to say for both of us if this
is a once-in-a-lifetime tournament or if from here you're actually
going to go on. I'm not worrying who's going to be there; I'm sort
of waiting for myself to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the 1998 U.S. Open champion who's probably the least
controversial player on the tour, and Stevenson, arguably the most
controversial since John McEnroe made his bombastic debut here 22
years ago, actually do have a few things in common: their high
school diplomas and games grounded on unadulterated power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always hit the ball, just gone for it and, I mean, to
win, to win you have to just go for it, and over the years I've
gotten more control, so that's better,'' said Stevenson. Too, the
prodigy said her tunnel vision on winning this title has enabled
her to block out distractions ranging from much-quoted remarks
allegedly made by her sportswriter/mother, Samantha, on the
proliferation of racism and lesbianism on the women's tour to the
news media feeding frenzy about Erving's paternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite oblivious to most of it,'' said Stevenson, who has
supported her mother's opinions but has so far refused comment on
her father's identity. When pressed about her heritage, Stevenson
has referred to herself as African-American and Caucasian.
</P>
<P>
   About the most remarkable, and remarked-on, trip to a Wimbledon
semifinal since McEnroe rose out of the qualifying rounds in 1977,
Stevenson waxed patriotic: ``I think it's right that it's been two
Americans,'' she said. ``I think it's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory vaulted the self-assured Stevenson into her first
career semifinal at her first career Grand Slam event. Besides
Stevenson, only Chris Evert in 1972 and Anna Kournikova in 1997
have attained the semifinals in their Wimbledon debut.

AT UNIVERSITY, ULTRA ORTHODOX MOVE THEIR WORLD APART A BIT CLOSER
TO SECULAR ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BNEI BRAK, Israel _ In a nondescript building, up a flight of
stairs and behind unmarked doors, a dozen ultra-Orthodox men sat
hunched over desks, furiously coloring away.
</P>
<P>
   With their black hats by their sides and a pile of crayons at
their feet, they sketched rainy skies, fruit trees and apartment
buildings topped with solar collectors _ whatever it took to
express themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Mayevsky, who is 49, proudly displayed his artwork, a
maritime scene with a roiling blue sea, a boat and a life raft.
After a brief, almost Talmudic discussion about whether his colors
were intentional or just a result of the crayons that befell him,
Mayevsky analyzed his creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at sea, in trouble,'' he said, pointing to a figure in the
water. ``The life raft, adrift, is where my family and I used to
be. Now I'm splashing about in the wisdom of my professor's
teaching. I'm trying to enter his world, to climb up on the big
boat. I have a fear of sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   They are painstakingly revealing words, and pretty touchy-feely
stuff for a roomful of Torah scholars. But Mayevsky and his fellow
students are engaged in a quiet, almost secret revolution: They are
getting a secular education.
</P>
<P>
   With the laboriously negotiated permission of the rabbis, they
are stepping out of their cloistered religious universe to train in
a three-year social work program at one of Israel's two largest
universities, Bar Ilan. This is almost unheard of in Israel, for
ultra-Orthodox men to seek the tools _ and degrees _ offered by a
secular Israeli university in order to take them back into their
own world.
</P>

   ``I, Berger, am making history,'' said Rabbi Reuven Berger, 50,
a Hasidic Jew and one of the students. ``People ask me, `Why? At
your age?' But I don't like to read history. I like to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The social work program is one of a growing number of recent
signals that the ultra-Orthodox, or as they are known here, the
haredim _ literally, those who tremble before God _ are starting to
negotiate a new relationship between their own society and larger
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects the ultra-Orthodox leaders' increasing
willingness to acknowledge that their community has social problems
that require professional help.

   The so-called world apart has always been a little more
integrated in Israeli society than secularists acknowledge _ there
have long been mixed neighborhoods and participation in the system
by haredi political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many haredi women, who are often the breadwinners, hold jobs in
secular Israel.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Still, until recently haredi men have largely stayed away from
three key worlds: higher education, the army and the secular
workforce. Now, that wall is starting to crumble. Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak signed a groundbreaking agreement with
religious leaders this week, in fact, that will bring more haredim
into the army and thousands more into the economic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to breaching the iron gate between the haredi world
and the universities, the social work program will create a
professional cadre of ultra-Orthodox social workers, who can better
understand the cultural and religious norms of the haredi world.
There are a few ultra-Orthodox women who are social workers, but,
in a society rigidly divided by gender, there was an especially
great need for male professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Under a special deal with the university, the students _ 18 men,
ranging in age from 25 to 56 _ attend class in rented space in Bnei
Brak, an ultra-Orthodox city and one of the poorest places in
Israel. They rarely step foot on the Bar Ilan campus in the
neighboring, affluent community of Ramat Gan, where they would have
to mix with what they consider immodestly dressed women. And their
professors, in a field dominated by women, are all men.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The program grew out of extraordinary negotiations between
Bar-Ilan and the rabbis, which involved compromises on both sides.
Despite the rabbis' qualms about the teachings of Freud, for
instance, he _ and Carl Jung _ remain in the curriculum, although
there are no budding Freudians in the class

   ``Everyone knows that without sex, the world doesn't exist,''
Mayevsky said. ``But to boil down the rich and complex essence of
humanity to just this _ well, I think it's exaggerated. And, yes, I
was startled by my initial confrontation with such thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Israel _ unlike the United States, where many haredim attend
universities and receive professional training _ the community has
been officially devoted to the study of Torah. Originally, this was
intended to keep alive a dying tradition. But as the ultra-Orthodox
community has burgeoned, many within it have questioned, at the
very least, the economic practicality of having most working-age
men remain outside the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   The military draft issue further complicated the matter. To
defer conscription, haredi men had to swear that they were studying
Torah full-time until they reached the age of 35 (or 41, depending
on how many children they had.). The agreement that Barak initialed
this week would lower that age to 24, ushering thousands of young
men into the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   If this happens, vocational institutes will have to spring up
quickly to train men who do not have high school degrees. Some
self-run training centers have opened within the haredi world in
the last few years, and Technion University has helped run a
computer technology training program in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the first university degree program tailored to
haredi men, and Moshe Kaveh, the president of Bar-Ilan, thinks it
will open the way for an influx of haredim into the university.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Ilan University has long co-existed uneasily with its
ultra-Orthodox neighbors in Bnei Brak, because Bar-Ilan is a
liberal, modern Orthodox institution, with a majority of secular
students. From each direction, there has been mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Many ultra-Orthodox look down on the modern Orthodox, who
maintain that religion can be integrated into modern life, as
compromised, or half-way, Jews. The modern Orthodox, in turn, often
using very paternalistic language, have tended to see the haredim
as backward and ghettoized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is a real break-through, believe me,'' Kaveh, the
president of Bar-Ilan, said. ``Behind the scenes when I met all
these rabbis, they hesitated very much. They're afraid. They want
to isolate their people. To let them participate is to take a
chance. I don't even like talking about it, because they might say,
`Oy vey, look what we have done. Tomorrow we will not have students
in the yeshiva and everyone will join the modern world.'''

 BNEI BRAK, Israel: modern world.'''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Ribner, a modern Orthodox Jew who directs the social work
program at Bar-Ilan, said the haredi community's readiness to
recognize its own problems _ from child abuse and neglect to
domestic violence _ was crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they are ready to present an image to the world that
doesn't have to be holier than the pope,'' Ribner said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students are already involved in charity or social
work in their community, although they have no formal training.
They are a very open, gregarious bunch. Although even an interview
with this newspaper had to be negotiated with the rabbis _ via a
liaison in New York _ the men themselves were completely
comfortable talking and burst with pride in their pioneering
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous and risky, this exposure,'' Rabbi Berger said.
``But it's part of the process of the haredi community becoming
part of the Israeli reality.''
</P>
<P>

   As part of the screening of applicants, Professor Ribner said,
men were asked to imagine the feelings of a religious woman who had
given birth to a baby with severe defects. If the applicants could
not consider the possibility that the woman might be angry at God,
they were not accepted because it was believed that their dogma
would get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Mayevsky said he feels comfortable navigating between two
worlds, because he grew up as a religious Zionist and served in the
army before he ``went black,'' in his words. After finishing his
yeshiva studies, he studied Torah for 12 years in a kollel, an
advanced Torah studies institute for married students who get by on
a state stipend and the earnings of their wives.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mayevsky said he has always been concerned with the number of
wayward youths among the haredi whose problems, like sexual
offenses, were being ``swept under the carpet.'' Often, haredi
families are unwilling to acknowledge mental illness, for instance,
because it is considered to taint their daughters and make them
undesirable marriage partners.
</P>
<P>
   He helped start a residential school in Rosh Haayin for
teenagers with problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when I first realized that I was handicapped without
a degree,'' he said. ``The Labor and Welfare Ministry officials
said, ``Who are you? You're not trained.' They felt we would be
opening up a lower-level facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The school hired a few professionals, either haredi women who
had trained abroad or modern-Orthodox men. Mayevsky said he was
upset that he himself was relegated to administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the dream of my life to work with this population,'' he
said. ``I was born to help. Still, when I started this program, it
was mostly to get the degree so I had the official sanction of
government authorities. Then, slowly, I realized that I had
something to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayevsky said his life has turned upside down, emotionally, as
the course work has demanded that he explore his feelings for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have conflicts in my head that go back 30 years,'' he said.
``Now I'm struggling through all this confronting. If I had done
this earlier, I probably would have conducted my own life very
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayevsky and Rabbi Berger said the fact that their community
distrusts social workers from the outside world makes it harder for
problems to be addressed and resolved. An outsider might bring with
him value judgments about community norms, seeing certain
traditions _ like arranged marriages _ as pathologies.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The men said they would obey the law and report criminal
behavior in their community to the police. But, Rabbi Berger said,
the police often do far less than the community would.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, a haredi man ``known for starting up with
young male children'' was recently reported to the police, who
conducted a half-hearted investigation and dropped the matter. A
group of rabbis then paid him ``a friendly visit,'' Rabbi Berger
said, and told him that if he didn't seek help, ``we would
publicize his situation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Rabbi Berger, this worked.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In his field work at a psychiatric hospital, Rabbi Berger, who
exudes calm and compassion, took on a suicidal patient that none of
the credentialed professionals could reach. The patient, a homeless
ultra-Orthodox man, had set a specific time and way to kill
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe _ I know _ that my presence in this case as a haredi
man gave this person the faith to work on,'' Rabbi Berger said.
``The problem came after many months, when he was much better. I
was forced to separate from him, because that is the dictate of my
new profession. He was very hurt and angry, and I felt guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had been the biggest hurdle as they breached the wall
between their community and the outside world, Mayevsky and Rabbi
Berger conferred, stroking their beards.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi spoke for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiple choice tests,'' he said.

DEBATE RAGES OVER HOW TO MEASURE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Monday, July 5) 
(Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A year after California's voters threw out
bilingual education for non-English speaking students in favor of
``English immersion,'' school districts are interpreting the law
widely, and the political debate now rages over measuring its
success.
</P>
<P>
   A county grand jury reported last week that the Los Angeles
Unified School District, the largest and most influential in the
state, is abusing the anti-bilingual education law by continuing to
teach large numbers of children in their native language under the
guise of a program called ``Structured English Immersion Model B.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury report came on the heels of a statistical foul-up
in the compilation of statewide achievement test scores,
invalidating, at least temporarily, what looked like promising
academic gains this year for many of the state's 1.4 million
children with limited English.
</P>
<P>
   As state officials try to sort out how well the students with
limited English actually performed on those tests, a bill is
working its way through the State Assembly that would remove a
large percentage of limited-English students from the testing
program.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Unz, the Palo Alto software tycoon behind Proposition 227,
which ended bilingual education, says the move to exempt limited
English students from the achievement test program is outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   But Unz is not concerned about the varying levels of compliance
across the state, predicting parents will force stricter compliance
from reluctant teachers and administrators if they see stricter
enforcement producing results in other school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this first year of massive change, I'm reasonably
satisfied,'' Unz said. Unz was still crowing about some of the
Stanford 9 achievement test results for limited-English students,
even though the company which administers the test has admitted
that it garbled the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In measuring the students' progress, the testing company lumped
the scores of children still classified as ``limited English
proficient'' along with those who would be redesignated as fluent,
artificially inflating the scores of those learning English during
this first year under Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   Unz says he's cautiously optimistic that the scores of
limited-English students still will show dramatic improvement once
the test scores are corrected. ``Assuming the (Stanford 9) numbers
hold up, I think we'll see a sea change in people's attitudes about
bilingual education across the country,'' Unz said.
</P>
<P>
   Unz says he may yet pursue legal action to force better
compliance in districts such as Los Angeles, where the grand jury
charged teachers and administrators who oppose the law have mounted
active campaigns to circumvent it.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco school district is still operating the same
bilingual program it ran before Proposition 227 passed, having
successfully argued for an exemption under a previous federal court
order.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the loudest and most consistent critics of Proposition
227, the leadership of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Education Fund, argue that Stanford 9 test scores, accurate or not,
are not a good measure of Proposition 227's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a quiet revolution in education in California,''
said Theresa Fay-Bustillos, MALDEF vice president of legal
programs. She cited new phonics-based reading programs instituted
at the early grades, class size reduction, after-school programs
and tutoring programs for both students and parents as other
factors that could be expected to affect achievement test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think testing, per se, is a bad idea,'' Fay-Bustillos
said. ``But how much of any gain in test scores can you attribute
to 227?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do those (scoring) spikes really mean that child has kept up
with fluent English peers _ not necessarily,'' she said. ``Does it
mean they've gained enough English literacy skills to compete in an
English-only classroom? Not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oceanside Unified School District near San Diego was being
touted as a remarkable Proposition 227 success story with double
and even triple-digit academic gains before the problem with the
test scores surfaced. Superintendent Kenneth Noonan says his own
district statistician has rerun the numbers accurately, ``And we
still look pretty good. The percentage of gain is different. But in
the primary grades, especially, we look good.''
</P>
<P>
   With the amended comparison of scores, Noonan said, it looks
like limited English students in the second grade (for example)
showed a 92 percent gain in reading when compared to second-grade
scores the year before. The incorrectly inflated figures showed
that group making a 100 percent gain in reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told any percentage gain over five to 10 percent is
significant,'' Noonan said. But what makes Noonan's district
interesting, beyond what the children score on standardized tests,
is the superintendent's history and political background.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan was the founding president of the California Association
of Bilingual Educators and opposed Proposition 227, but decided
after the vote that he had no choice but to enforce the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Districts across the state have enforced the law as they have
seen fit because they got little guidance from the state, Noonan
said.
</P>
<P>
   But granting waivers to parents who wanted native-language
instruction for their children, he decided, was a provision the law
allowed only for special cases. Other districts in the state have
granted waivers generously, resulting in some districts with large
numbers of students continuing in traditional bilingual classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkley school district sued the state for permission to
waive the English-only requirement for their entire limited-English
population. And the grand jury report released last week charged
that anti-Proposition 227 administrators and staff in the Los
Angeles district mounted active campaigns to promote the waivers.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the district's limited English students
received those waivers and were taught in traditional bilingual
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also charged that the district's ``Model B''
track for limited English students continued to teach 117,000
children their core academic subjects in their native language.
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, Noonan got about 150 requests for waivers. But the
superintendent and a specially formed committee granted only five
in Oceanside, not enough to form a single bilingual classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have some political pressure in town,'' Noonan said.
</P>
<P>
   Upset parents, led by community activists, marched on the school
board. And Noonan said the first few months of English immersion
were tough on the children as well as his teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle. I watched these teachers, and I wanted to
cry for 'em. I have a master's degree in bilingual education. Some
of them did, too,'' Noonan said. ``We just took a real tough line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were dire predictions _ that kids would not progress, go
into culture shock. But the test results (even with less dramatic
gains) show quite the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   And Noonan said part of his evaluation of the new approach is
based on what he has observed. By the second semester, the
landscape in his school district had changed. ``I always kneel down
(in the classrooms) and ask individual students to read to me,''
Noonan said. ``I noted a significant increase in their ability to
read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see as the year went on things would be better than we
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay-Bustillos says the true measure of Proposition 227's success
will be whether students can become sufficiently fluent in English
after one year to compete with their English-speaking peers. That's
best determined by the number of students who are redesignated by
school officials as fluent in English at the end of a school year,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Orange County school districts that abandoned bilingual
education even before Proposition 227 passed saw their
redesignation rates drop this year. Unz argues that there is no
statewide standard for redesignation, and that schools are
frequently not aggressive about testing children for redesignation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unz is aware of the bilingual education debate emerging in the
Houston Independent School District, and is full of questions about
the public attitude toward native language instruction in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But while Unz is helping activists in Arizona who are attempting
to outlaw that state's bilingual program, he says he's not involved
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we haven't focused on Texas is they don't
have the initiative process,'' Unz conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But if California students enrolled in English immersion classes
score well on standardized tests, he argues, Texas parents will
notice the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those leaders in Houston and elsewhere may finally re-evaluate
their position on bilingual,'' Unz said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston school trustees voted last month on a bilingual
education policy that emphasizes ``the ability to read, write and
speak English as rapidly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the proposal have labeled it ``an advocacy vehicle
for the English-only movement.'' But the board members promoting it
say it is designed to move children into English-speaking classes
once they've achieved reading proficiency in English.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Rodriguez, president of the Parents for Public Schools of
Houston, said that Houston parents will have an opportunity to
speak out about the proposal at a meeting sponsored by the
organization July 14 at the Museum of Fine Arts.

   ``We are not for the proposal, we are not against the

understand how the public feels about this and take that input to
the board for their consideration.'' &QL;

   EAGLE RECOVERS FROM EXTINCTION IN TIME FOR HOLIDAY
</P>
<P>
   850&AMP;ADD
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Deans
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton kicked off the Fourth of July
weekend Friday by
</P>
<P>
   proclaiming that the nation's living symbol is no longer
threatened, marking the bald eagle's dramatic recovery from the
edge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The once ravaged eagle population has increased fourteen fold _
enough to ensure its survival well into the next century _ during
three decades of aggressive environmental management, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle's comeback illustrates the value of continued
environmental vigilance, said Clinton, whose multi-billion-dollar
proposals to expand protections for wildlife and natural areas have
come under fire by a budget-conscious Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his remarks on the White House lawn, as a
magnificent brown-feathered eagle crowned with ivory plumes looked
on from a rope-wrapped brass perch framing an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   He used the announcement to press for congressional support for
a White House plan to spend $7.8 billion over the next 20 years to
restore the Florida Everglades. Decades of development have
destroyed or threatened thousands of acres of the irreplacable
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think of a better way to celebrate the birth of a
nation than to celebrate the rebirth of our national symbol,'' said
Clinton, moments before a military band played America the
Beautiful as a row of flags rimming the south portico billowed in a
refreshing summer breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have the bald eagle back,'' said Clinton, who
survived the threat of political extinction himself, ``let's get
the spirit behind the bald eagle back, and put America back on a
bipartisan course of conservation of our natural resources.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were sporadically punctuated by the haunting screech
of Challenger. The celebrity eagle is familiar to Atlanta Braves
fans for his breathtaking flights from the upper seats at Turner
Field to home plate during the singing of the Star Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done three season openers at the Braves games,'' said
Challenger's trainer, Al Cecere. ``He flies into the stadium and
lands on my glove.''
</P>
<P>
   The living symbol of American freedom and might, the bald eagle
once seemed to be almost everywhere _ on the back of dollar bills,
capping schoolyard flagpoles and even fronting the presidential
seal _ except in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   By 1963, hunters, pesticides and encroachment upon nesting and
feeding grounds had so devastated eagle populations that only 417
breeding pairs remained in the United States, outside of Alaska and
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, eagles and their habitat began receiving
federal protection under the legislative precursor to the 1973
Endangered Species Act. In 1972, the country banned the use of DDT,
a pesticide that wrought havoc on eagle eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most important of all, we made the Endangered Species Act the
law of the land,'' said Clinton, ``declaring that extinction is not
an option _ not for the eagle, not for other creatures put here by
God.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, the eagle had recovered sufficiently to be taken off of
the endangered species list and assigned the less critical denotion
of ``threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   At last count, there were nearly 5,800 breeding pairs of eagles
across the lower 48 states. Clinton said Friday that the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service has proposed taking the bald eagle off of the
list of threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   The public has 90 days to comment on the proposal. The agency
would then evaluate the public's remarks and consider whether to
formally delist the eagle a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle would remain protected under the provisions of a
70-year-old federal ban on killing or trapping eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be legally no less protected,'' said Resse Collins,
director of the center for birds of prey for the Florida Audubon
Society. ``You can't harm the birds themselves, nor can you harm
their habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pressing Congress to support his Everglades
initiative, Clinton called for support for his proposals to
increase by at least $2 billion a year federal spending to protect
natural areas and greenspaces.
</P>
<P>
   He's waging an uphill battle. Committees in the Republican-led
House and Senate have both voted to slash his requests by more than
half.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed Friday to fight for the increase and Collins, one
of several environmental activists invited to attend Friday's
announcement, said the eagle's comeback proves that investing in
environmental protection pays off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory that they came back, but it's because we
cleaned the water, we cleaned the habitat we cleaned the land,''
said Collins, of Maitland, Fl.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Florida is home to some 1,000 mating pairs of eagles, more than
the other lower 48 states. There are 37 mating pairs in Georgia, 62
in Texas and 47 in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger is a striking if unique example of the bird of prey
that symbolizes strength and freedom to millions of Americans.
Blown from his nest in the Louisiana woodlands before he knew how
to fly, Challenger has spent his life in the care of other
predators _ humans _ and has never mastered the unforgiving art of
living off the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know how to hunt,'' said Cecere, Challenger's
trainer and president of the National Foundation to Protect
America's Eagles, located in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Challenger has
been released twice in the countryside, only to quickly find his
way back to the nurturing bosom of society, said Cecere.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's his job to keep Challenger off the dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feed him quail, trout, a little beefheart sometimes,'' he
said, as Challenger looked on from the shadow of the White House,
his black and golden talons sheathed in the thick leather manacles
that bind him earthbound to Cecere, civilization and celebrity.

<P>
   PARIS _ The Tour de France, one of Europe's legendary sporting
events, will draw 180 of the finest bicycle riders in the world
Saturday to a theme park in western France. From there, they will
embark on the Tour's annual three-week race to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, an estimated 15 million people line the race
route and another 160 million worldwide watch on television. And in
a typical year, Daniel Baal would be among the most interested
spectators. Baal is the president of the French Cycling Federation
and a vice president of the International Cycling Union, which
governs the sport worldwide. But Baal said he had been unable to
watch a bicycle race this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not able to believe any longer in the sport,'' he said,
citing the repeated drug scandals that had rocked the world of
elite cycling over the past year. ``I haven't seen a race yet. I
can't watch a fake spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   An air of profound pessimism hangs over the sport of cycling,
and it hangs heavier than usual with the Tour de France about to
begin, for it was during last year's race that the depths of the
sport's drug problem was laid bare. Since then, cycling, the sport
that for Europe has been a cultural treasure as well as a
formidable commercial enterprise, has suffered a collapse in
credibility so great that many of its riders, organizers and
sponsors fear for its future.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Tour de France champion, Marco Pantani of Italy, was
recently thrown out of the Tour of Italy because of suspected drug
use, and weeks after that, four cyclists failed blood tests during
the Tour of Switzerland. Perhaps most dispiriting, 11 riders
competing in last month's Tour of Italy amateur race, which is used
as a kind of prep race for young cyclists, also failed blood tests
that indicate drug use.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, nearly a dozen commercial sponsors of cycling
teams and races across Europe have formally expressed concern that
the sport is in peril, and two, Coca-Cola and the French bank
Credit Lyonnais, have threatened to end their millions of dollars
in financing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, criminal investigations aimed at cracking
Continent-wide drug rings go on in France, and earlier this year
the No. 1 book on France's list of best-selling nonfiction was a
tell-all book by Willy Voet, a former employee of France's top
cycling team, that details how riders bought drugs, cheated on drug
tests and undermined the notion of pure competition in one of
Europe's revered sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in cycling took everybody for fools and treated
them like fools _ the journalists and the fans,'' said Voet, the
former masseur for the Festina team who was caught by French
authorities last year in possession of banned drugs days before the
start of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of performance-enhancing drug use, of course, has
plagued virtually all sports in recent years. Football, track and
field and swimming, to name several, have all been bedeviled by
steroids use, and the International Olympic Committee has
identified drug use as the single greatest threat to international
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   But the kind of grim declarations voiced by Voet have echoed
with unique regularity and resonance throughout the world of
cycling _ a sport that annually offers millions of dollars in prize
money and tens of millions of dollars in endorsement deals and
commercial sponsorship. Riders talk with anger and despair,
occasionally with contrition. Organizers, fans and sponsors talk
with both cynicism and urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day it's something new,'' said Bobby Julich, the
American rider who finished third in last year's Tour de France.
``It's pretty hard to stay serious and motivate yourself for the
Tour.'' Of the recent disclosure that young riders in the amateur
division of the Tour of Italy had failed drug tests, Julich said:
``They are 21, 22, 18 even. That breaks your heart, it does, it
really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour, agreed that the
sport's state of crisis was real and deep. And just this week,
Leblanc said, it got worse. Leblanc had attempted to bar four
French riders and an entire Dutch team from the Tour because of
concerns about drugs, but because of a rules technicality, he was
ordered by the world cycling federation to permit Richard Virenque,
a former rider for Festina, to compete. Leblanc had said that
Virenque's ``name and image are the incarnation of doping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been prevented from completing our attempt to restore
the image of the Tour,'' Leblanc said of the decision by the
International Cycling Union. Of the sport's condition generally, he
added, ``Our significance has cracked, just like the public's trust
in us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For decades, cycling, a grueling, glamorous sport in Europe, has
been wrestling with drug use and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Tommy Simpson, a British cyclist, died while competing
in the Tour de France, his death ultimately linked to his use of
amphetamines. Succeeding years brought additional embarrassments:
In 1969, the Belgian star Eddy Merckx was suspended while leading
the Tour of Italy for using amphetamines; in 1978, Michel
Pollentier, another Belgian, was suspended while leading the Tour
de France after he was caught concealing a clean urine sample to
trick testers, and in 1988, Pedro Delgado of Spain won the Tour de
France despite having tested positive for using what is known as a
masking agent, a substance designed to hide drug use, but one that
then was not banned by the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the early 1990s, according to riders and cycling
officials, the sport's top competitors began to experiment with
much more effective and difficult-to-detect drugs, chief among them
erythropoietin, or EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Originally developed to treat kidney disorders, EPO increases
the number of red blood corpuscles that carry oxygen to weary
muscles. Because EPO is a synthetic version of a hormone that
exists naturally in the body, it is hard to detect, even more so
because riders, facing testing, have injected themselves with
saline solution to dilute their blood and mask their EPO use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had doping products in our sport, but there is a
lot of voodoo in these products, and cheaters either believed in
them or they didn't,'' said Hein Verbruggen, president of the
International Cycling Union. ``But EPO is highly effective. It
really increases capacity considerably, and the sad thing is that
many athletes in our sport have felt forced to use it because it is
so effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zulle is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rider, you feel tied into the system,'' Zulle, one of the
six riders for Festina who confessed to EPO use during the 1998
Tour de France, told reporters last year. ``It's like being on the
highway. The law says there's a speed limit of 65, but everyone is
driving 70 or faster. Why should I be the one who obeys the speed
limit?''
</P>
<P>
   Others think the rationale for widespread cheating is more
straightforwardly cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're all addicted to is making cycling _ this painful,
brutal sport _ easy,'' Voet, the former Festina employee, said in
an interview. The Tour de France, for instance, covers more than
2,000 miles, many of them in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Baal, the French Cycling Federation official, agreed. ``I feel
insulted by these riders who climb long hills with their mouths
closed, not even breathing hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the episodes have kept coming, sometimes revealing
individual duplicity, sometimes revealing the extraordinary
dimensions of the drug problem in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with two stages remaining in the Tour of Italy,
Marco Pantani, the bald, bold climber who had won last year's Tour
de France after weeks of drug raids, police interrogations and
rider protests, was comfortably in the lead. Pantani, whose income
from salary and sponsorship deals tops $3 million annually and who
for many represented what might still be engaging about the sport,
failed a blood test. The level of red blood cells in his system
indicated EPO use.
</P>
<P>
   While Pantani denied using EPO, the sport had absorbed another
hit to its integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The blows, though, have been bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a Paris narcotics squad questioned two professional
cyclists _ one of them the rising Belgian star Frank Vandenbroucke
_ as part of its investigation of a supply network for
performance-enhancing drugs. That network was allegedly
orchestrated by two Frenchmen: Bernard Sainz, a homeopathic
practitioner who has treated many riders and is suspected of
practicing medicine without a license, and Bertrand Lavelot, a
lawyer who often represented teams and riders, sometimes in doping
cases. Vandenbroucke and the other rider have been suspended from
their team, pending an investigation, and Sainz and Lavelot remain
in custody, maintaining their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles Smadja, an aide to the French sports minister,
Marie-George Buffet, said the investigation of Sainz and the riders
was a first attempt to take on what authorities believe is a
lucrative market in illicit drugs for sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone from the stage where doping was essentially
rudimentary and individual to the stage where it is now very well
organized with distribution networks and traffickers and
established points of supply,'' Smadja said. ``Doping brings in
more money than crack in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment of fear, anger and suspicion has been toxic.
Police in France have been extremely aggressive in detaining,
searching and questioning riders. And some cyclists call the
testing officials employed by the cycling organizations ``the
vampires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicycle riders have become easy prey,'' said Laurent Jalabert,
a French rider who competes for the Spanish team Once, but who is
refusing to race in the Tour de France this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cyclists,'' Pantani said recently of all the testing,
``not blood donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Days later, he failed a blood test.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1998 Tour scandal _ only 96 of the 198 riders who
started the race finished after the suspensions and protest
withdrawals took their toll _ cycling was arguably the sport second
in popularity behind soccer in several Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major commercial sponsors, who are centered in France,
Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, spend
between $4 million and $6 million annually to assemble teams of
about 20 men. The teams compete for purses great and small, with
the Tour de France's $2 million in total prize money the biggest
payday.
</P>
<P>
   But the cycling circuit has always functioned as a great
advertising gambit, and so sponsors financed the sport as a way of
gaining exposure for products and services ranging from vacuum
cleaners to insurance. According to cycling officials, the total
spent on road racing sponsorship annually is roughly $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among the central worries rippling through the sport then is
whether that kind of financing will diminish if the drug scandals
persist. Though no major sponsors have withdrawn, several are
reconsidering their participation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Coca-Cola, which pays about $3.5 million annually
to be an official partner of the Tour de France, has indicated that
its future involvement depends on how the 1999 race unfolds.
Earlier this month, 10 team sponsors sent an open letter to the
International Cycling Union emphasizing that the sport was ``in
danger'' and asking for stricter medical inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the top races, fearful that equivocation on the
drug problem by riders, officials or sponsors will further sap
public confidence, are closely monitoring attendance figures and
television ratings. The indicators have been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper Le Figaro, France Television's viewer
share for its Tour coverage shrank from 9 percent to 7.4 percent
last year as police raids frequently overshadowed the daily stages.
This spring, as drug episodes continued to claim the sport's top
riders, crowds were thin at a handful of events. Still, the Tour of
Italy drew crowds as big as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the right any longer to trick the fans who
continue to show us affection and support,'' Leblanc, the director
of the Tour de France, said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with one sponsor of the Tour de France, Credit
Lyonnais, said they were gratified that Leblanc had tried to bar
riders from this year's race who had been implicated in drug use.
But the action was decried in some other parts of Europe, including
Spain and the Netherlands, for coming before the legal proceedings
against the riders had been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the cycling circuit and its badly tarnished crown
jewel, the Tour de France, will unfold under considerable pressure.
Every competitor will have his blood tested before the race begins,
and there will be frequent testing of the leaders and random
testing of other racers throughout the event. Leblanc, a former
professional rider, has made it clear that he will resign if this
year's race becomes another fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the scope and regularity of the drug scandals have forced a
kind of healthy self-examination on the world of cycling, they have
also underscored how difficult finding a way out of the morass
might be. After all, one of the things that recent revelations have
made clear is how clever riders and their assistants can be in
defeating detection.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, cyclists were subject to urine tests only, and
during the Tour de France, daily tests were given to two race
leaders and two other riders selected at random. During the last
decade, the Tour reported only one positive test. And despite
riders' agreeing to more detailed blood testing in 1997, EPO use
evidently continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
   But Voet, in his confessional book, argues that cheating was
routine. He writes of planting clean urine samples inside bathrooms
where drug tests were to take place. He also claims that some
cyclists passed drug tests by inserting condoms full of clean urine
into their anuses _ condoms that were attached to plastic tubes
taped to their scrotums so they could feign urinating.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Voet, who remains under investigation by
French authorities, is not optimistic about a cleaner future for
the sport. ``The thieves have left the scene of the crime. They
already have shifted to something else,'' he said, saying that EPO
and other standard cheating drugs were now being improved upon.
``Now, it's synthetic hemoglobin or interleukin or products which
augment the oxygen level in muscles without raising the red blood
cell count.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbruggen, the president of the International Cycling Union,
shares the worry. ``In the near future, we will have genetic
manipulation,'' he said. ``There is a role for governments here.''
</P>
<P>
   The French have been the most aggressive in going after drugs in
sports. In March, a doping law was passed in France that
established maximum prison terms of seven years for trafficking in
banned performance-enhancing substances and instituted fines of up
to 1 million francs ($160,000). Under the new law, police have been
given wider powers to search and investigate.
</P>
<P>
   It is Marie-George Buffet, the sports minister who assumed her
post in 1997, who is behind the French forcefulness. The annual
antidoping budget in France has increased by more than 50 percent
this year to 25.5 million francs, and Buffet has asked for 115
million francs next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a long fight,'' Buffet said. ``A problem like
doping is never solved only by passing a law.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, no other European nation has comparable
penalties against trafficking in sports drugs. Earlier this month,
though, the ministers or secretaries in charge of sport in the 15
member nations of the European Union held a first-ever meeting in
which they discussed ways of unifying their widely divergent
antidoping legislation. And Giovanna Melandri, the minister who
oversees sport in Italy, is proposing a law similar to France's in
her country's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we are looking at it seriously is that we do
believe it has become a serious social problem,'' Melandri said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, there are questions about just how
committed the sport's riders and officials are to ending drug use.
The international federation's tests for EPO use measure a rider's
red blood cell count against what would be regarded as normal for a
fit athlete. But many people have complained that the test is too
lenient and allows for a degree of calculated cheating, riders
using just enough EPO to have their red blood cell count approach,
but not exceed the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe, as a result, that the greatest hope for an
effective system to counteract doping lies with the model being
developed by the French.
</P>
<P>
   The French Cycling Federation requires its riders to take four
annual medical tests. The idea is to establish a detailed and
carefully monitored portrait of a competitor's biological
characteristics from an early age, against which officials might
document any irregularities that develop suggesting doping.
</P>
<P>
   The new French law requires athletes to possess a medical
certificate to compete, and doctors who detect signs of doping in
an athlete are required to withhold the certificate, inform the
athlete of the risks and then transmit the information to a medical
supervisor. The procedure is required to be confidential, and
doctors who fail to follow it are subject to disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the Tour de France starting today, everyone in
cycling is holding his breath. And the riders understand they face
a long stretch of suspicion, fair or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very bad situation for cyclists,'' said Johan Bruyneel,
a Belgian who is the sports director for the U.S. Postal Service
team that competes in Europe. ``Everywhere we go, people look at us
almost as if we're criminals.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Slowly, life is returning.
</P>
<P>
   Cafes do brisk business amid the NATO tanks, a hair salon opens
in the rubble, a bar restocks beer, and people are once again
crowding the streets of Kosovo's provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   There are reunion scenes on every corner, especially the
open-arm greetings of friends and neighbors and families thrilled
to see each other alive.
</P>
<P>
   Stacatto conversations rattle through cafes as people recount
their ordeals of survival and harrowing tales of escape. And then
there are the sad silences _ the shakes of the head in recognition
of someone who was lost, or perhaps still missing, of homes burned
and businesses destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   After three months in the hunger and cold of a mountain pass
near Albania, Nejmia Luma, 28, finally made it home this week. On
Thursday, she celebrated her freedom in a chair at Menda's Salon,
which was packed with women awaiting the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a mess,'' said Luma, an accountant. ``We lived like
animals. They tried to reduce us to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me,'' she said, facing the mirror, her face leathered
by sun and wind and her hair thickly matted. Luma winced as a
female hairdresser pulled hard with a brush, trying to tease the
tangles out of her long, black hair.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, Luma had been too fearful to walk Pristina
streets that were increasingly dominated by Serb paramilitaries.
Even in the months before the war, she said, she would go downtown
only for necessities, such as food shopping and seeing family, but
nothing so extravagant as having her hair done. On March 26, two
days after the NATO bombing began, she and her family fled.
</P>
<P>
   Living under plastic tarps and huddling under the few blankets
they had, she and some 20 members of an extended clan were
surrounded by Serb paramilitary units for three months. The Serb
forces had placed land mines around the camp, making it impossible
to leave. It was only Wednesday that she had been helicoptered out
of the pass by international aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   She checked on family and friends first. She ate a decent meal.
But the first thing she did on the first morning after her return
was get her hair done. The first time in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had to look like a human being again,'' she
explained. ``I want to be able to hold my head up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanian refugees are flooding back at a rate faster
than they fled the Serb forces' terror. An estimated 550,000 of the
800,000 refugees have come home, UN and aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   The towns of Djakovica, Drenica, and Pec were hard hit by Serb
forces. There are more land mines and mass graves. But the capital
is relatively in tact, and it is remarkable how quickly it is
flowering anew amid the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   But the NATO tanks rumbling past are a constant reminder things
are far from normal. So are the mine clearance teams in heavy
kevlar uniforms, and the British paratroopers walking in formation
with machine guns drawn.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a solemn procession for some 2,000 Kosovar Albanian
prisoners still missing wound its way through the streets. Mirdita
Sorej, 25, led the march, carrying a large white placard that was
left blank. Her brother, Ali, 22, is among the missing. His
four-year-old daughter walked alongside Mirdita holding a
wallet-size picture of her father, who was arrested on his way home
from work at a grocery store on March 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lives will go on,'' Sorej said, looking in the direction
of the crowded cafes and bars along Pristina's main street. ``But
not ours. Not until our brothers and fathers come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadrush Sulejmni, 59, a writer and editor for several of
Kosovo's news magazines, was among that crowd getting on with life.
He was elated as he sat at his favorite cafe and ordered a
cappucino served in elegant white china cups with saucers.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, a Serb neighbor he had known for 20 years guided
paramilitaries to his home, and his family was forced out at
gunpoint. His wife and their three sons fled to Macedonia, but he
stayed in Pristina and kept a journal for the 79 days he was on the
run. He slept in one empty house after another and foraged for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was smiling as he plunked four sugar cubes into his
coffee at Cafe Koha, saying almost guiltily as if he were talking
to his dentist, ``No sugar in three months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a hard-working people,'' he said. ``We will get our
feet back on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   A grocery store was replacing glass windows that had been
smashed. At a clothing store, a man was straightening up female
manequins that had been knocked over and stripped of their clothes.
A restaurant owner was sweeping out the rubble from inside a fire-
blackened dining room. There was a handwritten sign that read, ``We
will serve soup tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Safete Rogova, 38, a well-known actress in Kosovo's provincial
theater, she had just returned after fleeing to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the curtain opening on a play,'' she said to a
friend as they marvelled at the streets just starting to bustle
with action. ``The characters begin moving. The set comes alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would never return,'' she says. ``I can't believe
my eyes.''

   PARIS _ The Tour de France, one of Europe's legendary sporting
events, will draw 180 of the finest bicycle riders in the world
Saturday to a theme park in western France. From there, they will
embark on the Tour's annual three-week race to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, an estimated 15 million people line the race
route and another 160 million worldwide watch on television. And in
a typical year, Daniel Baal would be among the most interested
spectators. Baal is the president of the French Cycling Federation
and a vice president of the International Cycling Union, which
governs the sport worldwide. But Baal said he had been unable to
watch a bicycle race this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not able to believe any longer in the sport,'' he said,
citing the repeated drug scandals that had rocked the world of
elite cycling over the past year. ``I haven't seen a race yet. I
can't watch a fake spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   An air of profound pessimism hangs over the sport of cycling,
and it hangs heavier than usual with the Tour de France about to
begin, for it was during last year's race that the depths of the
sport's drug problem was laid bare. Since then, cycling, the sport
that for Europe has been a cultural treasure as well as a
formidable commercial enterprise, has suffered a collapse in
credibility so great that many of its riders, organizers and
sponsors fear for its future.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Tour de France champion, Marco Pantani of Italy, was
recently thrown out of the Tour of Italy because of suspected drug
use, and weeks after that, four cyclists failed blood tests during
the Tour of Switzerland. Perhaps most dispiriting, 11 riders
competing in last month's Tour of Italy amateur race, which is used
as a kind of prep race for young cyclists, also failed blood tests
that indicate drug use.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, nearly a dozen commercial sponsors of cycling
teams and races across Europe have formally expressed concern that
the sport is in peril, and two, Coca-Cola and the French bank
Credit Lyonnais, have threatened to end their millions of dollars
in financing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, criminal investigations aimed at cracking
Continent-wide drug rings go on in France, and earlier this year
the No. 1 book on France's list of best-selling nonfiction was a
tell-all book by Willy Voet, a former employee of France's top
cycling team, that details how riders bought drugs, cheated on drug
tests and undermined the notion of pure competition in one of
Europe's revered sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in cycling took everybody for fools and treated
them like fools _ the journalists and the fans,'' said Voet, the
former masseur for the Festina team who was caught by French
authorities last year in possession of banned drugs days before the
start of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of performance-enhancing drug use, of course, has
plagued virtually all sports in recent years. Football, track and
field and swimming, to name several, have all been bedeviled by
steroids use, and the International Olympic Committee has
identified drug use as the single greatest threat to international
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   But the kind of grim declarations voiced by Voet have echoed
with unique regularity and resonance throughout the world of
cycling _ a sport that annually offers millions of dollars in prize
money and tens of millions of dollars in endorsement deals and
commercial sponsorship. Riders talk with anger and despair,
occasionally with contrition. Organizers, fans and sponsors talk
with both cynicism and urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day it's something new,'' said Bobby Julich, the
American rider who finished third in last year's Tour de France.
``It's pretty hard to stay serious and motivate yourself for the
Tour.'' Of the recent disclosure that young riders in the amateur
division of the Tour of Italy had failed drug tests, Julich said:
``They are 21, 22, 18 even. That breaks your heart, it does, it
really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour, agreed that the
sport's state of crisis was real and deep. And just this week,
Leblanc said, it got worse. Leblanc had attempted to bar four
French riders and an entire Dutch team from the Tour because of
concerns about drugs, but because of a rules technicality, he was
ordered by the world cycling federation to permit Richard Virenque,
a former rider for Festina, to compete. Leblanc had said that
Virenque's ``name and image are the incarnation of doping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been prevented from completing our attempt to restore
the image of the Tour,'' Leblanc said of the decision by the
International Cycling Union. Of the sport's condition generally, he
added, ``Our significance has cracked, just like the public's trust
in us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For decades, cycling, a grueling, glamorous sport in Europe, has
been wrestling with drug use and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Tommy Simpson, a British cyclist, died while competing
in the Tour de France, his death ultimately linked to his use of
amphetamines. Succeeding years brought additional embarrassments:
In 1969, the Belgian star Eddy Merckx was suspended while leading
the Tour of Italy for using amphetamines; in 1978, Michel
Pollentier, another Belgian, was suspended while leading the Tour
de France after he was caught concealing a clean urine sample to
trick testers, and in 1988, Pedro Delgado of Spain won the Tour de
France despite having tested positive for using what is known as a
masking agent, a substance designed to hide drug use, but one that
then was not banned by the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the early 1990s, according to riders and cycling
officials, the sport's top competitors began to experiment with
much more effective and difficult-to-detect drugs, chief among them
erythropoietin, or EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Originally developed to treat kidney disorders, EPO increases
the number of red blood corpuscles that carry oxygen to weary
muscles. Because EPO is a synthetic version of a hormone that
exists naturally in the body, it is hard to detect, even more so
because riders, facing testing, have injected themselves with
saline solution to dilute their blood and mask their EPO use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had doping products in our sport, but there is a
lot of voodoo in these products, and cheaters either believed in
them or they didn't,'' said Hein Verbruggen, president of the
International Cycling Union. ``But EPO is highly effective. It
really increases capacity considerably, and the sad thing is that
many athletes in our sport have felt forced to use it because it is
so effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Zulle is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rider, you feel tied into the system,'' Zulle, one of the
six riders for Festina who confessed to EPO use during the 1998
Tour de France, told reporters last year. ``It's like being on the
highway. The law says there's a speed limit of 65, but everyone is
driving 70 or faster. Why should I be the one who obeys the speed
limit?''
</P>
<P>
   Others think the rationale for widespread cheating is more
straightforwardly cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're all addicted to is making cycling _ this painful,
brutal sport _ easy,'' Voet, the former Festina employee, said in
an interview. The Tour de France, for instance, covers more than
2,000 miles, many of them in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Baal, the French Cycling Federation official, agreed. ``I feel
insulted by these riders who climb long hills with their mouths
closed, not even breathing hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so the episodes have kept coming, sometimes revealing
individual duplicity, sometimes revealing the extraordinary
dimensions of the drug problem in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with two stages remaining in the Tour of Italy,
Marco Pantani, the bald, bold climber who had won last year's Tour
de France after weeks of drug raids, police interrogations and
rider protests, was comfortably in the lead. Pantani, whose income
from salary and sponsorship deals tops $3 million annually and who
for many represented what might still be engaging about the sport,
failed a blood test. The level of red blood cells in his system
indicated EPO use.
</P>
<P>
   While Pantani denied using EPO, the sport had absorbed another
hit to its integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The blows, though, have been bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a Paris narcotics squad questioned two professional
cyclists _ one of them the rising Belgian star Frank Vandenbroucke
_ as part of its investigation of a supply network for
performance-enhancing drugs. That network was allegedly
orchestrated by two Frenchmen: Bernard Sainz, a homeopathic
practitioner who has treated many riders and is suspected of
practicing medicine without a license, and Bertrand Lavelot, a
lawyer who often represented teams and riders, sometimes in doping
cases. Vandenbroucke and the other rider have been suspended from
their team, pending an investigation, and Sainz and Lavelot remain
in custody, maintaining their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Gilles Smadja, an aide to the French sports minister,
Marie-George Buffet, said the investigation of Sainz and the riders
was a first attempt to take on what authorities believe is a
lucrative market in illicit drugs for sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone from the stage where doping was essentially
rudimentary and individual to the stage where it is now very well
organized with distribution networks and traffickers and
established points of supply,'' Smadja said. ``Doping brings in
more money than crack in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment of fear, anger and suspicion has been toxic.
Police in France have been extremely aggressive in detaining,
searching and questioning riders. And some cyclists call the
testing officials employed by the cycling organizations ``the
vampires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicycle riders have become easy prey,'' said Laurent Jalabert,
a French rider who competes for the Spanish team Once, but who is
refusing to race in the Tour de France this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cyclists,'' Pantani said recently of all the testing,
``not blood donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Days later, he failed a blood test.

RUSSIA TRIED TO PUT SPY IN NATO POST, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY AND DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO earlier this year refused to accept a Russian
officer appointed by Moscow as a liaison to its military
headquarters in Belgium because it believed him to be a
high-ranking spy, two alliance officials confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the
Globe that the NATO supreme commander, General Wesley K. Clark,
rejected Moscow's nomination of then-Lieutenant General General
Victor Zavarzin to the post. Clark, the officials said, feared
Zavarzin would pass on NATO's military plans to Serbian commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin was to have been the NATO liaison to Russian troops in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   After being rebuffed, Zavarzin went to Bosnia when NATO's
airstrikes began March 24. Three weeks ago he became a Russian hero
when he led about 200 troops into Kosovo to take over the Pristina
airport just ahead of NATO peacekeeping forces. President Boris N.
Yeltsin immediately promoted him to three stars.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials in Moscow and Washington could not be reached
for comment Friday on the allegation that Zavarzin was a spy. Pavel
Felgenhauer, a knowledgable defense analyst for the Segodnya
newspaper in Moscow, cast doubt on the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too high-ranking an officer to be a spy, and even if he
was from military intelligence, that shouldn't be a problem with
the liaison position _ they often come from intelligence
departments,'' Felgenhauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of Zavarzin greatly angered Clark, according
to the NATO officials, and it added another chafing point to the
increasingly frayed relationship between the alliance and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Russia's key diplomatic role in securing an end to the
11-week war over Kosovo, Russia's political and military
relationship with NATO, especially with the United States, has sunk
to levels not seen since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Zavarzin-led dash to the Pristina airport,
the Russian military command has recently irked NATO and US leaders
by attempting to reopen the terms of the Kosovo peacekeeping
operation and by holding a military training exercise in which two
Russian TU-95 Bear bombers flew so close to the coastline of
Iceland that a pair of US Air Force F-15 fighters were scrambled to
escort them around the island.
</P>
<P>
   The ``West 99'' military exercises last week, like the seizure
of Pristina airport, apparently was meant to send a message that
Russia remains an important force and will maintain a state of
heightened readiness, despite a decade of drastic cuts in troop
strength and equipment. The exercises, in fact, appeared to be
designed to show how Russia might have mounted a military response
to the NATO action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, US officials showed little alarm. For one thing, they
noted that the TU-95 bombers represented a bygone era, built in the
1950s, powered by propellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to see more of these kind of things, with
the Russian military attempting to flex its muscles,'' said a
Clinton administration official, speaking on the condition he not
be identified. ``I think they are looking for any opportunity to
show that they still have the capability of keeping us on our toes.
They want the world to know they are out there, and they want to be
seen as relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, though, the issue goes beyond relevance. NATO's
decision to wage war without a United Nations mandate was seen as a
dangerous precedent that could be repeated against Russia. Another
point of contention developed when the alliance recently broadened
its doctrine to include the option of military response anywhere
NATO fee;s that its interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia announced the Zavarzin appointment in February,
officials at NATO military headquarters in Mons, Belgium, ``asked
Russia to nominate someone else,'' said one NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a field commander of any kind. He was a
professional intelligence guy, and from a NATO standpoint, that was
unacceptable,'' the official said. ``He never showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin was then working at NATO's administrative headquarters
in Brussels, which serves as the center of political activity for
the 19-country alliance. His assignment began in October 1997, a
NATO spokesman said. Russia recalled Zavarzin and its other
officials when NATO's airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had a liaison since 1996 at NATO's military
headquarters in Mons, a position created to lessen Russia's
objections to the allicance's eastward expansion and to help
resolve any issues between Russian and NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia.
NATO officers have given the Russian troops relatively high marks
for their work with US peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
   The first serious problem arose only this past June 10 _ when
the 200 Russian soldiers, commanded by Zavarzin, left their posts
without the requisite advance notice to NATO and then drove to
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said this week in Washington he expected no problems with
the new peacekeeping arrangement in Kosovo, which calls for Russian
troops to be spread among American, French and German soldiers.
Under the Kosovo arrangement, a Russian liaison officer will be
based at Mons, but the NATO officials said they won't accept
Zavarzin.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, an expert on US defense strategy at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, said he could
understand why Clark would veto a Russian alleged to be a spy for
his NATO headquarters. But he said it was important to allow a
Russian military officer access to NATO plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a price we've decided to pay for the broader good of
the relationship,'' O'Hanlon said. ``I'm glad that Russia is in a
position to get more intelligence because that will allow them to
see that NATO has no malicious intent vis a vis Russia, and we want
them to find that out through every possible way, using every
possible channel.''

TEXAS SCIENTISTS HOPE CRASH WILL INDICATE EVIDENCE OF ICE ON MOON 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Against admittedly long odds, a team of scientists
from the University of Texas has devised an experiment that could
provide evidence that caches of ice are hidden on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, ground control teams plan to maneuver NASA's Lunar
Prospector probe out of orbit around the moon and send it on a
high-velocity, terrain skimming plunge into a large crater at the
south pole. Using the Hubble Space Telescope and other space and
Earth-based observatories, scientists hope to detect evidence of
water vapor in the impact plume.
</P>
<P>
   Growing evidence of ice left in permanently shaded craters by
ancient comet strikes has revived interest in future human
development of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the experiment coincides roughly with the 30th
anniversary of the first manned moon landing, the Apollo 11
mission, July 16-24, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well aware that if there really was water ice there,
the area becomes some of the most valuable real estate in the solar
system,'' said David Goldstein, associate professor of aerospace
engineering at the University of Texas who proposed the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a human exploration of space point of view, I've
certainly had dreams of going to space and expanding the human
horizon. I think it would be nice to participate in that, in some
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunar Prospector slipped into a polar orbit around the moon a
few days after its launching June 6, 1998. At $63 million, it is
one of the least expensive and most successful missions undertaken
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, principal investigator Alan Binder reported the
probe's instruments had found concentrations of hydrogen around the
lunar poles high enough to imply ice in the crater recesses
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the mission's first year, Binder's team
estimated the moon may harbor the equivalent of up to 26 billion
gallons of water. Restricted to the unshaded equatorial regions of
the moon, the Apollo explorers did not report evidence of water
from their half-dozen landings.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months, however, the 350-pound Lunar Prospector is
starting to run out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   A longshot, Goldstein's proposal is a bid to turn the probe's
inevitable crash to the surface into weighty new evidence for
Binder's original claim.
</P>
<P>
   The target is a 38-mile wide, 2.5-mile deep crater within a few
dozen miles of the moon's south pole. Hydrogen readings collected
by the orbiting Lunar Prospector suggest the depression is
potentially a bountiful target.
</P>
<P>
   Much has to go right for the experiment to work, so much so that
Binder has estimated the chances of success at just 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The low-flying spacecraft must clear the surrounding crater
wall, then slam into the ice bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come in at a very shallow angle. The topography of the moon
is only known to a certain accuracy. We plan to clear the near rim
of the crater by a kilometer (0.6 miles), and the topography is not
known within an accuracy of a kilometer,'' said Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could easily hit a dry spot,'' he said. ``There could be
beautiful, white ice 10 feet deep right next to where we hit, but
if we happen to hit a rock or a dry spot, we will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   If the crashing Lunar Prospector hits dry terrain, the probe's
previous findings are not diminished.
</P>
<P>
   With the most fortunate of circumstances, the probe would strike
the equivalent of a Colorado snow bank with the force of a two-ton
pickup striking at more than 1,000 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's more likely that ancient ice deposits have been pummeled
over the years by micrometeorites, mixing it into the lunar soil.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if the impact zone contains as little as five gallons
of water, the collision would generate enough heat to create a dust
and vapor cloud that would rise for 15 minutes into the airless
realm of the moon's weak gravity. The cloud should settle for
another 15 minutes, giving the space telescope and instruments at
the McDonald Observatory in West Texas time to look for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Once sunlight strikes the rising cloud, the interaction should
break the molecules of water into its molecular constituents,
hydrogen and hydroxyl.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments aboard the Hubble and at the McDonald observatories
will be tuned to detect the hydroxyl.
</P>
<P>
   ``A positive spectral detection of water vapor or its
photo-dissociated by-product, (hydroxyl), would provide definite
proof of the presence of water ice in the lunar soil,'' said
Goldstein.

MARIO PUZO, 78; WROTE `THE GODFATHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Puzo, whose 1969 novel ``The Godfather'' became a
publishing sensation and went on to inspire an epic film trilogy,
died Friday at his home in Bay Shore, N.Y., apparently of heart
failure. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has energy and I lucked out by creating a character that
was popularly accepted and genuinely mythic,'' Mr. Puzo once wrote
of ``The Godfather'' and its hero, Mafia chieftain Vito Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   The novel was Mr. Puzo's third. He went on to publish four
others (a fifth, ``Omerta,'' is to appear next July). The author of
two works of nonfiction and a children's book, Mr. Puzo also
collaborated on eight screenplays. Among them were such well-known
films as ``Superman'' (1978) and ``The Cotton Club'' (1984). But
the impact of all his other work paled before that of ``The
Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel has sold more than 21 million copies. Francis Ford
Coppola's film adaptation (1972) was for several years the
highest-grossing movie of all time. Mr. Puzo wrote the screenplay
with Coppola and won an Academy Award. He won another for ``The
Godfather, Part II'' (1974). Considered as a single work, the two
``Godfather'' films have been praised as the greatest achievement
of post-Studio Age Hollywood. A third film, released in 1990, met
with considerably less success. Mr. Puzo and Coppola also
collaborated on that screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   As an American epic, ``The Godfather'' rivals ``Gone With the
Wind,'' another best-selling novel that gave rise to an even more
popular film. Like Margaret Mitchell's book, which evoked such
classic American themes and experiences as race, the South, and the
Civil War, Mr. Puzo's book dealt with such enduring concerns of
20th-century US life as immigration, violence, and the nature of
power.
</P>
<P>
   More than any novel of the postwar era, perhaps, ``The
Godfather'' entered the public consciousness. Part of that was
attributable to the success, both artistic and popular, of the
first two films. Much of it, though, is owing to the novel itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly a crime story, ``The Godfather'' is also a
rags-to-riches saga (the story of an immigrant family, the
Corleones), a show biz novel (Hollywood and Las Vegas figure as
prominently as Sicily and Little Italy), and a roman a clef (Frank
Sinatra and mobster Bugsy Siegel are the most obvious examples of
real-life personages who appear only lightly disguised in its
pages).
</P>
<P>
   Within the novel, Mr. Puzo offers a kind of shadow history of
the first half of the American century, touching upon everything
from the assimilation of ethnics (Corleone's youngest son, Michael,
is a Dartmouth man) to the rise of the Sun Belt (the family moves
from New York to Nevada at the novel's end).
</P>
<P>
   What stands revealed is a tainted society in which business and
crime are interchangeable and Mafia chieftains can be seen as being
more honorable than police or politicians. Mr. Puzo's dark vision
struck a chord with readers disillusioned by the social strife of
the '60s. At least two of his coinages _ ``I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse'' and ``A lawyer with a briefcase can steal more
than a hundred men with guns'' _ almost immediately entered the
vernacular. It's no coincidence they bespeak a kind of cynicism
previously unknown in the culture at large.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo was born in New York City on Oct. 15, 1920, the son of
Antonio Puzo and Maria (Le Conti) Puzo. Both were immigrants from
near Naples. His mother was the dominant figure in the family, and
Mr. Puzo later confessed she provided the inspiration for Vito
Corleone. ``Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth, in my own mind
I heard the voice of my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, ``I
had the usual dreams,'' Mr. Puzo once wrote. ``I wanted at the very
least to be a footloose adventurer. Then I branched out and thought
of being a great artist, and then, getting ever more sophisticated,
a great criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo served in the Army during World War II and later worked
as a civilian administrator in Germany. His experiences formed the
basis for his first novel, ``Dark Arena'' (1955), which earned
favorable comparisons to the work of Saul Bellow and Bernard
Malamud.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later Mr. Puzo published his own favorite among his
books, ``The Fortunate Pilgrim.'' Gay Talese praised its
semi-autobiographical account of New York life during the interwar
years as ``perhaps the best novel ever written about Italian
immigrants in America.'' Despite such praise, it sold poorly. Mr.
Puzo resolved to reach the bestseller list. He wrote a 10-page
outline of a story about a Mafia family. His current publisher
rejected it, but another offered him a $5,000 advance. It became
``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo's other books include the novels ``Fools Die'' (1978),
``The Sicilian'' (1984), ``The Fourth K'' (1991), and ``The Last
Don'' (1996); the nonfiction works ``The Godfather Papers and Other
Confessions'' (1972) and ``Inside Las Vegas'' (1977); and the
children's story ``The Runaway Summer of Davie Shaw'' (1966).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am another Italian success story,'' he wrote in ``The
Godfather Papers.'' ``Not as great as DiMaggio or Sinatra but quite
enough. It will serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo's wife, Erika (Broske) Puzo, died in 1978. He leaves a
companion, Carol Gino; a sister, Evelyn Murphy; a brother, Anthony
Cleri; five children, Anthony, Dorothy, Eugene, Virginia, and
Joseph; and nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A private service is planned for Monday.

MEXICO'S RULING PARTY KILLS PACKAGE OF ELECTION CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Lawmakers from Mexico's governing party have
killed a package of new election rules to monitor spending in
presidential primary campaigns now under way and to allow Mexicans
expatriates to vote in national elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   The measures passed the lower house of the legislature, which is
controlled by the opposition, in April. But senators from the party
of President Ernesto Zedillo, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, mobilized their majority in the upper house to stun
the opposition on Thursday by blocking the reforms from even coming
to the floor for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The session ended in a shouting match, with opposition senators
yelling, ``Cheaters! Cheaters!'' and the PRI senate leader banging
down his gavel and marching out abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition defended the changes as crucial to fortifying the
democratic framework for the presidential elections on July 2,
2000, which will be the most competitive ever held in Mexico. The
senators from the PRI, which has won every presidential election
since the 1920's, denounced most of the measures as
unconstitutional and said they had simply moved to spare themselves
a politically damaging but ultimately meaningless public debate.
</P>
<P>
   PRI senators adopted the tactic of simply staying away from
Thursday's session, using the strength of their numbers to prevent
the senate from reaching a quorum. Under the rules of the special
session, with no quorum there could be no debate and no second
chance, so the measure was pronounced dead-on-arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature has been in a special session for the last
month, after the end of its regular term, primarily to try and pass
some form of electoral reforms. Friday, one year before the
presidential election, was the last day the bill from the lower
house, the Chamber of Deputies, could be approved by the senate to
take effect in time for that vote.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI softened the measures in the lower house, but eventually
voted against them anyway. They were expected to be defeated in the
senate, where the PRI holds 75 of 127 seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition senators were counting on the debate to give
the public their view of the changes the PRI rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a democratic transition where reforms to open up and
scrutinize the system are of paramount importance,'' said Luis H.
Alvarez, a senator from the right-of-center National Action Party,
known as the PAN. ``We especially wanted to tighten campaign
financing to keep drug-traffickers out of the elections. But the
PRI didn't agree, and they stopped us in an incredibly heavy-handed
way.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure would have authorized the Federal Elections Council
to draw up plans for Mexicans living outside the country to vote in
the presidential election. As many as 10.1 million Mexicans who
live in the United States might have been eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said that it would be a logistical
nightmare to set up a voting system for so many people by next
July, and warned that it could antagonize American citizens and
elected officials to see so many Mexicans displaying their
allegiance to their home country's politics.
</P>
<P>
   PRI senators insisted that it would take a constitutional
amendment, not just a new law, to authorize the expatriate vote.
Opposition leaders argued that the PRI opposed the measure because
most Mexicans in the United States are believed to oppose the
governing party, blaming Zedillo and his allies for creating the
economic hardship which forced them to leave Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would also have created campaign finance limits
and reporting requirements during primary season. Mexico's
political parties are holding primaries to pick their presidential
candidates for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure would have made it easier for opposition parties
to form coalitions. Even though polls show that opposition voters
are the majority in most states, the PRI continues to win elections
because the opposition is split between the PAN and the
left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coalitions are already legal under Mexican law,'' said
Eduardo Andrade Sanchez, a PRI senator. ``But if the opposition
thinks we are going to make it even easier for them to gang up
against us, they're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition wanted a reform tailored to its interests,''
Senator Andrade said. ``And when they didn't get it, they wanted to
tangle us in a debate to accuse us of being opposed to change. So
we didn't let them.''

RUSSIA TRIED TO PUT SPY IN NATO POST, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO earlier this year refused to accept a Russian
officer appointed by Moscow as a liaison to its military
headquarters in Belgium because it believed him to be a
high-ranking spy, two alliance officials confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the
Globe that the NATO supreme commander, General Wesley K. Clark,
rejected Moscow's nomination of then-Lieutenant General General
Victor Zavarzin to the post. Clark, the officials said, feared
Zavarzin would pass on NATO's military plans to Serbian commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin was to have been the NATO liaison to Russian troops in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   After being rebuffed, Zavarzin went to Bosnia when NATO's
airstrikes began March 24. Three weeks ago he became a Russian hero
when he led about 200 troops into Kosovo to take over the Pristina
airport just ahead of NATO peacekeeping forces. President Boris N.
Yeltsin immediately promoted him to three stars.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials in Moscow and Washington could not be reached
for comment Friday on the allegation that Zavarzin was a spy. Pavel
Felgenhauer, a knowledgable defense analyst for the Segodnya
newspaper in Moscow, cast doubt on the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too high-ranking an officer to be a spy, and even if he
was from military intelligence, that shouldn't be a problem with
the liaison position _ they often come from intelligence
departments,'' Felgenhauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of Zavarzin greatly angered Clark, according
to the NATO officials, and it added another chafing point to the
increasingly frayed relationship between the alliance and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Russia's key diplomatic role in securing an end to the
11-week war over Kosovo, Russia's political and military
relationship with NATO, especially with the United States, has sunk
to levels not seen since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Zavarzin-led dash to the Pristina airport,
the Russian military command has recently irked NATO and US leaders
by attempting to reopen the terms of the Kosovo peacekeeping
operation and by holding a military training exercise in which two
Russian TU-95 Bear bombers flew so close to the coastline of
Iceland that a pair of US Air Force F-15 fighters were scrambled to
escort them around the island.
</P>
<P>
   The ``West 99'' military exercises last week, like the seizure
of Pristina airport, apparently was meant to send a message that
Russia remains an important force and will maintain a state of
heightened readiness, despite a decade of drastic cuts in troop
strength and equipment. The exercises, in fact, appeared to be
designed to show how Russia might have mounted a military response
to the NATO action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, US officials showed little alarm. For one thing, they
noted that the TU-95 bombers represented a bygone era, built in the
1950s, powered by propellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to see more of these kind of things, with
the Russian military attempting to flex its muscles,'' said a
Clinton administration official, speaking on the condition he not
be identified. ``I think they are looking for any opportunity to
show that they still have the capability of keeping us on our toes.
They want the world to know they are out there, and they want to be
seen as relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, though, the issue goes beyond relevance. NATO's
decision to wage war without a United Nations mandate was seen as a
dangerous precedent that could be repeated against Russia. Another
point of contention developed when the alliance recently broadened
its doctrine to include the option of military response anywhere
NATO fee;s that its interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia announced the Zavarzin appointment in February,
officials at NATO military headquarters in Mons, Belgium, ``asked
Russia to nominate someone else,'' said one NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a field commander of any kind. He was a
professional intelligence guy, and from a NATO standpoint, that was
unacceptable,'' the official said. ``He never showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin was then working at NATO's administrative headquarters
in Brussels, which serves as the center of political activity for
the 19-country alliance. His assignment began in October 1997, a
NATO spokesman said. Russia recalled Zavarzin and its other
officials when NATO's airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had a liaison since 1996 at NATO's military
headquarters in Mons, a position created to lessen Russia's
objections to the allicance's eastward expansion and to help
resolve any issues between Russian and NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia.
NATO officers have given the Russian troops relatively high marks
for their work with US peacekeeping forces.
</P>
<P>
   The first serious problem arose only this past June 10 _ when
the 200 Russian soldiers, commanded by Zavarzin, left their posts
without the requisite advance notice to NATO and then drove to
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said this week in Washington he expected no problems with
the new peacekeeping arrangement in Kosovo, which calls for Russian
troops to be spread among American, French and German soldiers.
Under the Kosovo arrangement, a Russian liaison officer will be
based at Mons, but the NATO officials said they won't accept
Zavarzin.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, an expert on US defense strategy at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, said he could
understand why Clark would veto a Russian alleged to be a spy for
his NATO headquarters. But he said it was important to allow a
Russian military officer access to NATO plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a price we've decided to pay for the broader good of
the relationship,'' O'Hanlon said. ``I'm glad that Russia is in a
position to get more intelligence because that will allow them to
see that NATO has no malicious intent vis a vis Russia, and we want
them to find that out through every possible way, using every
possible channel.''

MARIO PUZO, 78; WROTE `THE GODFATHER' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Puzo, whose 1969 novel ``The Godfather'' became a
publishing sensation and went on to inspire an epic film trilogy,
died Friday at his home in Bay Shore, N.Y., apparently of heart
failure. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has energy and I lucked out by creating a character that
was popularly accepted and genuinely mythic,'' Mr. Puzo once wrote
of ``The Godfather'' and its hero, Mafia chieftain Vito Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   The novel was Mr. Puzo's third. He went on to publish four
others (a fifth, ``Omerta,'' is to appear next July). The author of
two works of nonfiction and a children's book, Mr. Puzo also
collaborated on eight screenplays. Among them were such well-known
films as ``Superman'' (1978) and ``The Cotton Club'' (1984). But
the impact of all his other work paled before that of ``The
Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel has sold more than 21 million copies. Francis Ford
Coppola's film adaptation (1972) was for several years the
highest-grossing movie of all time. Mr. Puzo wrote the screenplay
with Coppola and won an Academy Award. He won another for ``The
Godfather, Part II'' (1974). Considered as a single work, the two
``Godfather'' films have been praised as the greatest achievement
of post-Studio Age Hollywood. A third film, released in 1990, met
with considerably less success. Mr. Puzo and Coppola also
collaborated on that screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   As an American epic, ``The Godfather'' rivals ``Gone With the
Wind,'' another best-selling novel that gave rise to an even more
popular film. Like Margaret Mitchell's book, which evoked such
classic American themes and experiences as race, the South, and the
Civil War, Mr. Puzo's book dealt with such enduring concerns of
20th-century US life as immigration, violence, and the nature of
power.
</P>
<P>
   More than any novel of the postwar era, perhaps, ``The
Godfather'' entered the public consciousness. Part of that was
attributable to the success, both artistic and popular, of the
first two films. Much of it, though, is owing to the novel itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly a crime story, ``The Godfather'' is also a
rags-to-riches saga (the story of an immigrant family, the
Corleones), a show biz novel (Hollywood and Las Vegas figure as
prominently as Sicily and Little Italy), and a roman a clef (Frank
Sinatra and mobster Bugsy Siegel are the most obvious examples of
real-life personages who appear only lightly disguised in its
pages).
</P>
<P>
   Within the novel, Mr. Puzo offers a kind of shadow history of
the first half of the American century, touching upon everything
from the assimilation of ethnics (Corleone's youngest son, Michael,
is a Dartmouth man) to the rise of the Sun Belt (the family moves
from New York to Nevada at the novel's end).
</P>
<P>
   What stands revealed is a tainted society in which business and
crime are interchangeable and Mafia chieftains can be seen as being
more honorable than police or politicians. Mr. Puzo's dark vision
struck a chord with readers disillusioned by the social strife of
the '60s. At least two of his coinages _ ``I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse'' and ``A lawyer with a briefcase can steal more
than a hundred men with guns'' _ almost immediately entered the
vernacular. It's no coincidence they bespeak a kind of cynicism
previously unknown in the culture at large.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo was born in New York City on Oct. 15, 1920, the son of
Antonio Puzo and Maria (Le Conti) Puzo. Both were immigrants from
near Naples. His mother was the dominant figure in the family, and
Mr. Puzo later confessed she provided the inspiration for Vito
Corleone. ``Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth, in my own mind
I heard the voice of my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, ``I
had the usual dreams,'' Mr. Puzo once wrote. ``I wanted at the very
least to be a footloose adventurer. Then I branched out and thought
of being a great artist, and then, getting ever more sophisticated,
a great criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo served in the Army during World War II and later worked
as a civilian administrator in Germany. His experiences formed the
basis for his first novel, ``Dark Arena'' (1955), which earned
favorable comparisons to the work of Saul Bellow and Bernard
Malamud.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later Mr. Puzo published his own favorite among his
books, ``The Fortunate Pilgrim.'' Gay Talese praised its
semi-autobiographical account of New York life during the interwar
years as ``perhaps the best novel ever written about Italian
immigrants in America.'' Despite such praise, it sold poorly. Mr.
Puzo resolved to reach the bestseller list. He wrote a 10-page
outline of a story about a Mafia family. His current publisher
rejected it, but another offered him a $5,000 advance. It became
``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo's other books include the novels ``Fools Die'' (1978),
``The Sicilian'' (1984), ``The Fourth K'' (1991), and ``The Last
Don'' (1996); the nonfiction works ``The Godfather Papers and Other
Confessions'' (1972) and ``Inside Las Vegas'' (1977); and the
children's story ``The Runaway Summer of Davie Shaw'' (1966).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am another Italian success story,'' he wrote in ``The
Godfather Papers.'' ``Not as great as DiMaggio or Sinatra but quite
enough. It will serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Puzo's wife, Erika (Broske) Puzo, died in 1978. He leaves a
companion, Carol Gino; a sister, Evelyn Murphy; a brother, Anthony
Cleri; five children, Anthony, Dorothy, Eugene, Virginia, and
Joseph; and nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A private service is planned for Monday.

CENSUS PROBABLY WON'T COST BAY STATE A HOUSE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Massachusetts is in ``much less danger'' of losing
one of its 10 seats in the House of Representatives after the 2000
Census, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service
that bolsters members' claims the seat was not in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The research arm of the Library of Congress found that the
state's 10th seat in Congress is ``less vulnerable'' than the seat
it lost after the 1990 census found the state's population had
decreased.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, said
Friday that the report ``reassures me that Massachusetts is in no
danger of losing a representative as a result of the 2000 Census.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a Bay State Democrat who
requested the study, is ``not concerned at all'' about losing a
House seat, said his spokesman, Fred Clark. ``There's always the
possibility if there is a poor count, but we're still in great
shape,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state's congressional delegation met with the
Democratic Party's national census experts and were assured the
state would not lose a House seat as a result of the census.
Moakley asked for the study after Massachusetts Secretary of State
William F. Galvin warned members last month the state might lose a
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this writing, Massachusetts appears to be in much less
danger of losing a House seat in 2002 than it was at a similar
point in the decade prior to the 1990 Census,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Using three types of analyses of the state's projected
population, the study expected Massachusetts' 10th seat to rank
between 417 and 421 _ for the 435 seats in the House _ after next
year's census.
</P>
<P>
   In these projections, if all other state populations remain the
same, Massachusetts would need a drop of 225,650 people or as many
as 301,339 to lose a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said Friday he still believes Massachusetts could lose a
House seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be thrilled, ecstatic if I was wrong,'' he said. ``But the
gap between 421 and 436 isn't all that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said his remarks last month were not to pit himself
against the congressional delegation, but to urge local government
officials to conduct thorough census counts. With the recent
Supreme Court ruling ordering an actual head count for the census,
instead of using statistical sampling, he is convinced the threat
of losing a seat is very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just sit back, because the rules have changed,'' he
said. ``The enumeration issue has changed everything. Estimates
don't count anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The study itself lists numerous caveats. ``Because population
projections are imperfect, they provide a very rough basis for
anticipating what representation in the House may be after the next
reappointment,'' it states.

TRAUMATIZED SEEK SHELTER IN MONASTERY SAFE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ More than a week after peace formally came
to Kosovo, Maria Filipovic returned from shopping to find that
someone had jammed a heavy knife in the back of her husband's neck,
killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was targeted because he was a Serb. Maybe someone
suspected their family of cooperating with a hated paramilitary
group. The horrific episode sent the tiny, 59-year-old Filipovic to
the area's only safehouse, a Serbian monastery donated to shelter
those too afraid to stay at home _ and too feeble to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   People residing here survived the war, but fear they will not
make it through the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stay here. It's like being in prison,''
Filipovic said. But life outside _ despite the strong presence of
NATO peacekeeping troops _ is still too risky, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly Serb and largely elderly, the some 130 people who
sought a haven in the historic Orthodox monastery are refugees in
their own city. Many tell of being imprisoned by the Kosovo
Liberation Army shortly after NATO forces came in and Serbian
troops left.
</P>
<P>
   Their frail, bruised bodies bear witness to their reports of
severe beatings.
</P>
<P>
   For Janko Jankovic, the violence started when the German Kosovo
Force (KFOR) troops arrived _ the same day Serb troops started
leaving and the KLA took over the local police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at my son's apartment, visiting. Then when I left the
apartment, the KLA kidnapped me and took me to the police
station,'' Jankovic, 68, said. ``Every hour, they beat me _ on my
ribs, my kidneys, my chest and my head,'' he said, exposing his
purple bruises and a head wound the size of a grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the KLA would attack him, Jankovic shrugged, then
winced from the pain of his fractured rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for weapons. What I had, I gave to them,''
he said. ``But then they said, `Why don't you speak Albanian? You
must know Albanian,''' and started to beat him, Jankovic said _ a
turnabout on the Serb military assaults during the war. Many
Albanians who survived attacks by Serb forces say the Serb soldiers
demanded they speak in Serbian, or recite Serbian slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery also houses a few Albanians and gypsies. Many of
these people were suspected, rightly or wrongly, of collaborating
with the Serbs, shelter administrators say.
</P>
<P>
   The aid group Relief International runs an on-site clinic for
the residents, some of whom are still recovering from beatings, and
others who suffer from chronic health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since the residents can't leave the monastery _ guarded
around-the-clock by German KFOR soldiers _ they can't get to the
hospital. Some of the patients also might not feel comfortable
being cared for by Albanian doctors, who for nearly a decade were
virtually shut out of Serb hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schermerhorn, an American physician's assistant with the
National Institutes of Health, gave up a month's vacation time to
volunteer for the job, and he has a full caseload. There is a
little girl whose teeth are rotted to the bone. A 73-year-old
Serbian man is so gaunt after being abused in prison, his entire
rib cage is visible.
</P>
<P>
   A young Albanian mother, who reported that she was raped by five
different Serb soldiers when they came to take her husband away,
lives here with her 8-month-old daughter. Another woman,
Schermerhorn believes, is schizophrenic, but he has no
anti-psychotic drugs to prescribe for her.
</P>
<P>
   Schermerhorn doesn't take much note of people's ethnicities, and
he doesn't ask who caused their injuries. ``I only ask where they
were beaten and with what,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery residents aren't so background-blind. Serbs and
Albanians at the safe house have segregated dormitories, and the
adults of each ethnic group rarely speak to each other in the
monastery's courtyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   The children, too traumatized at first even to speak, now play
together _ but that ``is the only interaction between people
here,'' Schermerhorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the aid workers nor the residents know when people will
be able to leave. Typically, Schermerhorn said, the elderly people
there were the ones who were left behind to tend the animals, while
their adult children found refuge elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Serbs had sons in the army or paramilitary, and when
these men left Kosovo with the military pullout, their parents were
left behind, vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the monastery walls, Prizren has largely returned to its
pre-war condition. Cafes are open, and there is food on the shelves
in stores. Considered the most ethnically harmonious of Kosovar
cities before the war - Prizren has a lively mix of Serbs,
Albanians, and Turks - the city was barely damaged during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mosques were left untouched, a remarkable omission in a
war in which so many of the oldest, most culturally-cherished
structures were burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't go home yet,'' said 66-year-old Nadelzhda
Marjanovic. ``Here, at least we are alive.''

DOWNEAST   SAILOR HOPES TO BEST ATLANTIC SPEED RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With dolphin sightings in the distance and the spray of salt
water on his face, Cam Lewis of Maine zips through the choppy
waters of the Atlantic with one thought on his mind: breaking
another world record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Lewis, 42, sailed around the world with four French
sailors in less than 80 days _ beating the previous record by 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   That record no longer stands in the frenzied world of sailboat
racing, where better technology and feverish activity keep sailors
rushing to the next challenge.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's a scramble to Lizard's Point at the mouth of the
English Channel. Lewis and a crew of five others rushed to sea
Tuesday morning from New York Harbor. To beat the 1990
trans-Atlantic sailing record, they must arrive at ``The Lizard''
before 10:43 p.m. EST Monday. So far, they are making record time.
</P>
<P>
   And, as sailors have come to expect, there's always a snafu.
</P>
<P>
   On day one, the crew discovered their engine compartment filled
with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get it pumped out and get the engine cleaned up in a
hurry,'' Lewis wrote in an email from the vessel. Without the
engine, which runs communications equipment they probably wouldn't
reach their finish line in time.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't stop them. As a hired hand pumped the water out
for two hours, Lewis kept speeding along, keeping a 20-knot pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Foncia, a 60-foot-long trimaran, looks like something out of
Star Wars. It's nearly as wide as it is long; the outer amas span
56 1/2 feet. Unlike other kinds of sailboats, it doesn't heel much.
It's ride is steady and stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not particularly dangerous. These boats are designed to
go fast,'' said Keith Taylor, publicist for the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a jerky ride, like a ``trolley car run amok,'' Taylor
said. And there's always the possibility that random debris could
smash against the vessel. But those on the Foncia are in constant
touch with the world.
</P>
<P>
   Via satellite phones and computer e-mail, Lewis keeps in touch
with three weather routers in New Hampshire and five in France.
Using the Global Positioning System, the routers get hourly reports
of the exact location of the Foncia, its speed and heading.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, after completing 72 hours, the Foncia had
covered 1,470 nautical miles and had another 1,449 miles to go.
Taylor said if the Foncia continues at its current clip, it will
finish the 2,888-mile voyage in six days total, about half a day
faster than the record.
</P>
<P>
   The existing record, set in June 1990 by French skipper Serge
Madec sailing the 75-foot catamaran Jet Services V., made it across
the Atlantic in 6 days, 13 hours, 3 minutes, and 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the end what will make the difference is lighter and stronger
equipment, and a passion for winning. But that comes easy to Lewis,
who lives in Lincolnville, Maine, and grew up in Sherborn, Mass.
He's been sailing since age 4. He won his first race at age 6.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's won a slew of championships, including two wins
of the Finn Gold Cup and twice winning the 505 world title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the real rock star of sailing,'' said Larry Rosenfeld,
46, his long-time friend and business partner. The two have started
their own company, Team Adventure USA, which is is building a
vessel to compete in The Race, the simply titled name of a race
around the world which will begin Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said the co-skippers aboard the Foncia _ Swiss
brothers Yvan and Laurent Bourgnon _ are among the best sailors in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brothers are like the Michael Jordans of France,''
Rosenfeld said. ``They are on TV all the time.''

268,000 NEW WORKERS ADDED IN JUNE

<TEXT>
<P>
   After idling in May, the great American job engine is purring
again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite another big drop in factory jobs, the nation's employers
added more than a quarter of a million new workers to their
payrolls in June. The overall gain, of 268,000, followed a decline
of 5,000 in May. Nearly two of every three Americans _ a record _
were at work last month. And the pay of rank-and-file workers
jumped 5 cents an hour, to $13.23.
</P>
<P>
   With the labor market tighter than at almost any other time in
the last three decades, Americans who have jobs are starting to act
a bit cockier _ something that they have refrained from doing until
very recently. In June, the so-called quit rate _ the fraction of
people looking for work who left their last jobs without having
lined up another _ rose to 14.5 percent, the highest level since
the end of the long, strong 1980s boom. The rate is a classic
barometer of consumer confidence, which by other accounts has
recently strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the economic picture that persuaded Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and his colleagues to nudge up
a key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday
was not materially altered by the report issued Friday by the Labor
Department. Though the economy may no longer be in overdrive, as it
was last winter, it still has enough momentum to keep spending and
production stronger than the central bank _ worried that the
longest peacetime expansion ever will rekindle inflation _ would
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is still very strong,'' said Joshua Feinman, chief
economist at Deutsche Asset Management. ``Whatever concerns Alan
Greenspan had about a shrinking pool of workers, he's still got
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said simply, ``The sun is shining
brightly.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.3 percent in
June from 4.2 percent in May. But Katherine Abraham, the
commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the
monthly jobs report, said the uptick was not statistically
meaningful and called the unemployment rate ``essentially
unchanged.'' It has remained between 4.2 percent and 4.4 percent
since November.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the bureau's survey of households (on the basis of
which the unemployment rate is calculated) showed that the number
of new entrants to the labor force rose even more, by nearly
400,000, than the number of new jobs _ yet another sign that
Americans are more confident than ever that work is there for the
asking. Meanwhile, the number of discouraged workers _ those who
are not looking because they think there are no jobs for them _ has
dwindled to just over 200,000 in the entire country, down 90,000
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unemployed are plenty of people looking for better
positions. A bigger portion of people who are job hunting _ not
those who retired or returned to school or decided to stay home
with a child _ told their bosses to get lost even though they did
not have alternative work. This rate, now at 14.5 percent, is still
shy of its peak of 16.5 percent, reached in January 1990. But it is
a lot higher than in mid-1996, when it was below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beneficiaries of the current demand for labor, of
course, are groups of workers who have traditionally suffered the
most joblessness. The unemployment rate for African-Americans,
already at a record low, dropped by a couple of tenths of a
percentage point last month, to 7.3 percent, half the rate during
the last recession. Joblessness among Hispanic workers, 6.8
percent, also remained at close to a record low.
</P>
<P>
   The report issued Friday was only one of many recent indications
that the economy continues to barrel along at a pace well above its
long-term trend, which most economists consider to be 2.5 percent
to 3 percent a year. With income growing at a rapid clip and
corporate profits firming, spending by consumers and businesses has
remained robust, and despite the yawning gap between the amount of
goods imported and exported, domestic production has been picking
up, too.
</P>
<P>
   The only sector of the economy that had been suffering from
serious weakness and had restrained overall growth _ manufacturing
_ is pretty clearly on the mend. The most recent reading by the
National Association of Purchasing Management suggests that output
has expanded for five consecutive months even as inventories shrank
relative to sales and as order backlogs swelled.
</P>
<P>
   The policy makers at the Fed will be looking at such numbers
before their scheduled meetings later this year. ``Will the world
look different on Aug. 24 or Oct. 25 than on June 30? We don't
think so,'' said Ed McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs,
which estimates that the gross domestic product grew at an annual
rate of 4 percent in the second quarter and predicts that the Fed
will probably raise rates more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Admittedly, the rebound in industrial production has not
translated into more hiring. Factory payrolls shrank by 35,000 in
June, mostly because of job losses in aircraft, electronics and
apparel, bringing the total number of manufacturing jobs that have
vanished in the last 15 months to nearly half a million. But hiring
typically lags behind sales increases as companies initially try to
fill the extra orders by adding hours and improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Labor Department reported that overtime edged up to
4.7 hours a week in June from 4.6 hours in May and the factory
workweek got a tad longer. It is also possible that manufacturers
are letting temporary-help outfits, which are classified as service
firms, do the first round of hiring. ``We're probably not
accurately capturing the number of people actually work in
factories,'' Feinman speculated. The temporary-help industry added
19,000 workers in June, the ninth straight month of increases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, construction employment rebounded in June after
dropping sharply in May. (It turns out that the May decline was
mostly a reflection of last winter's warm weather, which disrupted
the usual seasonal hiring pattern.) Although the housing boom has
already cooled with higher mortgage rates, contractors hired 26,000
workers last month, many of them plumbers, roofers and
electricians,
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the part of the economy that did the bulk of the
hiring in June was the sprawling service sector, which includes
everything from the corner copying store to giant multinational
banks. These companies hired a total of nearly 300,000 workers. On
one end of the pay and prestige spectrum, banks, brokerage firms
and other financial institutions added some 13,000 workers. At the
other extreme, retailers added some 50,000 workers, nearly half of
whom wound up waiting on tables or working cash registers in
restaurants or bars. Seasonal businesses _ amusement parks, lawn
services, hotel chains, movie theaters _ did lots of hiring, too.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the tight labor market has not brought on much
inflation. Even with the 5-cent increase in average hourly
earnings, pay is up just 3.7 percent from a year ago. That is about
half a percentage point less than the pay increases employers were
handing out last summer.

FOR THOSE WHO DARE, SOME PEARLS IN THE JUNK-BOND SEAS 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 4)

<P>
   In some ways, it is a paradox: high-yield bond funds performed
better than any other type of fixed-income funds in the first half
of the year, yet investors continued to shun them.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the rate of defaults on high-yield bonds, better known as
junk bonds, has been rising steadily since last year, the first
sustained climb in more than five years. And many bond dealers are
refusing to handle junk bonds because of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the lack of demand has left the yield premium, or
spread, between high-yield bonds and Treasury issues at 4.9
percentage points at the end of the second quarter, more than a
point above the historical average.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say that the spread is likely to narrow,
moving closer to the average, and that prices may rise.
</P>
<P>
   This year through June 30, high-yield bond funds delivered a
total return of 3.0 percent, on average, compared with a decline of
1.8 percent for the average intermediate-term government bond fund,
according to Morningstar Inc., the fund publishers in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, junk bonds have not fully recovered from their
near-collapse last fall, when investors fled from them and other
high-risk securities. For the most part, their yields remain higher
than their stated coupon rates.
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds pay higher interest rates than investment-grade
corporate bonds, because they are issued by companies that for
various reasons have risks in their financial outlooks. Maybe the
company is new, or has an aggressive business plan, or has had
financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors like junk bonds because of the higher returns,
but also because they can diversify a portfolio. Junk bonds are
less likely than most other bonds to be affected by general
economic news, although their prices, and thus their yields, which
move in the opposite direction, are very sensitive to the issuers'
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Most individual investors buy high-yield bonds through mutual
funds, and some investors might find them especially appealing now,
with the market relatively inexpensive. On June 30, the yield on
the average junk bond tracked by the Merrill Lynch High-Yield
Master II index was 10.7 percent, versus 5.8 percent for the
10-year Treasury note.
</P>
<P>
   That 4.9-point spread is hardly typical. From Jan. 1, 1993,
through Dec. 31, 1997 _ a time of relative stability _ the spread
was 3.68 percentage points, on average, according to Merrill Lynch.
The current gap, however, is still much smaller than the 6.8 points
on Oct. 16, 1998, just after the Federal Reserve lowered short-term
rates for the second of three times last year in the face of global
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Fed, as expected, raised short-term rates a
quarter of a percentage point. But surprisingly, it indicated it
was not leaning toward another increase in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Many bond analysts expect yields on junk bonds to return to
their historical relationship to Treasuries. If so, prices may
rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think there's room to grow in terms of capital
appreciation,'' said Stewart H. Welch 3d, a financial planner in
Birmingham, Ala. ``And you are still picking up the yield.'' Welch
expects the high-yield market to have total returns _ price
appreciation and coupon income _ in the range of 12 percent to 14
percent by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But there are reasons for caution _ and some experts think
prices could go still lower in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   The current spread between junk bonds and Treasuries is a
reflection of market risks, said Martin Fridson, senior high-yield
strategist at Merrill Lynch. He noted that defaults by companies
that issue junk bonds are up; according to Moody's Investors
Service, the bond rating agency, such defaults rose to 3.68 percent
for the 12 months ended March 31, the highest level since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that many bond dealers are unwilling to buy
high-yield securities, Fridson said. Typically, dealers step in to
buy junk bonds because investors are not always readily available.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, dealers bought junk bonds hoping to sell at a
profit before a downturn. But after being hurt last fall by the
selloff of risky securities, many dealers will not commit capital
to the junk-bond market, Fridson said. ``You should get extra yield
to compensate you for the fact that you have a much greater roach
motel risk,'' he said. ``You can get in, but you can't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger King, manager of Dreyfus High-Yield Securities, the
best-performing junk-bond fund in the first half of this year,
agreed that prices, unsettled as the market is, might go lower.
``One of the problems with high yield is that there is always an
imbalance between supply and demand,'' he said, resulting in too
many bonds for the market.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Investors, meanwhile, have continued to leave junk-bond funds.
For the eight weeks ended June 30, $1.4 billion flowed out of such
funds, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks fund sales,
though there was one week of net inflows in June.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the outflow probably represents selling by market
timers trying to take advantage of short-term price movements,
Fridson said. They may have been unnerved by rising interest rates
and default rates, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Market timers can have a big impact on high-yield bond funds.
The Strong High Yield Bond fund shrank to $420 million in assets
last fall, from $720 million, as the high-yield market collapsed.
The fund's co-manager, Thomas Price, estimates that only half the
loss was a result of the market's slide; the rest was caused by
investors' pulling money out of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage timers, the fund now charges a 1 percent
redemption fee to investors who withdraw their money within six
months, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the high-yield market is still a bit shaky. But it may
nonetheless be attractive for long-term investors seeking high
income and possible capital appreciation. ``I think it's wise to be
in junk bonds,'' said Eric Jacobson, a fixed-income analyst at
Morningstar. Depending on their risk tolerance, he said, investors
may want 5, 10 or 15 percent of their portfolios to be in junk
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jacobson agreed with Fridson that yield spreads
were wide for a reason and that buyers should be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   One consideration in selecting a high-yield bond fund is its
investment style. Some funds, of course, are riskier than others,
investing in lower-quality issues with higher yields. The
portfolios of funds with the highest-quality junk bonds will
typically have weighted average credit ratings of double-B from
Standard &AMP; Poor's, a major ratings agency; those of riskier funds
will have weighted average ratings of single-B, or below.
</P>
<P>
   ``One type of fund isn't better than another; you just need to
know what you're buying,'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus High Yield Securities, for instance, favors bonds with
no ratings or with ratings of single-B or lower, and subjects them
to intensive research before buying. The fund lost 15.84 percent in
1998. But for the first half of this year, it was the
best-performing high-yield fund, with total return of 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   King, its manager, views high-yield bonds as long-term
investments and makes no apologies for the wild swings. ``There are
other high-yield investments that are less volatile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity High-Income, up 6.8 percent in the first half of this
year, had an average annual return of 11.3 percent for the three
years through June 30. The fund relies on a team of 16 high-yield
analysts, including its manager, Thomas Soviero. Though it has a
weighted average credit rating of single-B, it still ended 1998
with a gain of 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Soviero said he expects the performance of high-yield bonds to
improve; he is not worried about the rise in default rates. Indeed,
he said, the market nervousness creates opportunities to find bonds
that others may overlook. ``We should be able to avoid those
defaults and find the pearls,'' he said.

LIGHTNING STRIKE LEAVES AIR TRAFFIC IN NORTHEAST ON ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lightning strike at the cavernous air-traffic facility in New
Hampshire, where controllers direct high altitude planes in
airspace over New England and upstate New York, knocked out radar
and radio communications with airplanes Friday and brought holiday
air travel in the region to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:41 p.m., on one of the busiest travel days of the year,
lightning struck Federal Aviation Administration's Boston Air Route
Traffic Control Center in Nashua, N.H., causing widespread delays
throughout the nation's air system and affecting travel over the
North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   When radar screens went dark, controllers had to rely on a
slower back-up system that requires them to handwrite identifying
information about flights and pass the notes from one controller to
the next as the planes traveled across New England.
</P>
<P>
   The back-up system was in use for two hours and 49 minutes until
the regular system went back on line at 6:30 p.m. But residual
delays were expected to last for the rest of the day, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three peak hours, all jet airplanes were restricted
from taking off at airports throughout New England, including
Boston's Logan International Airport. And the effects of the outage
and slower back-up system rippled throughout the nation as planes
across the country headed for Boston, Providence, Manchester, N.H.,
Hartford, Burlington, Vt., and Portland were all told to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Flights inbound to New York from Europe were rerouted around the
affected air space, and flights at New York's airports headed for
Europe were also unable to take off, said FAA spokeswoman Arlene
Salac. The Boston Center handles virtually all Europe-bound
aircraft departing from anywhere on the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials could not begin to estimate the number of planes and
people affected, but controllers at the Boston Center _ which has
experienced numerous outages over the years _ said Friday's was
among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to be the most serious outage they have
ever had,'' said Mike Blake, the regional vice president for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ``It is a summer
holiday weekend, there are thunderstorms in the area, it is a busy
time of day. This is a big one.''
</P>
<P>
   At Logan, the scene was one of long lines, short tempers and
plans for quick getaways for the holiday weekend vanishing with
each tick of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have extensive delays,'' groaned Massport
spokesman Jeremy Crockford. ``We are landing planes that are in the
air, but there are holds on in other cities. Flights inbound will
be delayed hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spot was small propeller planes flying
passengers to and from the Cape and Islands and some northern New
England destinations. They were permitted to take off because they
fly under 10,000 feet and are not tracked by controllers in the
Boston Center.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the Cape and Islands, delays were of historic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Nantucket Airport, which on the July 4th weekend often
handles as many planes as Logan Airport. Usually, planes on final
approach to Nantucket are separated by 2.5 miles or 3 miles. Friday
afternoon and early evening, planes flying into Nantucket were
separated by 35 miles, controllers said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no bright spots for the controllers in the Boston
Center, whose job it is to maintain safe separation among planes
hurtling across the sky at speeds that can exceed 500 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said all the radar screens in the center went blank for
about a minute, forcing controllers to transition to the slower
back-up system.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the transition, it gets very excited. As a controller,
it is one of those times you count on the system and when you don't
have it, it places you in a very uncomfortable position.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Sevey, one of the controllers who was working in the
building at the time of the lightning strike and a union
representative at the facility said ``you could feel the building
shake. It either hit the building _ which is built like a fallout
shelter _ or one of the antenna.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least two sectors, the radar screens failed completely.
</P>
<P>
   Working quickly, controllers working in sectors adjacent to
those who lost radar coverage, expanded their coverage area so the
blind controllers could cobble together a working picture of the
planes under their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   To communicate with the planes, the controllers used a back-up
radio system they are not familiar with. ``I've been a controller
for 18 years and I have never used it,'' Sevey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Center is one of 21 high-altitude air-traffic control
centers around the country operated by the FAA. Its air space
extends north to Canada, south of Long Island, east into the
Atlantic and west to Western New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has consistently maintained that the nation's
air-traffic system is safe because of the redundancies built into
the system, and while outages may cause delays, planes stay safely
separated because there are fewer of them in the air and the
separation between them is increased.
</P>
<P>
   While controllers said they were not aware of any mishaps or
close calls because of Friday's outage, a computer outage at the
Boston Center late last year resulted in two Europe-bound jumbo
jets nearly colliding off Long Island. On Dec. 6, a British
Caledonian L-1011 with 271 people on board heading from Montego Bay
to Manchester, England, and a Delta Airlines Boeing 767 going from
Atlanta to Zurich with 101 on board came within a mile of each
other while both were traveling at an altitude of 33,000 feet and a
speed of more than 500 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   At that altitude, safe separation is considered to be 2,000 feet
vertically or 5 miles horizontally. On board computers that are
programmed to alert pilots to other traffic in the area directed
the two planes to alter their course.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA could not immediately say what lightning prevention
equipment is built into the Boston Center and whether it worked.

last year's race that the cover was blown off the sport's
far-reaching drug problem. Since then, cycling, the sport that for
Europe has been a cultural treasure as well as a formidable

great that many of its riders, organizers and sponsors fear for its

<P>
   Rarely have investors received a clearer warning about the
danger of chasing after hot-performing mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the list of the worst-performing funds in the
second quarter. It's includes many of the same portfolios that were
the best performers in 1998 _ funds like Janus 20, Excelsior Large
Cap Growth and Smith Barney Large Cap Growth, all of which soared
last year as investors flocked to big, liquid stocks, particularly
in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Now check the list of the best performers in the second quarter.
You will find the types of funds that investors shunned last year
and for much of the last several years: funds like Liberty-Crabbe
Huson Special and Goldman Sachs Small Cap Value, which specialize
in finding hidden gems among small-capitalization stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As those ranking suggest, the world in which investors had grown
so comfortable over the last few years was turned on its head in
the second quarter, as the air leaked out of the Internet balloon,
while sectors and funds that had been written off for dead suddenly
came to life.
</P>
<P>
   Remember real estate? Funds that specialize in the sector lost
16 percent of their value last year, on average, but gained more
than 10 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Does energy evoke any memories? Funds that invest in
natural-resource stocks lost 17 percent, on average, last year, but
surged more than 15 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Recall Garrett Van Wagoner? His funds performed poorly in 1997
and 1998, but the Van Wagoner Micro Cap and Emerging Growth funds,
shot up on the last day of the second quarter, to the top of the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have a period of extended performance in one
direction or another, you get to a point where people take profits
and expectations start to become a little more realistic,'' said
Russel Kinnel, mutual funds editor at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher that provided those statistics and other
performance data for this quarterly report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Likewise, after a period, some things get so cheap that people
start to take advantage of the low prices,'' Kinnel said. ``That is
what you expect to happen. The bigger surprise is that the recent
trend lasted as long as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the average American diversified equity fund
gained nearly 9 percent in the second quarter, the results varied
widely according to the size of the companies a fund contained.
Large-cap growth funds, which have made up the best-performing
category of funds over the last one- and five-year periods, gained
just 4.2 percent in the quarter, while small-cap funds, laggards
over the longer periods, racked up double-digit gains.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively poor performance of many large-cap stocks allowed
equity fund managers, on average, to outperform the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, which gained a bit more than 7 percent in
the second quarter, including reinvested dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The same trends evident in Morningstar's broad fund categories
can be seen in the lists of the best-performing individual funds.
Consider the Internet Fund, an aptly titled portfolio that invests
in companies that make their living exploiting the economic
potential of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The fund led the pack in the year ended June 30, with a gain of
252.6 percent. Rarely has a mutual fund tripled its money in a
year, but the last 12 months have been no ordinary time for
Internet stocks, or for the funds that invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with those gains is that relatively few investors
have actually enjoyed them. On June 30, 1998, at the beginning of
its spectacular 12-month run, the Internet Fund had just $1 million
in assets. Even as recently as Dec. 31, the fund's coffers
contained only $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of this year, however, the Internet Fund has
taken in roughly $600 million in new cash from investors. AMG Data
Services, a fund-tracking company, said the biggest flows, at a
rate of about $100 million a week, came in April _ just as the
Internet sector was peaking.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Fund's net asset value hit $38.08 a share on April
13; it then fell 12 percent during the rest of the quarter, to
$33.49. In other words, recent investors in the fund would have
fared better somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent sluggish performance were not enough worry for
shareholders, there is now another unknown: how the fund will fare
under new management. Ryan Jacob, who had managed the fund since
the end of 1997, resigned last month after a planned sale of the
company that managed the fund's portfolio fell through.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fund is now managed by a team including Peter Doyle, a
co-founder of the fund and chairman of Kinetics Asset Management of
North Babylon, N.Y., which holds the contract to manage the
portfolio, and Steven Tuen, who is also director of research at the
IPO Value Monitor, a research service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Fund is not the only fund of its type to show up on
the list of winners. Munder Net Net, the largest Internet fund,
surged to become one of the top performers among specialized funds
during the last 12 months, with a return of 116 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund gained a mere 3 percent in the second quarter, a
slowdown that was unexpected for investors who poured money into
the fund in April at a rate of $200 million a week.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of large flows of money into a fund and a
downturn in performance is not unusual, financial professionals
say. In fact, the link is seen beyond the Internet field.
</P>
<P>
   The Janus 20 fund, one of last year's top performers, took in
nearly $7 billion in new assets in the year's first four months,
including $2 billion in April alone, then shut its doors to new
investors. The fund lost about 4 percent of its value in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans like to buy everything on sale except stocks,'' said
David H. Bugen, a financial adviser whose firm, Bugen, Stuart, Korn
&AMP; Cordero, is based in Chatham, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, mutual fund investors, much like investors who buy
stocks directly, seem to prefer buying what has already gone up the
most. Emerging-markets funds, which gained more than 70 percent, on
average, in 1993, took in more than $1 billion a month the next
year. But in the five years that ended June 30, those funds lost
money, on average.
</P>
<P>
   The calamity that hit emerging markets in 1997 and 1998 all but
dried up investor interest. So how many investors were around to
enjoy the 21 percent gain over the last year _ or the 26 percent
gain in the second quarter? Far fewer, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for those crossing currents. For
starters, unlike most items bought by consumers, financial products
are expected to appreciate in value. In contrast, when someone buys
a refrigerator or a car, it is expected that the value will
decrease over time. It makes sense, then, that a buyer would want
to pay as little as possible for a Kelvinator that will be hard to
resell at some point down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But a more basic instinct also plays a part: greed. Few people
turn down a chance to get rich quickly. In an investing environment
like the current one, where it seems that everyone has a friend or
relative who hit it big on an Internet stock, it is tempting to
chase after the hottest-performing funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is, the big bucks are usually made by doing the
opposite,'' Kinnel said. ``That is, buying when everyone else hates
something and sticking around until it goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes discipline to keep buying when a sector is
underperforming, said Bugen, the financial adviser. The average
investor is faced with such a situation more often than not. ``It's
not unusual to have one asset class lead the way,'' he said. ``So
you have to develop a strategy and adhere to it, and rebalance back
to your target allocations. Over the long term, you'll end up
buying low and selling high. You're not saying this asset class is
undervalued or doing market timing; you're just sticking with a
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be particularly difficult when, for example, large-cap
mutual funds are gaining more than 20 percent a year and small-cap
funds are barely breaking even, if that. Putting a bigger portion
of new investments in the underperforming groups, to keep an
overall portfolio weighting constant, can be painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel as if they're missing out on the party if they're
not totally invested in the best-performing groups,'' Bugen said.
``But if one has a strategy and stays with it, in the long run
you'll have less volatility, and your compounded returns will be
higher.''

COKE RECALLS BOTTLED WATER IN POLAND AFTER BACTERIA ARE FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its second beverage recall in Poland this week, Coca-Cola Co.
said Friday that it was removing all half-liter bottles of its
Bonaqua Plus purified water from stores because Polish government
scientists had detected coliform bacteria in the product.
</P>
<P>
   About 180,000 bottles of the water had already been distributed
by the bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages, and were being pulled from the
market, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman, Sonya Soutus, said. All of them
will be destroyed, along with thousands more bottles that were in
warehouses awaiting shipment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Soutus insisted that the coliform bacteria found in Bonaqua
Plus _ a new product that was introduced June 15 and so named
because it has more minerals added to it than the regular Bonaqua
bottled water that Coke sells _ was not harmful. But she would not
say whether it was the E-coli variety, which is often traced to
human or animal feces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best assumption, but they have not told us that
directly,'' she said, adding that at a news conference Friday,
Polish officials mentioned the possibility. ``We're doing our own
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some types of E-coli have caused outbreaks of severe illness and
even death, particularly among young children, the elderly and
others with limited immune systems. The presence of E-coli ``is an
indication there was fecal contamination somewhere along the
line,'' said Dennis Juranek, associate director of the division of
parasitic diseases at the Centers for Disease Control. He said more
than 99 percent of all E-coli are harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Soutus said Coke had begun the recall on its own, after
being informed on Tuesday that the government tests had turned up
``some questionable results.'' She added: ``At that point, we
decided to look at what we needed to do in the current
environment.'' Once the coliform was confirmed Thursday, the
government told Coke to continue its recall, though Ms. Soutus said
there was no sense of urgency about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, since it's non-pathogenic and not
hazardous, there is not a rush on it,'' she said. ``It's not
harmful to anyone's health.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was the latest development in what has become a
European ordeal for for Coke this year. In June, the company was
ordered to remove all its bottled and canned soft drinks from
Belgium after hundreds of people reported feeling ill after
drinking Coke and Fanta. Luxembourg enacted a ban as well, while
France ordered the closing of a huge bottling plant in Dunkirk and
the Netherlands banned Coke products produced in Belgium. Most of
the bans were lifted last week.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported in Poland as a result of
drinking Bonaqua Plus, Ms. Soutus said. The fault lies with the
operator of the bottling plant in Sroda Slonska, she said, adding
that he apparently ran the plant for more than 48 hours without
stopping to clean it. ``Our belief is that the bacteria accumulated
in the line because it was running constantly around the clock for
two and half days,'' she said. ``It was a violation of procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke said Tuesday that it was recalling Bonaqua in .33-liter
glass bottles throughout Poland after mold was discovered by a
consumer in one bottle. That recall was widened Wednesday to
include all Coke brands in that size bottle. They are being
replaced with the same size bottle in plastic.

CONFERENCE OFFERS CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSALS TO CURB POPULATION
GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Unrestricted access to safe abortions in
countries were it is legal, education in ``sexual and reproductive
health issues'' at all school levels, and confidential
contraceptive advice to ``sexually active adolescents'' _ these are
among the more controversial recommendations presented Friday by a
179-nation conference called to review progress made on goals set
five years ago to curb the world's population growth.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Cairo agreement on population and development had
called for freezing the total population at no more than 9.8
billion in the year 2050. It is currently 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite objections towards these and certain other
recommendations from a small group of conservative Muslim and Roman
Catholic countries, backed by the Vatican, the conference adopted
them by consensus as part of a new action plan approved Friday for
reaching the Cairo population goals. Argentina, Nicaragua and the
Vatican filed reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Population officials generally expressed satisfaction with the
meeting's outcome. ``Cairo has taken root and is working'' the
chief U.S. delegate, Undersecretary of State Frank Loy, said at a
closing press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than merely setting numerical targets and mounting
family-planning campaigns, the Cairo strategy for limiting
population growth seeks to improve the status of women in the
belief that they will then have smaller families.
</P>
<P>
   This week's conference recommended that governments make a
number of adjustments to this strategy mainly in the way they treat
abortion, the 1.1 billion people in the world between the ages of
15 and 24 and the estimated 33 million people infected with the
AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   It urged governments to deal resolutely with the damage done to
women by unskilled abortionists, saying that where this practice is
legal they should ``train and equip health-service providers and
should take other measures to insure that abortion is safe and
accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chile and El Salvador are the only countries to ban
abortion outright, another 75 or so only permit it only when a
woman's life is directly threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Cairo action plan called simply for abortion to be
``safe'' in countries where it is legal. It did not say abortions
should be ``accessible'' or make governments responsible for
insuring practitioners are qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Almost equally contentious, however, were the conference's
recommendations dealing with young people. It called for school
children, at all levels, to be instructed in ``sexual and
reproductive health issues'' in order to teach them ``responsible
sexual behavior'' and protect them from ``unwanted pregnancy'' and
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   It also told governments to provide ``special family-planning
information, counseling and health services'' for ``sexually active
adolescents'' and to help them avoid AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   While governments should respect ``the rights, duties and
responsibilities of parents'' as well as ``cultural values and
religious beliefs,'' the conference said they should ``safeguard
the right of adolescents to privacy, confidentiality and informed
consent'' when providing such assistance.
</P>
<P>
   These new recommendations go far beyond those of Cairo, which
simply asked governments to provide adolescents with ``guidance in
sexual and reproductive matters'' and not to restrict their access
to ``appropriate services and the advice they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, conservative governments sought to emphasize
parents' right to control all aspects of their children's education
and to play down the state's role in making sex education and
contraceptive advice available to young people.
</P>
<P>
   The conference also recognized that the AIDS pandemic is far
worse now than expected five years ago by setting new, specific
targets for reducing the infection's spread.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, it said, governments should insure that at least 90
percent of adolescents have access to ``the information, education
and services necessary to develop the life skills required to
reduce their vulnerability'' to the disease, raising this to 95
percent by 2010. Services provided should include ``access to
preventative methods such as female and male condoms, voluntary
testing, counseling and follow up.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, governments in the most affected countries should aim
for a 25 percent reduction in the number of young people getting
infected and this should become a universal target for all
countries by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The conference also recognized that one of the greatest threats
to achieving the population goals set at Cairo is lack of funding.
Bringing the world's population under control by 2050 is expected
to cost $17 billion a year by 2000, with the developing world
contributing two-thirds and the industrialized countries the rest.

SOUTH KOREA HALTS TALKS WITH NORTH
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ South Korean officials said Friday that they were
suspending talks with North Korea because it had refused to discuss
reuniting families divided by the Korean War of the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The talks here began on June 22, with South Korea's seeking
progress on its longstanding goal of uniting millions of aging
people who have not seen their relatives since the war. North
Korea, suffering from an economic collapse and famine, wants
increased aid from the South.
</P>
<P>
   The South promised 200,000 tons in fertilizer and delivered half
of that before the talks began. But three meetings over 11 days
have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were soured by a naval confrontation, apparently
caused by North Korean testing of maritime borders. On June 15,
South Korean naval forces sank a North Korean torpedo boat, killing
at least 20 sailors. The South said the North Koreans had fired
first.
</P>
<P>
   In the talks here, the North has demanded that South Korea
apologize for the clash and that it deliver the rest of the
fertilizer. The South refuses to apologize and says it will not
deliver the other 100,000 tons of fertilizer until the North
discusses the family issue.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the two sides met only briefly and Friday, the South
Korean delegation announced that it was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is meaningless to go on like this so we are heading home,''
said Yang Yong-sik, the chief South Korean delegate.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, the naval clash and the stalled talks on family
unification have led to increased criticism of President Kim Dae
Jung's ``sunshine policy'' of opening economic and political
contacts with the North.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have also reported evidence that North Korea
may be preparing to test a ballistic missile. Such a test would
likely scuttle an American proposal to improve economic ties with
North Korea in exchange for restraint on weapons tests and sales.

<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. reported that
their car and truck sales edged higher in June as the entire auto
industry recorded its best June in history and its second best
month ever.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sales of cars and light trucks totaled 1.6 million
vehicles last month, a 2 percent increase over the blistering sales
pace of a year ago. That put the seasonally adjusted annual selling
rate at 17 million vehicles, 9 million cars and 8 million trucks,
according to Ward's Communications, a Detroit publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting its best sales month since May 1989, GM sold 493,475
cars and trucks in June, up 1 percent from a year earlier. Truck
sales were 234,848, down less than a percent from the record level
of June 1998. Car sales rose 3 percent to 258,627. June sales put
GM's first-half sales slightly ahead of the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first five months of this year, we were not where we
wanted to be, but we're pleased with June,'' said Roy Roberts, GM's
vice president for North American vehicle sales, service and
marketing. ``We saw the momentum really pick up. June bodes well
for our performance in the second half of the year.'' GM's share of
the car and light truck market rose to 30.8 percent, down from last
June but higher than it has been this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reported its best sales month ever, with sales of Ford,
Mercury, Lincoln, Jaguar and now Volvo vehicles up 5 percent from a
year earlier to 422,979 cars and light trucks. The previous record
was set in June 1978. It also was Ford's best first half for sales
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's truck sales set a new record at 235,675. ``We're pleased
that truck sales are even higher than last year's levels,'' said
George Pipas, head of Ford's sales analysis. ``Last year, we had
incentives on trucks that we never had before, and we don't have
them this year.'' Ford's car sales, thanks largely to the addition
of Volvo, which Ford acquired this year, rose 11 percent from a
year earlier to 187,294.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in our car sales sets us apart from our
competitors this month,'' Pipas said. ``The Japanese posted overall
sales increases but had lower car sales. Some of the increase was
the acquisition of Volvo, but even the Ford, Mercury and Lincoln
lines continued to climb for the sixth month in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford and GM have begun introducing some critical new
products. Ford recently began selling the Lincoln LS, the first car
from its luxury division to go head to head with German luxury
makers, and the Jaguar S-Type, an entry-level Jaguar built from the
same platform as the LS. This fall, Ford presents the subcompact
Ford Focus and the giant Excursion sport utility. Meanwhile, GM
will revamp its entire large sport-utility line for fall and unveil
the new Cadillac DeVille, Oldsmobile Aurora and Saturn L-Series,
the first new car for Saturn in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Both automakers forecast strong sales in the second half of the
year. GM's Roberts predicted the industry would break the record
for annual car and truck sales set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president for
marketing, sales and service, said, ``The question is fast
becoming: by how much will the industry sales record be eclipsed.''

ISLANDERS RECALL THE MAKING OF `JAWS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the summer of blood in the water, dark fins on the
horizon, and terror in the sand dunes. It was Tinsel Town on
Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago this summer Steven Spielberg came to
Martha's Vineyard to do for body surfing what Alfred Hitchcock had
done for hot showers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the shops of Menemsha and the inns of Edgartown, the
pulsating theme of ``Jaws'' _ the fish-bites-man film that drove
grown men to shrieks of terror _ still brings smiles to the
islanders who mingled with the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told the extras not to wear red because they planned for
the colors in the movie to gradually blend from the blues and the
greens at the beginning of the movie to the bloody reds at the
end,'' said Janice Hull, an assistant to the local casting
director. ``Boy, that was a big summer.''
</P>
<P>
   None bigger. The Spielberg blockbuster, the first movie ever
filmed on the island, grossed more than a half a billion dollars.
And its story about a killer shark off fictional Amity Island is
credited with helping create a cachet that today makes the Vineyard
one of the country's most exclusive pieces of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of an ironic mixed blessing about `Jaws,' '' said
Lee Fierro, who played the role of a young shark victim's mother in
the movie's opening sequences. ``It's given the island a great deal
because people come and spend money. But on the other hand, it had
added to the hordes and hordes of people who are drawn here.''
</P>
<P>
   What drew filmmaker Spielberg, then a 20-something director who
had yet to achieve mega-mogul status, was pristine landscapes and
breathtaking ocean vistas that he would make the backdrop for a
bloody excursion with a hungry shark.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the local villagers along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a dirty old character who gets eaten up by a
shark,'' recalled Craig Kingsbury, 86, who played the role of Ben
Gardner, whose bobbing skull provides the movie's first cinematic
jolt. ``The lady testing guys for the part took one look at me and
said: `Seek no more.' Now, how the hell that shark spit that head
back in the boat after he bit it off, I'll never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury's daughter, Trina, said her mother, needlessly,
reminded her children that the skull scene in the movie was from a
cast made of their father's head _ not the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that movie five or six times now and every time
dad's head pops out of that hull _ Woooeee! _ I hit the ceiling,''
Kingsbury said. ``That still gets me.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-grossing movie of all time until ``Star Wars'' knocked
it off two years later, Jaws virtually turned Martha's Vineyard on
its ear. Originally scheduled for several weeks of shooting
beginning in the spring, production instead stretched throughout
the summer and into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July parade was filmed in May, a blessedly sunny
day, that helped make it appear a little more summer-like despite
the fact that tree limbs were bare. Some beach scenes were shot in
June when the surf's temperature was bone chilling. And that darned
shark _ actually three different mechanical ones _ kept breaking
down. They nicknamed it Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems one of the guys got drunk one day and stole one of
the sharks and he towed it around Edgartown Harbor on one of those
floating dry docks,'' said Edith Blake, who covered the making of
the movie for the Vineyard Gazette and later wrote a book about it.
``My mother woke up one morning in her little waterfront boathouse
and found herself staring at it and she thought: Good God!''
</P>
<P>
   The more human encounters are the ones most islanders recall.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Poole, who helped the local casting director, said she
wondered for days what her father-in-law, Donald Poole who played
the harbor master, and Spielberg talked about each morning as they
sat on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have to go down to the set early each morning and they'd
have these long conversations each day and finally I said to him:
`What is it that you and Steven Spielberg talk about every day?'
And he said, `Who is Steven Spielberg? I've been meaning to ask you
what that man's job is.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Spielberg had yet to attain marquee status, the film's stars,
Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, needed no
introductions to the onlookers, extras, and those who managed to
win bit parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done the scene where I slap Roy Scheider and we had done
a couple of takes when he came up to me, put his hands on my
shoulder and complimented me with incredible enthusiasm,'' Fierro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fierro, who played the grieving and black-veiled Mrs. Kintner,
said she at first turned down the role after it required her to
utter vulgarities that was uncomfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not about to swear and say four-letter words, especially
ones that begin with F, on the big screen,'' said Fierro, a local
theatrical actress. ``They got the writer to rewrite the scene in a
different way. And they decided they liked it better that way after
all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the film itself evokes warm memories from those associated
with it, other islanders recall the tumult associated with the
filmmaking more coolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people complaining about the noise, and
closed streets, and the trucks,'' Blake said. ``They wanted to
build Robert Shaw's house over in Menemsha. And they were only
going to need it for a week or two but the stupid islanders made
them conform with all the local zoning laws. It was awfully petty.
Since then, they don't make movies here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said producers for the new Kevin Costner movie, ``Message in
a Bottle,'' briefly considered making it on the island, but took a
pass.
</P>
<P>
   If Martha's Vineyard never became Hollywood-East, the memories
of its big-time hit lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Fierro said, while she knows it's silly, she can't stop thinking
about the dangers of shark attacks each time she approaches the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   And that tingling hesitation all goes back to the summer of '74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that summer,'' Virginia Poole said. ``I
remember it from a mother's perspective. That was the summer a lot
of mothers discovered that their small kids were suddenly afraid to
go into the water.''

A LONG TRIP TO THE MET FOR A TATAR LOVE STORY

<P>
   ``The Fountain of Bakhchisarai,'' one of the most famous ballets
created in the Soviet Union, will be presented for the first time
in the United States when the Kirov Ballet performs it on Tuesday,
Wednesday and next Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Until now American impresarios have been shy about importing a
work that so strongly embodies the principles of Socialist Realism.
Yet today that doctrine's emphasis on reaching a mass audience with
uplifting themes makes this dance-drama, created in Leningrad in
1934, a historical curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographed by Rostislav Zakharov to a score by Boris
Asafiyev, ``The Fountain of Bakhchisarai'' was based on Alexander
Pushkin's poem of the same title and remained in the repertory of
many ballet companies throughout the Soviet era. Galina Ulanova,
who became the supreme ballerina of that time, was the original
Maria, the Polish princess abducted by a Tatar chief in the ballet.
Ulanova wrote that her Stanislavskian identification with Maria and
the ballet's realism impelled her to add new ``meaning'' to her
performances in ``Giselle'' and ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Rupen, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, has researched the
political context of the ballet and the locale in which it is set.
</P>
<P>
   By ROBERT A. RUPEN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Today the fountain, the palace and the town of Bakhchisarai, 20
miles northwest of Yalta in the Crimea, are tourist attractions.
Thanks to Pushkin's poem, Bakhchisarai has become a permanent part
of Russian culture. Indeed, the poem probably saved the name and
some important aspects of the place in the face of powerful forces
for Russification and the ravages of Stalinism.
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin published the poem in 1823. It was immediately
successful, and the words were set to music as early as 1825.
Attempts to base a ballet on it were made in 1838, 1854 and 1890 (a
pantomime with dance), and in 1892 a religious-mystical version
called ``The Victim of Jealousy'' appeared. It was staged by Thomas
Nijinsky, father of the famous dancer, Vaslav Nijinsky. But the
Soviet production, first performed in September 1934 with music by
Asafiyev (1884-1949), became the standard.
</P>
<P>
   That production reflected an important political and cultural
shift in Stalin's Russia. The assassination of the political boss
of Leningrad, Sergei M. Kirov, heralded intensified political
control and before long extensive purges. Culturally, Socialist
Realism triumphed, including fearful and dull conformity. Russian
nationalism was also encouraged, and Russian classics provided a
degree of protection as the terror developed.
</P>
<P>
   In this version of the ballet, the Crimean Tatar chief, the
Giray Khan, leads ``Mongol hordes'' to Poland, and among other
despoliation, uses a spectacular fire to destroy a Polish
aristocrat's manor house. Maria, a lovely survivor, is snatched up
by the Khan and brought back to his harem at the Bakhchisarai
palace. Zarema, the harem favorite, becomes fiercely jealous and
kills Maria. Inconsolable, the Khan erects the famous fountain,
still commonly called the Fountain of Tears.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Giray Khans, who ruled from the early 15th century
until 1783, were respected throughout the Islamic and
Mongol-Tibetan world as the legitimate successors of the Chinggis
Khan (Genghis Khan). Even the rulers of the Ottoman Empire bowed to
the Crimean Tatar Khans' Chingizid legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original Crimean Tatar Khan's palace was built in
1518, the man who inspired Pushkin was Kirim Giray Khan, who led
the Crimean Tatars on raids into Europe in the 1760s. Kirim Giray
Khan ordered the construction of the Fountain of Tears and
dedicated a tomb to his Georgian consort.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the story, including Maria, was added by Pushkin,
however. The original Crimean Tatar palace, for example, was burned
by Russian soldiers in 1735, 25 years before Kirim led the Crimean
Tatars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1787 Catherine the Great planned a visit to Bakhchisarai as
part of a triumphal victory tour marking Russia's defeat of the
Ottoman Empire and related expansion to the South. Catherine wanted
to survey her new possessions, and Potemkin, her adviser and lover,
called the royal architect, Charles Cameron, to rebuild the palace.
She slept in the rebuilt palace for three nights in 1788, then
ordered the castle properly maintained in its existing Oriental
style. Potemkin, in his memoirs, described it as ``a compound of
Moorish, Arabian, Chinese and Turkish architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the palace was neglected, however. In 1820 Pushkin
visited and was inspired to write the poem. (He also complained
about its poor condition.) Later, Catherine's grandson, Czar
Alexander I, restored the palace.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th-century wars with the Turks, Gen. Alexander V.
Suvorov, the commander of the Russian forces, used the palace as
his military headquarters; thus the Bakhchisarai palace became a
symbol for Russian nationalism as well as an object of Crimean
Tatar identity.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the German Wehrmacht occupied the Crimea,
including Bakhchisarai. (One of the German Stuka dive bombers who
was shot down by the Russians in the attack before the Nazi
invasion was Joseph Beuys, who later became a well-known artist. He
remained convinced that the imprecations and incantations of a
Crimean Tatar shaman saved his life.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Russians drove the Germans out of the Crimea in
April 1944, Stalin declared that the Tatars had helped the German
occupiers. The Crimean Tatars became one of the so-called punished
peoples, non-Russian minority ethnic groups exiled to Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Bakhchisarai palace, which had been damaged during the war,
eventually became a military museum and memorial, with a T-70 tank
on a pedestal in the courtyard and an eternal flame to honor the
Red Army soldiers killed. The museum also commemorated Suvorov and
the earlier Crimean War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimea from the
Russian Republic to the Ukraine, further complicating the area's
identity.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union and all the post-Soviet
changes, about a quarter of a million Crimean Tatars have returned
to the Crimea. Mustafa Jemiliev, the longtime political leader of
the Crimean Tatars, lived in Bakhchisarai for many years and
sometimes worked in the palace, which includes a Suvorov Room, a
Pushkin Room and a Historical and Archaeological Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Although a majority of the Crimean population is ethnic Russian,
Ukraine intends to hold onto it. Meanwhile, the returning Crimean
Tatars stake their claim to independence from both Russians and
Ukrainians.

DREAMWORKS QUITS PLAN TO BUILD NEW STUDIO COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a move that reflects a mood of industry
retrenchment and ambivalence about its own grandest ambitions,
Dreamworks SKG has abandoned its plan to build Hollywood's first
new studio complex in more than 60 years. The company cited
difficulties in arranging acceptable financing to create its
planned campus of state-of-the-art sound stages as part of a
sprawling 1,000-acre development near Los Angeles International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The $250 million sound-stage project was the brainchild of
Steven Spielberg and his fellow moguls Jeffrey Katzenberg and David
Geffen, the three of whom founded Dreamworks five years ago and
with great fanfare announced plans for the studio, to be built on
the site of Howard Hughes' old aircraft factory. But from the
beginning the proposal was plagued by financial and political
wrangling, environmental lawsuits and doubts about its viability,
and Dreamworks threatened to abandon the site last year in a
dispute with the developers over the price of land.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday the studio's co-founders said they were dropping
the project at the new development, known as Playa Vista, because
of the problems with financing, together with rising interest rates
and construction costs, and Friday morning's headline in Daily
Variety, the industry journal, summed up the mood: ``Hasta La Playa
Vista, Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned a great deal during the past four years, and
it is clear that the move is no longer in Dreamworks' best
interest,'' Katzenberg said in a statement. ``It was simply not
meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But three of the Dreamworks investors _ Geffen, Spielberg and
Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. _ are billionaires and
could have arranged the money necessary to build the new studio,
had they chosen and had their company been generating a stronger
cash flow. So Hollywood executives were abuzz Friday with the
conviction that Dreamworks' decision to abandon the project
signaled a broader rethinking of the fledgling studio's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spielberg said in his own statement that ``not building
at Playa Vista in no way deters us'' from the goal of building a
new studio, Dreamworks officials said that in the short term, the
company would probably simply expand its offices on the Universal
Studios lot in the San Fernando Valley, and at the Dreamworks
animation campus in nearby Glendale. Spielberg's partners _
especially Geffen, who made his fortune in the recording business,
with its low overhead costs _ have long been thought to harbor less
enthusiasm for building their own movie production complex than for
just renting existing sound stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financing was the last straw,'' one Dreamworks official
said. ``But it was the combination of all the delays, the
uneasiness about the financing, the increases in construction
costs, the changes in the industry and the changes in our own
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In its short history, Dreamworks has had mixed results,
producing hit movies like ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Antz'' and
the successful television sitcom ``Spin City,'' but also
disappointments like the movie ``In Dreams'' and the series
``Ink.'' Further, in the four years since the project was
announced, production activity in Hollywood itself has cooled
considerably, as studios have shifted filming abroad to save costs.
That has freed up once-overcrowded sound stages in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is we've never had any trouble getting a stage for
any of our pictures,'' the Dreamworks official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Dreamworks partners are said to be most
happy with the financial performance of their Gameworks unit, which
operates upscale computer-game arcades in shopping malls and was
created without the benefit of any elaborate headquarters campus or
fancy fiber-optic network of the sort envisioned for Playa Vista.
</P>
<P>
   The Playa Vista developers, which are backed by a consortium of
investors led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., said they would proceed to build their own sound
stages for lease on what would have been Dreamworks' 47-acre
parcel, using as a base the old hangars where Howard Hughes built
his flying boat, the Spruce Goose. Already, movies like
``Titanic,'' ``Men in Black'' and ``Independence Day'' have been
filmed in part on the Hughes site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The phone is ringing off the hook this morning, to be quite
honest with you,'' said a spokesman for Playa Vista, David Herbst.
``We will retrofit the Hughes buildings, but we will also build
others. We're dusting off our plans and re-examining them to see
what the needs are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Playa Vista site, which is also scheduled to include 3,200
residential units and 3.2 million square feet of commercial office
space in its first phase, is one of the last remaining large tracts
of undeveloped land in greater Los Angeles. City officials spent
considerable effort to help the developers lure Dreamworks to the
project as anchor of a planned media campus, rewarding them for
success in that task with $35 million in job tax credits. The
developers will now lose that money, but plan to reapply to the
city after developing their own studio plan, Herbst said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who strongly backed the Dreamworks plan,
said the studio's decision ``is a disappointment, considering the
efforts which have gone into making this project real.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks closed on a $20 million purchase of its Playa Vista
land in April, and the effort to build the first wholly new studio
since Warner Brothers moved to the San Fernando Valley in the 1930s
appeared to be back on track. But, Dreamworks officials said, they
were ultimately unable to settle on financing terms for building
the studio complex with investment partners, including Union Labor
Life Insurance Co., a labor pension fund group. Negotiations
produced too many roadblocks, including a provision specifying that
if the project came in over budget, Dreamworks could lose control
of the land to the other investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were far too many controls on the deal and our ability
to coordinate it,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dreamworks will retrench in its existing operations,
with live-action feature production based at Spielberg's longtime
Amblin Entertainment outpost on the Universal lot; animation at the
17-acre Glendale animation campus, built while Playa Vista was tied
up in delays, and the Dreamworks Records operation in Beverly
Hills, which is Geffen's bailiwick. There are now five buildings on
the Glendale site, with room to build two more, which would
probably house offices.
</P>
<P>
   The larger Playa Vista project, meanwhile, has been beset by
lawsuits from a handful of environmental groups, who contend that
it would despoil wildlife habitats in the Ballona Wetlands, one of
the area's last remaining coastal marshes. Other environmental
groups have strongly backed the developers' plan to restore a
portion of the wetlands, and this week a Los Angeles Superior Court
judge rebuffed the latest attempt by the project's opponents to
block construction.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents had seized on Dreamworks' involvement in the
project to generate publicity, protesting at the openings of
Spielberg's films. But a Dreamworks official said the
environmentalists' protests had played little role in the company's
decision.

LATEST MOVE WOULD CREATE POWER-SHARING CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Unable to get the parties in Northern Ireland to reach
an agreement among themselves, the British and Irish governments
stepped in Friday, saying they would trigger the formation of a
power-sharing cabinet here July 15 and expect paramilitary groups
to begin disarming soon after.
</P>
<P>
   If Protestant unionists refuse to sit in government with
Catholic nationalists, or if the Irish Republican Army balks at
turning in its weapons, the political institutions created by the
Good Friday Agreement of 1998 will be suspended, effectively ending
the peace process, the governments said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a breakthrough nor a breakdown, the plan offered by the
two governments tries to steer a way through a political minefield
in which neither unionists nor republicans want to be seen as
giving too much to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, acted decisively after five days of talks failed to
produce a compromise between Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
and the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that public opinion will force the politicians here to
accept their plan and save the peace process from drift and a
potential return to widespread violence, Blair and Ahern said the
various parties had agreed to consult their constituencies before
deciding whether to accept their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair left no doubt what he thought they should do, saying,
``This is the only way forward for Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scene reminiscient of April 10, 1998, when they announced
the Good Friday Agreement on the same steps of the office building
where it was reached, Blair and Ahern stood under a drizzle and put
the best face on an outcome that their aides admitted was not the
preferred one.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein voiced support for the plan, while unionists said it
was unfair to them. Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said he
had ``several doubts about these proposals'' because they would
punish democratic political parties if terrorist groups held onto
their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said, ``We have collectively taken
an historic step tonight. There are difficult days ahead of us.
There are those who bitterly reject and who will oppose our
efforts. We must stand firm.''
</P>
<P>
   The unionists, representing mostly middle-class Protestants, had
insisted that the IRA begin turning in weapons before they would
consent to the formation of a government in which Sinn Fein would
hold two of 12 seats in a power-sharing cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to break the impasse, Sinn Fein promised it would
try to persuade the IRA to begin disarming as soon as the
power-sharing government was formed, but the unionists refused to
accept their word.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary commitment of time and energy, Blair and
Ahern ensconced themselves in Castle Buildings here on the grounds
of Stormont in East Belfast even longer than they had while
brokering the Good Friday Agreement that created the political
process which is now under threat.
</P>
<P>
   But while the two leaders got Sinn Fein to publicly say it would
try to get the IRA to disarm, the unionists would not budge, saying
they would accept nothing short of weapons up front, or a statement
from the IRA, which has steadfastly refused to countenance
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with unionist intransigence, and Sinn Fein's insistence
that it could compromise no further, the two leaders unveiled a
two-page document called ``The Way Forward.'' According to the
plan, the British government will trigger the formation of a
power-sharing government headed by a 12-member cabinet on July 15.
The next day, the British Parliament will be asked to transfer
power to administer Northern Ireland from London to the Northern
Ireland Assembly, taking effect July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he expected the process of disarming the paramilitary
groups to begin ``within days'' of devolving power to Northern
Ireland, and the handing over of weapons within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The British government will put forward legislation that would
suspend the assembly and other political institutions created by
the Good Friday Agreement if either side reneges on commitments to
share power or disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern stressed that the legislative safeguards make it
a low-risk exercise for both sides, but Blair acknowledged ``there
is a challenge for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Adams is to convince his constituents,
particularly those in the IRA, that giving in weapons is worth
achieving political power.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, meanwhile, has to convince mainstream unionists that
the prospect of getting the IRA to disarm is worth allowing former
IRA leaders like Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator,
to sit in the cabinet that will decide Northern Ireland's future.
</P>
<P>
   The governments' attempt to break the logjam came as Northern
Ireland enters the most volatile weekend of its ``marching
season,'' when Protestants hold thousands of parades to commemorate
17th century military victories over Catholics. Tomorrow's Orange
Order parade in Portadown, which is barred from passing through a
Catholic neighborhood, is the most contentious and has triggered
violence for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's pledge to get the IRA to disarm was seen by the
British and Irish governments as a giant concession, but unionists
were unmoved, saying they wanted a pledge from the IRA itself.
</P>
<P>
   The unionists, however, became increasingly isolated Friday
after a commission set up by the governments to oversee the
disarming of paramilitary groups said it believed that the
decommissioning of weapons could be accomplished by the May
deadline set by the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   John de Chastelain, a retired Canadian general who heads the
disarmament commission and whose report was held back for four days
while Blair and Ahern tried to broker a deal, concluded that all of
the parties linked to paramilitary groups were prepared to assist
in the decommissioning of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, Sinn Fein released a written declaration in which
it promised to persuade the IRA to turn in its arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that all of us, as participants acting in good
faith, could succeed in persuading those with arms to decommission
them in accordance with the (Good Friday) Agreement,'' the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
   De Chastelain said the Sinn Fein declaration ``offers promise
that decommissioning by all paramilitary groups may now begin. The
commission expects that Sinn Fein's proposal will be endorsed by
the IRA and reciprocated by loyalist and other republican
paramilitary groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said he had asked Sinn Fein to change a single word in
its declaration, from ``could'' to ``will'' or ``must'' so that
there would be an imperative in its plege to disarm the IRA, but
that Sinn Fein refused.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble rejected claims that his party did not want to work with
Catholic nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to work with Sinn Fein,'' he said, ``if they
commit themselves to democracy.''

ISRAELI LEADER PLANS A MEETING WITH ARAFAT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, who will be sworn
in on Wednesday, seems to be emerging from behind the scenes to
take his place as Israel's leader.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he telephoned Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
for their first official conversation since Barak won election six
weeks ago. They made a date to meet ``soon'' and to restart the
stagnant peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also ended six weeks of total public silence on policy to
reproach President Clinton for making seemingly offhand remarks
about the rights of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stepped into a minefield of sensitivities when he said,
``I would like it'' if Palestinian refugees ``were free to live
wherever they liked, wherever they want to live.'' His comments set
off a firestorm of public debate here Friday because they seemed to
represent a new position by the United States on one of the
thorniest issues between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's stance on the matter of the right of
return, as it might be understood from his remarks yesterday in
Washington, is unacceptable to Barak,'' his spokeswoman, Merav
Parsi-Tzadok, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who formed his coalition government on Wednesday after
six weeks of political negotiations, said through a spokeswoman
that he believed Clinton probably misspoke. Still, his office said,
the White House should have ``clarified and corrected'' his
remarks. In fact, administration officials on Thursday denied that
Clinton had meant to alter U.S. policy on refugee resettlement,
which says the Israelis and Palestinians should resolve the issue
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And an Israeli television station Friday showed a letter on
White House stationery, dated Thursday, from Sandy Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser, to the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, saying, ``There should be no misunderstanding:
there has been no change in our policy.'' The ultimate disposition
of Palestinian refugees has been left for the final status talks,
which have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   Even a high-ranking official in the Palestinian Authority, Ziad
Abu Zayyad, seemed to think the president had gone out on a limb on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Israeli radio, Abu Zayyad hinted that the
Palestinians themselves were not insisting on the right of return
of all refugees. The fate of the refugees needs to be negotiated,
he said, and the Palestinians are eager to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't ask the Israelis to commit suicide,'' he said. ``We
won't ask them to give up their state and turn it into a state of
an Arab majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pundak, a professor who was one of the architects of the
Oslo peace agreement, tried to explain Clinton's remarks to
Israelis Friday, giving Clinton every benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think that Clinton was trying to say was that anything
that is agreed upon between the Israelis and Palestinians is OK
with him,'' Pundak said. ``I do not believe _ nor do I think that
anyone in the American government believes _ that there will be any
right of return for refugees into Israel proper except perhaps for
some symbolic agreement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moshe Arens, the outgoing defense minister, was not quite as
empathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's remarks are very serious indeed because,
as we know, if we implement the right of return of refugees, this
will mean the end of the state of Israel as we know it,'' he said.
``It could be that the president does not understand this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Clinton had offended Israelis with casual
remarks. In December, in an address to the Palestinian National
Council in Gaza, he likened the pain of Palestinian children whose
fathers were being held in Israeli prisons to that of Israeli
children whose fathers had been killed by Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in his conversation with Arafat, said he planned to
continue on the path to peace of his mentor, the late Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   David Zisso, another spokesman for Barak, said, ``The prime
minister-elect and Arafat agreed to arrange a meeting shortly after
the government is presented to the Parliament.''

TOUR DE FRANCE LOOKS TO REINVENT IMAGE AFTER 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tour de France, which begins its 86th edition Saturday faces
a challenge that is bigger than the Alps, the Pyrenees, or the more
than 2,200 miles the race will cover. It has to climb out from
under the cloud of drug scandals that cast a pall over last year's
race when the focus was on the controversy instead of the race.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be easy. The past three winners won't be returning
_ one because of an ejection in last month's Tour of Italy, the
other two because of injuries. The major sponsor, Credit Lyonnais
bank, is considering pulling out. And the Tour banned almost 20
riders and coaches two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a challenge for us, and anything else is totally
secondary,'' said race director Jean-Marie Leblanc, when he
announced the bans. His goal, he said, is to have an ``open, clean,
transparent Tour de France.''
</P>
<P>
   His hopes for a clean start were short-lived, though.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the Union Cycliste Internationale, cycling's
governing body, reinstated French rider Richard Virenque, who now
rides with Italy's Polti team, and Manolo Saiz, manager of the ONCE
team. Virenque was the leader of the Festina team that was
disqualified last year, and Saiz was director of the Spanish ONCE
team. They were the only ones to appeal the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque, 29, runner-up in the 1997 Tour and four-time winner of
the mountain-climbing jersey, is a favorite not just among the
French, but among other riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that he's back in, he's such a big figure in
France,'' American Tyler Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tour did not feel the same way. Directors were left
reeling, and said the UCI move was ``in contempt of the defense of
fundamental sporting values.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's problems began even before the race started when
French customs officers discovered drugs in a car driven by the
Festina team. The team was expelled after team director Brian
Roussel admitted his squad was guilty of drug abuse. Virenque, who
never failed a drug test, denied using them.
</P>
<P>
   As the Tour went on, French authorities stepped up their
investigation and raided team hotels. Some riders were held for
questioning, and later complained of how they were treated, thus
prompting the Tour riders to stage a protest and ride, but not
race, one stage.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams quit that day, and three more followed the next. When
the race reached the finish in Paris, just 96 of the original 189
cyclists were there.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown continued over the winter, with more
investigations, and 14 arrests in connection with an alleged drug
distribution ring.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Italian rider Marco Pantani, who won last year's Tour,
was expelled from the Tour of Italy after he failed a blood test.
He opted not to enter the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Also absent will be 1997 winner Jan Ullrich and 1996 winner
Bjarne Riis.
</P>
<P>
   All of which should bode well for the American Tour contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely wide open,'' said Hamilton, of Brookline, who
will be riding his third Tour with the US Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's 5-mile time trial in western France that serves
as the Tour's prologue, the 180 riders on 20 teams will head north,
then east, touching the borders of Belgium and Luxembourg. After a
travel day, the cyclists will enter the Alps, finishing one day in
Italy, then travel west and south into the Pyrenees. After one more
day of rest, the riders will travel north through Bordeaux, and
after a time trial on the second-to-last day, arrive in Paris July
25.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who finished second in the Tour's first time trial
last year, spent the spring training in the Alps with teammates
Lance Armstrong and Kevin Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my fitness is a step above last year at this
time,'' Hamilton said by telephone from France.
</P>
<P>
   The team of seven Americans and two Europeans is led by
Armstrong, who won stages in 1993 and 1995, but sat out the last
two Tours after cancer surgery. He'll come into the race on a high
note, having won the last leg in the the Route du Sud stage race
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the team are: George Hincapie, who came close to
wearing the leader's yellow jersey in the first week of last year's
Tour; Jonathan Vaughters, who won the Route du Sud; seven-time Tour
veteran Frankie Andreau; Livingston, who finished 17th in last
year's Tour when he rode with a French team; newcomer Christian
Vande Velde; Frenchman Pascal Derame; and Dane Peter Meinert.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the favorites of Spaniard Abraham Olano, Russian Pavel
Ronkov, and Michael Boogerd of the Netherlands, is American Bobby
Julich, who rides with the French Cofidis team.
</P>
<P>
   Julich finished third last year, and might well make another
trip to the podium, considering all the defections.

FRENCH AIDE CHOSEN TO LEAD KOSOVO REBUILDING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Describing the challenge as awesome,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan chose the French health minister on
Friday as his chief representative to run the United Nations' vast
civilian operations to be set up in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Annan picked an American diplomat as the principal deputy.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced at a news conference that
Annan had selected Dr. Bernard Kouchner, 59, co-founder of Doctors
Without Borders, to supervise the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   His main deputy will be James Covey, 55, a former diplomat who
has worked on the Balkans for the White House and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats had expected that a European would be given the top
post, because the European Union is expected to pay for most of the
reconstruction. But the selection was repeatedly delayed by
intensive haggling over the top posts.
</P>
<P>
   As Annan's special representative, Kouchner will have sweeping
authority in what diplomats describe as the daunting task of
rebuilding on a broad front, restoring order and the rule of law,
providing housing and basic services, and re-establishing civil
institutions like the courts, the police and the remainder of local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Countless Albanians have returned to Kosovo homeless,
impoverished and intent on revenge against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the United Nations might have to administer Kosovo or
parts of its operations for 10 years or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats described Kouchner, a socialist who is deputy chairman
of the small Radical Party in France, as an unusual choice.
Although admired for impassioned and compassionate advocacy,
Kouchner has been innovative and independent minded in many crises.
But he has little administrative or U.N. experience. Critics have
portrayed him as driven by publicity, an erratic loner and
politically ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner seems to enjoy defying stereotypes. A lengthy profile
of him in Le Figaro, the conservative daily newspaper, once
described him as a combative, generous, seductive, naive free
spirit and, alternatively, on the make, a name dropper and a
``grande gueule,'' or gourmand.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.N. action in Somalia in 1992 and 1993, he was
criticized for having posed on a beach in Mogadishu carrying a sack
of rice on his shoulder. In the early '90s, he embarrassed the
French government by calling President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire a
``walking bank safe in a leopard-skin hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner's biography lists his humanitarian experience before
his political posts, along with books, plays and screenplays, many
written under pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said Annan had chosen Kouchner because he had ``the
qualities the secretary general was looking for,'' ``vision and
ability to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   France also lobbied heavily for the appointment. Having learned
that Annan intended to appoint President Martti Ahtisaari of
Finland, the Kosovo negotiator, President Jacques Chirac of France
telephoned Annan to argue that the post was so important that
Ahtisaari should resign as Finland's president to devote full time
to Kosovo. Ahtisaari then withdrew his name, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Covey, a retired American foreign service officer who is a
visiting fellow at the National Defense University in Washington,
is known as a skilled but blunt professional who knows the Balkans
well.
</P>
<P>
   He was deputy high representative in Sarajevo in December 1995
and remained involved in Balkan affairs on the National Security
Council, where he was President Clinton's special assistant for
carrying out the Dayton peace accords until August 1998. He also
held senior foreign posts, mostly in the Middle East.

   LIRONG, China _ The vultures gathered on the mountainside to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   On the grassy slope below, a Tibetan monk placed the naked
corpse of an old woman on a sacred clearing and stepped away to
sharpen his knife on the side of a rock. He marched once around an
old Buddhist monument, mumbling a prayer, and then he cut her body
into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Performing a Tibetan tradition that has haunted these grounds
for centuries, the monk stripped flesh from bone. He followed with
a sledgehammer, crushing each bone into fragments so small that
they, too, could be devoured by vultures.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour, after the monk finished and the enormous birds
swarmed the area and scrabbled over the last chunks of human flesh,
no trace of the woman's body remained. Except the memory of it,
fading slowly in the eyes of half a dozen witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vultures, about 50 of them, ambled slowly up the hill and
took to the air with evident difficulty, overfed as they are from
this daily ritual. Tibetans call it ``sky burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the mountains of the Tibetan plateau, even in this part
that spills into half of Sichuan Province, Tibetans still carry out
ancient rituals like sky burial every day. It bespeaks a timeless
adherence to old ways of life, and death, unaffected by the changes
that are so rapidly affecting the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
   Sky burial may seem barbaric to outsiders. Yet in a desperately
poor region dominated by nearly impassable mountains, where many
Tibetans live without electricity, roads or telephones, the
essentials of life seem to hew closely to the brutal rhythms of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   For Tibetans, many of whom display religious fervor despite
decades of Chinese rule that has at times tried to undermine it,
sky burial is a widely accepted and ecologically sound way to
dispose of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the body dies, the spirit leaves, so there is no need to
keep the body,'' said Garloji, a monk who came to observe the
ceremony. Like many Tibetans, he uses one name. ``The birds, they
think they are just eating. Actually they are removing the body and
completing part of life's cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sky burial is one of three principal ways that Tibetans
traditionally return their dead to the earth. The two others are
cremation and ``water burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was so scarce in the mountainous desert of Tibet that
burning a corpse was a reserved for people of stature. Poor people
who could not afford cremation or sky burial typically dropped a
body into a river.
</P>
<P>
   Today all three methods are still used, and popularity varies by
region. In towns with access to a river, ``water burial'' is now
often performed by cutting a corpse into small pieces that will
disappear into the mouths of fish.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials, who asserted their control over this area of
western Sichuan as the army moved toward Lhasa, the Tibetan
capital, in 1950, still seem to regard sky burial as a bizarre
ritual of a primitive people. Although the officials banned sky
burials together with almost all religious practices in the 1960s
and 1970s, Tibetans regained limited rights to practice religious
ceremonies in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage cremation, but we allow sky burial,'' Nima
Tsering, vice governor of Tibet, said last year. ``It is a Tibetan
custom. Tibetans feel very strongly about sky burial. A few years
ago, a Chinese soldier shot a vulture and was stoned by Tibetans.
It was understandable. If vultures are fair game, who is going to
do sky burial?''
</P>
<P>
   In Lhasa sky burial ceremonies are performed at dawn and are
closed to outsiders. But an area like this one, deep in the vast
border region of the Tibetan plateau and more than 500 miles by
dirt road from the nearest city, is so remote and inaccessible that
no one attending the ceremony here was aware of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the body of the 67-year-old woman was stiff after
three days of transport by tractor from her home more than 200
miles away when it arrived at a nearby Buddhist temple, where a
short ceremony was performed at noon.
</P>
<P>
   The dead woman's husband and her son, who accompanied the body
this far, retreated to sit on a hilltop about half a mile away and
chose not to discuss the circumstances of her death. It is
customary for relatives to remain close by during the ceremony,
Garloji explained, but not so close that they can actually witness
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lobsang, the monk who performed this sky burial, tied a burlap
bag around his waist like an apron. Working methodically, with the
dispatch of a professional, he stripped the flesh from each of the
woman's limbs. Cutting open her abdomen with one motion, he stepped
back momentarily to let the strong odor recede.
</P>
<P>
   He took one bone after another, placing them on a flat stone.
Raising a small sledgehammer over his head, he smashed them into
small pieces, separating the yield into two small piles, flesh and
bone. Next to last came her skull, which burst into pieces with a
sharp crack when the hammer came down.
</P>
<P>
   Garloji said one sect of fellow worshippers at his monastery
liked to preserve the top parts of the skulls and use them as
enlarged cups for tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself never have,'' Garloji said, when asked if he had
tried a skull teacup. ``Some people do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Chinese try to justify their rule in Tibet by depicting
the slavery and harsh theocracy that existed before 1950, skull
teacups are often one piece of evidence they offer of the nature of
pre-Communist Tibet. Such descriptions uniformly use the past
tense, though skull teacups may still be in use today.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Lobsang finished cutting the body, he looked up at the
vultures on the hillside. He signaled them, with a flick of the
wrist, that it was feeding time. On cue the birds descended in a
mass of flapping wings and pecking beaks, devouring the remains in
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lobsang took off his apron and walked away. Wearing a scowl, he
seemed surprised that anyone would ask him to pause a moment and
talk about his work. ``I come every day, and it's about the same,''
he said. ``Some bodies smell worse. Some are bigger, heavier. No
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobsang said that he typically disposed of 10 to 15 bodies a
week, and that he preferred to work alone. He is paid $5 a body.
</P>
<P>
   Sky burial is an ecologically sound way of disposing of a body,
Garloji pointed out, since it uses no firewood, pollutes no water,
and takes up no burial space. Some outsiders who have spent time in
Tibet agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the face of it, sky burial may seem a bit gruesome, but in
fact it is a highly ecological method of disposing of the dead,''
wrote Alec Le Sueur, a Briton who recorded his adventures in a book
about living in Tibet for five years in early 1990s. ``What better
way for the body to be returned to earth than directly as vulture
droppings?''

SPORTS COLUMN: SLAMMIN' SAMPRAS, A FOOTNOTE 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ In case anyone has forgotten, Pete Sampras
is here, too, back on his favorite surface, trying to win a
record-tying 12th Grand Slam tournament. I thought I should mention
this before we discuss the big news of the Wimbledon day, which
wasn't that the sun finally shone.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Pete, so easily ignored in the swirl of personalities at
most Grand Slam events, and particularly at this one. At the
noisiest Wimbledon in years, Sampras has become a serve-and-volley
footnote to all the tennis headliners, past and present, from Boris
Becker to Tim Henman, from John McEnroe to Steffi Graf. Tennis moms
and dads are making more news here than the world's top-ranked
male, and an 18-year-old qualifier is drawing more attention for,
among other things, using Sampras' serve and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the way it is in sports and games. Some stars make
headlines, and some headlines make stars. Alexandra Stevenson _
taught those aforementioned strokes by one Pete Fischer, who was
also Sampras' coach _ will never again be just a tennis player. She
has become the first qualifier at Wimbledon to reach the women's
semifinals, not to mention on the day her famous biological father
was publicly revealing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Stevenson finished dissecting her 6-3, 1-6, 6-3
victory over Jelena Dokic for reporters Friday came a well-timed
news break from the United States that Julius Erving admitted to
being her father and to having provided financial support. Frankly,
I don't think it is anyone's business, when consenting adults
apparently have an agreement to keep such information private, and
I'm not for rummaging through personal documents in search of a
scoop.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Stevenson's stunning success here probably
made the issue of parentage an inevitability. Her mother, Samantha
Stevenson, didn't exactly assist her daughter through the early
rounds in focusing on the feel-good themes of high school
graduation and her natural charm. The result: Stevenson plays
Lindsay Davenport Saturday on Center Court, days after she awoke in
the morning and wandered into her mother's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreamt I beat Lindsay Davenport last night,'' Alexandra
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said her mother, ``Well, I hope it was on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long and notorious Fleet Street tradition, there has
never been a more sensational debut for any athlete anywhere.
Alexandra Stevenson's best friend and childhood hitting partner,
Eric Basica, has cancer and is sending her e-mails asking that she
win Wimbledon for him. The former coach, Fischer, is a doctor in
jail on charges that he molested child patients. The next opponent,
Davenport, once kicked Stevenson's tennis bag out of her path,
according to Samantha Stevenson, who had such catty stuff in mind
when she spoke recently of the need to protect her daughter in the
locker room _ comments that were then misrepresented in the London
tabloids to imply that lesbianism was rampant in the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   This all preceded the unearthing of the birth certificate
containing the name Julius Winfield Erving II.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in this tabloid carnival it should be noted that the
6-foot-1-inch Stevenson does indeed have a powerful serve, a wicked
forehand and an impressive one-handed backhand. And it's true that
her power game was molded by Fischer in the image of his other star
pupil _ what's his name? _ whose advancement into the semifinals
came in the form of a thrilling injury default by Mark
Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you know it? Bearing down on Roy Emerson, Sampras will
be greeted Saturday on Center Court by a crowd that most certainly
wishes him gone. Sampras plays Henman, the English hope, whom he
beat in a semifinal last year. If Sampras does so again, he is not
likely to be the crowd favorite in the final against Patrick Rafter
or Andre Agassi, who has spectacularly reinvented himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis, anyone? Another story line that played out Friday was
the defeat of the 16-year-old Dokic, whose father, Damir, was
arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct at a recent tournament.
Also, 17-year-old Mirjana Lucic, who last year fled the father she
accused of abusing her, advanced to play Graf, whose own father
landed in a German prison some years ago for not paying income tax
on her earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as commentator to it all is McEnroe, who practiced with
Lucic Friday and later won another mixed doubles match with Graf.
``It's all great for the game,'' McEnroe crowed, including his own
return to Center Court.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Pete. What's 12 Grand Slam titles against all this?  &QL;

   PARIS _ An appeals court rejected requests for further
investigations into the car crash in Paris that killed Diana,
Princess of Wales, her companion, Mohamed ``Dodi'' al-Fayed, and
their French driver on Aug. 31, 1997, leaving investigating judges
and prosecutors to decide later this year whether to bring charges

U.S. AND ALLIES PREVENT FLIGHTS OF RUSSIAN TROOPS INTO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its NATO allies have blocked
Russia from flying hundreds of troops into Kosovo this weekend,
before details of Russia's role in the NATO peacekeeping force
could be worked out, administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 48 hours, Russia asked Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria
for use of their airspace to fly 10 planeloads of peacekeepers on
Sunday into Pristina, the provincial capital, the officials said.
But those countries rejected the request after consulting with top
American and NATO officials, the administration officials said.
Hungary is a new member of NATO, while both Romania and Bulgaria
would like to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian point of view was, `Let's get our troops in there
while we work out the arrangements,''' said an administration
official. ``Our view is, `Let's get the details down before we have
them deploy more troops.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after an agreement reached in Helsinki, Finland,
Russian military negotiators this week sought to alter it by having
their troops in Kosovo take orders only from Russian officers,
rather than be under the formal command of NATO. Russia also wants
to station forces in the Italian as well as French, American and
German sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Given Russia's surprise deployment of 200 troops to Pristina
airport last month and an unusual military exercise last week in
which American F-15 jets intercepted Russian fighter-bombers near
Iceland, administration officials said Friday they wanted no more
surprises from Russia over the July 4 holiday weekend, when many
senior American officials plan to be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, vacationing in Europe,
today called her Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, to explain
NATO's objections to continuing the deployment of 3,600 Russian
troops into Kosovo until several sticking points are resolved, a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials had expected to settle the details of Russia's
peacekeeping role at high-level military talks in Mons, Belgium,
this week. Anticipating this, Russia had scheduled to fly 10
hulking Ilyushin Il-96 cargo planes full of troops and equipment
into Pristina to join about 400 Russian troops already there.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks struck an impasse and were not set to resume in
Belgium until next week. When Russia signaled that it was preparing
to send its troops to Kosovo anyway, American and NATO officials
quickly intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser,
spoke to his Russian counterpart while NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana and his top aides consulted with officials in
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian planes were not on the runway ready to launch,''
said a senior military official. ``But calls were made to Hungary,
Bulgaria and Romania to coordinate our response'' if anything
happened.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said, ``The deal is, the
technical details of the Helsinki agreement must be worked out
before they send in more troops. Those details have not been worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
flatly ruled out the Russian proposals, but did not give any hint
at the tense, behind-the-scenes brinkmanship unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were various efforts made by the Russian side to present
modifications or new interpretations of issues previously agreed at
Helsinki,'' Clark told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We
deflected those attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached in Helsinki on June 18 outlined ways for
the Russian troops to cooperate with French, German and U.S.
forces, as well as control ground operations at the Pristina
airport, which is in the heart of the British sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian zone in the German sector borders on the Italian
sector in western Kosovo, and allied officials say that the
Russians want to operate in that sector as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to draw the lines along in areas that they would
feel more comfortable in operating in,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen told reporters on Thursday. ``We feel it's very important
that we stay within the existing map as it was drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Any changes in the patrol areas would require approval by NATO's
political arm, the North Atlantic Council, and the Russian
Federation. ``Some concern was expressed by some of the Russians on
the ground, having seen the KLA up a little close and personal,
that maybe the sectors they picked weren't the most convenient
sectors for the Russian forces to be in,'' Clark told reporters on
Thursday, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``They'll have
to come back through proper channels if this is going to be
adjusted.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Helsinki agreement also calls for Russian peacekeepers to
have their own commander, Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarin, and liaison
officers with the French, German and American commanders up the
allied chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians would not formally report to NATO commanders,
they are expected to follow allied military operational
requirements, a delicate distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Russian negotiator, Vice Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov,
appears to be seeking permission for Russian troops to operate
under their own rules, not NATO's, American and NATO officials
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We intend to keep this strictly within the bounds agreed at
Helsinki, including unity of command,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who said Russian troops would examine their assigned
operational areas in Kosovo in the next few days, expressed
optimism that impasse could be resolved by next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian elements are going to do on-the-ground
reconnaissance,'' Clark said. ``They're going to come back an see
us again at my headquarters next week, where we're going to
finalize the details of Russian participation.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Things have been a bit dismal of late at the Iomega
Corp., the maker of Zip, Jaz and other data storage units and
computer disk drives. The stock of Iomega, a full-fledged member of
the former highflier club, traded at $27 three years ago. On
Friday, it closed at $4.6875, down 36 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The company made a big splash selling relatively inexpensive
add-on disk drives for personal computers. Now, though, Iomega's
offerings have lost some allure. The company _ which had most of
the market for high-capacity, portable disk drives _ faces rampant
competition, and new computers come with so much memory installed
that consumers need less of the extra storage today that Zip and
Jaz disks provide. Zip drives, which sold for $200, now fetch
around $79.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, Iomega said it expected to report a shortfall in
earnings for its second quarter and to post a loss of between 5
cents and 10 cents a share. Its revenues have dropped from earlier
quarters, and Iomega attributed the decline to continued weakness
in sales of its Jaz line and to a component shortage that led to
lower-than-expected sales of Zip drives.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega also said it would lay off almost 10 percent of its staff
and take a restructuring charge of $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie K. Glore, president of Iomega, said the restructuring
charge would probably improve results at the company. Iomega hopes
that its new Clik drive, an almost paper-thin storage disk designed
for notebook computers, will revive sales.
</P>
<P>
   The lone ray of sunshine in this gloomy picture comes from two
Wall Street analysts who currently recommend buying Iomega. John
Dean at Salomon Smith Barney, a subsidiary of Citigroup, rates the
stock 1-S, the firm's most aggressive buy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``S'' stands for speculative. In the wake of the company's
profit warning, Dean cut his 12-month target price on Iomega's
stock to $9 from $11, but he said the company still offered a
long-term payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kunstler at J.P. Morgan Securities also likes the stock.
Last April, Kunstler reduced his recommendation from outright
``buy'' to what he calls a long-term buy, presumably warning
investors that a rebound at the company might take some time. No
other big-name Wall Street firms are currently recommending Iomega
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, any break in the me-too analysis emanating from big
brokerage firms is welcome. It isn't often, after all, that Wall
Street offers a contrarian view on a company like the one Dean and
Kunstler have taken on Iomega.
</P>
<P>
   But before they win plaudits for independent thought, one detail
is worth noting. Last year, Iomega replaced its credit line of $60
million with a $150 million line that expires next year, secured by
company inventories. The lead bankers on the financing are J.P.
Morgan Securities and Citicorp Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of J.P. Morgan Securities and Citigroup say it
is strictly a coincidence that they, Iomega's lead bankers, are
also the only major firms currently recommending its stock. But if
Iomega decides to raise money in the equity markets anytime soon,
would anyone be surprised if one or both of these firms won the job
of underwriting an Iomega offering?
</P>
<P>
   One other question: Is this what Congress has in mind as it
moves to knock down the barriers between investment banking and
commercial lending once and for all?

   What a difference a year makes. Last Fourth of July weekend,
American investors were basking in the glory of 22.9 percent and
30.4 percent gains in their domestic and European stock funds,
respectively, over the previous 12 months. But Asia funds were down
more than 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is the Asian funds that are lighting up investors'
eyes, amid sentiment that most of the region's financial crisis has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 months, funds that invest in the Pacific Rim
outside of Japan soared 69.35 percent, on average, including 38.17
percent in the second quarter alone, according to Morningstar Inc.,
the financial publisher in Chicago. Funds that invest in Japan
alone were also up substantially _ an average of 55.81 percent over
the last year for the 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, domestic equity funds rose 14.6 percent in the 12
months and 8.98 percent in the second quarter, while European funds
were down 4.72 percent for the year, including a 2.61 percent gain
in the quarter. Over all, international stock funds rose 11.3 and
10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio managers of three top performers among funds that
buy foreign stocks discussed the turnaround _ as well as new
opportunities and possible red flags.
</P>
<P>
   A good gauge of how far up, and how far down, Asian markets have
been recently is the Matthews Korea I fund. It was the
top-performing international stock fund for the second quarter and
the last 12 months, according to Morningstar, with gains of 69.73
percent and 278.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, the year the Asian crisis erupted, the fund, which
has virtually all of its assets in South Korea, was down 64.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean stock market was among the hardest hit during
the crisis and one of the earliest to bounce back strongly, said G.
Paul Matthews, manager of the fund. A big reason for the rapid
rebound was the government's aggressive economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Three types of companies have driven the fund higher:
manufacturing exporters that have benefited from a weak currency,
including Samsung Electronics; financial services companies that
have adopted Western business practices or sought foreign capital,
including Kookmin Bank and Hana Bank, and companies tied to
domestic consumption, including phone companies, department stores
and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews particularly likes Korea Telecom, the largest telephone
company in South Korea. It is already fairly efficient, because the
government held down rate increases in recent years. And in a newly
deregulated environment, the company will be able to raise phone
rates, Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback for prospective investors, he added, is that
the company's American depository receipts are now selling at a
premium to the local shares, because of limits on foreign ownership
of local shares. He bought the ADRs when they were first offered in
May at $27.56 each, representing half a local share. The ADRs ended
the quarter at $40. The local shares, meanwhile, gained 84.6
percent in the quarter, to end at 76,800 won, or $66.35.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is the Korea Electric Power Co., or Kepco, the
monopoly electric utility in South Korea. The fund has owned local
shares since December 1996, when it paid 37,193 won each. They rose
62.5 percent in the quarter, ending at 48,100 won, or $41.56.
</P>
<P>
   Another top-performing fund focused on the Pacific Basin,
although with a broader approach, was Montgomery Emerging Asia. In
the last 12 months, the fund, with most of its assets in Hong Kong,
Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan, has soared 97.44 percent, up
61.16 percent in the second quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Chiang, the fund's manager, said performance was spurred
by sharp declines in interest rates that have sent money into the
stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest gainers have been financial services stocks;
Chiang's holdings include Thai Farmers Bank and the Industrial
Finance Corp. of Thailand. He bought shares of Thai Farmers Bank in
October at 20 baht.
</P>
<P>
   The shares rose 50 percent in the quarter, ending at 114 baht,
or $3.09. And he made 300 percent, including currency and capital
gains, on Industrial Finance since he bought it at 9 baht a share
in January 1998, when the baht was weak. For the quarter, the stock
doubled, ending at 23.5 baht, or 64 cents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chiang said he thought financial stocks would continue to profit
as the Asian recovery accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   A current favorite is HSBC Holdings, the global, London-based
bank with roots in Hong Kong and Shanghai. It has not only
weathered the Asian economic storm; it has gained strength by
expanding its business in South Korea. He first bought the stock in
1996 at $140 (Hong Kong) a share. It rose 17.7 percent in the
quarter, ending at $286 (Hong Kong) or $36.86 (United States).
</P>
<P>
   Some fund managers who scour the world for opportunity are
increasing their commitment to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia looks better today than I've seen it in 10 years,'' said
Paul C. Warren, senior portfolio manager at the Putnam Diversified
Equity fund, one of the best-performing global funds over the last
five years. It has returned 20.87 percent, annualized, since
mid-1994 and is up 19.24 percent in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the majority of its assets have been in
the hot United States stock market, but Warren is redeploying some
money to Asia. At year-end 1998, 51 percent of the fund was in
domestic stocks, 41 percent in European and 5.5 percent in Asian;
it now has 42 percent in the United States, 37 percent in Europe
and 13 percent in Asia. (The rest is in Latin America and Canada.)
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Warren said, three factors were at work: interest
rates in much of Asia were a lot higher than in the United States;
Asian countries were running large current account deficits _ in
essence, borrowing heavily from abroad _ and Asian companies had
overdiversified.
</P>
<P>
   Now, interest rates in Asia are as low as or lower than those in
the United States, current accounts are in surplus and Asian
companies are restructuring. As such, ``we have a
better-than-Goldilocks scenario,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Warren's favorites is Nikko Securities, the third-largest
brokerage firm in Japan. Eighteen months ago, it hired a new
president, who is cutting costs. As the Japanese economy recovers
and retail investors return to the market, ``this stock has the
potential to be one of our biggest gainers,'' he said. The fund
first bought the stock in late 1998 at around 400 yen a share. It
rose 41.8 percent in the quarter, ending at 780 yen, or $6.44.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the outsized recent gains for Asia-Pacific funds,
investors should be wary, the managers said.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of those returns, they noted, came as local
currencies rose from depressed levels. Also, it is still early in
the region's recovery, and Asian companies have yet to prove that
their reorganizations will translate into consistently higher
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, despite the recent surge, many investors who have held
Asia-Pacific funds over the last five years still have net losses.
The average diversified fund is down 0.22 percent in that period.

HACKERS BREAK INTO COMPUTERS OF INTERNET'S GOVERNING GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hackers broke into network computers run by the Internet's new
governing body Friday in an apparent attempt to fan the flames of
an ongoing struggle for control of the lucrative business of
assigning Internet addresses known as domains.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Network Solutions, the company that has a
monopoly in the business of registering Internet addresses, said
Friday that the FBI was looking into the attack, which the
company's chief technology officer, David Holtzman, said had been
traced to an Internet service provider in Marina del Rey, Calif. He
said that company, SoftAware, is in the same building as the global
network's new oversight organization, Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann.
</P>
<P>
   SoftAware officials confirmed the attack was made through one of
their machines, but said all the records that might trace it had
been erased. Icann, meanwhile, confirmed that its server had also
been disrupted for several hours Friday. Brian O'Shaughnessy, a
spokesman for Network Solutions, declined to speculate on a motive
for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motive, it is likely to add to the political drama
being played out between Network Solutions and Icann, which is in
the process of opening the company's business to competition and
which is working on plans to move the Internet's main root server
from the company's headquarters in Herndon, Va., to its offices in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was picked by the federal government last year to take
over administration of the global network, which had previously
been handled by Network Solutions and the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition process has been contentious, and Network
Solutions has been a major critic of Icann and the policies it has
adopted. The company has refused to sign an agreement recognizing
Icann's oversight authority, and it has been lobbying for
congressional review of the decisions Icann has made and of the
authority that created the nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shaughnessy said the company discovered the break-in Friday
morning after receiving numerous reports that traffic to three of
the company's Web sites was being rerouted to Icann's Web site and
the Web site of a group that has led the fight to break up Network
Solutions' monopoly on the domain name registration business, the
Internet Council of Registrars, known as CORE.

FRENCH SEIZE WAR CRIMES SUSPECT IN KOSOVO; OTHER ARRESTS ALSO
REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ The French police arrested a Serbian
paramilitary leader and war crimes suspect in this Kosovo town on
Friday, raiding his apartment in the early hours of the morning and
confiscating weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police and military personnel were supposed to have left
Kosovo two weeks ago; the arrest was one of a series indicating the
lingering presence of Serbs viewed by NATO as provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Dragan Marjanovic, also known as Cujla, is one of those
who have been blocking the main bridge in the northern town of
Mitrovica in an attempt to divide the city and create a Serbs-only
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, six other Serbs, thought to be plainclothes
police officers, were detained in the town of Orahovac in
southwestern Kosovo. The men, who had weapons, radio equipment and
computers, were detected sending radio signals.
</P>
<P>
   Five Yugoslav army soldiers were also apprehended Thursday by
U.S. troops after straying into Kosovo on a foot patrol. The
commander of NATO forces in Kosovo has written Belgrade demanding
an explanation for the men's presence inside the province boundary,
a NATO spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' special representative, Sergio Vieira de
Mello, said he was sure the Serbs were acting to provoke violence
and tension, and he urged local Serbian leaders to condemn the
troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello spent most of Friday in an emergency meeting
with Serbian and Albanian leaders of Kosovo to draw up a statement
calling for the end to the extensive violence.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread looting, burning of houses and intimidation have
continued across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must not be allowed to exist,'' Vieira de Mello told
reporters just before the meeting. ``There is a need for the
leaderships to speak out. This includes the Serb side. I am sure
there are agents provocateurs especially in the north part of
Mitrovica and upwards of there.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven hours of negotiation, and four hours later than
planned, the group issued the statement condemning the ``crimes of
the Milosevic regime in Kosovo'' and saying that those ``suspected
of war crimes and crimes against humanity shall be brought to
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Albanian leaders, signatories of the peace accord signed in
Rambouillet, France, were present, including the Albanian leader of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci. Among those representing
Kosovo Serbs were Bishop Artemije, the leader of the Serbian
Orthodox Church in Kosovo, the liberal priest Father Sava and an
opposition politician, Momcilo Trajkovic.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Artemije said that the head of the Serbian Orthodox
Church, Patriarch Pavle, supported the statement, as did all the
Church.
</P>
<P>
   But the only other Serbs supporting the statement were local
leaders. Zoran Andjelkovic, Belgrade's representative in Kosovo
since last October, is still in Pristina but was not invited to
join the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The French have accused radical Serbs of creating the tension
that has forced a division of Mitrovica into Serbian and Albanian
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Marjanovic had been under surveillance for some time as one of
the organizers of the blockade on the bridge. He is a well-known
figure, a cafe owner who is said to be a member of the
ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party.
</P>
<P>
   He is also under investigation for more serious crimes committed
in the last few months of the war, including four rapes and the
murder of two girls who were handcuffed and burnt alive. Col.
Claude Vicaire, the commander of the French police force in
Mitrovica, led the dawn raid himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrested one of the chiefs of the paramilitaries who are
blocking the bridge,'' he said. The French police said they found
military weapons, grenades and ammunition in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The gendarmes moved in to arrest Marjanovic after he assaulted
two Albanians in the street Thursday. It was the first day that
Kosovo has an operating judiciary; judges and prosecutors are now
running a mobile court to attend to the growing number of people
detained by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   They will be imposing a 1976 version of Yugoslav law, except in
cases where it is incompatible with international standards of
human rights and civil liberties. Under the law, Marjanovic can be
detained without trial for 14 days. Until now, the French were
operating under French law and would have had to release him after
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be holding him for a long time,'' Vicaire said as he
stood on the bridge, watching a noisy demonstration of young
Albanians.

KOSOVARS MARK THEIR OWN DECLARATION
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ This city exploded into celebration Friday
night as thousands of Kosovar Albanians turned out in the streets
to celebrate the anniversary of their declaration of independence,
the first since the NATO air war returned Albanians to Kosovo, free
from Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Bursts of automatic gunfire rattled out, and red tracer fire
soared into the sky, as illegal weapons emerged from hiding places
to mark the occasion. British paratroops patrolled the streets but
did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, 1991, in the town of Kachannik in southern Kosovo,
Albanian members of Parliament, outlawed and dismissed from their
posts by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, made the daring
and ambitious statement of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, if the Albanians had not achieved actual
independence, they were celebrating openly nonetheless, for the
first time since NATO troops arrived in Kosovo. The festivity
indicates the relaxed atmosphere that is settling in after weeks of
tension.
</P>
<P>
   Whole families came outdoors, including old women in head
scarves and children in cars, their faces pressed against the
windows and their hands showing the victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   They chanted the initials of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
guerrilla force that spearheaded the fight for independence.
Uniformed soldiers of the rebel army were not in evidence, but it
was clear that many of those celebrating were members.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks of young men roared round the city. Some wore military
caps or Kosovo Liberation Army badges. They leaned out and slapped
one another's hands or gave a fisted salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy,'' said a mother of two, clutching her
children's hands and watching the cavalcade of cars. ``You cannot
believe what this means to us after so many years of suffering
under the Serbs.''

STEVENSON STORY PUTS SPIN ON WIMBLEDON BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ She is traveling fast on the biggest feet remaining at
Wimbledon, taking gigantic strides into no-woman's land, trying to
jump to the moon. Alexandra Winfield Stevenson is doing so even
amid the soap opera swirling around her, climaxed by Friday's
confirmation that she is Julius Erving's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's only stated focus is winning the title at the Big W,
and after Friday's decisive victory, she is in unchartered
territory for a qualifier in this 122-year-old tennis bash _ only
two wins away. Two wins from a tall Monday morning headline:
DEBUTANTE STEALS THE BALL.
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-the-swamp qualifier ranked No. 86, she is _ presto! _
The Story of the day. Not only because Stevenson is doing
previously undone things with a racket, but because of the report
Friday that followed by minutes her post-victory press conference.
In a statement to the Associated Press from Philadelphia, Erving
confirmed reports that he'd previously denied: The resident of the
Basketball Hall of Fame is her father, having had a brief liaison
with Alexandra's mother, former Boston television reporter Samantha
Stevenson, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   If you're 18 years old, taking a rookie cut at Wimbledon merely
three weeks after high school graduation, and find yourself bumping
heads in the final four with US Open champ Lindsay Davenport, the
eternal Steffi Graf, and another teen-age phenom, Croat Mirjana
Lucic, it might be reasonably hard to concentrate. To keep your
nerves from sounding like Big Ben. Meanwhile the ferocious London
tabloids are howling about your illegitimacy, and every reporter in
town is in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound like a carefree holiday in London?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all great fun,'' Stevenson said after acing another
enfant terrible, 16-year-old Jelena Dokic of Australia, out of
action, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3, to crash the semifinals, a precinct never
before invaded by a female qualifier. ``I'm oblivious to everything
but playing tennis, and I want this championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brown eyes popping with that little kid-at-Christmas look,
the 6-foot-1-inch Alexandra appears to have those size-12 sneakers
planted firmly on Wimbledon's revered sod.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does she feel about her father?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the stock, recurring answer from her and her mother to
questions regarding parentage, delivered with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in his statement, Erving said, ``my wife (who has
known from the beginning) and children are aware of this situation.
All matters concerning Alexandra since her birth have been handled
privately through counsel. I am pleased to see Alexandra, at 18,
doing so well and I applaud her mother's efforts and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Erving also said that he has met Alexandra just once, when she
was 3, at a basketball clinic and said it was ``her call'' whether
they would meet again.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, once a TV reporter at Boston's Channel 7 and an
occasional correspondent for the New York Times, said, ``I hope
this inspires single mothers. I want them to know it's worth all
the work to bring up a child alone. It isn't easy.'' Surely, Erving
has helped the San Diego twosome financially.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra graduated from a fine private school, La Jolla Country
Day, and went to the prom _ the kind of upsets accomplished by few
tennis prodigies, although her foe Saturday, fellow Californian
Davenport, pulled the same rare double. The next day Alexandra and
Samantha were on a 7 a.m. plane headed east to London.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to play the French as her first major,'' said
Samanatha, ``but that would have meant missing graduation, and I
said no. Alexandra still had to miss all the post-graduation
parties, but this is a pretty good trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA tennis coach Stella Sampras, Pete's sister, held her breath
when she handed the kid a letter of intent for a full-ride
scholarship, feeling that Alexandra might want to run away with the
pro circus instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella understands that I won't be going to college now,''
Alexandra said. ``Not for a while. Not to play tennis. Not after
this. But she said I had until September to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go for the dough was made when she knocked off
11th-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis, a seasoned pro from France, in
the third round. That was only Stevenson's 17th match on grass, a
surface not usually kind to novices. Chris Evert made it to the
semis in her Wimbledon debut in 1972 at age 17, but she had a track
record: semifinals at the US Open the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Not since a feisty 18-year-old named John McEnroe jimmied his
way into Wimbledon through the spiky qualifying tournament with
three wins 22 years ago has one of these back-door entries
performed so spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said McEnroe, a TV babbler and this year
a moonlighting comebacker, linked with Graf in the semis of the
mixed doubles. ``What Alexandra's done gives hope to the people
down there in the qualifying. They figure they've got a shot, too.
And I like the way she plays. My kind of game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an attractive attacking game that bent four players ranked
above her, and, in the crunch, the stubborn pony-tailed baseliner,
No. 129 Dokic, also a novitiate and qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go forward, get to the net,'' Stevenson said. She
has the serve and volleys, the smooth backhand approach to get away
with a gangbusters style that seems to have gone out with Martina
Navratilova. ``I lost my focus in the second set. I was backing up,
and Dokic took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rains sent them home to brood through perhaps a
sleepless night, the match far from decided, Stevenson leading,
6-3, 1-5. On resumption Friday, Dokic quickly took the second set.
But, ``I went right after her then,'' said Stevenson, who blasted
to a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then she skidded to 15-40, two break points. And coolly she
extricated herself with a fiery run of four points: ace, backhand
swoop-and-volley, a cap of two service winners. In match game she
led off with a 15th ace, one shy of the tourney record, flicked a
backhand winner to 40-15. Two match points.
</P>
<P>
   Double fault. Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to close it with an ace,'' she said, ``so I went for
one on the second ball . . . like Pete (Sampras) does. He's my
hero. We had the same coach, Pete Fisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Risky? ``Oh, I won it on the next point. I knew I would.'' After
the handshake, she curtsied all around to the audience of 11,429
filling Court 1. That's her crowd-saluting version of Andre
Agassi's bows and kiss-blowing. She's got a theatrical, as well as
sharp-volleying, touch.
</P>
<P>
   Poised, well-spoken, and loving the moment, Alexandra must be
chuckling inwardly (although she'd never admit it), at upstaging
her pal Venus Williams. For a couple of years, she's been thought
of as a sort of tag-along with the self-assured, sometimes
intimidating, Sisters Sledgehammer, Venus and Serena. Serena stayed
home and Venus got beat in the quarters by Graf.
</P>
<P>
   From the slums of qualifying to the penthouse is a flight not
yet accomplished. McEnroe was stopped in the semis by Jimmy
Connors. Stevenson may go no further, but she's in for at least
$160,000 and world-wide notice, continuing at 7 a.m. EST Saturday.
Could she someday get more exposure than Papa J, and even become
known as Dr. A?
</P>
<P>
   Right now it's dream time, and take your best shot at No. 3-seed
Davenport. It's a reach, and they've both got it in the loftiest of
all major women's semis: Davenport being 2 inches taller than
Stevenson at 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In a high school production of ``Grease,'' Stevenson played a
supporting role as a cheerleader. She had wanted the lead, wanted
to sing, ``Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee!''
</P>
<P>
   But this is better. Look at her, she's Alexandra Winfield
Stevenson, the debutante who might steal the ball.

COMMENTARY: SUMMER OF MATTHEW SHEPARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The love that dare not speak its name now won't shut up,''
says Tom Ammiano, the gay San Francisco politician who may be his
city's next mayor. Even a continent away, that's no joke. The
homophobic epidemic of '98, which spiked with the October murder of
Matthew Shepard, has turned into the homophilic explosion of '99.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the past week:
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the day after New York's Republican mayor (alas, not
in drag) enlisted in the placid gay pride parade, a couple in
Rockefeller Center surprised the ``Today'' show's strolling
weatherman, Al Roker, by treating the nation to its first
on-camera, man-to-man network kiss on the lips. (The nation
shrugged.) That afternoon, Bill Clinton, having already declared
June to be ``Gay and Lesbian Pride Month,'' took the stage of
Broadway's ``Iceman Cometh'' to salute the 30th anniversary of the
Stonewall riots, the Bunker Hill of the modern gay civil rights
movement. (The gesture might actually have been moving had his
audience not been limited to Kevin Spacey, Tony Danza and fat cats
paying $1,000 each.) The next afternoon, the first openly gay
American ambassador, James Hormel, was sworn in as our envoy to
Luxembourg, with his partner, Timothy Wu, holding the Bible.
Madeleine Albright, administering the oath at the State Department,
used the ceremony to ``send a message'' of inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   She and her boss weren't the only ones sending messages this
week. Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' its faux advance controversy
notwithstanding, turns out to have less to do with race or David
Berkowitz and his victims than with an attempted gay bashing by
vigilantes seeking a scapegoat in that addled New York summer of
'77. ``Bash,'' the bill of one-act plays by Neil LaBute that has
just brought Calista Flockhart back from ``Ally McBeal'' to a New
York stage, finds its dramatic climax in gruesome homophobic
violence carried out by a college student citing scripture to
justify his hatred. ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' the
hilarious animated movie every 15-year-old will be sneaking into
this weekend, features unexpurgated on-screen coupling between
Satan and, of all boy toys, Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   What larger drift can be discerned from this tidal wave of
gayness, promulgated by homo- and heterosexuals alike, may be as
ambiguous as the sexuality of Ricky Martin. But on the mass-culture
front, the sum total of the latest gay frenzy may be the start of a
shift in the mainstream depiction of gay people away from the
cuddly, guppie-next-door coming-out phase exemplified by ABC's
canceled ``Ellen.'' However inadvertently (and heavy-handedly),
``Summer of Sam'' and ``Bash'' do take on the pathology of anti-gay
violence _ a mass-audience subject in the wake of the murder of
Matthew Shepard much as AIDS became one in the aftermath of the
death of Rock Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   If the fallout from Shepard's murder is only just beginning to
resonate in pop culture, its impact on the political culture in
retrospect appears to have been profound. It was only weeks after
this student was tortured that the religious right's collapse
accelerated, with the surprise defeat of many of its more bigoted
standard-bearers on election day. The rout has continued ever
since. Jerry Falwell's dumb outing of the kiddies' TV character
Tinky Winky, trivial as it was, backfired disproportionately
because it came in the aftermath of Shepard's death and the
election. Within days of the reverend's Teletubbies witch hunt,
Mary Matalin, the former George Bush political director, was on TV
declaring that ``if we don't get off of that, we don't deserve to
be a majority party.'' The first-tier candidates for the 2000 GOP
presidential nomination now forsake gay-baiting entirely, leaving
such ugliness to the increasingly marginalized Gary Bauer and to
Steve Forbes, whose latent embrace of Christian Coalition dogma may
have more to do with distancing himself from his late, outed father
than whatever it is he actually believes.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the decline of overt homophobia in the political
marketplace more apparent than in the saga of Hormel's rocky
20-month path to Luxembourg. In the pre-Shepard phase of the Hormel
debate, Trent Lott wouldn't think twice about labeling gay people
sick and sinful, in sync with a full-throttle religious-right ad
campaign promoting conversion therapy. No more. The majority leader
remained mum when Clinton finally did an end-run around the Senate
by giving Hormel a recess appointment. As for the three GOP
family-values Senators who decried the nominee to the bitter end,
one has now been muted by an office pornography scandal (James
Inhofe of Oklahoma) and another by a hypocritical divorce (Tim
Hutchinson of Arkansas), while the third (Robert Smith of New
Hampshire) threatens to bolt the Republicans for the far-right U.S.
Taxpayer Party.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that the lives of all gay Americans are out of
harm's way. While the top GOP presidential candidates eschew
bigotry, neither are they inclined to lead the way in countering
anti-gay violence and job discrimination. As the conservative
Weekly Standard put it while surveying the oblique finessing of the
Hormel nomination by the George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole
campaigns, ``Nothing turns Republicans into awkward, tongue-tied
bumblers quite the way the issue of homosexuality does.'' My
request to the Bush campaign this week for the simplest statement
of its positions (if any) on gay civil-rights issues was met with
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign did respond, with vague intimations that one
of the Clinton-Gore administration's biggest policy disasters
(don't ask, don't tell) might be tempered by (what else?)
``compassion'' post-2000. But if the real advances in gay civil
rights under Clinton-Gore dwarf even the GOP's best efforts, they
are still only a beginning in a country where the Shepard murder
has been followed by such heinous crimes as the savage killing of
Billy Jack Gaither, a 39-year-old textile worker, in rural Alabama,
and the brutal beating of 17-year-old Adam Colton, who had tried to
start a gay-straight alliance in a high school 30 miles north of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The gay boogeyman or woman can still be exploited by demagogues
with impunity. Witness the rising number of anti-gay bills before
state legislatures and, in unconscious mimicry of the plot of
``Summer of Sam,'' the efforts by both Falwell (via TV) and Matt
Drudge (via the Internet) to whip up hysteria by spreading
unsubstantiated rumors that the Columbine killers were gay. And
it's not only those on the right who succumb to ignorance and fear
on this subject: only a few weeks ago my wife and I were lectured
by a prominent figure in Manhattan's liberal literary establishment
about a conspiracy to recruit our children into homosexuality at
college.
</P>
<P>
   A James Hormel is irrelevant to this equation, for his
``breakthrough'' is at most symbolic. Even so, on his way to what
should have been routine approval to a largely ceremonial post,
Hormel, a 66-year-old father of five, philanthropist, businessman
and former University of Chicago Law School dean was smeared as
everything from a pederast to a promoter of deadly sex to a
religious bigot.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, the 36-year-old Wu, was himself ``a first'' once _
one of the first two Asian-Americans to serve as trustees of
Princeton University. Reflecting this week on his recent trial by
innuendo and insult, he was upbeat. Though startled to find out
that he too was subjected to caricature _ ``Am I the trophy wife?''
he joked _ he took solace in the fact that neither he nor Hormel
ever ``changed the way we presented ourselves and our relationship
during the whole nomination process.''
</P>
<P>
   As that process continued, Wu realized that there was not much
of a benchmark for the suspicious and fearful to judge their
relationship by. For all the cultural representations of gay
people, he notes, ``there are not that many openly gay couples in
the media or the political scene'' _ and certainly none of truly
national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there now, sad to say, despite Hormel's swearing in.
Luxembourg isn't the closet, but it's just as small and discreetly
out of view. Famous heretofore as the duchy where Harry Truman
parked the ``hostess with the mostess,'' Perle Mesta, in 1949 _ and
where LBJ sent the first black woman envoy, Patricia Harris, in
1965 _ it may not be heard from again until a president appoints
our first transgender ambassador, circa 2033.

FISK '75 HOME RUN BALL SURFACES FOR AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knew? Who knew that ordinary baseballs someday would be
horsehide Hope Diamonds?
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 22, 1975, at thirty-four minutes after midnight, Carlton
Fisk cricled the bases, John Kiley played the ``Hallelujah
Chorus,'' and Peter Gammons started typing, ``the ball was there,
like the Mystic River Bridge, suspended out in the black of
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   There was bedlam in the stands at Fenway Park and church bells
rang across New England.
</P>
<P>
   And while all that was going on, Cincinnati Reds left fielder
George Foster trotted over and picked up a dented hardball that had
clanged off the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   Next Thursday, that baseball will be auctioned, and probably
will go for something in excess of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing right there and it hit the foul pole,'' recalls
Foster, who now lives in Florida. ``The game was over and it was
late and I put it in my glove and left it in my locker overnight.
The next night, Cesar Geronimo caught the last out of Game 7 and
said he was going to keep the ball. So I figured I'd hold on to
this one. There wasn't any thought at that time that it was going
to be valuable or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Times change. Nine-dollar baseballs become precious gems if they
are in the right place at the right time. Mark McGwire's 70th home
run ball last winter was auctioned for $2.7 million. Sammy Sosa's
66th went for a bargain basement $150,000. The first ball Babe Ruth
hit out of Yankee Stadium went for $125,000. Even the Vatican has
gotten involved. A ball autographed by Catholic Hall of Famer Pope
John Paul II will be auctioned July 21 at a Collectors Convention
in Atlanta. Pontiff ball bidding starts at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   And who can forget the tragic tale of the ground ball that
dribbled between the legs of Bill Buckner? The ball was originally
retrieved by umpire Ed Montague, who gave it to then-Mets traveling
secretary, Arthur Richman. Richman held on to the ball for six
years, then put it up for auction, where it fetched $93,500 from a
famous collector named Charlie Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's ball is bound to go higher. It represents one of the most
celebrated moments in baseball history. Footage of Fisk waving the
ball fair was selected by TV Guide as the greatest moment in the
history of sports television. The video can be seen at the
Smithsonian Institute in Washington, and discussion of Fisk's blast
highlighted a crucial clip in ``Good Will Hunting.'' It's the scene
when Robin Williams tells Matt Damon he skipped Game 6 because he
had to ``go see about a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon, a Cambridge, Mass. homeboy who co-wrote and starred in
the movie, is participating in next Sunday's celebrity home run
hitting contest at Fenway and rumored to be a candidate to bid for
the Fisk ball. The folks at Leland's auction house sent their
brochure to Damon's PR person. Damon did not return a call from the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk isn't too happy about the sale and has doubts about the
ball's authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge says he's seen George 25 times over the years and George
never mentioned that he had it,'' says Fisk's agent, Jack Sands.
``I called George myself. He claims that he was originally confused
because there was no World Series logo on the ball. Then he found
out that in '75, there was no Series logo on the ball. I told him I
thought it was be appropriate for him to donate it to the Hall of
Fame. I think Pudge is upset that the ball is not being donated to
the Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, in Boston Thursday for a baseball clinic, told WBZ-TV's
Gary Tanguay, ``I have no idea whether it's the ball. My only
question is timing, that's all. Twenty-five years and now the ball
has surfaced without any mention of it? I've inquired about that
ball for 20 years and not heard one word until recently. It could
be. It could not be. There could be ways to find out, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about it. It could possibly be the ball, but
if it hit the foul pole, there should be some indication of that. I
don't know how scientific you want to get about it. It would be
nice if it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Appel, who is handling public relations for Leland's,
says, ``Leland's is satisfied by Foster's story and the video that
shows Foster retrieving the ball. It's a Lee MacPhail signature
(MacPhail was American League president in 1975). It's got two
scuff marks, indicating the bat and the foul pole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fisk ball is part of a memorabilia sale that also includes
the New York Yankees home uniform worn by Lou Gehrig on Lou Gehrig
Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium July 4, 1939. The minimum bid
for Gehrig's uniform is $295,000.
</P>
<P>
   Foster won't say what he'll do with the money. He worked briefly
as an instructor with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays last spring, but is
currently out of baseball. He says the ball has been at his
mother's home in California since he brought it back from the '75
Series. Foster will not attend the auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend suggested I do this,'' says the former Reds slugger.
``I guess knowing what the Buckner ball went for entered into it.
I've never talked to Fisk about it. I never volunteered to say that
I had it and I hadn't heard any interest that he wanted it. I
didn't realize it was historical until they started listing the
greatest home runs in history and it was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to bid, call 212-254-2555. But remember, hardball
history doesn't come cheaply. Bidding for the Fisk ball starts at
$25,000.

ISLANDERS RECALL THE MAKING OF `JAWS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the summer of blood in the water, dark fins on the
horizon, and terror in the sand dunes. It was Tinsel Town on
Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago this summer Steven Spielberg came to
Martha's Vineyard to do for body surfing what Alfred Hitchcock had
done for hot showers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the shops of Menemsha and the inns of Edgartown, the
pulsating theme of ``Jaws'' _ the fish-bites-man film that drove
grown men to shrieks of terror _ still brings smiles to the
islanders who mingled with the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told the extras not to wear red because they planned for
the colors in the movie to gradually blend from the blues and the
greens at the beginning of the movie to the bloody reds at the
end,'' said Janice Hull, an assistant to the local casting
director. ``Boy, that was a big summer.''
</P>
<P>
   None bigger. The Spielberg blockbuster, the first movie ever
filmed on the island, grossed more than a half a billion dollars.
And its story about a killer shark off fictional Amity Island is
credited with helping create a cachet that today makes the Vineyard
one of the country's most exclusive pieces of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of an ironic mixed blessing about `Jaws,' '' said
Lee Fierro, who played the role of a young shark victim's mother in
the movie's opening sequences. ``It's given the island a great deal
because people come and spend money. But on the other hand, it had
added to the hordes and hordes of people who are drawn here.''
</P>
<P>
   What drew filmmaker Spielberg, then a 20-something director who
had yet to achieve mega-mogul status, was pristine landscapes and
breathtaking ocean vistas that he would make the backdrop for a
bloody excursion with a hungry shark.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the local villagers along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a dirty old character who gets eaten up by a
shark,'' recalled Craig Kingsbury, 86, who played the role of Ben
Gardner, whose bobbing skull provides the movie's first cinematic
jolt. ``The lady testing guys for the part took one look at me and
said: `Seek no more.' Now, how the hell that shark spit that head
back in the boat after he bit it off, I'll never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury's daughter, Trina, said her mother, needlessly,
reminded her children that the skull scene in the movie was from a
cast made of their father's head _ not the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that movie five or six times now and every time
dad's head pops out of that hull _ Woooeee! _ I hit the ceiling,''
Kingsbury said. ``That still gets me.''
</P>
<P>
   The op-grossing movie of all time until ``Star Wars'' knocked
it off two years later, Jaws virtually turned Martha's Vineyard on
its ear. Originally scheduled for several weeks of shooting
beginning in the spring, production instead stretched throughout
the summer and into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July parade was filmed in May, a blessedly sunny
day, that helped make it appear a little more summer-like despite
the fact that tree limbs were bare. Some beach scenes were shot in
June when the surf's temperature was bone chilling. And that darned
shark _ actually three different mechanical ones _ kept breaking
down. They nicknamed it Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems one of the guys got drunk one day and stole one of
the sharks and he towed it around Edgartown Harbor on one of those
floating dry docks,'' said Edith Blake, who covered the making of
the movie for the Vineyard Gazette and later wrote a book about it.
``My mother woke up one morning in her little waterfront boathouse
and found herself staring at it and she thought: Good God!''
</P>
<P>
   The more human encounters are the ones most islanders recall.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Poole, who helped the local casting director, said she
wondered for days what her father-in-law, Donald Poole who played
the harbor master, and Spielberg talked about each morning as they
sat on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have to go down to the set early each morning and they'd
have these long conversations each day and finally I said to him:
`What is it that you and Steven Spielberg talk about every day?'
And he said, `Who is Steven Spielberg? I've been meaning to ask you
what that man's job is.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If Spielberg had yet to attain marquee status, the film's stars,
Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, needed no
introductions to the onlookers, extras, and those who managed to
win bit parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done the scene where I slap Roy Scheider and we had done
a couple of takes when he came up to me, put his hands on my
shoulder and complimented me with incredible enthusiasm,'' Fierro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fierro, who played the grieving and black-veiled Mrs. Kintner,
said she at first turned down the role after it required her to
utter vulgarities that was uncomfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not about to swear and say four-letter words, especially
ones that begin with F, on the big screen,'' said Fierro, a local
theatrical actress. ``They got the writer to rewrite the scene in a
different way. And they decided they liked it better that way after
all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the film itself evokes warm memories from those associated
with it, other islanders recall the tumult associated with the
filmmaking more coolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people complaining about the noise, and
closed streets, and the trucks,'' Blake said. ``They wanted to
build Robert Shaw's house over in Menemsha. And they were only
going to need it for a week or two but the stupid islanders made
them conform with all the local zoning laws. It was awfully petty.
Since then, they don't make movies here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said producers for the new Kevin Costner movie, ``Message in
a Bottle,'' briefly considered making it on the island, but took a
pass.
</P>
<P>
   If Martha's Vineyard never became Hollywood-East, the memories
of its big-time hit lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Fierro said, while she knows it's silly, she can't stop thinking
about the dangers of shark attacks each time she approaches the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   And that tingling hesitation all goes back to the summer of '74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that summer,'' Virginia Poole said. ``I
remember it from a mother's perspective. That was the summer a lot
of mothers discovered that their small kids were suddenly afraid to
go into the water.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 2 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: CUBA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass an amendment that would
have eased restrictions on Americans who want to travel to Cuba.
Voting 55-43, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the amendment to a
foreign aid package. Supporters of the amendment said the United
States' policy regarding Cuba has become outdated and
counter-productive. Opponents said U.S. policy towards Communist
countries would be undermined if the restrictions on Cuba were
eased. A ``yes'' vote favors tabling the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: FOREIGN
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 97-2, a foreign aid package
that will allocate $12.6 billion to help southeastern Europe's
recovery and reconstruction efforts in the wake of the conflict in
Kosovo. Supporters said the package will allow the U.S. to uphold
its global responsibilities within a reasonable budget. President
Clinton may veto the bill because it contains $1.9 billion less
than he wanted. A ``yes'' vote favors the package.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: S. Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 81-18, legislation that would
restrict punitive damages and class action lawsuits against
businesses regarding problems that may arise if computers and other
systems are not fully Year 2000 compliant. The bill is a compromise
version worked out by the House, Senate and the Clinton
administration. Supporters said high technology companies need
protection from such lawsuits. Opponents said the bill would leave
consumers without any recourse to recoup financial losses due to
the Y2K bug. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PRAYER
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday failed to pass a measure that would have
implemented a national day of prayer and fasting. Voting 275-140,
the resolution failed to garner the two-thirds vote necessary for
passage under special rules. Supporters of the bill said such a day
could help ease some of the problems plaguing the country.
Opponents of the measure said it would violate the First Amendment
by essentially establishing an official religion. A ``yes'' vote
supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 270-159, legislation that would
prohibit taking minors to another state for an abortion to
circumvent parental consent and notification laws. Supporters said
the bill will help enforce the current parental consent and
notification laws and ensure the safety of America's youth.
Opponents said the bill would undermine a young woman's right to
choose to have an abortion. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: H. Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 404-24, the final version of
legislation that would restrict punitive damages and class action
lawsuits against businesses regarding problems that may arise if
computers and other systems are not fully Year 2000 compliant. The
bill is a compromise version worked out by the House, Senate and
the Clinton administration. Supporters said high technology
companies need protection from such lawsuits. Opponents said the
bill would leave consumers without any recourse to recoup financial
losses due to the Y2K bug. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill. (Roll
no. 265)
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: BANKS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 343-86, a measure that would
overhaul the financial services industry by allowing banks, brokers
and insurers to merge and to share customer transaction records.
The bill also includes provisions that would require financial
institutions to develop privacy policies and would allow consumers
to block companies from sharing or selling financial information to
third parties. Supporters of the bill said it was important because
it would save consumers' money and would help keep the U.S.
financial industry competitive in global markets. Opponents said
some provisions of the bill would endanger the privacy of
Americans. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

AUTO RETAILING GIANT BUYS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GROUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Terry York's auto retailing business, which
stretches from the L.A.'s Santa Clarita Valley to Huntington Beach,
is being bought by the world's largest auto retailer as it attempts
to become a major force in the Southern California market,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the purchase of Los Angeles-based Terry York Automotive
Group by AutoNation Inc. of Fort Lauderdale were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   York, a longtime philanthropist, said he had been negotiating
with AutoNation, formerly known as Republic Industries, for about a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for his management company to continue to run the
dealerships. ``For all practical purposes as far as the operation
of the dealership and the employees everything is exactly the
same,'' said York, who started his automotive career as a file
clerk at a dealership. He and a partner set up their first
dealership in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have just about everything there we would be
interested in buying,'' said AutoNation spokesman Oscar Suris.
</P>
<P>
   Suris said a definitive purchase agreement has been signed but
did not know when the deal would close.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation is also getting York's Land Rover franchise in Encino
and a Ford store in Huntington Beach. All of the facilities will
retain the York name.
</P>
<P>
   AutoNation, which is controlled by Florida billionaire H. Wayne
Huizenga, owns nearly 400 new vehicle dealerships and 45 used-car
megastores across the country along with the Alamo-Rent-A-Car and
National rental car chains.
</P>
<P>
   The company is building a unique, multilevel retail business.
New cars are leased or sold on AutoNation's new lots or rented
through its rental companies and then sold or leased later as used
cars on its used car lots.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investor enthusiasm has waned in the three years since
the company was created. Shares of AutoNation have dropped more
than 25 percent in the last 12 months because of losses reported in
the used-car business.
</P>
<P>
   It now owns nine auto dealership groups in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big market with lots of potential car buyers. That's
why we are committed to having a major presence in Southern
California and the only way you do that is through acquiring
franchises,'' said Suris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just demographics. People with disposable income are the
folks who buy autos and that's what we are looking for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   York's sale to AutoNation is part of a consolidation trend in
the industry. Still, some independent dealers are not worried about
the increased competition from chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just continue to do business as usual. They are always
trying different things in the marketplace. They are bigger, but I
don't know if they are successful. There are sure a lot more of us
independents than the consolidated guys,'' said Steve Livingston,
owner of Livingston Motor Car Co. in Woodland Hills, which sells
Pontiac and Buick models.

DOWNEAST   SAILOR HOPES TO BEST ATLANTIC SPEED RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With dolphin sightings in the distance and the spray of salt
water on his face, Cam Lewis of Maine zips through the choppy
waters of the Atlantic with one thought on his mind: breaking
another world record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Lewis, 42, sailed around the world with four French
sailors in less than 80 days _ beating the previous record by 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   That record no longer stands in the frenzied world of sailboat
racing, where better technology and feverish activity keep sailors
rushing to the next challenge.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's a scramble to Lizard's Point at the mouth of the
English Channel. Lewis and a crew of five others rushed to sea
Tuesday morning from New York Harbor. To beat the 1990
trans-Atlantic sailing record, they must arrive at ``The Lizard''
before 10:43 p.m. EST Monday. So far, they are making record time.
</P>
<P>
   And, as sailors have come to expect, there's always a snafu.
</P>
<P>
   On day one, the crew discovered their engine compartment filled
with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get it pumped out and get the engine cleaned up in a
hurry,'' Lewis wrote in an email from the vessel. Without the
engine, which runs communications equipment they probably wouldn't
reach their finish line in time.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't stop them. As a hired hand pumped the water out
for two hours, Lewis kept speeding along, keeping a 20-knot pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Foncia, a 60-foot-long trimaran, looks like something out of
Star Wars. It's nearly as wide as it is long; the outer amas span
56 1/2 feet. Unlike other kinds of sailboats, it doesn't heel much.
It's ride is steady and stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not particularly dangerous. These boats are designed to
go fast,'' said Keith Taylor, publicist for the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a jerky ride, like a ``trolley car run amok,'' Taylor
said. And there's always the possibility that random debris could
smash against the vessel. But those on the Foncia are in constant
touch with the world.
</P>
<P>
   Via satellite phones and computer e-mail, Lewis keeps in touch
with three weather routers in New Hampshire and five in France.
Using the Global Positioning System, the routers get hourly reports
of the exact location of the Foncia, its speed and heading.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, after completing 72 hours, the Foncia had
covered 1,470 nautical miles and had another 1,449 miles to go.
Taylor said if the Foncia continues at its current clip, it will
finish the 2,888-mile voyage in six days total, about half a day
faster than the record.
</P>
<P>
   The existing record, set in June 1990 by French skipper Serge
Madec sailing the 75-foot catamaran Jet Services V., made it across
the Atlantic in 6 days, 13 hours, 3 minutes, and 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the end what will make the difference is lighter and stronger
equipment, and a passion for winning. But that comes easy to Lewis,
who lives in Lincolnville, Maine, and grew up in Sherborn, Mass.
He's been sailing since age 4. He won his first race at age 6.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's won a slew of championships, including two wins
of the Finn Gold Cup and twice winning the 505 world title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the real rock star of sailing,'' said Larry Rosenfeld,
46, his long-time friend and business partner. The two have started
their own company, Team Adventure USA, which is is building a
vessel to compete in The Race, the simply titled name of a race
around the world which will begin Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said the co-skippers aboard the Foncia _ Swiss
brothers Yvan and Laurent Bourgnon _ are among the best sailors in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brothers are like the Michael Jordans of France,''
Rosenfeld said. ``They are on TV all the time.''

 &HT;    Little Mister making fans of hot people everywhere
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Her family was vacationing in Williamsburg, Va.,
and though it was only June, the heat index registered 102 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were outdoors touring the historic sites and my face was
getting fiery red,'' recalls Barbara Mason, who has fair and
sensitive skin. ``I decided I needed something and stopped at a
drugstore to see what might help.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Harrison Twp. woman spotted a Mister Fan combination
spray bottle and small fan, she remembered seeing others use
similar products and decided to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's sold on what she's dubbed her ``spritzer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used it for the next three days through the heat wave, and I
loved it!'' Mason says. ``It kept cooling me down.''
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures and humidity soaring this holiday weekend,
chances are you'll see lots of folks with the little spray-bottles
in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is simple: Fill the bottle with tap water and
squeeze it periodically to release a fine mist. To add to the
cooling effect, there's a battery-operated fan with an on/off
button. Similar products have names such as Mist N Cool and Misty
Mates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the personal misters sell for less than $10 and use two
double-A batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Foster, 18, bought a Squeeze Breeze last summer at the ATP
Tennis Tournament in Cincinnati. ``It was hot and I saw people
using them so we went to a booth and got one,'' says Foster, who is
from Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   A camp counselor at Sinclair Park, Foster says she keeps the
gadget in her trunk for hot-weather emergencies. Her campers like
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are fancier, and bigger, versions. ``It's something we
just started carrying this year,'' says Josh Huthmacher of Sears
Hardware Store in Kettering. His store sells The Mist Stand, a
free-standing portable cooling system that attaches to a hose and
sprays mist from nozzles that can be clamped onto umbrellas or
above a patio to cool a crowd. It's $15.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to enjoying the fountain spray at Paramount King's
Island, lots of visitors have been grateful for the theme park's
giant mister aimed at patrons who are waiting in line to ride The
Beast roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   And a patented cart-mounted misting system, the Cool Cart,
allows golfers to enjoy play on the hottest days.
</P>
<P>
   The misting folks may be missing one last bet, especially with
baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   A Menopause Mister would sell like hot cakes year-round.

 &HT;    Investors acting as if expansion has just begun
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stock market is in the midst of one of those
occasional, but fundamental, shifts that cause investors and
portfolio managers to rethink their holdings _ and to make major
adjustments in them.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what they are now buying, investors seem to think this
is the first year of an economic expansion instead of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter describe the situation
this way: ``The investment preference for big, richly valued growth
stocks that has been in vogue since 1997 reversed abruptly in
April, and investors began shifting aggressively into cyclical,
value and small-cap stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter typically outperform the market in the early stages
of the business cycle, when the economy is coming out of a
recession and demand for goods and services is strong.
</P>
<P>
   According to Standard &AMP; Poor's, the industry groups with the
biggest second-quarter share price gains were basic materials
(aluminum, chemicals, iron and steel), energy (oil and gas
exploration, drilling services), capital goods (construction,
electrical equipment, machinery, office equipment) and utilities
(electricity, natural gas).
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of those industry groups were money-losers in 1998,
and in the first quarter did not perform as well as the technology
sector, transportation or consumer cyclicals (autos, textiles,
retailing, home building).
</P>
<P>
   Explanations of this turn of events vary, but most of them add
up to this: The U.S. economy is still strong, some of the world's
economic trouble spots are improving (Southeast Asia especially),
corporate profits are better than expected and investor sentiment
is upbeat. By any standard, that's a formula for stock market
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anything that benefits from greater growth and pricing
power and rising commodity prices _ especially oil and natural gas
stocks _ has taken center stage,'' said Stephen Leeb, editor of
Personal Finance. ``As long as growth continues, these trends will
remain in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Most money managers recommend investors continue to favor value
and cyclical stocks this year, especially capital goods, phone
companies, consumer cyclicals, energy and technology.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Treasuries are yielding close to 6 percent,
analysts also suggests investors hold about 30 percent of their
portfolios in bonds. The consensus asset allocation recommendation
is another 59 percent in stocks and the rest in cash, according to
a Bloomberg News poll of strategists.
</P>
<P>
   That's the consensus. The range for stock allocation runs from
35 percent to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this seemingly positive outlook, the things that bearish
analysts have worried about for most of the '90s are still in
place. The most serious is that stocks are overpriced relative to
profit growth, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index starting the
third quarter at 34 times earnings against a historical norm of
about 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   IBES International, which tracks earnings forecasts and other
data, said its ``equity valuation model'' for June indicated stocks
were overvalued by 39.5 percent compared with only 4.4 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The same index had a reading of 39.8 percent overvalued in
August of 1987, just two months prior to the market's worst-ever
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Market breadth, or the number of stock groups moving higher, has
improved this year, but on balance trading is still dominated by a
relatively small number of big stocks, on the order of the Nifty
Fifty of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the rise of 30-year Treasury yields above 6
percent, the biggest negative for the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in the federal
funds rate on June 30 momentarily rallied the bond market, sending
the yield back below 6 percent. But some bond analysts are
concerned that the Fed's adoption of a neutral stand on rates
suggests it really isn't serious about fighting inflation _ a
sentiment that could keep upward pressure on yields.
</P>
<P>
   It's important since rising yields _ especially above the
psychologically important 6 percent level _ make bonds highly
attractive to investors who may be seeking safety as well as good
returns. That means money that could go into stocks, or that was in
stocks, could be diverted to bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in consumer debt _ especially margin debt, which is
used to buy stocks _ also concerns analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre sort of way, the Fed's concern about inflation may
have been a plus for the market, since it suggests the economy, far
from heading for recession any time soon, will eventually go on to
set an all-time expansion record.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts now look for the market to go to new highs
following the Fed's lone rate hike and neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Robbins, market strategist for Robinson-Humphrey in
Atlanta, looks for a ``summer rally,'' which he said is ``typically
the market's second-strongest seasonal rally of the year'' after
the year-end upturn.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Davis Research analyst Tim Hayes said the market is unlikely
to move to new highs ``without substantial interest rate declines,
significant improvement in the earnings outlook, or a broadening of
market activity.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens to the market in the second half may be determined
by the next barrage of corporate earnings reports, due over the
next five or six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After declining in the third quarter of 1998 for the first time
since 1990, and ending the year basically flat, operating earnings
of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies rose almost 10 percent in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That was the strongest quarterly gain since the Asian crisis
began in mid-1997, and far better than analysts anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for full-year 1999 profit growth vary widely, from
about 10 percent by analysts at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to as
much as 17 percent at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most forecasters are fairly modest in their
projections for the stock market in 1999. Forecasts of 11,500 for
the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average are common, but that is
only 393 points above the Dow's all-time high set on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bearish forecasts range as low as 9,000, however, such as that
by Gail Dudack of Warburg Dillon Read. Few analysts are that
pessimistic, however.
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario favored by some analysts is that stocks will
trade within a range in the second half. Stocks will make new highs
but also suffer modest corrections (under 10 percent) as investors
move in and out of favored industry groups _ but not out of the
market.

HARVARD PRESIDENT BACKS OUSTER OF DIVINITY DEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In his first public comment on the matter, Harvard
President Neil L. Rudenstine has defended his university's role in
the forced resignation of the Harvard Divinity School dean who
stepped down last fall amid allegations of pornography use on his
office computer.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine vociferously rejected criticism in the press that
divinity school technicians had violated the privacy of Dean Ronald
Thiemann by notifying authorities about the presence of pornography
on his office computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did any Harvard personnel violate Professor
Thiemann's privacy,'' Rudenstine said in a written statement
released Thursday,
</P>
<P>
   He said the role of the university's technology staff had been
reviewed at the most senior levels of the university. He said there
was nothing invasive or inappropriate about the technology staff's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, staff members repeatedly and over a period of more
than a year carried out tasks that the dean directed them to
perform, consistent with their official duties, in a place that had
clearly become part of their professional work environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In so doing, they were unavoidably and involuntarily exposed
to inappropriate materials which they found to be not only
offensive, but severely distressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann, who presided over the divinity school for nearly 13
years, stepped down in November citing personal and professional
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   He has not commented publicly on the matter since the
pornography allegations were publicized.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Harvard Law School Professor Charles Ogletree, said
Thiemann was profoundly disappointed by Rudenstine's statement. He
said that it was difficult to understand why the university had not
contacted Theimann about the allegations earlier if they really had
been problems for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dean Theimann has made every effort to respect and maintain
the privacy for him and his family and has avoided any public
comment on the allegations,'' Ogletree said. ``After 13 years of
unprecedented success surving as dean of the divinity school, there
is a strong feeling that he is now being kicked in the stomach when
he's down, while the University continues to protect the privacy of
those who have made allegations against dean.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources at Harvard said the pornographic material was discovered
in October on Thiemann's Harvard-owned computer after he requested
a new hard drive to replace his existing hard drive, which was
full. The computer was in the office of Thiemann's Harvard-owned
residence.
</P>
<P>
   In new revelations, sources said that an explicit pornographic
image was on the computer screen when a technician walked into the
room. Ogletree said the incident didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   In a process that involved down-loading the files from the old
hard-drive to the divinity school's mainframe to the new
hard-drive, the technician saw sexually explicit file names
crossing the screen, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the presence of so many image files, the file
transfer process took an entire work-day, the sources said. When
the technician's supervisor inquired why the transfer was taking so
long, he did not want to answer, the sources said, but eventually
did.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine said in his statement that staff members were
``reluctant to report the matter,'' and eventually spoke only to
senior officers at the divinity school. After consultation, the
senior officers reported the facts to the university president's
office, Rudenstine said.
</P>
<P>
   After the pornography scandal was disclosed this spring,
Thiemann became something of a reluctant cause celebre among
internet privacy rights activists. Boston Phoenix media critic Dan
Kennedy on Thursday singled out Rudenstine in his annual ``Muzzle
Awards,'' a list of people who Kennedy said undermined free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, for the most part, declined to respond to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the recent remarks of Harvard Law Professor Alan
Dershowitz that prompted the university to defend its beleaguered
information technology staff after he referred to them as
``snoops'' and ``peeping toms.''
</P>
<P>
   In other Harvard news, the university said its technicians on
Wednesday removed from school computers an independently-produced
web site after receiving a complaint that it contained offensive
material.
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman Joe Wrinn said the site was operated by a
group known as PacketStorm Security, led by a site administrator in
North Carolina. Harvard had recently made an unusual agreement to
host the popular site in order to help distribute software security
tools.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition, the PacketStorm's site included graphic sexual
images and other material apparently intended to satirize a rival
website devoted to software-security matters, known as AntiOnline.
</P>
<P>
   According to a letter to Harvard from AntiOnline founder John
Vranesvich, the PacketStorm site included ``a large archive of
libelous and, to put it bluntly, sick material,'' including
``images ranging from people engaged in homosexual activities, to a
nun that appears to be covered in seminal fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions were accurate, said Harvard spokesman Wrinn,
prompting the University to remove the entire site from its
computers because it violated school polices. Harvard is now in the
process of returning the data to PacketStorm administrator Ken
Williams in North Carolina, Wrinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams couldn't be reached for comment, but in a letter posted
on a different site on the Web he denied that his site had posed a
threat to Vranesevich and complained that in shutting down the site
Harvard acted inapropriately, because ``no laws or rules were
broken on my part.''

THERE'S MORE TO JAZZ DIVA THAN MEETS THE EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Picture a cool blonde behind the wheel of a
Camaro cruising along the streets of her small town with Aerosmith
cranked up on the stereo. Picture that same blonde playing tasty
piano runs while seductively crooning the Cole Porter classic
``I've Got You Under My Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think only one of those images fits jazz diva Diana
Krall, you're wrong. But in the whirlwind that is Krall's life
these days, it may be hard to bring the singer/pianist into focus.
</P>
<P>
   So some facts first. She's hot. Billboard recently hailed her as
jazz's ``new empress,'' and her delicious new CD, ``When I Look
Into Your Eyes'' (Verve), hit the best-selling-albums chart at No.
68. That may not seem blistering by Madonna standards, but consider
this: There are no other jazz albums even in the top 200.
</P>
<P>
   She recently headlined venerable Carnegie Hall to rave reviews
and performed before President Clinton at Ford's Theatre in
Washington, D.C., in a concert that will be aired on ABC later this
month. On Wednesday, she will open the Jazz at the Bowl series at
the Hollywood Bowl with the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. And
you may have seen her glamorous-looking profile in the current
Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 34-year-old Canadian draws as many oohs and aahs
for her beauty as for her music. Much of this adulation has
appeared on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   When told about the numerous reviews by her fans of her shows
and CDs on the Web, Krall, who doesn't have a computer, cracked,
``They review my legs more than they review my music half the time.
... But hey, welcome to the real world.'' But while many have
discovered Krall in the past few years _ especially lately because
of her enchanting vocals _ as a teen she was already turning heads
as a pianist.
</P>
<P>
   John Clayton, who is artistic director of Jazz at the Bowl, with
CHJO in residence, says he first heard of Krall when she was a teen
after his partner, drummer Jeff Hamilton, saw her at a jazz camp in
Washington state and told him to watch out for her. ``We didn't
know she was a singer.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year attending the prestigious Berklee School of Music
in Boston in 1981 on a scholarship, Krall received a Canadian Arts
Council grant to study jazz in Los Angeles, where she worked with
pianist Jimmy Rowles as well as Clayton and Hamilton. Krall gives a
lot of credit to the Canadian government for allowing her to study
in Rowles' ``living room in Burbank'' rather than at a university.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me money to live and study with him, and they
trusted me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Krall is no overnight success. She's been paying her dues in
clubs for quite a while. She recorded her first album on a small
label in 1993, but her breakthrough came with her 1997 CD ``All of
You: A Tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Cole, Krall has a way of making the difficult look easy.
Clayton sees her as a modern-day version of Cole. ``He was one of
the few entertainers who could play jazz piano at that high level
and accompany himself, which is what Diana does so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Krall followed it up with the lush and swinging ``Love Scenes,''
which by jazz standards was a smash. Her latest, ``When I Look Into
Your Eyes,'' is a bit of a departure. Instead of using her usual
trio, including stellar guitarist Russell Malone, Krall has added
orchestration on some cuts with the help of the legendary
composer/arranger Johnny Mandel (``The Shadow of Your Smile''), who
has worked with the likes of Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   The opening cut, ``Let's Face the Music and Dance'' features a
sensuous bossa nova with Krall's intimate vocal stylings. ``When I
interpret a lyric, I like to sing it like you're sitting across the
table from me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what's so beguiling about her singing. There are
thousands of technically great vocalists out there, but knowing
when to delay a note for a half-beat (ah, the joys of delayed
gratification), or sliding two notes together, or subtly
understating something is what separates the greats from the pack.
Sinatra, Tony Bennett and other great vocalists talked about how
much they learned from instrumentalists, and the lessons have
clearly not been lost on Krall, who describes her career as
``studying the great American song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana Krall is like a fresh, cool breeze on a hot, summer
night in reference to jazz,'' says Bubba Jackson, who produces jazz
and blues concerts throughout the area and hosts two syndicated
radio shows. ``Here's a woman who can get inside a song and live
that lyric and play in such a way that it's like a whole package in
one. I mean, she is totally captivating.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds an awful lot like love. We may be passionate about
musicians, but we seem to have an ongoing affair with vocalists. In
Krall's case, though, she finds the attention paid to her looks
awkward and embarrassing to talk about. While Sinatra could play
the bon vivant or saloon singer with the touch of sadness, Krall
has those blond Venus looks that make fans fall head over heels
while leaving others suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Some can't believe looks and talent can come in the same
package, citing the fashion layout with Donna Karan clothes on her
new CD. Others gripe that she's abandoning the jazz base with the
emphasis on vocals on her new album.
</P>
<P>
   Krall, for her part, would rather talk about music but
acknowledges her image is a subject she can't avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have major conversations with journalists where we talk
about the history of popular American song ... and then they write
about my hairstyles. Whatever. I don't care as long as the music
has integrity and honesty, and I think the marketing does, too. I'm
not exactly hanging out doing covers on bear rugs. If I wanted to,
I would. That would be my decision,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Krall says she wanted the album cover to reflect who she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted everything to be natural. I like clothes. I like to
be outside, and I like to be on the beach. That's where I'm
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for photographer Bruce Weber's black-and-white portrait in
Vanity Fair, it depicts Krall as a slightly wary seductress. Her
artfully tangled hair and bare shoulders beckon us to come hither.
But her cool, level gaze, and the hand with which she thoughtfully
cradles her cheek, suggest she's rethinking this unforeseen tryst.
</P>
<P>
   ``That experience was great for me because I got to work with
Bruce Weber, who taught me a lot about making pictures and film.
... It's great to be able to meet people who teach you,'' says
Krall, who cites as inspirations songstress Rosemary Clooney and
legendary bassist Ray Brown, as well as Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   But probably her biggest inspirations are her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised by a father and mother who told us that the sky
was the limit.'' Her father, she says, is one of her best friends,
and her mother has her master's degree and pursued a career while
raising Krall and her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Krall says she goes home a lot to Vancouver Island in British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother had a bone-marrow transplant three years ago. ``She's
doing really well now. Since then, I go home every second I can.''
</P>
<P>
   It's there that she'll borrow that Camaro from her sister, who
is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer. (``My father didn't
want us to fit into the usual roles,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   As for her life away from the stage, it sounds remarkably, well,
unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cook. I ride horses. I ski. I go to movies. I hike. I spend
time with my family. I'm curious about everything. I like to live
my life very fully. I go to restaurants and be silly with my
friends and just enjoy my life. ... I'm very passionate about my
life. And I'm very thankful for my life, that I get to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   A daughter, a pianist, an arranger, a band leader, a jazz
chanteuse _ Krall is constantly playing variations on multiple
themes. Perhaps her own take on what first drew her to jazz also
describes her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the fact that I could improvise ... that I
could play music with people, and it could be improvised over a
structure, and it could be different every time.'' &QL;

 &HT;    When V-chips are down, curse-free gadget will clean up TV trash
talk
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Less is more for many Christian homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a gadget that will do away with offensive words on
television and let the show go on. V-chips are out. Curse Free TV
is in.
</P>
<P>
   A computer with a 100-word dictionary and a sense of moral
outrage allows families to hear their favorite adult programming
free of profanity, cursing and the Lord's name taken in vain.
V-chips block the entire show. This gimmick cuts out swearing only.
</P>
<P>
   ``When insulting language comes into the home, it's a kind of
violation,'' said Pamela Culbreath, a self-described born-again
Christian from Boynton Beach, Fla., who is an area representative
for the invention. ``I feel violated when I have to either listen
to garbage like that or turn the program off.''
</P>
<P>
   Curse Free TV solves both problems. The small device attaches to
the television set and monitors all programs and videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   The computer reads the closed captioned script embedded in all
programs, compares each word to the dictionary of foul language,
mutes the bad words and flashes a neutral substitute on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are mandated biblically not to allow it (curse
words) into our homes,'' said the Rev. Jonas Robertson, president
of the Curse Free TV company and pastor of the Church of Abundant
Life in New Orleans. ``This has liberated us to stand up for our
convictions and still enjoy great movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's promotional material claims there are 13 offensive
words in the movie E.T., 32 in Kindergarten Cop, 21 in Mrs.
Doubtfire and 17 in Jurassic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Curse Free TV users can watch those programs safely. No naughty
words will escape the vigilance of technology.
</P>
<P>
   And the faithful are assured that the misuse of the words
Christ, God and Jesus will be muted as well _ unless they want to
hear them.
</P>
<P>
   If an actor uses the name of Jesus offensively, the machine will
mute the word and substitute something like ``Old Man,'' Culbreath
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a special religion switch cancels that censorship and allows
religious words to be heard when, for example, watching Christian
programming, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The device does not work for live programs, news or sports. The
closed caption script trails the audio on those programs. But for
most shows, Curse Free TV will be vigilant and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Culbreath is just getting started in her territory, defined by
the 561 area code. She plans to enlist distributors and market to
churches and individuals, selling Curse Free TV for $149.95.
</P>
<P>
   The device evolved from an earlier, less rigorous electronic
censor called TV Guardian produced by Principle Solutions in
Rogers, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson tried TV Guardian in November and soon realized it
would not meet the needs of Christian homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It had a tolerance switch that allowed mild cursing to come over
the airwaves. Some words used as substitutes for cursing such as
jerk or idiot were also offensive to Robertson's ear. And TV
Guardian used close word association for substitutions that he
found objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, `kick your ---' would become `kick your rear.'
That's a word that invokes the very word in your mind (you don't
want to hear). We use, `toe.' We don't want close word
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson modified TV Guardian for Christian homes and was given
the license to sell Curse Free TV through churches and Christian
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to help families with something we feel
is really important,'' Culbreath said.

SPECIAL PROBLEMS FACE LEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN U.S. MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCHORD AFB, Wash. _ Joachim and Lizette Camacho, each 21 years
old, are highly regarded professionals in the Air Force, but they
face a bureaucratic dilemma that could abort their military careers
before they get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The married couple are not U.S. citizens. They were born in
Mexico and emigrated to the United States, where they obtained
permanent immigrant status. Under military regulations, Joachim and
Lizette Camacho were qualified to enlist in the Air Force, but they
face discharge should they fail to become U.S. citizens by the end
of their four-year enlistments.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of their enlistments, the Camachos fully expected to
gain citizenship before their terms ended and continue on with
their Air Force careers. But a major backlog in processing
naturalization requests at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service has put their hopes in jeopardy, as well as more than 2,500
military members awaiting naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   Current regulations prohibit enlistees such as the Camachos from
any assignment in the Air Force requiring a secret or top secret
security clearance. Thus, pending their naturalization, they are
excluded from two-thirds of the jobs and career paths in the Air
Force, including any assignments working on aircraft, weapons or
high-tech communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harder'' for non-citizens, says Lizette Camacho, a
senior airman who works in the personnel office as a human
resources staffer at the 62nd Mission Support Squadron at McChord.
</P>
<P>
   The Camachos in all other respects are a typical military
couple, said McChord spokesman 1st Lt. Lars Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   They met as high school students at their home town of Glendale,
Calif., and decided after graduation and marriage to join the
military for its professional opportunities. Today, they live in a
cozy duplex on base and enjoy their life in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim, who said he has always been fascinated by airplanes,
was surprised to enjoy one of the least likeable aspects of
military life _ the regimented 12 weeks of recruit boot camp. ``I
liked the challenges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lizette said she, too, was intrigued by the opportunities and
challenges of military service, turning down a college scholarship
to join the Air Force. After hours, she attends Pierce College
courses in pursuit of an associate degree in human resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are valuable people we are glad to see serving in the
U.S. Air Force,'' Jim Wolfe, a special assistant to acting Air
Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters, said of recruits such as the
Camachos. ``There is no separate standard _ these are people who
have the potential for a full career in the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Although still a relatively small number overall, immigrant
enlistments in the U.S. military have steadily risen from 5,267 _
3.1 percent _ of all first-term enlistments in 1995, to 8,171
recruits _ 4.6 percent overall _ last year, according to Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   One traditional benefit of active military service for legal
immigrants is that the waiting period for naturalization is three
years in contrast to the five-year term for civilians. Wolfe said
that historically the shorter waiting period has helped military
immigrants because enlisted personnel do not normally require
higher security clearances and classified technical training until
their second four-year enlistments.
</P>
<P>
   But a serious problem threatening the military careers of the
Camachos and other legal immigrants in the military cropped up
several years ago when the INS experienced a dramatic increase in
applications for naturalization, said Don Crocetti, associate INS
commissioner for immigration services. Changes in federal welfare
eligibility for legal immigrant residents caused a six-fold jump in
citizenship applications.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog in processing naturalization applications
immediately put many military applicants in a serious bind.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were getting to the end of their (initial) enlistments
without the paperwork being complete,'' Wolfe said. ``The waits
were getting awfully long for (INS citizenship) interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lizette Camacho, who emigrated to the United States from
Guadalajara, Mexico, with her mother at the age of 13 in 1991, the
security regulations have resulted in her assignment to the
personnel office as a human resources staffer. While she enjoys the
work, Lizette said, her goal is to serve as a cargo loadmaster on
one of the McChord Air Force Base's C-141 or C-17 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are opportunities here that you can't get outside as a
civilian,'' she said. ``But with citizenship we will have a bigger
choice of jobs in the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year rule, Lizette will become eligible for
naturalization at the end of this year, while Joachim will be
eligible in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Camacho, who was born in the southern Mexico town of
Sinaloa before emigrating with his mother to the United States at
the age of eight, said his long-term goal is to work in aircraft
maintenance, another excluded position. For now, he works at the
McChord passenger terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe and Crocetti said that an outcry from military personnel
squeezed by the INS backlog led to a joint task force of Pentagon
and INS officials that last month devised a plan to fast-track
military applications for citizenship under the three-year waiting
rule. Under the plan, each of the military services is setting up a
system to assemble the paperwork, interviews and background checks
for each applicant, then delivering the packages directly to an INS
office that will expedite final processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't doing anything in the military to judge whether or
not the person should become a citizen,'' Wolfe said. The goal is
to avoid an inadvertent loss of service by a qualified military
applicant simply because his or her application is bogged down in
the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the recruiting climate we have now, we would not want to
lose such a group of people,'' Wolfe said.

   A Helpful Hint To the government &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For much of his 35 years in Britain, Mohamed al-Fayed, the
Egyptian-born owner of Harrod's department store, has been waiting
in vain to be admitted to British citizenship and issued a British
passport, apparently because some British officials questioned the
circumstances of his purchase of Harrod's.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Fayed _ never slow to tweak the British
authorities and remind them of his plight _ seized a chance to help
others facing delays with their passports. Huge lines have been
building at government offices because of computer problems and a
new rule requiring parents to obtain separate passports for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   British citizens, who had been able to obtain passports in about
10 days, now must wait about eight weeks. The backlog has reached
500,000 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Fayed dispatched one of Harrod's distinctive,
green-liveried vans, laden with tea, coffee, sodas and water, to be
handed out to some of those standing in line. ``I just wanted to do
something to show solidarity with the long-suffering public and do
something to ease their burden,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Programmer's Playtime &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What did Mark Eppley, creator of Laplink, the most popular
software for transferring files between personal computers, do on
his 21-month vacation? ``I got into diesel equipment,'' he said at
a party during the recent PC Expo in New York. ``A tugboat, a
bulldozer and a crane. I built a yurt, a treehouse and a stage.''
(A yurt is a circular canvas structure most common in Mongolia.)
</P>
<P>
   Why the time out? ``Hey, I needed a break,'' he said. ``I've
been in the software business 20 years, and that's equivalent to at
least two full careers with a normal job.'' What's more, the
business was no longer as much of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The newly constructed stage is the setting for his annual
Spamjam party and rockfest, on his farm in Snohomish, Wash. About
200 friends, including veterans of Eppley's Team Spam adventures,
attended last year's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   This year's dates are July 31 and Aug. 1; musical selections
will be on Laplink's Web site. Insiders know that Spam alludes not
only to unwanted e-mail, but also to a 1996 outing when Eppley
lugged a Spam windsock, playing cards, boxer shorts and an
umbrella, plus the canned product, up Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   Eppley, chairman of Traveling Software Inc., which produces
Laplink, estimated with a laugh that his product has about 20
million users, but only 6 million paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   As for work, the challenge is back and, since October, so is
Eppley, busily developing new products for use over the Internet.
``The Internet changes everything,'' he said. ``And that's
exciting.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juggling Jobs by Jet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Roger Penske, there's the weekday job, as chief executive of
the Penske Corp., a truck-leasing, auto-retailing and
engine-manufacturing company that operates around the world. And
then there's the weekend job, as chairman of Penske Racing Inc.,
the most successful Indy car racing team in history, with 99 wins
at tracks around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   How does he coordinate his two careers? Interviewed by telephone
last weekend at the Medic Grand Prix in Cleveland, he said he takes
the Penske Corp.'s Gulfstream IV jet for foreign jaunts and a
Citation X for most domestic trips.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, for example, he flew back from Italy to the
Detroit area (his headquarters and home) on the Gulfstream, then on
the Citation from there to Portland, Ore., for the Budweiser G.I.
Joe's 200. He flew home to Michigan Sunday night, then on the
Gulfstream overnight on Monday in time for a meeting Tuesday in
Bologna, Italy. Then to Stuttgart and Friedrichshafen, Germany, for
meetings on Wednesday, then overnight back to Detroit by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was back onto the Citation, bound for Cleveland.
On other weekends he has returned for races from as far away as
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He says his commuting method lets him squeeze in extra work,
particularly on trips from Asia. (Never mind that any hours picked
up on one leg of a trip have to be lost somewhere else.) ``You gain
time,'' he said. ``It gives you eight days in a seven-day week.'' &QL;

 ON JAPANESE TV, THE ABCs OF MONEY   (af)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The world of high finance could hardly believe the news
on the front page of The Financial Times last month. Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co., as snooty as Wall Street's notoriously snooty white-shoe
firms get, was sponsoring a TV program for Japanese homemakers?
Surely someone had confused the firm with Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the last Saturday afternoon in June, there it was. TV
Tokyo broadcast a one-hour special to introduce ``Money Angels,'' a
weekly half-hour drama that unlocks the mysteries of financial
planning for Mrs. Watanabe and her neighbors. And every so often,
up popped an ad for Goldman's mutual funds. At least for a
half-hour on Saturday afternoons in Tokyo, the firm is trading its
white shoes for house slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a title that evokes Farah Fawcett, the program is a
serious attempt to explain the basics of household financial
planning in a country where many consumers are baffled by compound
interest, never mind dividends or debentures.
</P>
<P>
   In American eyes, sponsorship of such a program might seem silly
and out of character for a firm like Goldman, but in the context of
Japan, it is an ambitious example of a company paying more than lip
service to the widely touted mantra, ``Think globally, act
locally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this market, we think this is going to be an interesting
and potentially very successful way of reaching the consumer,''
said Mark Schwartz, who was recently promoted to head Goldman's
business in Asia. ``We would never do something like this in the
U.S. because it's not appropriate there, but here it makes a lot of
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? For one thing, Japanese homemakers have a tight grip on the
country's $11.1 trillion in household assets. They determine how
their household budget is allocated, where savings are deposited
and what, if any, investments are made.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Japanese consumers are hungry for basic
information. ``There is a very high level of interest here, not
specifically in investing but in what this world of investing and
financial planning is all about, and especially how it works,''
said Yasuyo Yamazaki, Goldman's ebullient head of asset management
in Japan. Some 90,000 people attended the 600 investment seminars
Goldman held in Japan last year.
</P>
<P>
   People here are acutely aware that as they are living longer,
the population is aging, and both public and private pension
systems are grossly underfunded. Less understood, and harder to
explain in a country where prices are falling, not rising, is the
notion that piling up cash in a savings account that earns less
than 1 percent interest _ the going rate here _ will not likely
assure a comfortable retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Mention concepts like risk and reward, portfolio diversification
and asset allocation to a typical Japanese homemaker, and be
prepared for a bewildered stare tinged with ever-so-slight
disapproval: In Japan, risk is a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   The program revolves around three women, Hinako, Yuko and
Kuroda-san, the ``money angels,'' who are meant to function as
consumer advocates. A well-known actress, Fukumi Kuroda, plays
Kuroda-san, the head of a consulting firm whom clients often ask
about financial matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, a mother and father tell their stunned
children that they should not expect any inheritance, since the
parents will not be able to finance their own retirements. The
children appeal to the money angels for help, and so begins a
series of visits to real-life financial consultants and others who
demystify market principles by explaining ways to pump up savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The topics are deliberately broad,'' Yamazaki said. ``The most
important thing is for this show to educate the viewers, because
the more intelligent they are, the better it will be for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Goldman has no retail brokerage outlets of its own, and
must rely on Japanese brokerage firms and banks to sell its funds,
Yamazaki's operation is the sixth-largest mutual fund company in
Japan, and 5 of the country's 10 most popular funds are Goldman's,
according to one survey.
</P>
<P>
   Yamazaki, a born showman, has achieved that by using unorthodox
marketing methods _ unorthodox at least for Goldman. He and his
sales force spend a lot of time roaming the banks and brokerage
firms that sell Goldman's funds. He writes a column, ``Asset
Management with Zack Yamazaki,'' for a weekly newspaper read by
more than six million people, and receives about 500 letters a
month from readers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman was receptive when TV Tokyo, the station loosely
affiliated with Japan's leading financial daily, Nikkei Shimbun,
approached it with the idea for ``Money Angels'' last year, because
Goldman had already sponsored a program on a satellite channel and
was pleased with the response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we didn't approach Japanese firms at all,''
said Masato Ikeuchi, executive vice president of Television Tokyo
Channel 12 Ltd. ``But their reaction was, well, dull. They
understand where the industry is heading, but they've not yet
reached the point where they want to spend money on advertising and
marketing.'' In any case, in their present state few Japanese
financial institutions could afford it.
</P>
<P>
   One viewer's reaction illustrates what ``Money Angels'' is up
against. Tazuko Makio, 72, who lives with her retired husband, said
the program was clear and informative, if a bit stiff, and
illustrated issues from the consumer's side better than news
programs did.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Makio won't be buying any mutual fund shares. ``Those
things are for people with a lot of money,'' she said; her nest egg
will stay in accessible, riskless savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money Angels'' represents more than just an innovative
approach to an idiosyncratic market. It is also one more sign of
Goldman's adaptation to the rigors of being a public company. In
order to smooth out its earnings stream, Goldman is trying to build
up its asset management business, which lags far behind those of
its rivals, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. But the effort is
likely to scuff its white-shoe image a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz denies that backing ``Money Angels'' raised any
eyebrows at the firm. But others say Goldman's executive committee
is sensitive about how its support for the program will be
interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say stepping out in new directions will be good for
Goldman, whatever the impact on its traditional image. A more
homespun demeanor may help the firm cultivate a whole new crop of
clients to add to its roster of blue-chip corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman may even be taking a lesson from the very companies that
have long sought its advice. ``Look, the mutual fund business is
very different from the other businesses of Goldman, Sachs,''
Yamazaki said. ``It's a consumer business, and we're learning from
Sony, Tiffany, even McDonald's.''

ROBERT POLHILL, 65, LEBANON HOSTAGE FOR 3 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va.)  (rk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert B. Polhill, an American business professor who was held
hostage for 39 months in Lebanon a decade ago, died on Thursday at
Georgetown University hospital in Washington. He was 65 and lived
in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Polhill learned that he had throat cancer four days after his
release from captivity in April 1990 and later became a well-known
public speaker on surviving the disease. The immediate cause of
death was complications of chemotherapy being used to treat an
unrelated bladder cancer, found last year, said Polhill's wife,
Ferial Seikley.
</P>
<P>
   She added that her husband, a former heavy smoker, had become
equally famous in recent years for enduring both cancer and
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both kind of went hand in hand,'' she said. ``With either, the
message was the same: Never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 24, 1987, Polhill was an assistant professor of business
studies at Beirut University College, when he and three colleagues
were kidnapped by members of a Lebanese militia posing as police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The act, the largest abduction of Americans in Beirut, was one
of several in the 1980s in which foreigners were seized by the
militias.
</P>
<P>
   Polhill was often chained in a windowless room, poorly fed and
isolated much of the time. He endured by dreaming of musical
instruments he wanted to learn how to play and of Frank Sinatra
singing.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly after his release, Polhill said: ``We
were slapped around a few times when we misbehaved. We would try to
assert ourselves a little bit, or we would reject certain kinds of
foods or not move quickly when we were going to the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said his captors knocked him down a few times, but never
drew blood. ``They were really pulling their punches,'' he said.
``We only had value to them as long as we were well.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he spent time stuffed into the trunk of a car, he said,
after the first three months, he was usually chained by the wrist
rather than by the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Usually kept in residential living rooms, he was sometimes
almost comfortable, at least compared with harsh treatment other
prisoners in Beirut received. He learned bridge from Alann Steen, a
journalism professor, who was held with him.
</P>
<P>
   Polhill was one of the first to be freed, in part, it appeared,
because of his poor health; he was a diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   It was during his post-release medical examination that doctors
discovered cancer of the larynx. After the larynx was removed, he
was fitted with a device that allowed him to speak but at a lower
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He then began giving speeches on fighting cancer. He was also a
recipient of the American Cancer Society's annual Courage Award.
</P>
<P>
   Polhill was born on June 3, 1934, in Beacon, N.Y., and graduated
from New York University in 1961. He fell in love with Lebanon
while working there in the early 1960s as an accountant for a New
York firm. He took a teaching position at Beirut University College
in 1983. He met his wife, a naturalized American of Palestinian
descent, 20 years ago, in Nicosia, Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons, Stephen Polhill
and Brian Polhill, both of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Polhill was planning to return to Beruit, but his most recent
illness prevented him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't very happy to have his freedom taken from him, and
he hoped those responsible would be brought to justice,'' Ms.
Seikley said. ``But he never held ill will against the Lebanese.''

HURDLES STILL REMAIN BEFORE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY DEREGULATION BILL
BECOMES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas) (rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now comes the endgame in the 20 years war between
Democrats and Republicans, Treasury secretaries and Federal Reserve
chairmen, and lobbyists from three of the nation's most powerful
industries over legislation to overhaul the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Business interests and government agencies, recalling the trench
warfare of an earlier era, have spent years fighting to a stalemate
over the legislation. The lawmakers benefited mightily in the
process, using the battle among insurers, bankers and securities
firms to enrich their campaign coffers by hundreds of millions of
dollars. Until two months ago, they had delivered very little in
return.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the financial industry's investment may be paying
off. With the House of Representatives' overwhelming approval on
Thursday of a banking bill that would repeal 65 years of laws
intended to bar banks, insurers and securities underwriters from
entering one another's businesses, there is a growing consensus
that this year might be different. The Clinton administration
generally likes the House legislation, and that increases the odds
that a new law will be passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very pleased with the bill, the overwhelming majority
that supported it and the clear sign of what can happen when the
administration works with both sides of the aisle,'' said Gary
Gensler treasury undersecretary. ``There is finally a real chance
for meaningful reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will still take what was once unthinkable for the
legislation to become reality: an agreement between Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Gramm blocked a Senate measure, robbing Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato of New York, who was the committee chairman at the time, of
a significant legislative victory. After he failed to win
re-election, D'Amato was succeeded as head of the banking committee
by Gramm, who, bucking the predictions of many on Wall Street,
quickly and effectively won approval of his own version of the
legislation two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bill he produced has two provisions that the White House
says would lead President Clinton to veto it. One provision gives a
decided preference to the Federal Reserve over the Treasury as a
top regulator for banks. The other exempts thousands of banks from
requirements that they make loans to members of minority groups and
others traditionally denied access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   That provision is expected to be highlighted by Clinton as he
embarks on a nationwide tour next week to areas of poverty and high
unemployment, in an attempt to encourage investment in some of the
poorest communities.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the provisions objectionable to the White House is in
the House bill, which was approved late Thursday evening by a
343-86 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill's passage was a setback for Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve. He has been unyielding in his view
that any new banking legislation must include a provision that
organizes financial conglomerates so that banks and securities
firms are affiliates of a holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The practical significance of Greenspan's preference is that
under such a corporate structure the Federal Reserve would become
the dominant regulatory agency, and the Treasury would lose much of
the authority it now has as overseer of nationally chartered
institutions. Greenspan has testified that he feels so strongly
about the point that he would rather see no new legislation than
legislation that takes the approach favored by the Treasury, which
would preserve a role for the administration as a regulator.
</P>
<P>
   The House legislation follows the Treasury's approach, while the
Senate bill takes the Greenspan position.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, administration officials and lobbyists Friday began
to figure out how to reconcile the competing measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gramm's strategy has been to bargain very hard and take to the
conference bargaining table as many chips as he could,'' said
Edward Yingling, the top lobbyist for the American Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   While Gramm has suggested a willingness to negotiate, it is
impossible to know whether he or the administration will blink, or
whether they will ultimately be able to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who tells you that they can predict what Gramm will do
is full of beans,'' said John H. Hanley, director of legislative
strategy for the Independent Community Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say a congressional conference to iron out the
differences between the House and Senate measures may begin later
this month or in August. The most positive force pushing for a law
is undoubtedly the remarkable unity of the insurers, the bankers
and the securities underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to absolutely beat the hell out of each other on the
bill,'' Yingling said. But as judges and regulators have
interpreted the rules loosely enough to enable some affiliations
between banks, insurance companies and securities firms, the lines
separating those industries have blurred.

READYING EMERGENCY TEAMS FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md.)  (jw) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ As a paramedic on the Jefferson County
disaster response team, Rick Robbins is typically called on to
handle chemical spills and rescues. He has never encountered CS, a
powerful kind of tear gas, on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't want to, either,'' said Robbins as he and a
handful of his comrades were trained by a federal expert in how to
use a sampling kit to detect the tear gas and other poisons that
can be spread through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Noxious as CS can be, federal and local authorities want Robbins
and other public safety workers to be ready to handle it and even
worse threats.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say it is just a matter of time before a local
emergency crew is first to arrive on a scene littered with the
casualties of a terrorist gas attack, an assault with a biological
agent or a nuclear incident. Perhaps it will be at the Kentucky
Derby or the city's huge waterfront fireworks show in May, the
state fair or one of many smaller local events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not preparing for if; it is when,'' said Mary
McCormick, a local telecommunications executive involved in
readying community services for this county of about 670,000
people. ``There is just so much going on and there are just so many
crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestic terrorism specialists might not put it quite that way,
but they agree that the nation could one day experience an act of
terrorism involving a chemical, biological or nuclear weapon of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent communities from being caught completely off-guard by
such an event, Congress created a domestic preparedness initiative
in 1996, which is the most extensive since the civil defense effort
of the early Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current ``first responder'' program, emergency crews
and health workers in the nation's 120 largest cities are being
trained. The training of Louisville's crews marked the halfway
point of a $157 million, five-year project that Sandy Berger, the
White House national security adviser, said must be handled in a
way that gets the job done without scaring the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is obviously a tension here between dealing with this
problem without trying to frighten the American people,'' Berger
said. ``We are trying to stay ahead of the curve. There is a
genuine problem there and we ignore it at our peril.''
</P>
<P>
   During the recent week of instruction, conducted by certified
teams from the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command in
Aberdeen, Md., local firefighters, ambulance crews, hospital
workers, police and other emergency personnel were schooled in the
fine points of recognizing a biological attack that might first
appear to be no more than a fast-spreading flu.
</P>
<P>
   They were told to respond cautiously and defensively if an
unknown agent begins leveling victims at a shopping mall. They
learned about donning protective gear and setting up
decontamination showers.
</P>
<P>
   They became familiar with the jargon of terrorism and weaponry,
a vocabulary that defines ``direct deposit'' as a means of
delivering a fatal germ and refers to the bubonic plague as a
modern threat rather than a relic of the Middle Ages. And they were
urged to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events are manageable,'' an instructor, Zach Goldfarb,
assured one of his classes of emergency medical technicians. ``If
we train for it and prepare for it and think about it in advance,
we can manage these things like we do plane crashes and other
crises and still get home safely.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the military and other federal specialists might be best
suited to handle a terrorist incident over the long term, local
emergency crews will have to cope with the consequences during the
first crucial hours, making decisions that might reduce casualties
and shape the ultimate outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the canaries in the coal mine,'' said Frank Cilluffo,
a terrorism analyst at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. ``These are the people who are going to be
there first, not the FBI or the Marine Corps. If they don't even
know what to look for or have the equipment to protect themselves,
then we will lose control right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency planners are under no illusions that the training will
eliminate panic if an attack does come.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am confident the better trained they are, the less
likely that will be,'' said Bud Fekete, assistant director of the
Louisville-Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency. ``If we
don't learn anything else but who to contact if we have the real
thing, this will be a success.''
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly cited case of biological terrorism in the
United States occurred in the Pacific Northwest in 1986, when
members of a cult trying to influence a local election spread
salmonella on salad bars. There have been dozens of hoaxes since,
including one here last October, when a letter purportedly
contaminated with anthrax was sent to an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Though the FBI considers explosives and other conventional
weapons to be the most likely terrorist tools over the next decade,
the agency cannot rule out the use of a weapon of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is reality,'' said Carl Christiansen, an agent in the FBI
office in Louisville. ``We have got to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-responder program has not been without its critics. A
General Accounting Office study issued last year said the effort in
some ways duplicated training conducted by individual federal
agencies. The report also noted that the selection of the training
sites strictly by population created clusters of neighboring
cities' getting the training while emergency and health care
workers in 12 states _ mainly in New England and the West _
received no training at all.
</P>
<P>
   Outside analysts also recommend more attention to preparing for
biological attacks, such as vaccinating responder teams against
possible agents, something the program does not now envision. And
partially to resolve any unease over such deep military involvement
in domestic matters, control of the program is being shifted next
year from the Army to the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its supporters are pleased with the progress thus far.
And if the training is never needed, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it is the worst use of taxpayers' money ever,'' said
Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, director of weapons of mass destruction
preparedness for the National Security Council.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 2 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: CUBA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass an amendment that would
have eased restrictions on Americans who want to travel to Cuba.
Voting 55-43, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the amendment to a
foreign aid package. Supporters of the amendment said the United
States' policy regarding Cuba has become outdated and
counter-productive. Opponents said U.S. policy towards Communist
countries would be undermined if the restrictions on Cuba were
eased. A ``yes'' vote favors tabling the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: FOREIGN
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 97-2, a foreign aid package
that will allocate $12.6 billion to help southeastern Europe's
recovery and reconstruction efforts in the wake of the conflict in
Kosovo. Supporters said the package will allow the U.S. to uphold
its global responsibilities within a reasonable budget. President
Clinton may veto the bill because it contains $1.9 billion less
than he wanted. A ``yes'' vote favors the package.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: S. Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 81-18, legislation that would
restrict punitive damages and class action lawsuits against
businesses regarding problems that may arise if computers and other
systems are not fully Year 2000 compliant. The bill is a compromise
version worked out by the House, Senate and the Clinton
administration. Supporters said high technology companies need
protection from such lawsuits. Opponents said the bill would leave
consumers without any recourse to recoup financial losses due to
the Y2K bug. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PRAYER
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday failed to pass a measure that would have
implemented a national day of prayer and fasting. Voting 275-140,
the resolution failed to garner the two-thirds vote necessary for
passage under special rules. Supporters of the bill said such a day
could help ease some of the problems plaguing the country.
Opponents of the measure said it would violate the First Amendment
by essentially establishing an official religion. A ``yes'' vote
supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 270-159, legislation that would
prohibit taking minors to another state for an abortion to
circumvent parental consent and notification laws. Supporters said
the bill will help enforce the current parental consent and
notification laws and ensure the safety of America's youth.
Opponents said the bill would undermine a young woman's right to
choose to have an abortion. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: H. Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 404-24, the final version of
legislation that would restrict punitive damages and class action
lawsuits against businesses regarding problems that may arise if
computers and other systems are not fully Year 2000 compliant. The
bill is a compromise version worked out by the House, Senate and
the Clinton administration. Supporters said high technology
companies need protection from such lawsuits. Opponents said the
bill would leave consumers without any recourse to recoup financial
losses due to the Y2K bug. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill. (Roll
no. 265)
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: BANKS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 343-86, a measure that would
overhaul the financial services industry by allowing banks, brokers
and insurers to merge and to share customer transaction records.
The bill also includes provisions that would require financial
institutions to develop privacy policies and would allow consumers
to block companies from sharing or selling financial information to
third parties. Supporters of the bill said it was important because
it would save consumers' money and would help keep the U.S.
financial industry competitive in global markets. Opponents said
some provisions of the bill would endanger the privacy of
Americans. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULLES, Va. _ Over the last year, the walls of America Online's
rapidly expanding headquarters here have been dotted with plaques
declaring the company's mission: ``To build a global medium as
central to people's lives as the telephone or television ... and
even more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Aren't telephones everywhere? And don't Americans
watch seven hours of TV each day? How can AOL chairman Stephen Case
dare to think that his company _ which just a few years ago lurched
from one crisis to the next and was largely a chat service for
lonely teen-agers _ belongs in the same league?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that America Online, confounding the skeptics, has
emerged over the last two years as the biggest, most powerful
company on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an astounding 39 percent of Americans' time online is
spent using services the company controls, 10 times the share of
its nearest competitor, Microsoft. AOL expects to hit $5 billion in
sales this year, more than the next 20 Internet companies combined
and roughly the revenues of NBC. Its market value of $125 billion
is bigger than that of any other media concern in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So now Case, who has been talking for years about taking on
television, has a plan to realize the ambitions of his most
audacious rhetoric _ for AOL to leap off the computer and be
everywhere, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has these parts:
</P>
<P>
   _ The company will try to roughly double the number of
subscribers, now 17 million, to its flagship America Online service
over the next five years or so. And it will aim to add several
times as many users overseas and through its other brands, like
Compuserve, ICQ and Netscape. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ It will develop new services to lure users to stay online as
long as three hours a day _ the current average is 55 minutes _
and, in the process, make advertising revenues as important to the
company as subscriber fees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ And it will set out to subsume all other media by delivering
its service on television screens, cellular telephones and myriad
other devices, in addition to computers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to establish AOL as a more important part of tens
of millions of people's everyday life,'' Case said a few weeks ago,
nibbling jelly beans in his office. ``And to do that, we have to
move beyond the PC in the den.''
</P>
<P>
   If America Online performs as planned, fending off media giants
and the rapidly growing army of well-financed Internet start-ups,
Case may be able to fulfill yet another ambition: for AOL to be the
most valuable company in the world. That would mean achieving a
market value surpassing that of its longtime rival, Microsoft, now
worth some $470 billion, or almost four times AOL's current value.
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish? That depends on how you look at it. America Online's
estimated $378 million in earnings for 1999 is barely 6 percent of
Microsoft's, so by traditional measures, AOL has a long way to go.
But for an Internet stock, it remains cheap. After a 300 percent
run-up over the last year, the stock is selling for about 31 times
revenue, far less than the comparable 150 for Yahoo. AOL closed
Friday at $115.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Overtaking Microsoft is an especially fitting goal, because much
of Case's plan resembles the playbook of none other than Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Microsoft has come to dominate the operating systems for
personal computers, AOL, Microsoft and many other companies are
fighting to control a new and crucial form of operating system, in
essence for daily life. As people wire their families, their
finances, their jobs _ even their household appliances _ into one
vast network, whoever ties it all together will have much say in
how the electronic future unfolds, and possibly capture much of the
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows is the past,'' Case says flatly. ``In the future, AOL
is the next Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Also like Microsoft, AOL has adopted a ``fast follower''
strategy. It can afford to invest in the sort of long-term projects
that smaller companies cannot. But to avoid becoming too
bureaucratic and introverted, it hopes to buy some of the most
creative start-ups. Indeed, its $4.2 billion acquisition of
Netscape Communications last year was meant to inject Silicon
Valley culture into AOL and to create a home base from which to
acquire more West Coast start-ups, which might balk at moving to
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online has a grand vision and a size that lets them
achieve it like no one else,'' said Edward Bennett, the former head
of Prodigy, whose online service was vanquished by AOL. ``Because
they have so many customers, they can sell more products and
services to them. And they get the pick of the content and services
because everyone else out there who is smaller comes to them for
exposure to their audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft certainly isn't ceding any ground. It is spending
billions of dollars to insure that Windows is widely used in
Internet-linked devices ranging from cable television boxes to
cellular phones. And a big part of its antitrust fight with the
government is over its desire to funnel Windows users to its
Internet browser and the services that flow from it.
</P>
<P>
   Case's big plans also come up against the ambitions of AT&AMP;T, the
nation's largest long-distance, wireless telephone and cable
television company. With its direct control over connections to
millions of homes, AT&AMP;T would love to drive traffic to its own
online services, especially Excite(AT)home, a consortium of cable
companies developing a high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the World Wide Web may defy any big company's efforts
to dominate it; most Goliaths meet their Davids. But so far,
America Online has grown stronger from every challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one who two years ago said, `Bye-bye, AOL,''' said
Halsey Minor, the chairman of Cnet, a technology news and shopping
Web site that just decided to pay $14.5 million to America Online
for promotion on its computing channel. ``What they have done is
extraordinary. They have created a great business.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Going Where the Users Are
</P>
<P>
   To understand how Steve Case turned America Online from
laughable to extraordinary, just follow a typical suburban
teen-ager after school. You'll see that e-mail and chat rooms are
as important to his social system as cruising the mall and talking
on the phone. If his parents want to cancel AOL in favor of another
service, he may howl, because all his friends are on AOL.
</P>
<P>
   But most parents don't want to cancel AOL anyhow. For the many
adults who are unsure of their technological sea legs, America
Online has positioned itself as the great life vest of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know one engineer in Silicon Valley who uses AOL,''
said Milo Medin, the chief technical officer and founder of
Excite(AT)home. But, he conceded grudgingly, ``every one of them
has told 20 not-technical people that AOL is the best way to get on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Such endorsements can hardly be credited to Case's discipline as
a day-to-day manager. Distant and taciturn, he has often allowed
his subordinates to wander off on uncoordinated pursuits. The
company has flip-flopped on numerous important issues and
strategies and nearly collapsed in early 1997, when its phone lines
were swamped.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online prevailed, in large part because Case didn't
waver on two central ideas: first, that the most important use of
an online service is communicating with people, and second, that it
is better to be easy to use than to have the most sophisticated
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Case's detachment _ along with AOL's intergalactic
stock price _ has allowed America Online to recruit what is
generally regarded as the deepest bench of top-quality executives
in any Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is president and chief operating officer Robert
Pittman, who gave the company much-needed management discipline and
a flair for marketing. There is the flamboyant Theodore Leonsis,
once the company's No. 2 executive, who is now running the ICQ chat
service and a few other youth-minded brands.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Miles Gilburne, the head of corporate development,
who concocted some of the world's most complex acquisition deals.
And on the rise is Barry Schuler, who now runs most of the
programming services and is spearheading the company's forays into
the world of electronic devices beyond the PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is finally all marching in the same direction,''
said Jonathan Sacks, now the head of the America Online flagship
service. ``It's not like this is a cult, but the management has
done a good job in rallying everybody around a single and powerful
vision. Finally, the company has become comfortable in its own
skin.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Buyers, Many Brands
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Bob Pittman is to hear parables about business _
especially about the importance of a well-promoted brand. He draws
from his experience as a disk jockey, as a founder of MTV and as
the head of the Six Flags theme parks and, later, the Century 21
real estate system.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his explanation for structuring America Online to offer
a series of products, each with a separate brand, rather than
unifying all of its services under a single banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I did this was at MTV,'' he explained in his
Mississippi drawl. ``We started VH1. Then we took Nickelodeon and
reformed it as a channel for older kids. It was no longer spinach,
but pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   In his vision, the America Online service will remain the
mass-market brand. But there will be others for more specialized
audiences: Compuserve, repositioned as a budget brand; ICQ, a chat
service for college types too cool to use AOL; Netscape's Netcenter
Web site, for business users. Coming next is a Netscape-brand
online service filled with the latest Web technology, to follow
Netcenter users home.
</P>
<P>
   Besides drawing more customers, the company hopes the
multi-brand strategy will help fight off competitors like
Freeserve, which is offering free Internet access in Britain, or
Free-PC, which is giving away both access and a computer in the
United States. Instead of cutting prices on the flagship brand's
service, the company can use other brands, notably Compuserve, to
match competitors' deals. Last week, it announced a plan to provide
free computers with three-year Compuserve subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can use our core infrastructure, bought and paid for by
AOL, to create new brands with a real cost advantage,'' Pittman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television is also on Pittman's mind as he considers
America Online's bottom line. For each subscriber, the company
takes in $19.44 a month in subscription fees and $4.50 a month in
advertising. He hopes that those numbers will eventually be about
equal _ and that both will grow as AOL lures users to spend more
time and money online. Indeed, Pittman looks at broadband access
and services like the company's planned interactive television
service as the equivalent of premium cable channels like HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really love AOL, would you pay $10 a month for AOL TV
and five bucks a month to get your AOL e-mail on your Palm Pilot?''
Pittman asked. ``I am loath to predict the future, but people pay
50 or 60 bucks a month for cable. I think people see us as
comparable, so we have a lot of headroom to deliver value.''

   The Well-Connected Life
</P>
<P>
   Behind Barry Schuler's desk is a blue and red box older than
many of AOL's employees. It is an Imsai 8080, one of the very first
personal computers, and it is a signal that in a company devoted to
the technological novice, Schuler is a true bit-head. He recently
put wireless networks in his houses in Virginia and San Mateo,
Calif., enabling his laptop to automatically collect his e-mail
whenever he walks in.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler joined AOL in 1995, when the company bought his firm,
called Medior, which designed games and CD-ROMs. Until a recent
promotion, his job was to run the AOL service, and he used his
designer's eye to help give it a cleaner, more consistent look.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of the software, called 5.0, is to be
introduced this fall. Instead of simplicity, its focus is the
addition of new features intended to keep users online.
</P>
<P>
   One feature inspiring high hopes here is called You've Got
Pictures, a joint effort with Kodak to let people send snapshots by
e-mail. Another is My Calendar, which lets users keep their
appointment books online. But why bother, when a hand-held
electronic organizer _ or a paper calendar _ may be simpler? As
always, the answer is communication. The service will let a group
arrange the soccer carpool by bringing together all the drivers'
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these offerings is meant to weave the details of
everyday life into AOL's services, so that users will not switch to
other providers but instead will be exposed to more advertising and
more opportunities to buy products inside AOL. The photo service
sells reprints on mugs; the calendar service hawks movie tickets
from Moviephone, recently acquired by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole game is about building the online habit,'' Schuler
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is also where electronic appliances figure in America
Online's plans. AOL is jockeying with many competitors for position
in an ever more wired world that is connecting the Internet to the
microprocessors in everything from microwave ovens to cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Many other companies are focusing on helping users stay abreast
of information tidbits: stock quotes, say, or news headlines. But
building on its heritage as the online community's favorite place
to chat, AOL is focusing on communication, building on its existing
``buddy list'' system, which now shows users which of their friends
are online and available for instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to crow about that great play in the NBA finals.
With one mouse click, you will be able to track down a fellow fan,
whether he's working on his computer, watching television or
sitting in the stadium with her cell phone. All this will take a
while. But AOL users will be able to check their e-mail on their
Palm Pilots by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious of the planned services is AOL TV, the
company's version of a concept _ interactive television _ that has
hardly taken off in other incarnations. Since paying $425 million
for the business in 1997, for example, Microsoft has sold just
800,000 subscriptions to its WebTV service, which is marketed
mainly as a way for people who don't have computers to get onto the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, starting next year, AOL TV will be sold mainly as a
$10-a-month add-on for AOL subscribers. It will allow Web surfing,
but the focus will be on services tied to watching television, like
an elaborate program guide and live chat rooms that can be
superimposed on the screen during popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are already writing e-mail, sending instant messages,
watching television and talking on the phone at the same time,''
said Anne M. Borsch, head of the AOL Devices unit. ``We're just
making it easier for them to do it all in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Ahead of Broadband
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's clear that the company will not be done in by the
Web, the biggest worry for AOL investors is broadband, the new
generation of high-speed online connections.
</P>
<P>
   So far, America Online is locked out of offering broadband
access through cable TV systems, which are generally seen as the
most promising of several broadband technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The company's responses to questions about its broadband
strategy are contradictory. Pittman spent a good deal of a recent
meeting with Wall Street analysts arguing that the threat from
broadband is overblown. America Online's research, he said, shows
that demand for high-speed service, especially at the current price
of $40 to $50 a month, is modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband doesn't sell itself,'' Pittman said in an interview.
``There is a small group that says `Yeah, it's faster.''' But high
speeds don't make a difference to the activities that AOL members
use most, he added, saying, ``Your e-mail doesn't get any better
with broadband.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, America Online is hardly staying on the sidelines. It
is about to introduce its own AOL Plus broadband service, to be
marketed initially to telephone customers of Bell Atlantic and SBC
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   And AOL's $1.5 billion investment last month in Hughes
Electronics means that Hughes will offer AOL Plus and AOL TV over
its DirecTV satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   The new 5.0 software will have special audio and video features
for users on fast connections. The company has also hired a former
television executive to develop broadband programming. And it has
begun an extensive lobbying campaign in Washington, pressing
regulators to force cable companies to open their systems to AOL.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's hot-and-cold rhetoric about broadband makes
sense when seen as part of an elaborate game of chicken in which it
is negotiating the price and terms for gaining access to cable
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Excite(AT)home, which has contracts granting it exclusive
control over high-speed cable services at AT&AMP;T and 20 other cable
companies until at least 2002, argues that it has the momentum to
be a powerful rival to AOL _ even though it now has only 500,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half our new customers are ex-AOL users,'' said
Excite(AT)home chief executive Tom Jermoluk.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, America Online is betting that the cable
companies need it more than it needs them.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman argues that if anyone can sell broadband, it is America
Online, because the most likely prospective buyers are its 17
million members. ``We realize that we're one of the few who can
write the big check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that a little close to the sort of offer-you-can't-refuse
tactics that got Microsoft in hot water?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, says Case, raising the bar slightly on his
hyperbolic ambitions _ and throwing a dig at Gates and company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will establish AOL as the most valuable and the
most respected company,'' he said. ``We won't settle for just one
of them.''

COLUMN: LIFE IS A BARREL OF PICKLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rain fell in fat, wet drops on Thursday morning,
splattering atop the 15 orange barrels outside Lower East Side
Pickles as the proprietor, Joe Davide, squinted at the sky and
pronounced business ``sour.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not much of a day to move ``the product,'' as Davide
calls his barrels of sour tomatoes, sweet red peppers, hot cherry
peppers, marinated mushrooms, pimento olives, black olives and,
most of all, pickles. He has sour pickles and three-quarter-sour
pickles and half-sour pickles. He has sweet pickles and large
pickles and small pickles. He even has specially spiced pickles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that everybody don't have,'' Davide said,
lifting the hard plastic cover of a barrel to reveal spicy pickles
swimming in the brine.
</P>
<P>
   New York, Davide is quick to remind, is a pickle town. The
pickle might not enjoy the glamour of the bagel or the acclaim of
the knish, but just imagine a pastrami and rye without one. Yet if
the pickle is everywhere in New York, it is also practically
nowhere. The old pushcart pickle district on Essex Street on the
Lower East Side has dwindled to a single store as most people now
buy their pickles from jars in grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   But if the writing was on the wall, Davide didn't read it. He
had stumbled into the business 25 years ago as a delivery driver at
Guss's Pickles on the Lower East Side, but 18 months ago he left
Manhattan to open his own store on East 19th Street off Avenue M in
Midwood, Brooklyn. He taped a notice of rabbinical approval to his
front window to assure residents in the predominantly Orthodox
Jewish neighborhood that though he is Italian and a gentile, his
pickles are kosher. He then sat back in a plastic chair on the
sidewalk and waited in vain for what might be described as the
pickle theory of economics to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who don't eat pickles?'' he asked. ``Everybody eats pickles.''
</P>
<P>
   During his years at Guss's, he learned how to make the brine of
salt water, garlic and spices, and how to properly age cucumbers
for the right degree of sourness. It was a living, but not always
an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning,'' conceded Davide, who is now 47, ``it was
embarrassing. `What do you do?' `I make pickles.' I was young then.
At that age, who wanted to be a pickle man?'' But now he takes a
certain pride in his life of pickles. When the telephone rings
inside the shop, he answers, ``Pickles!'' He says customers shout
to him on the street, ``How do you do, Pickles?'' or ``Pickle
man!'' He just smiles and stuffs pickles into plastic quart
containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call him the pickle packer,'' snickered Joe Miller, his
brother-in-law and employee.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is helping out for the summer and his specialty seems to
be marketing and public relations (``Miller, like the beer, like
I'm high on life because I can't afford any better,'' he said by
way of introduction). He's talking about a Web site and formulating
plans to ship special orders of pickles nationwide. Davide listens
to all this, but he isn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already worked 25 years in the business,'' he said. ``I
don't want to kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His pickle shop shares a bathroom with Anything Goes, a discount
ladies undergarment boutique on the corner, and, fortunately, the
owner, Mark Bayarsky, likes pickles. Often, Bayarsky sends
customers armed with bags of frilly things around the corner for a
pickle on him. ``When we open up the store in the morning, my whole
store stinks of pickles,'' he said. ``But I don't care. I love
pickles.''
</P>
<P>
   Davide knows that pickles will never make him rich. He charges
$4.25 for a quart of pickles, pricier than grocery pickles, but he
says quality is the difference. He is picking up business from a
few restaurants and delis, and Ellen Freudenheim, the polymath of
all things Brooklyn, included the shop in her new book about the
borough, ``Brooklyn! A Soup-to-Nuts Guide.'' His peak times are
Friday afternoons before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   But on slow days he or Bayarsky will run to the store for a few
beers. They usually get a sampler, tasting different brands with
different pickles in the name of market research. He knows there is
not much future in pickles, but he has come to realize that it is
good to be a pickle man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, pickles are popular,'' he proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   And with that he reclined in his plastic chair and waited for a
customer.

`THE SLEEPING BEAUTY': RETURN TO 1890 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Kirov Ballet's new production of ``The Sleeping
Beauty'' has been the subject of intense discussion this week. Much
of the talk has centered on the authenticity of detail and spirit
in this attempted return to the 1890 original and on what Sergei
Viharev's restaging has to offer to audiences of the 1990s. (It
takes some getting used to a ``Beauty'' whose Lilac Fairy looks, in
her historically correct costume, like Boadicea.)
</P>
<P>
   Irma Nioradze, who performed the title role on Wednesday night
at the Metropolitan Opera House, in some ways embodies these
issues. Hers was an interpretation that relied for the most part on
the dancing itself rather than any obvious acting to tell the story
and reveal the character of the young princess Aurora and her
awakening to womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   More naturally a frail, sad Giselle, Ms. Nioradze gained
radiance and suggested youthful excitement through her beautifully
poised carriage flashing legs and quick, darting attack. She
seemed at times to skim the ground. This was an Aurora animated by
music rather than steps or emotions, with fleeting glimpses of a
grandeur that belied Ms. Nioradze's slight build.
</P>
<P>
   Her speed robbed the Vision Scene of some of its poetry, though
Ms. Nioradze's quick, articulated footwork and fluid arabesques did
have a dreamlike quality. And the partnering looked underrehearsed
in the culminating grand pas de deux, danced with Igor Zelensky.
There was little rapport between the two dancers.
</P>
<P>
   One great pleasure of the charming, vivid production was the way
these 20th- century dancers' bodies projected 19th-century ballet
poses, to sometimes haunting effect. Sofiya Gumerova stood out for
her expressive use of her upper torso. Other standout performers
included Vladimir Ponomarev as an empathic King Florestan; Yana
Selina and Yuri Fateyev, the blessedly unkitschy White Cat and
Puss-in-Boots; Svetlana Ivanova and Vasily Sherbakov, full of
youthful Kirov presence in the Bluebird Pas de Deux, and Elvira
Tarasova, Tatyana Nekipelova, Yelena Koziyakova and Yuliya
Kasenkova in the Pas de Quatre.
</P>
<P>
   The lead cast was completed by Darya Pavlenko, a radiant Lilac
Fairy, Islom Baimuradov as Carabosse, and Polina Rassadina and
Maxim Khrebtov. Gianandrea Noseda conducted the sumptuously
performed Tchaikovsky score. Aleksandr Vasiliyev was the violin
soloist.

`GISELLE': SEDUCTION STRIPPED TO THE ESSENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Giselle'' has many faces, as the Kirov Ballet
reminded us on Thursday night when Diana Vishneva and Andrian
Fadeyev, as a young village lass and an unusually innocent seducer,
triumphed in this first of six performances that the Kirov is
presenting (Sunday excepted) through Monday night at the
Metropolitan Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   The current production still has the costumes of a staging by
Oleg Vinogradov, who apparently retains his title as the Kirov
Ballet's artistic director although Makharbek Vaziev actually runs
the troupe with the title of director of the ballet company.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the dramatic detail, always played down in the
Kirov's ``Giselle,'' has been whittled down to the minimum. The
production has a ritualistic air: the dancers do what is expected
of them, and their characters are less real than emblematic.
</P>
<P>
   Much is taken for granted. The ``Peasant Pas de Deux'' was
performed with no introduction. The likable Vyacheslav Samodurov
and the precise Irina Zhelonkina danced the more difficult Soviet
version but there was no major character onstage to watch it. The
first act speeds along and includes an understated mad scene, not
necessarily unwelcome, by Ms. Vishneva.
</P>
<P>
   The production's treasure remains Act II, with the corps
delivering a superb stylistic unity. Two of the wilis, ghosts of
jilted maidens, still fly above on wires, and the green lighting by
Mikhail Federov and Vladimir Lukasevich gives the Romantic tutus of
the wili corps a true menace. Tatyana Amosova, as Myrtha, queen of
the wilis, is a dancer of great power and surprising sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vishneva and Fadeyev received a long and delirious ovation
at the end of their performance. Given the schematic outline in Act
I, they accomplished wonders. In the Soviet era, the landmark
``Giselle'' was Leonid Lavrovsky's 1944 staging for the Bolshoi.
Its mix of realism and passionate romanticism, however, has always
been at odds with the Kirov version, which was more stylized and
often looked old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is stripped to bare essentials, the Kirov version
offers little depth of characterization. Ilya Kuznetsov kept to a
suffering image as Hilarion, the rival to Fadeyev's Albrecht. Ms.
Vishneva, a sparkling dancer who molds every movement into a
sculptural shape, and Fadeyev, a pure and unaffected classicist,
seemed to be opposites yet danced in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The first act looked overcoached. Nonetheless Ms. Vishneva's
perfect execution of her solo was a pleasure to watch. She held the
arabesques that many today omit and it is rare to see a dancer sail
through a double turn in attitude with such fluency and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has one often seen such a whirlwind of hops and turns by
Giselle's spirit right after her entrance in Act II. Fadeyev's
repentant sinner, sensing Giselle's presence at the start, had a
poetic veneer that he sustained right down to his perfect air turns
and to the moment Giselle's hand slipped out of his at the end.
Boris Gruzin was the fine conductor.

`FREE BOB': RUBIN IS KIDNAPPED, AND THE CROWD ROARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his last 24 hours as Treasury secretary, Robert
Rubin scolded Congress for legislation that would make life easier
for money launderers, cleaned out his office, and then watched in
mock horror as President Clinton's closest advisers played out
their fantasy: That Rubin had been captured by Japan's Ministry of
Finance and held for a bizarre ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping was the plot of a video entitled ``Free Bob: A
Documentary,'' which premiered in the state dining room on Thursday
night during a farewell party thrown by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was working Friday to make sure that the first
showing was also the last. But it will be hard to keep bootleg
copies from leaking out: This may be the only economic thriller to
ever star, playing themselves, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, National Security Adviser Samuel Berger, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and Jesse Jackson, who is called in,
naturally, to negotiate Rubin's release.
</P>
<P>
   The video opens with NBC White House correspondent David Bloom
reporting that Rubin is being held hostage in Tokyo by retired
officials of the proud Japanese bureaucracy who demand that he say
something _ anything _ positive about the Japanese economy. It is
only a slight leap of the imagination, because last year Japanese
officials repeatedly complained that Rubin's searing criticism of
Japan's economic mismanagement was undercutting the Japanese
government, destabilizing its markets and contributing to the
ouster of a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the White House, already in crisis management mode.
Rubin, according to intelligence reports relayed back to the CIA,
won't bend. Under intense questioning by the Japanese, he will only
repeat: ``My name is Bob Rubin. I am a U.S. citizen. Markets go up
and markets go down. I have nothing more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   An options memo is prepared for the president, but first there
must be a turf war between the White House national security team
and the White House economic team. Berger argues with Gene
Sperling, the chairman of the National Economic Council and the
producer of the video _ not about how to rescue the imprisoned
Treasury secretary, but over whose name goes on top of the memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a foreign policy matter,'' Berger deadpans in his
office. ``Japan is a foreign country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of this'' shoots back Sperling, playing out a battle
that occurs, presumably in slightly more subtle fashion, every week
in Washington. ``The demands the Japanese are making are
economic.'' Berger concludes the scene by saying, ``If we can't
agree on this, then let him fry.''
</P>
<P>
   (Sperling, in addition to his acting role, was the producer,
director and screenwriter. ``I don't want to be called the
president's economic adviser anymore,'' he said Friday. ``I do
film.'')
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the administration's arguments, the president's press
secretary is sent out to assure the world that ``we're working as a
team.'' Meanwhile, Clinton is trying to finish a crossword puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen appears in the Pentagon press room to offer up the entire
Navy budget, $82 billion, to pay for Rubin's hotel room bills at
the Okura Hotel, his luxurious prison across from the U.S. Embassy
in Tokyo. (It might take that much: Getting a shirt pressed at the
Okura runs about $20, and an informal lunch for two at the sushi
bar downstairs easily tops $250.) Greenspan finally appears to deal
with Japan's demands for America's gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would you like it delivered,'' he inquires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan and Woody Allen have one thing in common,'' one
of Clinton's top economic advisers said Friday, assessing the Fed
chairman's acting abilities while insisting on anonymity. ``They
both know how to play only one character.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jackson is appointed as a special envoy to mediate a
solution, and goes off to Japan talking about finding ``common
ground between the yen and the yang.'' When his mission is
accomplished, he declares: ``Free at last, free at last. Thank God
almighty, Bob's free at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he is. Lawrence Summers, Rubin's longtime deputy, was
sworn in as the next Treasury secretary Friday in the Oval Office.
Summers has already received congratulations on his new post from
Japan's Ministry of Finance.

to measure their quality, employers and hospitals here are well on
their way toward establishing a report card. While hospitals and
the Internet often go together like ketchup and waffles, seven
Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association members use a budding
information network to help plug holes in the medical records of
people with more than one hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An even more high-falutin' network, the first of its kind
anywhere, enables a doctor at Kettering Medical Center to look at
the heart scans of a patient at Middletown Regional Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While alternative medicine is dismissively branded a wave of the
future east of California, Franciscan Medical Center's growing
holistic center is among few in the country with alternative guru
Dr. Dean Ornish's heart program, and Children's and Miami Valley
hospitals practice the low-tech benefits of touch for premature
newborns. Instead of bucking the trend toward MedCath-type
specialty hospitals, local hospitals have established their own for
cancer at Good Samaritan, orthopedic surgery at Miami Valley,
obstetrics and gynecology at Southview, eye surgery at Kettering,
even primary care at Sycamore.
</P>
<P>
   A market of Dayton's size can't have nationally renowned centers
for treating grave illnesses, but it can find different ways of
reaching more people and keeping them healthy.
</P>
<P>
   That's a particularly valuable knack in this era of cataclysmic
changes in the way health care is delivered. As hospitals, health
plans, doctors and patients keep grumbling about new health-care
rules that are costing them all money and comfort, Dr. A. Patrick
Jonas calls all that confusion a great opportunity for innovations
in health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It forces everybody to think differently,'' and as long as
change is inevitable, the advantage will go to those who change
sensibly, says Jonas. Founder of the new Center for Innovation in
Family and Community Health, Jonas himself is changing to a solo
practice in Beavercreek after his hospital-owned practice became
part of Kettering's cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Healthy Communities (CHC) is a grass-roots
innovation that established one of the country's first networks of
community health advocates 10 years ago. Instead of groaning about
how many people fall through the cracks of the social safety net,
these advocates reach into those cracks to pull people back out.
They are neighborhood residents who know the community resources
that might keep downtrodden folks out of the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   The center has helped set up programs to provide convenient
exercise programs in urban neighborhoods, support and treatment for
the generally ignored morbidly obese, and research and advocacy for
grandparents raising grandchildren. The grandparents program has
found many problems previously obscured by grandmothers' loving
hugs, one being that the state gives almost three times the
financial support to foster grandparents as to biological
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   A Planned Parenthood program is showing how culture and
compassion can prevent teen-age pregnancy, and Miami Valley
Hospital is the country's only commercial site for a program for
turning around young mothers. Sinclair Community College is one of
three colleges nationally with credited courses in community-health
advocacy, Kettering is the only hospital that owns a school for
health professionals and Wright State was one of the first schools
where psychology students work with real patients from the time
they start grad school.
</P>
<P>
   Why here? Cooperation among social service agencies sure helps,
says CHC director Kate Cauley. So do the relative smallness of the
market and newness of the med school, she and Jonas agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're such a heartland city. It's the place where they test
whether corn flakes will sell with honey on them,'' Cauley says.

TWO FOUND GUILTY OF HOSPITAL FRAUD CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)  (jw) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two executives of the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. were found
guilty Friday of defrauding federal health care programs through
the submission of bogus expense claims to the government in the
first jury verdicts stemming from the investigation of potential
wrongdoing at the company.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives, Jay Jarrell and Robert Whiteside, were found
guilty by a federal jury in Tampa, Fla., of six counts of fraud
each. A third executive, Michael Neeb, was acquitted, while the
jury was unable to reach a verdict for a fourth defendant, Carl
Lynn Dick.
</P>
<P>
   The four executives, all of whom have worked with Columbia/HCA's
Florida division, were charged with conspiring for more than a
decade to overstate expenses at one hospital, Fawcett Memorial
Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla. Because of complex federal
reimbursement rules, such overstatements would illegally increase
compensation from programs like Medicare. As a result, the hospital
_ one of hundreds in the Columbia/HCA network _ defrauded Medicare
and other federal programs of more than $1.7 million, according to
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the four executives has been closely watched by
health care providers and law enforcement officials around the
country, because it has been widely viewed as a test run of the
government's theory of prosecution in the investigation of
Columbia/HCA, the world's largest health care company. While an
executive was acquitted, the verdict establishes that a crime did
indeed occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdicts will have significant implications concerning how
health care providers do business with the government,'' said
Charles Wilson, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of
Florida, whose office tried the case. ``Clearly, I think it will
have implications on the Columbia investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers in the case said Friday that they expected the
verdict would finally force both the Justice Department and
Columbia/HCA to reach a settlement of the potential charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the chance of unlocking what, up until now, has been
a gridlock in resolving the case,'' said Stephen Meagher, a lawyer
who represents the whistle-blower who brought the Florida case to
the attention of the government. ``Columbia clearly must get the
message that the jury was unanimous that crime was committed here,
and that some of its executives participated in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Columbia/HCA executive said the company viewed the
implications of the verdict as limited. ``This is a very specific,
complex interest expense issue for one hospital,'' said Victor
Campbell, senior vice president with Columbia/HCA. ``But it does
not directly relate to the settlement discussions that we have with
the Department of Justice.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In court records, federal investigators have said that in their
broader investigation of the company, they uncovered evidence that
similar frauds occurred at hospitals across the Columbia/HCA
system. As part of that investigation, teams of federal agents
seized documents in more than half a dozen states relating to the
company's cost reporting and other business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal charges were among the highest ever brought in the
area of cost reporting, an arcane part of the federal Medicare
system that results in billions of dollars in federal expenditures
each year and hundreds of millions of dollars to Columbia/HCA
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Through the federal cost reporting system, Medicare partly
reimburses hospitals and other health care providers for certain
expenses. The cost reports also help determine total compensation
for outpatient services like home care.
</P>
<P>
   In its investigation, the government obtained critical evidence
from second sets of cost reports and work sheets maintained at
Columbia/HCA hospitals that contained significantly lower expenses
than were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Columbia/HCA hospitals were reserving money in
the event that auditors challenged questionable expense claims;
once the period in which an audit could be conducted had passed,
the hospitals booked those reserves as revenue, people involved in
the case said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the government charged that the executives
conspired to misrepresent certain expenses that were related to
hospital administration as actually being costs for capital
improvements. Such improvements usually involve purchases of
medical equipment and other expenses that have a direct effect on
patient care.
</P>
<P>
   But administrative costs are reimbursed at a lower level than
capital expenses. By misrepresenting administrative costs as
capital costs, a hospital would illegally increase its federal
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses related to interest payments on a long-term debt
owed by Fawcett Memorial Hospital. In its reports, Fawcett
represented the debt as 100 percent related to capital
expenditures, the indictment says. But only 39 percent of the debt
involved capital costs; the rest was for administrative
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The misrepresentation in the cost reports resulted in the entire
interest payment's being reimbursed at the higher rate for capital
expenses, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a year, that meant a significant amount of
money for the small Florida hospital. In 1992, the
misrepresentation resulted in an overpayment by Medicare of
$539,984, the indictment charges. The following year, the hospital
obtained $1,215,676 in overpayments from the same scheme, it says. &QL;

 &HT;    Murphy's law: Carrying on the legacy at Peachtree
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sixteen-year-old Sarah Murphy on Sunday will run her
fourth consecutive Peachtree Road Race, not counting the first time
she traveled down the course. That happened in 1983, when her
mother Laura, one of Atlanta's top female runners at one time,
slipped a bathing suit and T-shirt over her rotund belly and, nine
months pregnant, ran the 6.2 mile course for fun. Sarah was born
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, mother will cheer daughter from their home in
northeast Atlanta. Laura Murphy, 47, can barely walk these days.
She has Lou Gehrig's disease, an illness that progressively steals
her ability to move her muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have to be her,'' said Sarah, a member of the
cross-country team at Woodward Academy, ``but I do think of me
running as a continuum of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, Laura took up running after graduating from
Emory's law school, and she loved to get up early in the morning
and join friends for a long run. She finished well in local races
and was asked to join the Atlanta Track Club's competitive team.
She eventually took charge of keeping the team organized as it
traveled around the country to races.
</P>
<P>
   She raced everything from 5Ks to marathons and owned a sub-40
minute time for a 10K, ranking among the five-fastest local women
at that distance. With a gregarious personality, she made a lot of
friends among other runners and was particularly thrilled to help
women who had never exercised much finally finish a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to go out of your way not to become a friend with
her,'' said Kirk Rosenbach, a masters runner and longtime friend of
the Murphys. ``Laura was so encouraging and always had a good word
for everyone and was very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are big reasons why Laura loved the Peachtree Road Race.
She ran in it until the late '80s, until she was no longer
competitive. She didn't like to run back in the pack, so she began
volunteering at the finish line. As one of the ``Welcome
Committee,'' she helped identify the top female runners and steered
them into the proper chute, a difficult task given the speed of the
first wave of finishers. ``We still don't have anyone who can
replace her,'' said Penny Kaiser of the track club. ``No one can do
the job Laura was able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sarah grew up, Laura's running rubbed off on her. ``I
remember every single morning, my dad would make breakfast, and
then my mom would come in all sweaty'' from her morning run, Sarah
said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura took her along to local races. Sometimes, Sarah would do
the fun run.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, who has difficulty speaking, typed in an e-mail message,
``She was so sweet and cute (not that she isn't now) and I liked
having her along and my friends liked seeing her. When it became
apparent she had some natural ability, I was pretty happy about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, 1995, a fellow finish-line volunteer at the Peachtree
noticed Laura's speech was a bit slurred. That started her on a
nearly year-long quest to find out what was happening to her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so gradual that for us who were around her every day,
we didn't notice,'' said Rosenbach, who with Laura was part of a
group that met at 6 a.m. to run as many as 12 miles several times a
week. ``She had more trouble going up hills, and her breathing was
more labored. She got a little slower. It was very subtle, but
clearly, something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Sarah decided to get serious about running,
and she set her sights on the 1996 Peachtree. She would train with
her mother, who refused to slow down to her daughter's pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would run back and forth across the street to stay at my
pace and I found it incredibly insulting,'' Sarah said. ``I would
think, 'I can't do this! I hate you!' It was a mother-daughter
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she also said, ``I don't think I'd have ever done it if she
hadn't done it. I definitely think my interest in running came from
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, 1996, doctors at the Mayo Clinic told Laura she had
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, a fatal neurological disorder that attacks nerve cells and
pathways in the brain to the spinal cord, cutting off the brain's
ability to start and control muscle movement.
</P>
<P>
   The last times she and Sarah ran together remain happy memories.
Laura remembers the Ekiden relay in the fall of 1996, handing off
to Sarah the Japanese sash that serves as a baton in that event.
Sarah recalled the Avon 5K, in which they ran and walked through
the pouring rain. ``I had no idea it would be the last one,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Laura retired from her job as a lawyer with the
Georgia Supreme Court. As her illness has progressed, her friends _
many runners among them _ have formed a group called ``Share the
Care'' to help her. Laura has relied on her running friends to help
Sarah, not only by ferrying her around before she got her driver's
license this week but also to help her with her running. When Sarah
got shin splints, Laura asked a family friend to show her exercises
to do to help it heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the luckiest woman alive. Or close to it,'' Laura said,
adding that she is grateful that she is not in pain and that she
can read and write. The disease does not affect her mind. ``I have
a wonderful husband and daughter. And extraordinary friends. And
many of those are running friends. My friends are a steady reminder
that I am not my disease.

BUDGET PRIMER: IS $1 TRILLION WINDFALL AS EPHEMERAL AS A BREEZE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where did Congress and the Clinton administration
find $1 trillion?
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a new analysis of the federal budget
this week that projected a windfall of more than $1 trillion over
the next 15 years on top of the previously anticipated $4.9
trillion cumulative surplus in that time. The Congressional Budget
Office then released a similar study that looked at the fiscal
picture over shorter periods and closely paralleled the
administration's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For members of both parties, the news that the surplus was
continuing to swell beyond what had been projected just a few
months earlier was a little like winning the lottery jackpot and
then having Ed McMahon appear at the door the next morning with a
check from Publishers Clearing House. There is so much money on the
table that they do not quite know what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that they will figure something out.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to contemplate the pile without wondering where
it came from and whether it is for real.
</P>
<P>
   The answers lie deep in the economy, with factors like business
efficiency and the huge gains being generated by Wall Street, and
deep in the government bureaucracy, where teams of analysts make
educated guesses about fiscal trends.
</P>
<P>
   Early each year the White House's Office of Management and
Budget and the Congressional Budget Office separately produce
estimates of what the government's fiscal condition will be over
the subsequent 10 or 15 years, based on their best assessments of
how much tax revenue the economy will generate and how much
spending current programs will require. Each of them then updates
its estimates each summer.
</P>
<P>
   The data that go into making the predictions rarely change
substantially within a single year. But because the U.S. economy is
so big, and because any changes affect the outlook for years to
come, even tiny changes can yield huge swings in revenue and
spending projections, and therefore in the size of projected
surpluses or, until recently, deficits. So algebra, not economics,
drove much of the improvement in the new forecasts. Chalk that up
to the magic of compound interest taught to every high school
student.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the new projections hang all kinds of policy and
political decisions, like how big a tax cut the country can afford
and of what kind, how much money is available for education and
health care and what can be done to shore up Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over arcane budget matters is so intense, said
Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget
Office, because ``adjustments that are small to professional
economists can have immense political importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the most recent round of changes included in the
administration's economic forecast. They seem technical, even
arcane, and their link to federal budget surpluses might seem
tenuous. But they get at some fundamental improvements in the U.S.
economy and its ability to create the jobs and profits that
generate tax revenues. They include an increase in the
administration's estimate of growth in productivity, or how much
each worker can produce in a given period. When productivity
improves, so does the economy's ability to expand without inflation
_ and therefore to generate a steady increase in tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In its new analysis, the administration estimated that
productivity growth would be 1.6 percent annually through 2002, up
from 1.3 percent in the analysis it prepared in February. Over the
longer run, it estimated that productivity growth would slow
somewhat, to 1.4 percent annually, a figure that is still higher
than its previous long-range estimate of 1.3 percent annually. The
CBO made similar increases in its productivity estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in productivity also helped fuel the administration's
new estimates of economic growth. From this year through 2004, the
administration is estimating the economy will expand by an annual
average of 2.5 percent, up from 2.2 percent in the administration's
last budget analysis in February. Moreover, the economy is already
bigger at this point than the administration or Congress had
predicted early this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hint of how the changing economy affects revenues _
and where the flood of new money is coming from _ in the experience
of the last few years. Most of the surge in revenues is coming from
individual income taxes. For next year, for example, the
administration now expects individual tax receipts to total $921
billion, up more than $21 billion since the February estimate.
Corporate income tax receipts are expected to come in somewhat
lower than previously anticipated, reflecting slower profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the individual tax take is rising is that more people
are working, and wages are rising at a healthy pace. But part of
the growth in individual income tax receipts stems directly or
indirectly from the long bull market on Wall Street. Individuals
are reaping substantial capital gains, and more and more people are
being compensated with stock or in ways that reflect the
performance of their employers' shares.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the rising stock market can be clearly seen in
receipts from inheritance taxes levied on estates, many of which
contain big holdings of stocks and bonds that have appreciated in
value tremendously in recent years. The administration estimated
that estate and gift tax revenue next year would be $31.4 billion,
up from $27 billion in its February estimate.
</P>
<P>
   As for the accuracy of the surplus projections, there are two
issues: whether Congress or the administration is slanting its
estimates for political reasons and whether even the best
nonpartisan economists can predict fiscal results even a year
ahead, much less a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties present the figures in ways that advance their
agendas. President Clinton has introduced 15-year projections this
year in part so he can allocate tax revenues from the distant
horizon to deal with long-term problems like Social Security while
leaving money available to deal with other issues sooner. Before
this year, no one had tried anything longer than a 10-year
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But because there are two competing sets of projections, neither
the administration nor Congress could tinker much with its
projections and get away with it. In fact, they often come up with
remarkably similar results; their forecasts this week for the
cumulative 10-year surplus were within $20 billion of each other, a
tiny rounding error.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say, however, that either of them is likely to be
correct. Their long-term forecasts have proved to be wildly
inaccurate, and even their short-term forecasts often prove to be
off by tens of billions of dollars. Three months ago, the
Congressional Budget Office predicted a government surplus of $111
billion this year. It recently increased the estimate to $120
billion.
</P>
<P>
   So no one can count on the projections. Still, the
administration and the CBO can claim that their assumptions and
projections are reasonable, which may be as good as it gets for the
purpose of policy decisions whose implications play out over
decades.

CLINTON AGREES TO DEAL WITH HATCH ON FEDERAL JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has finally agreed to an unusual
bargain that obliges him to nominate as a federal judge a Utah
Republican who is vigorously opposed by several environmental
groups, congressional and administration officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, will remove his months-long blockade of
the president's judicial nominees, smoothing the way for at least
10 of those choices to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who have been involved in the negotiations said
the Clinton administration recently sent the name of the Utah
candidate, Ted Stewart, to the American Bar Association and the FBI
to consider his qualifications, as is customary before a nomination
is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, if the bar association rates Stewart as
``qualified'' to serve as a federal trial judge and the FBI finds
no personal problems in his background, the nomination will go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a lawyer who headed the Utah Natural Resources
Department, has been a harsh critic of the president's land-use
policies and politics and, in turn, has been opposed by major
environmental groups. He is now chief of staff to the state's
governor, Michael Leavitt, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials defended the deal, saying they would
get more than an acceptable amount in return for nominating
Stewart, whom they acknowledged would not be chosen for the federal
bench by a Democratic president under ordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a friend and admirer of Stewart, has been able as
chairman of the committee to block all of Clinton's judicial
choices until the White House made a decision on Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   If Stewart is nominated, he will face an intensive campaign to
block his confirmation from environmental lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Wetstone, program director for the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington, said the nomination of Stewart would
be ``an unconscionable departure from this administration's record
on environmental and natural resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetstone said lobbyists for several environmental organizations
would oppose the nomination at any confirmation hearings, citing
their concern that Stewart, as a state official, demonstrated his
``opposition to the landmark laws that protect our natural
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups opposing the nomination include the
Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense
Council, Defenders of Wildlife, Friends of the Earth, the National
Environmental Trust and the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, however, if the removal of Hatch as an
obstacle to the administration's judicial choices means that they
will ultimately be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate
as a whole have been mobilizing to block Clinton's judicial
choices. Last week the committee only narrowly voted to recommend
to the full Senate the nomination of Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco
labor lawyer, to an appellate court seat, despite Hatch's support.
</P>
<P>
   And as Clinton moves closer to the end of his presidency,
Republicans are also seeking to keep as many judicial seats vacant
as possible in the hope that they might be filled by a Republican
in the White House after next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's nomination has proved an especially difficult issue
for Vice President Al Gore, who is seen by the environmental groups
as their greatest supporter in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, administration officials said, has insisted that if the
Stewart nomination goes forward, the White House must be able to
demonstrate that it received a good bargain in return.

CANDY MAKER FORREST MARS DIES AT 95
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Va., Pa., Fla.)  (jw) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forrest Mars Sr., creator of the M&AMP;M, died Thursday at his home
in Miami. He was 95 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In a final nod to Mars' lifelong desire for secrecy, a
spokeswoman for his company, Mars Inc., refused to provide details
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Mars ardently sought to avoid the limelight, he routinely
ended up on lists of the wealthiest Americans. The company he
built, and turned over in 1973 to his sons, now sells some $20
billion worth of candy, snacks and pet food annually, according to
Joel Glenn Brenner, author of ``Emperors of Chocolate,'' which was
published earlier this year and chronicles Mars' life. Along with
M&AMP;M's, Milky Way, Snickers, Three Musketeers and Skittles, the
company, based in McLean, Va., owns the Combos, Kudos and Twix
brands; Uncle Ben's rice, and Kal-Kan and Pedigree pet food.
</P>
<P>
   Mars was often called a recluse, an eccentric or worse. When
Fortune magazine named him to its Business Hall of Fame in 1984, it
praised him as ``one of this century's most brilliant and
successful entrepreneurs,'' and derided him as ``an irascible candy
maker with a fetish for privacy'' and ``a driven personality given
to terrifying outbursts of temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Mars did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1904, he inherited the privately held company from his
father, Frank, who developed the Milky Way candy bar in the 1920s
and quickly had a hit on his hands. Forrest Mars, however, is
credited with suggesting some ingredients for the candy.
</P>
<P>
   The two ended up squabbling, and Forrest Mars went to England,
where he marketed the Milky Way with some variations in the
formula. During World War II, he returned to the United States and
introduced a candy-coated chocolate that he named M&AMP;M's, based on a
popular European product.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he merged his company, known as Food Manufacturers,
which was responsible for, among other things, the invention of
Uncle Ben's converted rice, with Mars Inc. Fortune reported that at
his first formal meeting with Mars executives, he announced that he
was a religious man and then dropped to his knees, intoning, ``I
pray for Milky Way; I pray for Snickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mars, who in 1922 had declared a goal of making his father's
already-successful candy company a global powerhouse, ran Mars with
a system of clear penalties and rewards. Employees were to keep
their desktops neat and clean; he once hurled a basket of papers
off a senior executive's desk, Ms. Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Managers who failed to meet growth and profit targets were
dismissed. To this day, employees who arrive on time all week
qualify for a 10 percent bonus in their paychecks, while those who
arrive late are docked 10 percent. Everyone, from the executive
suite on down, punches a time clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was legendary for his extreme temper, and his fanatical
behavior,'' Ms. Brenner said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   That temper and that behavior could be exhibited upon the
discovery of a less than perfect Mars product. ``He would call up
sales associates in the middle of the night if he found a packet of
M&AMP;M's where the `M' wasn't printed exactly in the middle of the
candy, and he would order the candy recalled,'' Ms. Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Mars is also credited with coming up with a processing method
for rice that extended its shelf life, simplified its cooking and
increased its nutritional value. He marketed the rice as Uncle
Ben's. At one point he decided that people could be persuaded to
buy food specially processed for their pets, Ms. Brenner said, and
thus created the pet food category.
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration for M&AMP;M's was a lentil-shaped, candy-coated
chocolate that he saw soldiers eating while on a visit behind the
lines during the Spanish Civil War. He was traveling with a member
of the Rowntree family, Ms. Brenner said, and Rowntree went on to
make Smarties, a candy similar to M&AMP;M's.
</P>
<P>
   The name came about because, with World War II under way and
America's involvement only a matter of time, Mars felt he needed
help with the product, especially if sugar and chocolate were to be
rationed. So he approached William F.R. Murrie, then the president
of Hershey, and they agreed to become partners. Hence the M&AMP;M
stands for ``Mars and Murrie,'' according to Ms. Brenner. Today,
Hershey and Mars are archrivals in the American candy market.
</P>
<P>
   Although he officially retired in 1973, and began unaffiliated
businesses selling boxes of chocolates and plant food, among other
things, he continued to look in on the business and to call his
sons on the carpet for any problems he detected; until recently the
sons were co-presidents of the company. This, too, could lead to
extreme behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has continued to call and harass them when he saw things
that were not to his liking,'' Ms. Brenner said. When the company's
performance in 1992 disappointed him, she said, he arranged a
meeting with the chairman of Nestle SA to orchestrate a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   A series of trusts that control the ownership of the company
prevented his three children from selling the company until his
death, Ms. Brenner said. Now, she added, the company may well go
public.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his sons, Forrest Jr., who, Ms. Brenner
said, stepped down as co-president in April, and John, who remains
president; his daughter, Jacqueline Mars Vogel, and 10
grandchildren. His wife, Audrey, died in 1989.

 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Profane and imperious, Richard Harriton has for two decades run
Wall Street's biggest clearing operation, the Bear Stearns
Securities Corp., with an iron hand. A tough guy up from the
streets of Brooklyn, N.Y., his us-against-them view of the world
meshed nicely, associates say, with Bear Stearns's macho culture
and obsession with the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But Harriton apparently failed to recognize that when the
``them'' shifted a few years ago, from his competition on Wall
Street to securities regulators and prosecutors, the game changed.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities increased their scrutiny of the small, dubious
brokerage firms among Harriton's clients, he dug in his heels. And
the clearing house's parent, the Bear Stearns Companies, with as
much as a third of its revenues riding on Harriton's business,
stood behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Bear Stearns is waving the white flag. On Monday,
the firm agreed in principle to settle securities fraud charges
that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been preparing to
bring against Harriton's unit.
</P>
<P>
   The case concerns Bear Stearns' dealings with A.R. Baron, a
brokerage firm that Manhattan prosecutors labeled a criminal
enterprise after it failed in 1996, leaving investors with $75
million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   And Harriton, who as recently as five months ago told a
colleague that he thought the worst of his troubles were behind
him, is on his own. Privately, top Bear Stearns executives are
toning down their full-throated defenses of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer is trying to negotiate a separate settlement with the
SEC. Meanwhile, two criminal investigations continue into the
unit's business and Harriton's management of it. According to a
colleague, the imposing 6-foot-3 banker has lost his optimism _ and
30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the clearing business _ the highly profitable
backwater of Wall Street where the paperwork of customers' trades
is processed and where small brokerages turn for day-to-day
financing _ will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   New rules have already been instituted by the SEC, requiring
every clearing firm to more closely police its brokerage firm
customers. These and additional rules on the drawing board will
almost certainly cut profits for the clearing firms, because of the
additional staff that must be hired.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will most likely be greatest at Bear Stearns, which
says it clears 10 percent of all trades on the New York Stock
Exchange _ more than any other firm, but down from 12 percent two
years ago, when the government investigations first came to light.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements like the one proposed in the Baron case typically
call for bringing in an outside consultant to make sure that a firm
stays on the straight and narrow. For a brokerage firm like Bear
Stearns, which prides itself on its aggressive, entrepreneurial
manner, that may sting much more than the $5 million fine and $20
million in restitution to A.R. Baron customers it has offered to
pay. The settlement still must be approved by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The road that brought Bear Stearns to the SEC's bargaining table
last week has many twists and turns, but it inexorably leads back
to Harriton, 64. How could a smart man have made the series of bad
judgments that put his firm and his career at peril? Why did he
agree to clear trades for some of the most troubled brokerage firms
in America _ not just A.R. Baron, but also Rooney Pace and Stratton
Oakmont, all of which have been closed down? Why did he give these
firms Bear Stearns' imprimatur, even as securities regulators were
turning up the heat on them?
</P>
<P>
   Harriton's lawyer, Howard Wilson of Rosenman &AMP; Colin, declined
to comment on his client's negotiations with the SEC and said
Harriton would also have no comment. Harriton has maintained
throughout the investigations that he has done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A Bear Stearns spokeswoman also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Although largely unknown to the public, Harriton is a big man on
Wall Street, where he has remained the president of Bear Stearns
Securities throughout the government inquiries, operating _ as is
typical at the firm, according to former employees, customers and
others who know it well _ with near autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   As the clearing operation grew in size and profitability over
his two-decade stewardship, Harriton became even more prized at the
firm, the nation's fourth-largest publicly traded securities
concern. He was elected to the board of directors in 1989. And
though he left the board in 1997, when its size was reduced, he
remains on the firm's powerful management and compensation
committee, which meets weekly and recommends, among other things,
how much should be paid to employees below the level of senior
managing director.
</P>
<P>
   People who have worked with Harriton over the years as
associates or customers invariably describe him as arrogant,
pompous and tough. He bullied customers and upbraided his staff,
even once screamed expletives at a junior member of a regulatory
team assigned to watch over a client firm, according to a person
who witnessed the tongue-lashing.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who know him say that Harriton could never quite
outgrow the street-player persona he developed during a
working-class childhood in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side in a penthouse
with sumptuous river views, Harriton, the son of a bakery supply
salesman, ``couldn't get out of the old neighborhood,'' according
to one former associate. ``He didn't graduate to the big leagues
and learn that he's got to protect himself and his firm. He didn't
care who he dealt with, just as long as they paid the clearing
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another person who knows Harriton characterizes him this way:
``He divides the world into friends and nonfriends. He has his
friends from the old days, and he has his allies. And then he has
the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Bear Stearns finds itself not only in settlement talks
with the SEC, but also under investigation by Robert M. Morgenthau,
the Manhattan District Attorney, who prosecuted the Baron case.
Federal prosecutors in the office of Mary Jo White, United States
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, are also
investigating Bear Stearns, in its role as clearing firm for
Sterling Foster, a defunct New York brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted two men closely associated with
Sterling Foster last fall on charges that they and the firm
manipulated the stocks of six small companies it underwrote in the
mid-1990s, bilking investors out of $100 million. Both men have
denied wrongdoing; the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the A.R. Baron mess, Bear Stearns approached
its clearing business with a can-do attitude. Advertisements for
its services read, ``We clear almost anything for almost anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And Harriton embodied that spirit. One brokerage firm executive
recalled a meeting a few years ago of a committee of the National
Association of Securities Dealers on which Harriton sat. Pending
before the committee was whether to bring a disciplinary case
against one of Bear Stearns's client firms. Rather than recuse
himself from the vote, Harriton voted against initiating the
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns now says it clears trades for 2,400 firms, up from
725 in 1987. Most are hedge fund operators and professional
traders. The remainder are mainly smaller firms dealing with
individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   These clients, known in the industry as introducing firms, have
several reasons for clearing their trades through a larger
brokerage like Bear Stearns. The relationship allows a smaller firm
to operate without putting up as much capital as would be required
if it processed its own trades.
</P>
<P>
   And the administrative duties that a clearing firm provides _
like sending out trade confirmations and customer statements _ are
headaches that many small firms are happy to farm out.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the smaller the firm, the more likely that it will
want its customers to know their transactions are backed by a
powerhouse like Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   For clearing firms, the business is a gold mine. They require
introducing firms to put up a deposit, usually around $250,000.
They also levy a so-called ticket charge, generally $10 to $25, on
each trade that the introducing firm conducts for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing firms also charge interest, typically 1 percent a
month, on the margin loans that introducing firms make to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The clearing firms also have access to the cash that sits in the
accounts of the introducing brokers' customers, on which they pay
only nominal interest. And Bear Stearns, like other clearing firms,
requires that its clearing customers funnel all their trades to its
trading desks. Another brokerage firm would pay perhaps 2 cents a
share for this order flow, but the clearing firm gets it gratis.
</P>
<P>
   All this business has historically come with little downside.
The risk that an introducing firm might fail, leaving the clearing
firm exposed, can virtually be eliminated, if the clearing firm
uses its access to its clients' books to keep a careful watch over
their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, until recently, clearing firms have generally not been
held legally responsible for problems _ like unauthorized trades _
experienced by their clients' customers. Instead, those have been
the legal responsibility of the introducing firms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the law has not changed on this issue, the regulators'
view of a clearing firm's responsibilities has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases have been very kind to the clearing firms over the
years,'' said Norman S. Poser, a professor at Brooklyn Law School
specializing in securities regulation. ``I think that is changing
and more responsibility is being placed on clearing firms. To some
extent, that is coming out of the A.R. Baron situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the old, nonjudgmental approach to the clearing business
could explain some of the relationships Harriton established for
Bear Stearns, putting a Wall Street giant in business with some of
Wall Street's most marginal players.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first clearing customers he brought to the firm when
he joined in the late 1970s was Rooney, Pace, whose co-founder,
Randolph Pace, remains one of Harriton's closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   That would not be remarkable, except for the fact that Pace has
been censured by regulators three times. The NASD expelled Rooney
Pace in 1987, saying it manipulated securities. And though Pace was
barred from the securities industry, prosecutors say that he
secretly controlled Sterling Foster, whose trades Bear Stearns
cleared until the firm closed its doors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pace now is awaiting trial on securities fraud charges in the
Sterling Foster case. He did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Harriton's son Matthew, meanwhile, is an officer or investor in
three companies that prosecutors say have ties to Pace, though they
are not known to figure in any investigations: the Embryo
Development Corp., Superior Supplements and the Phlo Corp. Embryo
Development, which markets biomedical devices, was underwritten by
Sterling Foster. Superior Supplements, a maker of dietary
supplements, and the Phlo Corp., a beverage maker, are companies
whose investors include Pace or a company controlled by him. The
stocks of all three companies trade for pennies a share.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Harriton, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing,
did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the failure of another of Harriton's client firms, A.R.
Baron, that opened wide the door to the clearing world.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns had cleared trades for A.R. Baron back in 1992, but
Harriton stopped doing business with the firm that summer.
According to a former Baron executive, Harriton was worried that an
initial public offering that A.R. Baron was planning to underwrite
for a San Diego-area drug maker called Cypros Pharmaceutical would
flop. That might have left Bear Stearns vulnerable, if Baron's
deposit did not cover losses resulting from the underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in July 1995, Harriton welcomed the firm back into the Bear
Stearns fold. He agreed to lend the capital that A.R. Baron needed
to operate _ despite the fact that the firm was unable even to
secure an Exxon credit card, according to records that became
public when Baron later went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns' reunion with A.R. Baron seemed especially odd,
given that it came just three days after Baron settled a case with
the NASD in which regulators accused it of executing trades for
customers at unfair and unreasonable prices. A.R. Baron paid $1.5
million in fines and restitution to settle the charges; the firm's
chairman, Andrew Bressman, personally paid $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, A.R. Baron got into trouble again. In
September 1995, the firm's capital fell below the minimum required
by regulators. Later that month, a Baron customer notified Bear
Stearns of unauthorized trading in its accounts _ a complaint that
Bear Stearns ignored, according to an arbitration case that the
customer has lodged against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Baron's capital again fell below the required
levels. This time, Bear Stearns injected $1.1 million of its own
capital into Baron, keeping it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC ordered A.R. Baron to halt operations in May 1996. The
firm filed for bankruptcy protection that July. The Manhattan
District Attorney's office convened a grand jury to investigate the
failure in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost certainly decisions by Harriton that kept A.R.
Baron in business as long as it was. According to a former Baron
executive, well before the firm failed, one of Harriton's top
lieutenants wanted to again cut the smaller firm's ties to Bear
Stearns. Harriton said no _ a decision he very likely regrets now.
</P>
<P>
   If Harriton leaves Bear Stearns as a result of the A.R. Baron
fiasco, his likely replacement will be Richard R. Lindsey, the
former director of market regulation at the SEC. Lindsey joined
Bear Stearns in January as a senior managing director and No. 2
person at the clearing subsidiary. Trained as an engineer, Lindsey
is said to be a aficionado of technology.
</P>
<P>
   People who know the clearing world say that it is changing from
a business based on relationships to one where technological
prowess drives the bargain. A world where Lindsey may fit better
than Harriton.

JULIUS IRVING ADMITS HE IS FATHER OF TENNIS STAR
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By   JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each surprising victory at Wimbledon, Alexandra Stevenson,
the 18-year-old rising tennis star, faced another set of questions
_ intensifying curiosity about everything from her style of play to
her experiences as a black woman in a predominantly white sport.
</P>
<P>
   Then this week, as she continued her run through the world's
most prestigious tournament in her first performance as a
professional, Stevenson, the daughter of a single white mother,
began to be asked insistently about an issue &UR;  &LR; that had shadowed her
during her rise through the amateur ranks: Who is your father?
Politely and repeatedly, the young player declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson did not stop winning _ she will play in the
women's semifinals Saturday _ and the question did not stop being
asked, the interest driven by a newspaper report that claimed to
identify the father. So Friday her father came forward, saying he
was acting to help relieve the stress on his daughter as she
prepared for the biggest match of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Erving, the Hall of Fame basketball player who had been
one of his sport's greatest performers and sturdiest models of
personal rectitude, issued a statement acknowledging that he was
Stevenson's father, and that he had, in secret, provided for her
well being from the day of her birth. Erving, who was married when
Stevenson was born, said he had kept his wife informed all along,
and that his three children were aware that he had another
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand they are being besieged because she won her match
today,'' Erving, in his only public comment, told the Associated
Press. ``Getting this statement out will help.'' He declined a
request to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson has known who her father was for years, but has only
met him once, according to her mother. And in a brief interview
Friday night, Stevenson said she did not feel cheated because she
had grown up without her father present. She pointed out many of
her friends came from homes where the parents had divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been normal to me,'' she said. Stevenson said she
had also learned to live with the secret and with the agreement not
to reveal her father's identity. ``I have been well trained,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rather remarkable events Friday were only the latest in what
has been a tumultuous and often exhilarating 10 days for Stevenson.
Having graduated from high school in May, she arrived at Wimbledon
as a relative unknown who had won a berth for unseeded players at a
qualifying tournament. In quick succession, Stevenson won five
straight matches against mostly higher ranked players, becoming the
first qualifier in history to reach the women's semifinals of the
venerable tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stevenson declined to talk about her father and
declared her mother had served as her only role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had both parents wrapped into one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate about her father intensified, and the question
became unavoidable on Wednesday when the Ft. Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel published a copy of her birth certificate identifying
a Julius Winfield Erving 2nd as the child's father.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Stevenson has become an instant celebrity, and
the London tabloids have given her extensive coverage. Stevenson
has appeared quite comfortable amid the excitement, and her mother,
Samantha, a freelance sports writer whose work has appeared in The
New York Times, has moved easily and aggressively in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson has written extensively about her experiences
as a single mother raising a gifted tennis player, and over the
years she had not discouraged speculation that her child's father
was a prominent athlete. She has been working on a book project
about her daughter's life as a promising tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Samantha Stevenson said very little about her
daughter's father. ``I can't comment all,'' she said. ``The mother
maintains her silence.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared statement, Erving acknowledged he had had a
relationship with Stevenson's mother in 1980. ``All matters
concerning Alexandra since her birth have been handled privately
through counsel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Erving told the Associated Press he had met Stevenson only once,
when she 3 years old, but had supported her financially since her
birth. ``She was brought to me at a basketball clinic at a public
school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erving, now a vice president of the Orlando Magic basketball
team, initially denied the Sun-Sentinel's story. But reporters
mobbed Stevenson at the tournament, peppering her with questions
about her father.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson became pregnant in 1980 while she was living
in Philadelphia, covering, among other things, the 76ers. She moved
to San Diego, where her parents lived, to have the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevenson recognized her daughter's talent early and
enrolled Alexandra in tennis lessons at the age of 4 at the La
Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. When Alexandra was 9, she was taken in
and coached by Dr. Peter Fischer, the Los Angeles pediatrician and
tennis guru who helped Pete Sampras develop his game as a youth.
Three times a week, her mother drove three hours to Los Angeles for
her daughters lessons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Fischer's tutelage, Stevenson developed a classic style,
reminiscent of Margaret Court, whom she now calls her heroine.
Stevenson is almost a tennis throwback, using a wicked one-handed
backhand, a big serve and lightning volleys in an era when
two-handed backhands and dogged baseline play is the vogue.

   Fischer also encouraged her to play in junior tournaments above
her level to better her game, so she did not wrack up the string of
victories that might have made her a household name.
</P>
<P>
   As her game developed, Stevenson received help from other
prominent coaches in California, including Pancho Segura in
Carlsbad and Robert Lansdorp in Pacific Palisades. Fischer dropped
out of her life in 1997, when he was arrested on charges of
molesting children at his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Lansdorp, who helped Stevenson perfect her ground strokes, said
rumors that her father was a professional athlete began circulating
years ago in West Coast tennis clubs. Erving's name was sometimes
mentioned, he said, but neither the mother nor daughter would talk
about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, kiddingly, I would say, hey, who's the dad?'' he
recalled. ``But they said its not important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansdorp said the absence of her father never seemed to bother
Alexandra.``She seems a real well-adjusted kind of girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stevenson has never achieved a No. 1 ranking in the
U.S. national junior rankings, she has been a member of the U.S.
national junior team and developmental squad for several years. She
has played in international junior tournaments as a representative
of the U.S. Tennis Association, and in 1996, at age 16, she won the
U.S. Open junior doubles title.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wimbledon, Stevenson had played only a handful of
matches on the women's pro tour, and as an amateur won a
minor-league tournament in Michigan last year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she had received a wild card into the Evert Cup in
California and had lost creditably to Martina Hingis, 6-3, 6-4. In
June in the DFS Classic, a traditional Wimbledon tuneup played on
grass, Stevenson, ranked 114th at the time, upset 12th-seeded
Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France, 6-3, 5-7, 8-6, after surviving a
double match point. She lost in the quarterfinals when Magui Serna
of Spain stopped her run as Stevenson was forced to retire with a
pulled stomach muscle, trailing, 6-1, 1-0.

   The admission that he had fathered an illegitimate child was not
in keeping with Erving's public image. Many prominent players in
the NBA have been hit with paternity suits from single mothers in
recent years, and several have acknowledged supporting children
born outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Erving, or ``Dr. J'' as he was known, has always been held
apart by fans, not just for his breathtaking play, but as a model
family man who had deep religious beliefs. He has been married
since 1972 to his wife, Turquoise, and they have raised four
children.
</P>
<P>
   More than his numbers or his midair artistry, he became known as
one of the league's most prominent ambassadors, speaking eloquently
on issues of sportsmanship, race and the game.

NORTHERN IRELAND FACES LOSS OF LEGISLATURE IF IMPASSE ON PACT
CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The British and Irish governments
delivered an ultimatum to the feuding politicians of Ulster
Saturday to resolve the impasse threatening the Northern Ireland
peace settlement or see their hard fought new legislature shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern issued their formal
challenge after personally devoting five grueling days to talks
that failed to produce an agreement between the Ulster Unionists,
the Protestant group that is the province's largest party, and the
Catholic group Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute had centered on the timing of which of two key steps
in the peace settlement formula would occur first _ the creation of
a power-sharing executive to run the new Northern Ireland assembly,
favored by Sinn Fein, or the beginning of the disarming of
paramilitary groups, demanded by the Ulster Unionists. The plan
includes a first-ever disarmament pledge by Sinn Fein and sets out
a sequence that makes the two events occur within weeks of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read from the steps of the Stormont Castle
Buildings where the grinding marathon talks took place, Blair
wearily cast the document in upbeat tones but acknowledged that it
faced a test in convincing the distrustful Catholic and Protestant
communities to accept it as ``the way forward,'' as it was
entitled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most historic chance for peace that this land has
known for years and years,'' he said, ``and I ask you to give it a
chance.'' Ahern said it ``gives the whole island a bright future''
but added, ``if we can agree upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing what had blocked progress in putting into effect the
much hailed April 1998 peace agreement, the document specified that
a power-sharing executive who will run the legislature will be
nominated in two weeks, and that disarmament of guerrilla weapons
will begin in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein is entitled to two of the 10 positions in the new
cabinet, in effect the new government of Northern Ireland, and the
Ulster Unionists have refused to permit the party to occupy its
seats until the IRA begins giving up its weapons. Under the
proposal, Sinn Fein achieves its aim of entering the government
without acceding to this condition, a result that left the
Unionists complaining of unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   What the British and Irish prime ministers hoped would placate
the Unionists was a first-ever statement from Sinn Fein that it
would seek full disarmament of the IRA by the May 2000 date in the
original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also sought to reassure the Unionists with the
promise of prompt British legislation setting out the punishment of
automatic and immediate suspension of the legislature and other
institutions set up by the peace agreement if the IRA does not live
up to the disarmament pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament of paramilitary weapons, called decommissioning
here, has long been the stumbling block to peace proposals in
Northern Ireland, and the matter was left deliberately vague in the
1998 peace accord in an effort to gain Sinn Fein backing for it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Unionists' demand for immediate action on
decommissioning, and Sinn Fein's refusal to respond to it, held up
what is the most important stage of putting the overall peace
agreement into action _ the creation of the executive and the
accompanying transfer of powers from the British Parliament in
London to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That delay became particularly dramatic this week when new
legislatures in Wales and Scotland received their powers from
London in the program of constitutional reform that Blair has
brought to Britain. Northern Ireland was supposed to be part of
that move; instead Northern Ireland became the reason why Blair had
to cancel his appearance at the ceremonial opening of the Scottish
Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Saturday's blueprint, the formal exchange of powers from
London to Belfast will take place on July 18, three days after the
formation of the executive.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament proposal that led to the prime ministers' master
plan was only spelled out Saturday morning when a long-awaited
document was submitted to them by John de Chastelain, a retired
Canadian General who heads up the International Independent
Commission on Decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   The report was deliberately held up in recent days so it could
incorporate crucial compromises achieved since Monday. Thus, when
finally made public today, it referred to developments Thursday
that led the commission to conclude that Sinn Fein was now prepared
to persuade the IRA to start turning in guns on a scheduled
timetable and to have eliminated its entire arsenal by May 22,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will hold meetings promptly with representatives
of paramilitary groups to establish the dates and manner of turning
in weapons and will formally report progress in September and
December and then next May.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, appeared buoyant in his
comments on the governments' proposal. He said he wanted to work in
``partnership'' with the Unionists and urged their leadership to
stand up to ``people who want to break this down.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Trimble, the Unionists' leader and the First Minister
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, questioned Sinn Fein's commitment
to peace and criticized the governments' plan as ``fundamentally
unfair'' to his party and vague and ``aspirational'' on points
where the Unionists had hoped for ``certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble faces the task of selling a deal he clearly has little
enthusiasm for to his party members, some of whom are not
supporters of the original peace agreement and others who will find
it hard to step back from their hardline position of demanding IRA
disarmament before the entry of Sinn Fein into government. One of
them, Jeffrey Donaldson, a Unionist member of the British
Parliament, announced Saturday that he opposed the way forward
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble will also have to confront the voluble opposition of the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the firebrand preacher-politician and head of the
Ulster Democrats, who is a much lampooned figure in British life
but still commands fervent backing from his hardline followers.
</P>
<P>
   But if they do not set up the executive on July 15 with the Sinn
Fein members, Trimble and his party members will face the shutdown
of the legislature, in which their party has the most power.

BIAS INFECTS N.J. STATE POLICE, WHITMAN ADMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Three months after acknowledging that New Jersey
state troopers systematically discriminated against black and
Hispanic drivers, Gov. Christie Whitman conceded Friday that the
police force had also mistreated its own employees by tolerating a
culture of racial discrimination and sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there was evidence of ``disparate treatment'' of some
troopers by their co-workers and supervisors, the governor released
a report by the attorney general blaming the state police
leadership for failing to aggressively recruit female and minority
troopers and awarding promotions and choice assignments to white
male officers in disproportionate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited evidence that police commanders frequently
did nothing to deter or punish white male officers who openly used
racial slurs or crude sexual terms in talking about co-workers
while on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention any commanders or other officials by
name, but the new attorney general, John Farmer, held out the
possibility that some individuals would be disciplined in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The report also mentioned the Internal Affairs Bureau of the
Division of State Police, saying troopers had complained that it
had been used by commanders to retaliate against officers who had
filed discrimination complaints. The bureau's credibility has
become so tarnished that some female and minority troopers no
longer bother to report discrimination, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the report, the governor said she had ordered the
attorney general to reform the division by devising new guidelines
for promotions, revamping Internal Affairs and reshuffling the
division's command structure. Most significant, Whitman said she
would assign an assistant attorney general to monitor complaints by
troopers and help reshape a state police force that has
historically operated as a quasi-independent entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to be able to narrow it all down and say,
`One person is responsible, and it happened over a short period of
time,''' the governor said. ``This is something that has been,
frankly, happening over the course of state police history.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders criticized the report, saying Whitman was
belatedly trying put a favorable political spin on a problem she
can no longer dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has scheduled a demonstration on the
Atlantic City Expressway for Saturday to protest the governor's
response to discrimination complaints, said the report would do
little to convince minority residents that the state police would
be forced to enact meaningful reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Whitman: Her administration now admits to the
practice of racial profiling as well as racism in hiring and
promotion,'' Sharpton said at a news conference in Manhattan. ``She
was the one in denial, and we were correct all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, director of the Black Ministers
Council of New Jersey, said he was disappointed that the governor
stopped short of calling for the creation of a civilian review
board to monitor the Division of State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department has been investigating
discrimination complaints against the force for three years, and
Jackson said the attorney general's report had confirmed his
resolve to ask the federal government to install an outside monitor
to oversee the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also complained that the report failed to name anyone
who had tolerated or participated in discrimination or harassment.
And he said the report's description of unchecked racism within the
force had convinced him that Whitman must find someone from outside
the division to fill the vacant position of state police
superintendent. The previous superintendent, Col. Carl Williams,
was fired by the governor in February after making insensitive
comments about black and Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report, weak as it is, documents the failure of
leadership in the New Jersey State Police,'' Jackson said. ``If
they are going to make no personnel changes in that leadership,
then this report isn't worth the paper it's printed on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has told aides that she is considering an outsider to
reform the division, and has reportedly offered the job to one
outside candidate who has not made a decision yet. But she has
faced intense pressure from within the state Senate, which has the
power to reject her nomination, because many senators want the
governor to promote someone from within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the result of an investigation of the state
police that Whitman had ordered in response to complaints of
discrimination, which have dominated New Jersey's political agenda
since troopers shot and wounded three unarmed minority men during a
traffic stop in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings brought waves of criticism from New Jersey
residents and elected officials, and since then 12 troopers have
filed lawsuits against the state claiming racial and sexual
discrimination. The governor ordered the attorney general to
evaluate the force, and three months ago, she became the first
state official ever to acknowledge that New Jersey troopers had
engaged in racial profiling _ the illegal tactic of singling out
drivers based on the color of their skin.

 TRENTON: their skin.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As she released the attorney general's findings Friday, the
governor avoided using the word ``discrimination,'' but offered
statistics showing that women now make up just 3 percent of the
2,700-member force and that 14 percent of the troopers are black or
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Minority representation on the force has dropped significantly
since 1992, when the Justice Department ended a 17-year consent
decree that had forced the state police to hire more women and
members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted the high number of troopers who have filed
lawsuits charging a similar pattern of discrimination, racial slurs
and hostility at work, but it offered few specific examples.
However, Phil Moran, a lawyer who represents many of the minority
troopers who have sued, said the attorney general's office had
reviewed court papers from several of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said the clients whose complaints were reviewed included:
female troopers who said their commander had referred to them using
vulgar descriptions of female genitalia, black officers who said
they had been frequently demeaned by racial slurs, and a Hispanic
officer who said he had been verbally harassed and abandoned on a
roadway after having been stripped down to his underwear by fellow
troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers' mistrust of their leadership has become so widespread
that last month 65 female and minority officers formed their own
fraternal organization to defend themselves against any retaliatory
disciplinary charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear what these people have been through, it's hard
to believe we're even talking about this century,'' said Moran, who
represents the minority troopers' association.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report did not identify commanders who were likely
to be disciplined, one administration official, who asked not to be
identified, said the attorney general's office was still reviewing
some of the most serious complaints against supervisors who turned
a blind eye to discrimination. If the charges are substantiated,
the supervisors could face disciplinary charges or dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman said the fundamental purpose of the report was to
chart a path toward reforming the state police, not to single out
individual offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said she would allocate money for the division to
buy computers to track complaints against officers and act as an
early warning system against those with repeated disciplinary
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The division will also be compelled to recruit more minority and
female cadets, Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The state police will also establish a toll-free telephone
number to accept complaints of trooper misconduct and open three
walk-in centers outside state police barracks so civilians can file
reports in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state police risk their lives each and every day to keep
us safe, and in carrying out their work need our full support,''
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we cannot rest until we bolster the public's
trust. The report we're releasing today is a first step in renewing
that trust.''

 &HT;    Coles quickly gets to point of his many roles for Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A couple of stories about point guard Bimbo Coles,
acquired Tuesday by the Hawks in the package deal for Mookie
Blaylock:
</P>
<P>
   Coles, who made his first visit to Atlanta on Friday as a member
of the Hawks, was the primary playmaker last season at Golden
State, which fell just short of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   One night in April, Coles played 25 minutes against Dallas and
scored two points. A radio reporter asked Coles how he thought he
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we win?'' Coles asked him.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter answered, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I played great,'' Coles said.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, the Warriors went up against runaway Pacific
Division winner Portland. Coles scored 16 of his 24 points in the
fourth quarter when the Warriors overcame an eight-point deficit
and scored on their final 12 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he noted that the two games reflect his philosophy.
He will do whatever is required to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dive to get loose balls. Ask me to score. Take a charge. Pass
to Smitty and Dikembe. Whatever it takes to win games. I hate to
lose. You will see that. I don't take losing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 31, with nine years in the league, Coles knows too much
about losing. His Golden State teams went through coaching changes
and roster upheaval, along with the Latrell Sprewell choking
incident, which tore the squad apart in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At his previous layover, Miami ran a revolving door out of the
locker room, allowing players like Steve Smith, Grant Long, Rony
Seikaly and Glen Rice to leave.
</P>
<P>
   This is Coles' third stop. ``A good trade for me,'' he called
it. ``For one thing, I'm coming to a team and organization that I
think are committed to winning. I'm working for a Hall of Fame
coach in Lenny Wilkens. I can't wait to play for him. We talked for
10, 15 minutes, and I got excited. Plus, I'm on the same team with
great players like Dikembe Mutombo and Steve Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever confused Coles with greatness. But he has been a
scrappy player throughout his career. ``I can't think of another
guard who is better on defense,'' Miami Heat coach Pat Riley said
before trading Coles to the Warriors in the Tim Hardaway deal in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Coles said he expects to contribute to his new team, even with
the Hawks drafting point guard Jason Terry out of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny told me every position is open, that you earn your
minutes and earn your role. I'm going in to earn my spot.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes the role of mentor to Terry and lightly-experienced
Anthony Johnson. ``I've always wanted to coach. (This is an)
opportunity to work on those skills,'' he said. ``It's good to be
around young guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles was conducting a youth basketball camp in Lewisburg,
W.Va., where he lives, when he awakened to news of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the guy who helps me train,'' Coles said, ``and told
him, 'Let's go to the gym _ right now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks notes
</P>
<P>
   With the 52nd pick of the draft, the Hawks took Roberto
Bergeson, a 6-foot-6 guard from Boise State, then revealed that
they had been acting as a surrogate for the Portland Trail Blazers.
Officially, the Hawks did it for ``cash considerations.'' However,
the Portland Oregonian reported those considerations as $500,000.
Going from one of the world's wealthiest men, Paul Allen, to
another, Ted Turner, that's a nice token of thanks. That sum, by
the way, pays 71 percent of Dion Glover's rookie salary of
$700,000. ... Hawks rookies and free agents will be at Life
University for practice and games on July 12. Young veterans
Roshown McLeod and Johnson will participate. Former Hawk Ivano
Newbill also has been invited. ... When the games start July 15,
three of the top rookie point guards from the draft could be
playing _ the Hawks' Terry (No. 10), Cleveland's Andre Miller (No.
8) and Charlotte's Baron Davis (No. 3). In addition, Orlando will
bring Corey Magette, the 13th pick acquired from Seattle.

 &HT;    Cope can't qualify for 7th time in 16 races
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<TEXT>
<P>
   Daytona Beach, Fla. _ Derrike Cope's tough season got even worse
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cope, the 1990 Daytona 500 winner, failed to qualify for
tonight's Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway. It was
Cope's seventh DNQ of the season and his third in the last six
events.
</P>
<P>
   Cope, 41, is 42nd in points and hasn't been higher than 40th
since finishing 18th in the season-opening Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pressley, who is 40th in points, was the only other
Winston Cup regular who failed to qualify. Also missing the race
were Hut Stricklin, Ken Bouchard and Stanton Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lepage made the race, but he lost nine starting spots
because of an oversight. Lepage's No. 16 Ford team missed Friday's
5:35 p.m. deadline to notify NASCAR officials they were standing on
their time from Thursday night's first-round qualifying, which
would have put him in the 31st starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lepage missed the deadline, NASCAR officials ruled that he
had to drive in second-round qualifying. Lepage elected not to run
and took the fourth of seven provisionals and will start 40th.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton, who is fourth in points and only 240 behind leader
Dale Jarrett, also didn't attempt to qualify Friday. Burton didn't
complete his two qualifying laps Thursday after the engine in his
No. 99 Ford blew up. He took the first provisional and will start
37th.
</P>
<P>
   Here's looking at you
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nadeau's No. 9 Ford is sporting a new paint job for
tonight's race, with pro wrestling star Bill Goldberg painted on
the hood. Nadeau, whose primary sponsor is the Cartoon Network,
will also have an Atlanta Braves paint job later this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to have your likeness on the hood of a car,''
Goldberg said. ``I've had a lot of dreams come true during the last
couple of years and this is one of the them. The next one is
driving. I've got to talk to NASCAR about the weight limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcis running strong
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marcis, who missed last week's race at Sears Point because
of injuries suffered in a crash at Pocono on June 20, starts 22nd
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Marcis, 58, will attempt to break Richard Petty's records for
most laps and miles completed in the Pepsi 400. Marcis, who has the
most career starts at Daytona with 60, needs to complete 133 laps
and 372.5 miles to surpass Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to retire as a driver,'' Marcis said. ``I enjoy
racing as much as anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Running strong in front
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon became only the seventh driver to win the Daytona
500 from the pole on Feb. 14. In the previous 40 races at Daytona
in July, the front-row starters have accounted for 11 victories.
The last driver to win the Pepsi 400 from the pole was Dale
Earnhardt in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt fastest in practice
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who finished second in the Daytona 500, had the
fastest average speed in Friday's practice. Earnhardt covered the
2.5-mile oval in 47.371 seconds, an average speed of 189.99 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed Earnhardt's car has spent most of the time covered
up,'' Bobby Labonte said. ``That's a good sign _ for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin was second-fastest at 189.865 mph, followed by
Bobby Hamilton, Jerry Nadeau and Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Among the drivers struggling were Jeff Burton (32nd), Kyle Petty
(37th) and Ernie Irvan (42nd).

 &HT;    Pepsi 400 a prime test for NASCAR
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Earlier this season, NASCAR retained
television negotiating rights from track promoters, and it will
package all of its Winston Cup races to a major network when the
current contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
   While the new deal, which could be worth as much as $500
million, won't be announced for several months, NASCAR executives
could get a good gauge tonight of just how valuable their sport is
to network television.
</P>
<P>
   Barring inclement weather, tonight's Pepsi 400 at Daytona
International Speedway will be the first auto race broadcast live
in prime time on network television.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which will televise tonight's race, was supposed to
broadcast last year's Pepsi 400 in prime time, but the event was
postponed until Oct. 17 because of area wildfires. Lights weren't
installed above the storied track until May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another milestone for motor sports, for NASCAR, and it's
certainly a compliment to the sport,'' NASCAR president Bill France
Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was the first network to broadcast a NASCAR race live in
1979, when the Daytona 500 drew a 10.5 rating, its highest rating
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that time, the races had been joined in progress, maybe
with taped highlights of the first half, if that,'' France said.
``Most of the broadcasters didn't know if they could keep the
attention for 3 1/2 hours. The fear was always (cars just going)
'round and 'round.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's coverage of this year's Daytona 500 drew a national rating
of 9.6, its highest rating since 1987 and a 12 percent increase
from last year. CBS and NASCAR officials are looking for a rating
around 5.0 tonight since ratings on Saturday are usually the lowest
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   That figure would match the 5.0 rating the Indianapolis 500 drew
on ABC on May 30, the lowest rating ever when the open-wheel race
was run on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was 18 years old, I'd be on a date (Saturday) night,
hopefully,'' NASCAR driver Bobby Labonte said. ``But that was
before I had this life. Seriously, I think it's great the race is
on prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's coverage certainly won't be lacking in storylines.
Two-time defending Winston Cup champ Jeff Gordon will attempt to
become only the fifth driver to win both events at Daytona in the
same season. Gordon, who starts 11th, also would become the fifth
driver with consecutive victories in the Pepsi 400.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nemechek and Ricky Rudd, ranked 37th and 38th in points,
respectively, will start on the front row.

 &HT;    Tension mounting for U.S.
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ How can the United States and Brazil
possibly top their scintillating wins in the Women's World Cup
quarterfinals? By playing each other, which is exactly how the draw
has worked out for Sunday's semifinal at Stanford Stadium that
could escalate the tensions even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way they had to pull out those victories on Thursday,
and the success of their high-powered offenses thus far in the
tournament, such fireworks are virtually assured. The Americans
held off Germany 3-2 at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium after trailing 2-1
at halftime, then watched Brazil squander a 3-0 lead before winning
4-3 in overtime against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't very good against Germany,'' U.S. coach Tony
DiCicco said. ``I give Germany a lot of credit, but it was not a
classic performance for the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The four teams largely predicted to reach this point have done
so. On Sunday night in Foxboro, Mass., defending champion Norway
meets powerful China in a matchup of the Americans' principal
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which finished fourth in the 1996 Olympics, is trying to
join that elite group. Although defensive problems have been
exposed in their past two matches, the so-called Samba Queens have
plenty of offense, including midfielder Sissi, who leads the World
Cup with seven goals. She scored the winner Thursday on a superb
free kick.
</P>
<P>
   After sleepily arriving on the West Coast on Friday afternoon,
U.S. players acknowledged the heightening anxiety of living up to
the attention and expectations of reaching the finals. In three of
their four matches, the Americans either have given up an early
goal or allowed foes to get off good shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the feeling you get when your stomach is turning
because you're on your first date,'' said defender Brandi Chastain,
who scored an own goal for Germany and later tied the game in the
second half. ``But when you go out in front a big crowd, where
people have their faces painted red, white and blue, you're excited
about the opportunity to show them a high level of soccer. It's an
energy level that's been hard to control.''
</P>
<P>
   That scenario should present itself on Sunday, Independence Day,
with a possible capacity crowd of 80,000 on hand. ``The U.S. is a
team without weaknesses,'' Brazil coach Wilson de Oliveira Rica
said. ``But we are certain this will be the best game of the
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   China and Norway are playing better as the tournament goes
along. China had no problems beating Russia 2-0, and 18-year-old
midfielder Pu Wei got a goal to demonstrate greater depth on a team
where striker Sun Wen has scored five times.
</P>
<P>
   Norway trounced Sweden 3-1, getting all three goals in quick
succession. Both teams also criss-crossed the country, playing in
San Jose, Calif., on Wednesday night. But unlike China, which has
been grumbling about having to make three cross-country flights,
Norwegian players don't seem to be bothered by the travel demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't worry,'' captain Linda Medalen said. ``It's nice
to go to Boston. We have a lot of friends there.

OAKLEY HAS PLENTY OF OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Charles Oakley likes the Lakers. Phil Jackson likes
Charles Oakley. And everyone with an opinion seems to like the
match.
</P>
<P>
   But Oakley is in no rush to make a decision, and the Toronto
Raptors will get every opportunity to keep the veteran rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Charles is anxious to explore all his options,
including the Lakers,'' Billy Diamond, Oakley's financial adviser,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The free-agent negotiating period opened Thursday, but the
Lakers had not yet contacted Oakley, who figures to be pursued by
several teams.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson already has expressed an interest. Oakley and Jackson
overlapped one year with the Chicago Bulls, when Jackson was an
assistant coach. They also have in common close relationships with
former Bulls Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good relationship with Phil and has the utmost
respect for him,'' Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley has financial incentive to stay put. He's earned ``Bird''
rights with the Raptors, who can pay him whatever it takes and will
offer at least $4 million a year. The Lakers, and most other
suitors, can offer only the $2 million salary exception.
</P>
<P>
   But Diamond said Oakley, a 14-year veteran, is financially
secure ``for the rest of his life'' and won't necessarily be
motivated by money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure decision, not a pressure decision,'' Diamond
said. ``He wants to go somewhere at this point in his career where
he will be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, happiness means playing alongside Rookie of the Year
Vince Carter and talented youngster Tracy McGrady on the NBA's most
improved team. In L.A., happiness could mean a chance to win a
championship before he retires. The 35-year-old Oakley wants to
play three more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (competing for a championship) is part of the
equation,'' Diamond said. ``I don't think it's an overriding
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams cannot sign free agents or make trades until Aug. 1.
Diamond said Oakley plans to take his time and probably won't agree
to a deal until close to that date.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's tale: Assistant coach Tex Winter, architect of the
Bulls' famed triangle offense, is also being wooed by Jackson. But
the 76-year-old Winter is contemplating retirement. If he coaches
another year, he might choose to stay with Chicago out of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Winter is headed to Greece for a basketball clinic/vacation and
plans to make a decision by the time he returns July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will use that period of time to think things out,'' he said.
``At my age, it's time to weigh things carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Bulls assistants Jim Cleamons and Jimmy Rodgers are
expected to fill two of the three slots on Jackson's staff. An
announcement should come next week, when Jackson returns to L.A.
after a week at his Montana home.
</P>
<P>
   Bullwatch: The Lakers have contacted the agent for former Bulls
small forward Jud Buechler, who might choose to rejoin Jackson
here. And if Oakley doesn't work out, don't be surprised if Dennis
Rodman becomes an option.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, writing in this week's ``ESPN The Magazine,'' ponders
the possibility of bringing the troubled Rodman back to the Lakers
and notes that the Bulls succeeded with Rodman by using a support
system that included a team psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some food for thought: On Wednesday, as Jackson talked
about his support staff, he said he'd like ``people... that have
worked with me in the past that are on the physical (training) end
of it, the mental end of it, the psychological end of it too.''

HEROICS LEAD TO ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ They had broken soccer's two cardinal rules:
Do not score on yourself. And do not be scored on after the clock
has run out. Now, the US women's team was sitting in the locker
room glum, chastened, and trailing the Germans Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 45 minutes left in your dream,'' coach Tony DiCicco
told his squad. ``If you don't go back out there and give
everything you have, you're going to go home early. And you're
going to be sad about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Their World Cup dream is supposed to end a week from Saturday in
the Rose Bowl with Uncle Sam's nieces taking a victory lap before
ascending to accept their gold medals. It was not supposed to end
with a loss to the Germans in the Redskins' playpen in suburban
Maryland with the First Family coming by to offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For how many years we've played together and sweated together
and killed each other in practice,'' midfielder Julie Foudy was
saying, after she and her blood sisters had stayed alive with a 3-2
victory that put them into Sunday's semifinals with Brazil at
Stanford Stadium. ``And now, to have the World Cup here in the US
and to be able to win it _ that's the dream. That's what we all
talked about at halftime. Let's not make this our last 45 minutes.
Everything we've been fighting for, let's let it continue.''
</P>
<P>
   So here came Brandi Chastain, who had accidentally tapped the
ball into her own goal in the fifth minute, pouncing on a German
mistake off a corner kick and cracking a goal off the crossbar and
in. And here came supersub Shannon MacMillan dashing into the match
in the 66th minute to take a corner kick and launching a lightning
bolt that Joy Fawcett headed in for the winner. ``She was on the
field for what, two seconds?'' DiCicco marveled.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the stuff that dreams are made of. One touch _ and
magic. And for Chastain, one swing of the leg and redemption. She
had watched in horror and humiliation as the ball she thought she
was passing back to keeper Briana Scurry rolled slowly into the US
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously disappointing to put a ball in your own
net,'' said Chastain. ``But literally within seconds of it going
in, (captain) Carla Overbeck came over and looked me straight in
the eye and said, `Brandi, don't worry about it. We've got a lot of
soccer yet to play. It's over. We're going to go forward and we're
going to score a lot of goals.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Turned out three was enough, and as regulation time expired the
anxious Americans kept glaring at Colombian referee Martha Toro
Pardo, who had added two minutes to the clock. ``Everyone was kind
of angry,'' said forward Tiffeny Milbrett. ``Where did she get
those two minutes from? When you come from a goal down twice, you
want it over as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   When Toro Pardo finally blew her whistle, the Americans hugged
each other (``A big sigh of relief,'' said Milbrett), did a
celebratory tour of the field, heard the President congratulate
them on their heart and soul, then realized that they'd also
qualified for next summer's Olympics in Sydney. ``Our reaction was
_ cool!,'' said Scurry. ``But we've got another game to play. First
things first.''
</P>
<P>
   As demanding and draining and fulfilling as the victory over the
Germans was (`It could have been a final,' mused DiCicco'), it was
only a quarterfinal. The Americans always survive the
quarterfinals. Their difficulties on the global stage have come in
the semis _ they lost the Cup to Norway there last time and had to
beat the Norwegians in overtime to survive at the Olympics. All
Thursday's heroic 45 minutes bought them was 90 more.

U.S. AND ALLIES PREVENT FLIGHTS OF RUSSIAN TROOPS INTO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Inserts new 4th graf on comment sought from Russian
officials)  
(rm) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its NATO allies have blocked
Russia from flying hundreds of troops into Kosovo this weekend,
before details of Russia's role in the NATO peacekeeping force
could be worked out, administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 48 hours, Russia asked Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria
for use of their airspace to fly 10 planeloads of peacekeepers on
Sunday into Pristina, the provincial capital, the officials said.
But those countries rejected the request after consulting with top
American and NATO officials, the administration officials said.
Hungary is a new member of NATO, while both Romania and Bulgaria
would like to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian point of view was, `Let's get our troops in there
while we work out the arrangements,''' said an administration
official. ``Our view is, `Let's get the details down before we have
them deploy more troops.'''
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Russian Embassy here said there was no one
available Friday night to comment on the flights. Similarly, there
was no government spokesman in Moscow or at the Russian Mission to
the United Nations to discuss the matter, officials said. It was
unclear exactly how many more troops Russian had intended to
deploy, though American officials said it was at least a few
hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after an agreement reached in Helsinki, Finland,
Russian military negotiators this week sought to alter it by having
their troops in Kosovo take orders only from Russian officers,
rather than be under the formal command of NATO. Russia also wants
to station forces in the Italian as well as French, American and
German sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Given Russia's surprise deployment of 200 troops to Pristina
airport last month and an unusual military exercise last week in
which American F-15 jets intercepted Russian fighter-bombers near
Iceland, administration officials said Friday they wanted no more
surprises from Russia over the July 4 holiday weekend, when many
senior American officials plan to be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, vacationing in Europe,
today called her Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, to explain
NATO's objections to continuing the deployment of 3,600 Russian
troops into Kosovo until several sticking points are resolved, a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials had expected to settle the details of Russia's
peacekeeping role at high-level military talks in Mons, Belgium,
this week. Anticipating this, Russia had scheduled to fly 10
hulking Ilyushin Il-96 cargo planes full of troops and equipment
into Pristina to join about 400 Russian troops already there.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks struck an impasse and were not set to resume in
Belgium until next week. When Russia signaled that it was preparing
to send its troops to Kosovo anyway, American and NATO officials
quickly intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser,
spoke to his Russian counterpart while NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana and his top aides consulted with officials in
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Russia, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian planes were not on the runway ready to launch,''
said a senior military official. ``But calls were made to Hungary,
Bulgaria and Romania to coordinate our response'' if anything
happened.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said, ``The deal is, the
technical details of the Helsinki agreement must be worked out
before they send in more troops. Those details have not been worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
flatly ruled out the Russian proposals, but did not give any hint
at the tense, behind-the-scenes brinkmanship unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were various efforts made by the Russian side to present
modifications or new interpretations of issues previously agreed at
Helsinki,'' Clark told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We
deflected those attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached in Helsinki on June 18 outlined ways for
the Russian troops to cooperate with French, German and U.S.
forces, as well as control ground operations at the Pristina
airport, which is in the heart of the British sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian zone in the German sector borders on the Italian
sector in western Kosovo, and allied officials say that the
Russians want to operate in that sector as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to draw the lines along in areas that they would
feel more comfortable in operating in,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen told reporters on Thursday. ``We feel it's very important
that we stay within the existing map as it was drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Any changes in the patrol areas would require approval by NATO's
political arm, the North Atlantic Council, and the Russian
Federation. ``Some concern was expressed by some of the Russians on
the ground, having seen the KLA up a little close and personal,
that maybe the sectors they picked weren't the most convenient
sectors for the Russian forces to be in,'' Clark told reporters on
Thursday, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``They'll have
to come back through proper channels if this is going to be
adjusted.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Helsinki agreement also calls for Russian peacekeepers to
have their own commander, Col. Gen. Viktor Zavarin, and liaison
officers with the French, German and American commanders up the
allied chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians would not formally report to NATO commanders,
they are expected to follow allied military operational
requirements, a delicate distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Russian negotiator, Vice Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov,
appears to be seeking permission for Russian troops to operate
under their own rules, not NATO's, American and NATO officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to keep this strictly within the bounds agreed at
Helsinki, including unity of command,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who said Russian troops would examine their assigned
operational areas in Kosovo in the next few days, expressed
optimism that impasse could be resolved by next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian elements are going to do on-the-ground
reconnaissance,'' Clark said. ``They're going to come back and see
us again at my headquarters next week, where we're going to
finalize the details of Russian participation.''

NORWAY BANKING ON RIISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ In addition to playing for the Norwegian
national women's soccer team, Hege Riise is also a marketing
consultant for a bank in Norway. She makes her living convincing
customers to make purchases and investments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with all of her advertising savvy, Riise doesn't use her
skills to promote herself. You'll never hear her say a word about
how good she is or how much she means to Norway's hopes of
repeating as Women's World Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my type,'' said the soon-to-be-30-year-old
midfielder during the team's practice at Middlesex School Friday.
``Probably (defender) Linda (Medalen) is the player that everyone
would talk to because she always has something to say or she always
finds something to say. But that's her type. I'm probably a little
bit more shy. I've always been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Riise prefers to let her play do the talking for her. And her
opponents have heard loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in her third Women's World Cup, Riise is now at the top
of her game. She scored three goals and assisted on another as
Norway romped through four matches leading up to Sunday's semifinal
showdown with China. She has scored a goal in Norway's last three
games, the last two coming on penalty kicks against Japan and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Riise has played in every minute of the tournament and is tied
for fifth in points with 7. More important than her scoring is her
ability to defend and control the tempo of the game. Before her
teammates get to celebrate goals, Riise is the one who sets up
their opportunities. She has served all but one of Norway's 32
corner kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's back with the form she showed in (the) 1995 (World Cup)
in Sweden,'' coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said. ``Before we traveled
here, she did her best physical test ever. She's very fit now. The
fitness together with her skill makes her one of the best midfield
players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe the coach's claim that Riise is one of the
best in the world, perhaps more of her stats will change your mind.
She is one of the leading scorers in Women's World Cup history with
25 points. She's played in 120 international matches; only Medalen
and Heidi Store have more caps. Her 46 goals are fourth on Norway's
all-time list behind teammates Medalen (63), Ann Kristin Aarones
(56), and Marianne Pettersen (50).
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great player and she has a lot of skills, maybe the
player with the best technique in the world,'' said Medalen,
Riise's roommate. ``She's so cool and calm. She's not a good
header, but her skills and understanding are at a very high
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And that form Hogmo referred to? It's the one Riise displayed
when she scored five goals and five assists to lead Norway to the
title four years ago. For her performance Riise earned the Golden
Ball, given to the tournament's most outstanding individual
competitor, and the Silver Shoe, awarded to the player with the
second-most goals in the tournament (Aarones scored six).
</P>
<P>
   So far, Riise has picked up where she left off in Sweden. She
agrees that she's in the best shape of her career, and with a
victory Sunday, may be able to wreak havoc in the midfield in a
long-awaited matchup with the United States, if the US wins its
semifinal against Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like after '95, I had two down years, not that hungry
to play football (soccer),'' said Riise, who along with Medalen and
goalkeeper Bente Nordby are the only Norwegians to play in every
Women's World Cup. ``But there's something special when the World
Cup is around the corner. I've been training hard for this
tournament. It would be great if we can do it. Now we have to focus
on China.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Chinese know what's best for them, they'll be focused on
her.

JULIUS ERVING ADMITS HE IS FATHER OF TENNIS STAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS spelling of name in headline.)  (rm) 
 By   JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each surprising victory at Wimbledon, Alexandra Stevenson,
the 18-year-old rising tennis star, faced another set of questions
_ intensifying curiosity about everything from her style of play to
her experiences as a black woman in a predominantly white sport.
</P>
<P>
   Then this week, as she continued her run through the world's
most prestigious tournament in her first performance as a
professional, Stevenson, the daughter of a single white mother,
began to be asked insistently about an issue &UR;  &LR; that had shadowed her
during her rise through the amateur ranks: Who is your father?
Politely and repeatedly, the young player declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson did not stop winning _ she will play in the
women's semifinals Saturday _ and the question did not stop being
asked, the interest driven by a newspaper report that claimed to
identify the father. So Friday her father came forward, saying he
was acting to help relieve the stress on his daughter as she
prepared for the biggest match of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Erving, the Hall of Fame basketball player who had been
one of his sport's greatest performers and sturdiest models of
personal rectitude, issued a statement acknowledging that he was
Stevenson's father, and that he had, in secret, provided for her
well being from the day of her birth. Erving, who was married when
Stevenson was born, said he had kept his wife informed all along,
and that his three children were aware that he had another
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand they are being besieged because she won her match
today,'' Erving, in his only public comment, told the Associated
Press. ``Getting this statement out will help.'' He declined a
request to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson has known who her father was for years, but has only
met him once, according to her mother. And in a brief interview
Friday night, Stevenson said she did not feel cheated because she
had grown up without her father present. She pointed out many of
her friends came from homes where the parents had divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been normal to me,'' she said. Stevenson said she
had also learned to live with the secret and with the agreement not
to reveal her father's identity. ``I have been well trained,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rather remarkable events Friday were only the latest in what
has been a tumultuous and often exhilarating 10 days for Stevenson.
Having graduated from high school in May, she arrived at Wimbledon
as a relative unknown who had won a berth for unseeded players at a
qualifying tournament. In quick succession, Stevenson won five
straight matches against mostly higher ranked players, becoming the
first qualifier in history to reach the women's semifinals of the
venerable tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stevenson declined to talk about her father and
declared her mother had served as her only role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had both parents wrapped into one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate about her father intensified, and the question
became unavoidable on Wednesday when the Ft. Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel published a copy of her birth certificate identifying
a Julius Winfield Erving 2nd as the child's father.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Stevenson has become an instant celebrity, and
the London tabloids have given her extensive coverage. Stevenson
has appeared quite comfortable amid the excitement, and her mother,
Samantha, a freelance sports writer whose work has appeared in The
New York Times, has moved easily and aggressively in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson has written extensively about her experiences
as a single mother raising a gifted tennis player, and over the
years she had not discouraged speculation that her child's father
was a prominent athlete. She has been working on a book project
about her daughter's life as a promising tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Samantha Stevenson said very little about her
daughter's father. ``I can't comment all,'' she said. ``The mother
maintains her silence.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared statement, Erving acknowledged he had had a
relationship with Stevenson's mother in 1980. ``All matters
concerning Alexandra since her birth have been handled privately
through counsel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Erving told the Associated Press he had met Stevenson only once,
when she 3 years old, but had supported her financially since her
birth. ``She was brought to me at a basketball clinic at a public
school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erving, now a vice president of the Orlando Magic basketball
team, initially denied the Sun-Sentinel's story. But reporters
mobbed Stevenson at the tournament, peppering her with questions
about her father.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson became pregnant in 1980 while she was living
in Philadelphia, covering, among other things, the 76ers. She moved
to San Diego, where her parents lived, to have the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevenson recognized her daughter's talent early and
enrolled Alexandra in tennis lessons at the age of 4 at the La
Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. When Alexandra was 9, she was taken in
and coached by Dr. Peter Fischer, the Los Angeles pediatrician and
tennis guru who helped Pete Sampras develop his game as a youth.
Three times a week, her mother drove three hours to Los Angeles for
her daughters lessons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Fischer's tutelage, Stevenson developed a classic style,
reminiscent of Margaret Court, whom she now calls her heroine.
Stevenson is almost a tennis throwback, using a wicked one-handed
backhand, a big serve and lightning volleys in an era when
two-handed backhands and dogged baseline play is the vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer also encouraged her to play in junior tournaments above
her level to better her game, so she did not wrack up the string of
victories that might have made her a household name.
</P>
<P>
   As her game developed, Stevenson received help from other
prominent coaches in California, including Pancho Segura in
Carlsbad and Robert Lansdorp in Pacific Palisades. Fischer dropped
out of her life in 1997, when he was arrested on charges of
molesting children at his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Lansdorp, who helped Stevenson perfect her ground strokes, said
rumors that her father was a professional athlete began circulating
years ago in West Coast tennis clubs. Erving's name was sometimes
mentioned, he said, but neither the mother nor daughter would talk
about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, kiddingly, I would say, hey, who's the dad?'' he
recalled. ``But they said its not important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansdorp said the absence of her father never seemed to bother
Alexandra.``She seems a real well-adjusted kind of girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stevenson has never achieved a No. 1 ranking in the
U.S. national junior rankings, she has been a member of the U.S.
national junior team and developmental squad for several years. She
has played in international junior tournaments as a representative
of the U.S. Tennis Association, and in 1996, at age 16, she won the
U.S. Open junior doubles title.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wimbledon, Stevenson had played only a handful of
matches on the women's pro tour, and as an amateur won a
minor-league tournament in Michigan last year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she had received a wild card into the Evert Cup in
California and had lost creditably to Martina Hingis, 6-3, 6-4. In
June in the DFS Classic, a traditional Wimbledon tuneup played on
grass, Stevenson, ranked 114th at the time, upset 12th-seeded
Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France, 6-3, 5-7, 8-6, after surviving a
double match point. She lost in the quarterfinals when Magui Serna
of Spain stopped her run as Stevenson was forced to retire with a
pulled stomach muscle, trailing, 6-1, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The admission that he had fathered an illegitimate child was not
in keeping with Erving's public image. Many prominent players in
the NBA have been hit with paternity suits from single mothers in
recent years, and several have acknowledged supporting children
born outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Erving, or ``Dr. J'' as he was known, has always been held
apart by fans, not just for his breathtaking play, but as a model
family man who had deep religious beliefs. He has been married
since 1972 to his wife, Turquoise, and they have raised four
children.
</P>
<P>
   More than his numbers or his midair artistry, he became known as
one of the league's most prominent ambassadors, speaking eloquently
on issues of sportsmanship, race and the game.

CHINA BRINGS BRAINPOWER TO FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUPEN FOFARIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chinese National Team will beat you with its brains, not
just with its feet.
</P>
<P>
   Although two Chinese are among the top four goal scorers in the
Women's World Cup, there are no offensive stars. Seven members have
played in the forward position, and each of them has scored.
</P>
<P>
   That's because on any given day, the Chinese will play any given
style of soccer. It just depends on what they believe will be the
best poison for their opponent after hours of careful analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many, many different types of scoring chances on the
field,'' said Zhao Lihong, a forward who has scored once. ``That
represents the strength and ability of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese get reports on the strengths and weaknesses of their
opponent, who will be defending champion Norway Sunday when the
teams meet at Foxboro Stadium for a 7:30 p.m. semifinal showdown.
The Chinese watch tapes, read the reports, and then hit the
drawingboard.
</P>
<P>
   Against Sweden, a team that put a lot of pressure on the ball
and played them very closely, the Chinese were a very aggressive
team and constantly attacked the goal. The result: a 2-1 victory.
Against Russia, which played much of its defense in the midfield,
the Chinese played long ball and began each scoring drive with
shots from over 20 yards out. The result: a 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The brainpower China uses in achieving its versatility can be
maddening. They can go from an aggressive attack to a long-range
offense in a matter of days _ and come away with a victory either
way.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure,'' said Pu Wei, China's youngest player who scored her
only goal thus far Wednesday against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   China finished second two years ago in the Olympics, fourth in
the '95 Cup, and fifth in the '91 Cup. It finished second in the
'94 and '96 US Cups and outscored its opponents, 37-1, en route to
winning its sixth consecutive Asia Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing to be ashamed of. But failure comes in many
forms. Failure in practice can result in failure on the field. So
Pu counts that in her assertion. And, although placing well in many
of the major tournaments and being considered one of the most
dominant women's teams in the world is nice, the Chinese still
haven't won the Olympics or the Women's World Cup. No one is
ashamed of their performance, but when the goal is to be the best,
finishing second is failure.
</P>
<P>
   `In '96, when we won the silver medal _ when we lost to the US
in the final _ I prepared for this (tournament). For two years,''
said Ma Yuanan, China's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao said her and her teammates feed off of these shortcomings
and makes them mentally tougher. No amount of analysis or energy in
switching offenses is too great _ because when the opponent expects
and prepares one thing and instead meets something which exploits
its greatest weakness, the result is a victory for China. And that
is what this team wants to take home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our goal,'' said Zhao. ``To win it all.''

 AT SCHEUER LINENS, HIGH-CLASS THREADS COUNT  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
What is the primary difference between a towel monogram and a sheet
monogram? What size napkin is appropriate for lunch and what
dimensions are recommended for dinner?
<P>
   If you can't answer these questions, you can't work at Scheuer
Linens, an old-fashioned, family-owned, home-textiles boutique off
of San Francisco's Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Scheuer, the grandson of the shop's founders _ a German
Jewish couple who fled Hitler's Europe in the 1930s _ instructs all
new hires in the age-old customs of table, bed and bath linens.
Trainees must pass a 25-question examination before they may wait
on their first customer.
</P>
<P>
   Rosel and Samuel Scheuer, dry goods merchants from Heldenbergen,
Germany, settled in San Francisco after escaping Europe in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of a small Nob Hill apartment, they began calling on
the city's wealthy German Jewish residents with samples of
tablecloths, towels and sheets. Rosel would check the wedding
announcements each morning and immediately send a congratulatory
note that included an offer to handle the bride's gift registry.
</P>
<P>
   Rosel and Samuel's son Manfred _ Mark's father _ joined the
business in 1950, and the family opened its first store on Stockton
Street three years later. The shop got bumped by Niketown, and
Scheuer Linens moved in 1995 to a larger space on Sutter Street.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing up in such a genteel business, both Manfred and
his son Mark were rough-and-tumble young men. In the 1930s, while
Manfred's parents sold linens from their apartment, their
twentysomething son worked on San Francisco's docks, getting into
fistfights when ordered to work on Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Mark Scheuer spent his free time smoking pot on
Haight Street. He graduated from the University of Washington in
Seattle in 1967 with a degree in advertising, spent three years
avoiding the draft and wound up serving one year in Vietnam,
returning to San Francisco in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He never intended to join the family business, although he was
not immune to the allure of quality linens. His one request from
home while serving in Vietnam was a good bath towel. His parents
shipped him a tasteful olive drab set, monogrammed in black.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Mark Scheuer went to work for his father,
expecting to leave the business after he had figured out what to do
next. But he never left. When Manfred Scheuer died in 1982, his son
took charge of the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his initial lack of enthusiasm for selling linens, Mark
Scheuer came to love the business. He now relishes the time he
spends explaining to shoppers the difference between a satin weave
and a twill weave, or helping them select a set of fine napkins
from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Scheuer said he has passed up opportunities to open additional
stores because he prefers the intimacy of running a single shop.
``I like being out on the floor with customers,'' he said. ``I
never saw myself as an executive sitting behind a mahogany desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime shoppers describe Scheuer Linens as the pinnacle of
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always know that if there's a glitch or we need to borrow a
sample, they will be very accommodating,'' said Judy McBride, an
interior designer with San Francisco's Wiseman Group. Scheuer has a
broader selection of merchandise than some other specialty stores
in town and much better service than chains, McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   The store's advice is eminently trustworthy, said shopper
Katherine James, who is such a textile purist that she irons her
bed linens by hand. On a recent visit, James said, Mark Scheuer
recommended the less expensive of two pillows because he thought
the smaller one would be more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco socialite Susie Tompkins Buell, who has patronized
Scheuer since she accompanied her mother there as a child decades
ago, said she relies on Scheuer for advice on how to fold her
linens and where to get them laundered.
</P>
<P>
   Like Buell, a co-founder of the Esprit clothing chain, the
majority of the store's customers are well-heeled women in their
40s and up. A typical afternoon finds shoppers sitting at three
small tables on the sales floor, placing orders with Mark Scheuer
or a sales assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can ask questions about esoteric matters such as thread
count or leaf through fabric samples. About one-third of the shop's
sales are custom ordered.
</P>
<P>
   The average purchase tallies $200, but sales of $1,000 bed sets,
which include sheets, pillowcases, a duvet cover and a sham, occur
every day, said Mark Scheuer. The most popular sheet, a queen-size
Italian variety called Celeste, retails for $146 on sale, $183
regularly. The most expensive flat sheet, a Swiss model, goes for
about $700.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a lot for a few yards of cotton. But cost is not a
big deterrent to Scheuer's loyal shoppers. ``I don't know (how
their prices compare) because I don't really shop other places,''
said James.
</P>
<P>
   As independent merchants of all types fold by the dozen, Scheuer
is a rare survivor. Only 2 percent of bedding sales are rung up by
single-store independents like Scheuer, according to Home Textiles
Today, a trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of sales, 39 percent, go to discounters like

   The competition isn't a huge worry to Scheuer, since his elite
customer base isn't likely to defect to J.C. Penney. His main
concern is that his company may get too big to be fun.

   The business is outgrowing its 3,000-square-foot retail space,
as well as the 3,000-square-foot basement where catalog orders are
filled. The catalog, which is mailed to 50,000 people, accounts for
makes up &LR;  about 35 percent of total company sales.
</P>
<P>
   Scheuer Linens' store and catalog revenues rose a robust 12
percent last year and have grown at least 10 percent for each of
the last three years, with bedding accounting for about 60 percent
of sales.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Assets were not the only things increasing at Fidelity
Contrafund through the early 1990s. While the fund grew sixfold,
its expense ratio also climbed.
</P>
<P>
   But after peaking at 1.06 percent in 1993, the ratio began to
fall. Now, Contrafund charges investors 0.61 percent every year to
manage their money, the lowest amount in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Contrafund investors are not alone. The fees that the average
mutual fund investor pays are going down.
</P>
<P>
   The trend flies in the face of conventional wisdom, which holds
that expenses have been flat, or even rising. Indeed, the industry
has come under heavy public criticism for its high fees, which long
allowed fund companies' stocks to outpace their funds' returns.
</P>
<P>
   But the decline in fees is real. Kanon Bloch Carre, a mutual
fund consulting firm in Boston, calculates that the average expense
ratio paid by investors is down 16 percent over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   There are several explanations: Many investors have shifted
assets to low-cost funds _ a byproduct, to a large degree, of their
embrace of index funds. Corporate executives who negotiate terms
for their companies' 401(k) plans have increasingly favored funds
with lower fees. And new, low-cost competitors have joined the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts say fund companies will keep facing
pressure to lower fees. After all, price competition is typical in
maturing industries, as the battle for market share increases and
growth slows.
</P>
<P>
   But don't pity the fund companies. They haven't lost their
license to print money, with many fund companies seeing annual
returns on equity that still top 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard that fees are on the rise. For example,
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, has reported
that expenses on the average United States diversified stock fund
rose last year to $1.44 for every $100 of assets, from $1.35 in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   But such comparisons treat a $10 billion fund the same as a $10
million fund, and thus do not measure the average investor's costs.
With new funds being rolled out at the rate of almost 10 a week for
much of this decade _ some of them low-cost funds but most of them
small, often esoteric funds charging higher-than-average expenses _
it should not be a surprise that unweighted average expense ratios
rose.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Kanon Bloch uses asset-weighting in its
calculations, giving twice as much weight to a $100 million fund,
for example, as to a $50 million one. On that basis, the average
United States diversified stock fund now charges 77 cents in annual
expenses for every $100 invested, down from 88 cents three years
ago and 92 cents in 1993. Such stock funds constitute the lion's
share _ 80 percent _ of stock mutual fund assets.
</P>
<P>
   The calculations include only the share classes with the most
assets or longest records _ usually the class A shares. But William
Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch, said the expense ratio of
other share classes, which make up less than 20 percent of domestic
diversified stock fund assets, have also been falling. Moreover,
the firm's calculations do not include sales charges, or loads,
which have also been in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty acknowledged that Kanon Bloch's findings may seem
surprising, but said the trend has been clear for years. He
calculates that investors are saving $3.8 billion this year because
of the decline in asset-weighted expense ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics might say the industry's fees look lower under
asset-weighting because of the frugality of the Vanguard Group, the
index fund king. Vanguard, as a mutual company owned by its
customers, does not have to make a profit for public shareholders.
The total asset-weighted expense ratio for Vanguard's domestic
diversified stock funds declined by one-fifth during the last six
years, to 28 cents for every $100 invested, according to Kanon
Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just Vanguard. And it isn't just the Kanon Bloch
figures. In a report this year, Scott Cooley, a Morningstar
analyst, found that even excluding low-cost index funds and
institutional shares, asset-weighted costs for investors have
dropped by one-quarter since 1984 for load funds and by about 9
percent for no-load funds. He attributed much of the decline to
investors' seeking out lower-cost fund families.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, asset-weighted expenses have fallen at the four biggest
fund families _ Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, American Funds and
Putnam Investments, which, combined, have 43 percent of the total
United States diversified stock fund assets. That decline has come
in part because swelling assets have touched off break-point
clauses in fund management agreements that call for lower fees.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, for example, charges a two-pronged management fee, one
part of which declines as the company's total assets rise. That
part of the fee was 0.2863 percent of assets in December 1998, down
from 0.2942 percent the year before and 0.3243 percent at year-end
1993. The company has also given up a portion of its fees to some
investors in recent years, because performance has not met targets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From May 1993 to May 1999, Fidelity's expense ratio for
diversified stock funds fell by one-third, to 0.63 percent, while
the ratio at the American Funds group declined 11 percent, to 0.61,
according to Kanon Bloch. It even fell at the relatively pricey
Putnam, to 0.95, a 15 percent drop over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, whatever the fee cuts at some fund companies, they
pale next to huge revenue gains, as assets under management in
stock funds soared 44-fold, to $3.2 trillion, in the 15 years ended
in May, according to data from the Investment Company Institute,
the industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Noting such huge profits, critics say fees should have plunged,
not just drifted downward. A congressional subcommittee heard
testimony last fall, and now the General Accounting Office is
investigating the matter at the request of Reps. John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., and Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio. If any legislation is
proposed, it will most likely seek to improve disclosure of fees to
investors, congressional aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund officials defend the industry's fees, noting that a
study last year by the Investment Company Institute found that fund
companies had, in fact, been passing along savings to fund
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what Congress does or does not do, the outlook for
investors is good. Plenty of factors already at play suggest that
investors will, on average, pay lower fees in the future. The
factors include these: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INDEXING Increasingly sought by investors, index funds accounted
for an astonishing 43 percent of all new cash flows into stock
funds so far this year, according to AMG Data Services, a mutual
fund researcher. The expense ratios on funds that track the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index generally range from 0.18 to
0.40.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of index funds is being tested, now that many
actively managed funds are outperforming the S&AMP;P 500 over several
months for the first time in a half-dozen years. But if history is
any guide, the outperformance of the actively managed funds will
eventually lapse. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GROWING SOPHISTICATION Individual investors are becoming savvier
about fees, especially as they notice commissions for online stock
trades dropping sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Cooley of Morningstar took the mutual fund industry
to task for not passing along its huge economies of scale. He also
noted that investors were increasingly factoring fees into their
fund-buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this misconception out there that all investors are
stupid, that they chase performance and don't pay attention to
fees,'' Cooley said. But, he added, ``we found that people were
migrating toward lower-cost funds and lower-cost families.''
</P>
<P>
   At Charles Schwab, the huge San Francisco-based discount broker,
executives creating an in-house funds group a decade ago studied
institutional money managers and observed that they emphasized low
management fees more than the retail market did. Figuring that
small investors would eventually follow suit, they decided to make
index funds their primary offering. That bet proved prescient.
</P>
<P>
   ``As investors have become more and more educated about the role
of fees, we are beginning to see a trend of fees being more of a
determinant in fund selection,'' said Bill Klipp, president of
Charles Schwab Investment Management. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COMPETITION More low-cost fund options are becoming available.
Schwab's funds have become top sellers, posting the ninth-largest
net sales of any fund group in the first five months of the year,
according to the Financial Research Corp., an investment researcher
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Global Investors, meanwhile, the huge San
Francisco-based institutional money manager that specializes in
indexing, plans to sell about 50 index funds on the American Stock
Exchange beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   And TIAA-CREF, the low-cost fund and annuity provider that
already dominates the retirement markets at colleges and
universities, has gotten off to a strong start with a new line of
very low-cost retail mutual funds that combine indexing with active
management. The expenses on the funds range from 0.30 to 0.49
percent, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, there has been a slowdown in the number of
new funds _ the kinds that seem to have skewed expense ratio
tallies in the past _ as well as in the total net assets flowing
into mutual funds. Only 11 new funds were rolled out in the first
three months of 1999, about one-tenth the rate of the last three
years, according to Cerulli Associates, a financial-services
consulting firm in Boston. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   401(K) MUSCLE The shift to low-cost funds has been particularly
pronounced among the executives and consultants who select
investments for 401(k)s and other employer-sponsored retirement
plans. Analysts estimate that these plans contribute about
one-third of the new cash flowing into mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, analysts say, expenses played less of a role in
the selection of funds for 401(k)s by corporations. But that is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say fees to participants have moved up'' in
importance, said Steve Butler, president of Pension Dynamics, a
pension consulting firm in Lafayette, Calif. ``In smaller companies
where owners and key managers have a major proportion of the
assets, I would say costs are the No. 1 factor.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   CONSOLIDATION If analysts are correct and the fund industry is
maturing, consolidation of fund companies could also play a role in
allowing them to reduce costs, if they care to. After all, the
trend lets them spread a greater amount of assets over a similar
base of fixed costs.
</P>
<P>
   But more important for building economies of scale has been the
high number of mergers involving funds themselves. Hundreds of
funds combine every year. While that should raise a red flag to
investors _ fund companies can merge a poor performer with a good
one and then use the better fund's track record for marketing
purposes _ it also makes it easier to lower expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And the merger trend is expected to continue. ``I suspect you'll
see more of that,'' said Mark L. Constant, a fund industry analyst
with Merrill Lynch in San Francisco. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MARKETS Many analysts think that stock market returns will
revert to their historical averages. And when that happens,
investors are certain to pay more attention to fees. Over the last
decade, the S&AMP;P 500 has risen an average of almost 20 percent a
year. That compares with its post-1926 average of about 11 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Given that almost anyone in a diversified stock fund has made a
lot of money in recent years regardless of the fees he paid, it is
surprising that investors have paid any attention to costs.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there's going to be a growing cost awareness if the rates
of return available in the marketplace turn out to be a lot lower
in the next decade,'' said James F. Rothenberg, president of
Capital Research and Management, the Los Angeles
investment-advisory firm for the American Funds group. ``Then I
think people will start to focus a lot more on what are the
elements of their results, including what are the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Funds with higher expense ratios will, of course, take a much
bigger slice of an investor's profits when returns are lower:
losing 1.5 percent of your return to expenses is easy to shrug off
when your fund returns 25 percent a year, but not when it returns 7
percent or 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of fees is compounded over time, even if all other
factors remain equal.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which has had annual
expenses of about 20 cents for every $100 in assets invested over
the last decade. Had you invested $10,000 each year, beginning at
the start of 1989, you would have had almost $332,000 after 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   But if you took the same fund and replaced Vanguard's low
expenses with the average expense ratio of United States
diversified stock funds, which was 1.44 percent last year, you
would be left with about $311,000, or a difference of $21,000,
according to Pension Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the asset-weighted numbers, some industry officials,
even those who proselytize for lower fees, scoff at the idea that
the industry has been broken of greedy habits.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Bogle, Vanguard's founder, bluntly describes the
industry's attitude this way: ``Croupier, croupier, croupier, where
is thy rake?''
</P>
<P>
   And John H. Biggs, chief executive of TIAA-CREF, questions
whether fund companies will lower fees anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to imagine them coming down in normal
times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives note that compensation to fund managers has
increased, especially as hedge funds have offered huge packages to
top stock pickers. Moreover, public fund shareholders are demanding
higher earnings, and the continuing bull market in stocks is
keeping investors from complaining too much about fees.
</P>
<P>
   But costs are a certainty, while market-beating performance
never is. Study after study has shown that funds with low expense
ratios outperform those with higher expenses over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we have found over and over,'' said Cooley,
the Morningstar analyst.

EDWARD DMYTRYK, FILM DIRECTOR, DIES AT 90
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Dmytryk, the versatile director whose best films were
taut, realistic and at times explosive and who, as one of the
``Hollywood 10,'' was jailed for refusing to tell a congressional
committee whether he was a Communist, died on Thursday at his home
in Encino, Calif. He was 90 and the only member of the 10 who
recanted and named names.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, when the House Un-American Activities Committee held
hearings on subversive activities in the entertainment industry,
Dmytryk had been nominated for an Academy Award as best director
for ``Crossfire,'' a powerful film about anti-Semitism that he made
with Adrian Scott, another member of the Hollywood 10, and which
starred Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum and Robert Young.
</P>
<P>
   After a long apprenticeship in Hollywood, Dmytryk was regarded
as one of the industry's bright new directors. His early films
included ``Hitler's Children'' and ``Behind the Rising Sun,''
graphic 1943 anti-Fascist melodramas; ``Murder, My Sweet'' (1944)
and ``Cornered'' (1945), thrillers that established a macho image
for the actor Dick Powell and won him a new career; ``Back to
Bataan,'' with John Wayne as tough as ever, and ``Till the End of
Time,'' a sympathetic drama of returning soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   What many of these films shared was a faith in common people,
dedication to team efforts and respect for traditional values,
often focusing on a character's faith and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But all this ended in 1947 when Dmytryk was one of the group of
screenwriters, directors and producers who were cited for contempt
of Congress by the House Un-American Activities Committee for
refusing to acknowledge a Communist affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   For his silence, the director paid a $1,000 fine and served 4{
months at a federal prison camp in Mill Point, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1978 autobiography, ``It's a Hell of a Life, but Not a
Bad Living,'' published by Times Books, Dmytryk said he was
blacklisted after his release from prison and unable to work. He
said he hunted for ways to break the blacklist and concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to purge myself: Hollywood's right wing had to have its
pound of flesh. They were riding high now, and there was no way
they were going to let anyone off the hook. It was an eye-for-eye
attitude, but who could blame them?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he reappeared before the panel, acknowledged that he
had been a Communist Party member from 1944 to 1945 and confirmed
other witnesses' party membership.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Dmytryk said he did not feel guilty about
his reversal, unlike some other reluctant witnesses who eventually
cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had long been convinced,'' he said, ``that the fight of the
Hollywood 10 was political, that the battle for freedom of thought,
in which I believed completely, had been twisted into a conspiracy
of silence. I was being forced to sacrifice my family and my career
in defense of the Communist Party, from which I had long been
separated and which I had grown to dislike and distrust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision was made easier,'' he continued, because ``my
experience as an actual party member had been rather meager, and I
couldn't name anybody who hadn't already been identified.'' He
expressed pride that ``there was no new or startling information''
in his testimony, which ended his blacklisting by the American film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 3{ years,'' he wrote, ``I felt free of
guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   After he recanted, Dmytryk found work. Stanley Kramer assigned
him to direct several low-budget films, among them ``The Sniper''
and ``The Juggler,'' with Kirk Douglas as a concentration camp
survivor in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the big leagues in 1954 when he directed ``The
Caine Mutiny'' with Humphrey Bogart. The film's success again put
Dmytryk in demand. In the mid-1950s and '60s he directed major
films including ``The Broken Lance'' with Spencer Tracy; Graham
Greene's ``The End of the Affair'' with Deborah Kerr; ``The Left
Hand of God'' with Bogart and Gene Tierney; ``Soldier of Fortune''
with Clark Gable; ``Raintree County'' with Elizabeth Taylor and
Montgomery Clift, and ``The Young Lions'' with Marlon Brando, Clift
and Dean Martin.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to make films with big stars until his career
tailed off in the '70s. These movies included ``Warlock'' with
Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda; ``A Walk on the Wild Side'' with
Jane Fonda, Barbara Stanwyck, Laurence Harvey and a cat who
strolled through Saul Bass' famous credits; ``The Carpetbaggers''
with George Peppard and Alan Ladd; ``Where Love Has Gone,'' with
Bette Davis and Susan Hayward, and ``Bluebeard'' with Richard
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Dmytryk was born on Sept. 4, 1908, in Grand Forks,
British Columbia, the second of four sons of Michael Dmytryk, a
Ukrainian immigrant. His father, who was variously a truck driver,
smelter worker and motorman, and a severe disciplinarian at home,
moved his family to San Francisco and then to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Edward began selling and delivering newspapers at age 6 and left
his punitive home at 14, becoming a messenger at Paramount Pictures
for $6 a week while attending Hollywood High School. He rose to
projectionist at 19, film editor at 21 and director (and an
American citizen) at 31. He studied at the California Institute of
Technology for a year, but dropped out to learn about movie making.
</P>
<P>
   He said his most valuable training was tightening scripts for
maximum effect and minimum dialogue. ``When we rehearse and film
each scene,'' he wrote, ``further cuts are almost always in order.
Later, in the cutting room, I find I can slice still more. If I see
the picture again months later, I kick myself for leaving some
scenes too long.''
</P>
<P>
   As for directing, he believed ``the hand on the tiller'' should
be ``gentle, but firm _ and undivided.'' He said a director should
also be a film's producer. The dual assignment, he said,
``eliminates the need for compromise,'' which he deplored as ``the
single most difficult problem facing any creator.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years Dmytryk taught film theory and production, first
at the University of Texas in Austin, then at the University of
Southern California. He also wrote several books on filmmaking,
among them ``On Screen Directing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmytryk's first marriage, to Madeleine Robinson, ended in
divorce in 1948. The director is survived by his wife, Jean Porter,
an actress whom he married in 1948; two sons, Richard and Michael;
two daughters, Victoria and Rebecca, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Like Elia Kazan, the director who received an honorary Oscar in
March amid controversy because he named names to the House
committee, Dmytryk was never forgiven in some Hollywood quarters.
In 1988, the Barcelona Film Festival organized a symposium about
the Hollywood blacklist and invited Dmytryk and others who had been
blacklisted in the 1950s but who never recanted, among them the
directors Jules Dassin and John Berry, both identified as
Communists by Dmytryk, and the screenwriter Walter Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Dassin, Berry and Bernstein
refused to share the platform with Dmytryk. He was forced to sit in
the audience, hearing himself denounced as ``Judas'' and an
``informer.''
</P>
<P>
   After the festival, Dmytryk told The Associated Press, ``When I
die, I know the obits will first read `one of Hollywood's
Unfriendly 10,' not `director of ``The Caine Mutiny,'' ``The Young
Lions,'' ``Raintree County'' and other films.' ''

DILEMMA FOR DEMOCRATS IN CLINTON PLANS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just as the 2000 campaign is in full swing at
living-room coffees in New Hampshire, it is engulfing Washington,
too. As many people are asking how President Clinton's Medicare,
Social Security and budget proposals will play politically as are
asking how they will work or whether they are good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Would Vice President Al Gore's chances in November _ assuming he
wins the nomination _ be better if a version of the president's
plan is passed and he can claim a share of the credit? Or would he
be better off if he can campaign against what he might call
hard-hearted Republicans denying their grandparents prescription
drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Putting the question directly to Gore does not provide much
enlightenment. He would only say, ``I support the proposals the
administration has made for Medicare and Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   A more eloquent version of the politically appropriate nonanswer
was offered by Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chief. He said:
``Providing our seniors, our mothers, our grandparents with
prescription drugs is something that Al Gore strongly believes in
and that he will fight for without reservation. If the American
people want to reward someone for that, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they may believe that, as Rep. Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., put it, the president's ``message is more important than
the next election.'' And even if they do not believe it, they can
hardly be expected to say that they wish Clinton had found
something else to propose, or that they hope the Republicans in
Congress kill the plan and leave them with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But others will say it for them. Most Republicans and some
Democrats, speaking anonymously, are sure that Gore would prefer
the politics of attack and the chance to run, if he is nominated,
against not only the Republican presidential candidate but also
against ``the worst Congress in history,'' as one prominent
Democrat here visualized a Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant, said it was simple: ``You
give Gore a choice _ he'd damn well rather have that as an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it might not make a huge difference either way. Bill
Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine,
contended that an agreement would help the reputations of Clinton
and the House Republicans. But he said it was not clear that
Republicans would suffer from being seen as denying the elderly a
new benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said Gore could profit
``under all circumstances.'' He might claim another
``Clinton-Gore'' policy success or he could blame the Republicans,
Garin said, adding that ``there is more force to it if the
Republicans don't succumb.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there is little Gore can do but speak up for the
president's plan and push for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   But what about members of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the Senate is murky, because only rarely do
national issues affect many Senate elections. But the Republican
majority of 11 in the House is at risk next year. So would the
Republicans be more likely to retain control of the House if they
scaled back their tax cut proposals enough to legislate with the
president on Social Security and Medicare?
</P>
<P>
   ``If Social Security is off the table, it helps Republicans
generically,'' Mahe said without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the House
Republican campaign committee, does not speak as definitely. He
conceded that an agreement on Medicare would deflate ``a
potentially hard-edged issue that sometimes works against us.'' And
he acknowledged that ``to the extent that we're acting like
grown-ups, that helps everybody in office.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Republicans need not ``chase shadows'' in fear over
these issues, and should be satisfied with their alternatives. On
Clinton's prescription drug proposal, for example, he said that
``we will have our argument in terms of where we will give them
their pills.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality for Davis and other Republican leaders is that
talking compromise and accommodation is tricky for a party whose
most conservative 40 to 50 members usually call the tune in the
House. One of them, Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, went out in the
glaring sun on Thursday afternoon to denounce the Medicare drug
plan as unsound, unnecessary and too big.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Republicans might not find it politically profitable to
seek compromise rather than risk a fight over Medicare, he replied,
``Doing the truthful thing sometimes is risky.''

 WASHINGTON: is risky.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the political odds are for Republicans to make a deal, and
outside the House most Republicans think they will. For example,
Brian Kennedy, who manages Lamar Alexander's presidential campaign,
said, ``I bet they come up with a compromise program, because it's
clear that when they have cut these deals with Clinton they do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican candidate's adviser, insisting on anonymity,
said: ``It's always in everybody's best interest to legislate
successfully. The public is in a mood for accommodation, not
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats may fear that the president is paying more
attention to his place in the history books than their
circumstances in the polling booths but, like Gore, they can do
little about it. They have little influence in the decisions of the
House, and they have a natural inclination as Democrats to
legislate.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk about their worries. Meehan of Massachusetts said,
``There is always the political danger that congressional
Republicans will get a boost and it will be hard for Democrats to
give voters a reason to change the House.'' To avoid that, he said,
``It's important that the president not compromise too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In that one hears an echo of the bitter resentment many House
Democrats feel over the deals Clinton struck with Republicans in
1996 and 1997 over welfare, children's health care and the budget.
Many believe they would have regained control of the House by now
if he had not compromised and given Republicans results to brag
about. Still, there is little they can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of his party's campaign
committee, said without hesitation that legislation was better for
Democrats than confrontation. Making a virtue of necessity, he
said: ``We're much better off when our issues are being discussed.
These are Democratic programs. Continued success of these programs
will only accrue credit to the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said that despite their fears,
Democrats have to legislate. ``There is, I think, a real necessity
for the Democrats to face the fact that we have to be
responsible.'' Speaking of Medicare, he said: ``We're not going to
get the perfect benefit. We'll take as much as we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the issues could not be considered abstractly.
Politics is a heavy player, he added, and ``everything that has
happened in the last six months has been directed at the 2000
election; nothing has been without its 2000 reference point.''

TEEN WHO TRAVELED WITH TALL TALE MAY HAVE TB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 13-year-old Honduran boy who duped many people
with a tale about a 3,200-mile solo odyssey to search for his
father here is being treated for tuberculosis at University
Hospital and Medical Center at Stony Brook on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Edwin Daniel Sabillon, tested positive in a skin test
for tuberculosis while he was undergoing medical examinations. He
was hospitalized Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The skin test indicates that he might have been exposed to the
disease, but it does not necessarily mean he is infected with it.
But it is ``standard to start therapy for the disease while
completing the evaluation,'' said Dr. Sharon Nachman, his attending
physician, who specializes in pediatric infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   If Edwin does have tuberculosis, doctors said, he is expected to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the boy's spirits, Nachman said he was in isolation,
but seemed to be doing fine. ``He didn't like the lunch food, so we
promised him Spanish food for dinner, and he spent the afternoon
playing Nintendo, just like any other 13-year-old,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has been placed with a Spanish-speaking foster family in
Suffolk County. Members of the family have visited him in the
hospital, wearing protective face masks.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Friday with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the Administration for
Children's Services, tried to allay fears that the boy might have
passed tuberculosis on to others. The diagnosis is ``not confirmed
at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Edwin fooled politicians, police officers and
members of the press alike with his story: that he set out from his
hurricane-wrecked village in Honduras to find his only living
relative, his father, Grevi Sabillon Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   He told the authorities that his mother was killed by Hurricane
Mitch, and that he had never seen his father. In fact, his mother
is alive, but gave the boy up when he was 3 months old. His father
died of AIDS in October. Relatives have said that even though Edwin
attended his father's funeral, he has had a difficult time
accepting his death.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been living with an aunt, Aurora Sabillon, 23, in
Hialeah, Fla., when he ran away to New York City. Ms. Sabillon has
said she does not think she can rear him because she is expecting a
baby and she lives in a modest two-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin's grandmother, Paula Vasquez, who lives in Honduras, has
expressed interest in having Edwin live with her.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Scoppetta said that Edwin might be
returned to live with relatives in Florida, but that there were
conflicting reports about their desire to have him back. ``Another
option is that he can be returned to Florida child welfare, even if
there is not a home there,'' Scoppetta said. ``He can also stay
here if conditions indicate that that is what's best for him.''

CLINTONS LEARN THAT SUBURBS ARE COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If where you live defines who you are, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
the likely Senate candidate, is on a difficult search.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six weeks, a handful of friends, an exclusive real
estate agent and the White House social secretary, Capricia Penavic
Marshall, have canvassed the expensive northern Westchester County
suburbs _ from Katonah to Armonk to Mount Kisco to North Salem _
looking for a home the Clintons can afford. Friends say the
president and Mrs. Clinton want to rent, not buy, and pay no more
than $10,000 a month. It has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody had any concept that costs would be so
high,'' said a friend of the first lady. ``This is not a
millionaire president.'' Last year, the Clintons reported $504,109
in income, but they have an estimated $10 million in legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   So far, friends say Mrs. Clinton likes an 18-room, $3.8 million
house on Mills Road in North Salem, but was said to be worried that
it was too grand and that the rent, more than $20,000 a month, was
too high.
</P>
<P>
   Although political aides to Mrs. Clinton dismiss her
house-hunting as a minor matter _ ``I don't do the house,'' two
advisers replied, a tad haughtily, to a reporter's questions this
week _ it is far from a trivial concern. Just as Brooklyn defined
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Nassau County on Long Island
defined former Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, Mrs. Clinton's
address, even if she rents, will create an image in the minds of
voters about who she is, or would like to be.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Westchester would put Mrs. Clinton in the land of Girl
Scouts, car pools, professional women and, not least, crucial
voters. The once solidly conservative county now has more
registered Democrats than Republicans, a large number of
independents and a history of picking every winner in a statewide
election for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's advisers insist that privacy and security,
not politics, are the prime considerations in the house hunt.
Friends say the Secret Service is asking that the house be on at
least two acres of land, which eliminates most of the more crowded
suburbs of southern Westchester within a half-hour commuting
distance of the city.
</P>
<P>
   So she has focused largely on the rolling horse country of
northern Westchester. But friends say this has created another
problem: putting Mrs. Clinton, who presumably will be telling
voters she understands their problems, in the middle of some of the
most celebrity-saturated real estate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   North Salem, a town in the far northeastern corner of the
county, is obscure enough that it seems safe, for now, from
chicness. Although it is home to David Letterman and the composer
Alan Menken, it is largely a rural outpost of horse corrals, no
sidewalks and only two traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The town supervisor, Sy Globerman, a Republican, did not seem
especially welcoming Friday of the Clintons. ``It's not a question
of Republican or Democrat,'' he said. ``The problem is, they're
very high profile, and it kind of creates a disturbance in the
town.''
</P>
<P>
   The $3.8 million North Salem house that Mrs. Clinton likes is
owned by James Kohlberg, of Kohlberg &AMP; Co., an investment firm he
started with his father, Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of the
leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. Jerome Kohlberg
is also a Democratic contributor.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is the Kohlberg house or another one, friends say the
Clintons' representatives hope to negotiate a rich owner down to
what one friend called a ``reasonable'' rent _ with the unspoken
argument that the Clintons will add cachet and increase the market
value of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sloane, a real estate agent with Brown Harris Stevens, is
advising the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Friends add that closeness to the Westchester County Airport,
New York City and a golf course for the president are crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the homes are videotaped for Mrs. Clinton to look at
later, but on Monday the first lady and the Clintons' daughter,
Chelsea, spent the day in New York City and Westchester looking
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: This is Mrs. Clinton's search, not her
husband's. Friends expect the president to have his say after Mrs.
Clinton narrows down what she likes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, on a trip back to Washington from New York, Clinton
was asked by reporters how his wife's house-hunting went. The
president smiled sheepishly, then said, ``I'm not the spokesperson
for that operation.''

 &HT;    Scientists: Blunders abound in Coke flap
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The recent European health scare involving Coca-Cola
probably can be attributed to a mass psychological reaction made
worse by the way the media, the Belgian government and the company
itself handled the crisis, independent scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter published in today's edition of the prestigious
British medical journal The Lancet, the scientists argued that
Coca-Cola's high profile coupled with domestic conditions in
Belgium made the country ripe for panic.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Nemery, a toxicologist and spokesman for the group that
advises the Belgian government on health issues, contended the
illnesses can be attributed to ``mass sociogenic illness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In vulgar terms, this is called mass hysteria,'' Nemery said
in a telephone interview. ``We do not want to use that term because
it's incorrect in psychiatric terms, and it doesn't do anybody any
good to be called an hysteric.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemery said the group of scientists is reluctant to blame
anyone, but he said Atlanta-based Coca-Cola could have done more to
contain the crisis in its sensitive early days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that the Coca-Cola Co. didn't manage the
story very well,'' he said. ``They should have been more open. You
would have thought that their management would have been more
professional. It took more than a week before things appeared to be
taken seriously by Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has said the illnesses were caused by small amounts of
a contaminant in the carbon dioxide used to add fizz to drinks at a
Coca-Cola Enterprises plant in Antwerp and by fumes from cans
transported in wooden pallets from a bottling plant in Dunkirk,
France.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's initial response was a major miscalculation given
the abnormal concern Belgians have had about food scares after some
meat products were found to have been exposed to the cancer-causing
substance dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if Belgium was let down once again,'' Nemery said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Coca-Cola's historic reluctance to discuss the formula
of its soft drink also was a problem. ``The fact that the Coca-Cola
ingredients are secret didn't do them any good,'' the scientist
said. ``The whole atmosphere of secrecy induces suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Belgian government, already burned by the
dioxin scare, was in no mood to go easy on Coke, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Very early in the crisis, advisers suggested the psychosomatic
possibility to Health Minister Luc van den Bossche, who ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   Once van den Bossche took the extreme measure of banning all
Coca-Cola products June 15, it proved difficult for him to say that
no health risk was found in the beverages, Nemery said.
Additionally, it would have been tough for the health minister, who
had been on the job just a few weeks, to have told parents that
their children were only engaging in psychosomatic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Belgian media _ particularly TV news reports _
added fuel to the fire by exaggerating medical problems and mixing
the Coke issue with the much more serious dioxin controversy,
Nemery said.
</P>
<P>
   The psychosomatic response theory, which has been suggested by
scientists hired by Coca-Cola, was disputed by medical workers who
treated the first groups of adolescents who reported experiencing
nausea, headaches and vomiting after drinking the company's
products.
</P>
<P>
   But Nemery said studies have found that health officials often
resist the theory that these symptoms can be psychosomatic.
</P>
<P>
   He said studies have found that adolescent girls are most likely
to exhibit such reactions. Of the 39 students who went to the
hospital in Bornem on June 8 complaining they had gotten sick from
drinking Coke, 27 were girls, school officials said. Of the 30
students who were sent to a hospital in Ghent a week later, 29 were
adolescent girls.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 250 people reported the beverages made them sick. The ban
was lifted June 23, even though scientists hadn't yet established a
clear cause for the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola began restocking Belgian supermarket shelves Friday as
it attempts to recover from the four-week health scare. Coke trucks
in Belgium were bedecked with huge signs proclaiming, ``Your
Coca-Cola Is Back.'' Full-page ads appearing Friday in a major
Belgian newspaper declared: ``The problems that affected some of
our products are completely solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coca-Cola recalled a new batch of mineral water in
Poland, this time due to bacteria contamination. The recall was the
second this week in Poland.

   MAJOR MARKET GAUGES CLIMB AS NUMBER OF JOBS GROWS
</P>
<P>
   Despite another big drop in factory jobs, the nation's employers
added more than a quarter of a million new workers to their
payrolls in June. The total gain, of 268,000 jobs, followed a
decline of 5,000 in May.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.3 percent
in June from 4.2 percent in May. The figures helped spur the major
market gauges to new highs. The Dow Jones industrial average
finished up 5.6 percent for the week, its best performance since
October 1998. The Dow closed at 11,139.24, up 72.82 points, or 0.7
percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.26 points,
or 0.7 percent, to 1,391.22. The Nasdaq composite index climbed
34.84 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,741.02.

<P>
   GM AND FORD SALES INCREASE IN JUNE
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and Ford reported that their car and truck sales
edged higher last month, as the entire auto industry recorded its

   Hackers broke into network computers run by the Internet's new

   Brazil's Senate approved a measure erasing $3.4 billion in
questionable securities from the books of Banco do Brasil, possibly
averting insolvency at the 191-year-old bank, Latin America's
largest. But the measure, which transferred responsibility for the
securities from the bank to the federal treasury, has worried
investors.

   BELO BUYS SOME MAC ASSETS
</P>
<P>
   A.H. Belo, which publishes The Dallas Morning News and The

from MAC America Communications. The acquisition will include KTVK,
an independent television station in Phoenix, and the right to
operate KASW, an affiliate of the WB television network in Phoenix,
through a local marketing agreement. The acquisition will also

   COCA-COLA IN SECOND POLISH RECALL
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is removing all half-liter bottles of its new

because government scientists have detected coliform bacteria in
the product. About 180,000 bottles of the water had already been

CATHOLICS AND ANGLICANS: SO CLOSE YET SO DISTANT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone investing in future Christian unity, the dialogue
between Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism would not be a hot stock.
Perhaps no other two branches of a divided Christianity are so
close in spirituality, doctrine and ritual, and yet in recent years
the two churches have often seemed to be going in opposite
directions.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of the 37 national or regional provinces of
worldwide Anglicanism, including the Episcopal Church U.S.A. and
the mother church, the Church of England, now ordain women to the
priesthood. But, the Roman Catholic Church, under Pope John Paul
II, has ruled definitively against such ordinations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rather than softening its century-old rejection of the
validity of all Anglican ordinations, the Vatican, in the person of
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, recently listed that rejection among
teachings to be considered virtually infallible.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the pope and the archbishop of Canterbury,
Anglicanism's leading prelate, continue to meet, exchange good
wishes and pray for greater unity. And down in the trenches, a
determined band of theologians has been slogging away for years
trying to narrow differences and clarify the common understandings
that the two churches share on central questions like the nature of
the Eucharist and the church's ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The knottiest of those questions has been authority, and most
specifically the authority of the pope. That was the question,
after all, that lay beneath the split between Rome and the English
church when Henry VIII and the pope clashed over the English king's
desire to dissolve his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that some readers were startled in mid-May when
the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, which, with
various changes in personnel, has been working together for three
decades, issued a report that attributes a legitimate task of
``universal primacy'' to the bishop of Rome and that proposes that
Anglicans might enter into some sort of interim relationship with
the papacy without waiting until full unity between the divided
churches is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Is a 465-year-old rift about to be healed? Hardly. The
commission, generally known as ARCIC, cannot speak for the
churches. Despite its official status and high-level membership,
the commission only proposes ideas for acceptance by church
authorities. And the report itself, now being hailed by
sympathizers for its nearly poetic, tightly woven and highly
condensed style, will probably be found wanting by critics for
exactly the same characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Using a passage from St. Paul's Second Letter to the
Corinthians, the report's discussion of authority begins with God
as the author of life speaking a ``yes'' to humanity in Jesus and
being answered with an affirming ``amen,'' also in Jesus and,
through his spirit, in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Anglicans and Roman Catholics will have to parse the exact
meaning of the commission's proposals for the role of the bishop of
Rome, the pope, not only as a symbolic point of unity but as an
authoritative teacher with the ministry of discerning and
proclaiming the truth of the faith. The language is carefully
framed with references to the whole body of bishops, ecumenical
councils, freedom of conscience and fidelity to Scripture and
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But the very title of the commission's report, ``The Gift of
Authority,'' challenges a much wider audience, especially in the
United States. Authority a gift? Most Americans would instinctively
title a report like this, ``The Problem of Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   In this broken world, authority inevitably has a hard edge that
the commission's report recognizes, although only briefly. Yet, as
more than one commentator suggested, in the West simply to link the
notions of ``authority'' and ``gift'' verges on the subversive.
</P>
<P>
   The report's positive unfolding of ``the gift of authority''
also challenges another dominant pattern of American religious
life. Theological understandings of authority are continually bent
to serve whatever immediate cause is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   If advocates or opponents of changing church tenets and
practices regarding homosexuality are confident of finding support
for their views in the resolutions of their national deliberative
bodies, they treat those resolutions as authoritative and binding.
If they cannot garner support nationally, they become defenders of
``local option,'' whether at the diocesan or presbytery or
conference or congregational level.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Catholics treat the pope as authoritative regarding
capital punishment or removing sanctions from Iraq, but they want
their national bishops' conference or even their local parish to
have the last word when it comes to inclusive language in the
liturgy. Conservative Catholics honor the pope as pretty much
authoritative on everything _ depending, of course, on the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Authority in these cases isn't a gift to be received and
treasured, but rather one more variable in a political battle.
</P>
<P>
   The ARCIC report ends with some concrete but probably quixotic
recommendations. It urges the Catholic church to strengthen the
``synodal structures'' that emerged from the Second Vatican Council
(which have in practice been eclipsed by the current papacy). It
urges Anglicans to strengthen their ``structures of authority''
(which have in practice been disregarded by national churches
confronting issues of gender and sexuality).
</P>
<P>
   The commission also floats the intriguing idea of having
Anglican bishops accompany Catholic ones on their periodic visits
reporting to the pope in Rome. That would force the question of
whether Anglicans might recognize some degree of Petrine ministry
even before full communion between the churches was achieved. But
it would also force the question of whether Rome would recognize
Anglican bishops as in some sense peers of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect it to happen. In this case as so often happens, the
effect of ecumenical dialogue will not be organizational unity
between two bodies as much as a deeper probing by each of its own
beliefs. To reach out, you have to dig down.

CLINTON AND S. KOREAN LEADER WARN NORTH AGAINST TESTING MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and President Kim Dae-jung of
South Korea used a brief meeting in Washington on Friday to make a
show of solidarity against North Korea and to warn it against
testing another long-range missile in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are maintaining close coordination on all issues, on
economic issues as well as security issues,'' said Kim, the onetime
dissident who was elected president just as South Korea plunged
into its economic crisis two years ago. ``And I do hope that this
close cooperation sends a clear message to North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of cooperation, a senior Clinton administration
official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, refused to
discuss South Korea's own expanding missile program. It has become
the subject of increasing tension between Washington and Seoul,
with Clinton administration officials fearing that the North will
regard it as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not prepared to discuss anything about a South Korean
missile program,'' the senior official said testily after being
pressed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago the administration warned North Korea that a test of
its long-range Taepodong missile would result in ``very serious
consequences.'' The official speaking Friday said such a test would
create ``serious obstacles to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the United States, South Korea and Japan _ the last
test flew over Japanese territory _ might respond, he ruled out
suspending oil shipments or aid to the North in building
light-water nuclear reactors, part of a 1994 deal under which the
North is supposed to freeze its work on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The official said it would make no sense for the United States
to violate the 1994 accord and invite the North to do the same by
resuming its weapons project.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day Kim met with former Defense Secretary William
Perry, President Clinton's special envoy for North Korean affairs,
for an update on Perry's recommendations to the White House for
dealing with the North. Last month Perry went to Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital, to offer a deal under which the United States
would gradually lift economic sanctions that have been in place
since the Korean War of 1950-53.
</P>
<P>
   In return the North would have to agree to stop testing and
exporting missiles and to end military provocations against the
South. The State Department described North Korean officials as
interested in Perry's proposal. But only two weeks later, a dispute
between North and South Korean fishing boats turned into a naval
firefight in disputed waters west of the Korean Peninsula. More
than 20 North Koreans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Kim also came here to proclaim that his country's economic
troubles appeared to be well on their way to ending. Clinton
congratulated him, but the White House description of the meeting
made it clear that U.S. officials remained worried that the process
of reforming South Korea's economy had bogged down.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The painting had hung in St. Petersburg
City Hall all of Joe Waller's life, an eight-foot-long racial
caricature that showed black people happily entertaining white
picnickers. Every time Waller, a young black man, saw it, anger and
humiliation scorched him deep inside.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1966, he tore it down. With police officers in
pursuit, he ran through St. Petersburg's downtown, the ripped
painting flapping in his clenched fists like the captured flag of
some oppressive government. To him, it was.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians in this city on Tampa Bay have called his action
the start of the civil rights movement in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``That damn mural, that insulting thing,'' said the man who
ripped it down, who is now known as Omali Yeshitela. He has gray in
his hair, but the contempt in his voice, after all this time,
sounds brand new.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost 33 years later, members of the St. Petersburg City
Council say they believe that their predecessors were wrong to have
hung the painting in the first place, and they recently put forth a
motion to hang a plaque in City Hall, in apology.
</P>
<P>
   But when some Council members learned that the wording in the
first-draft for the plaque also included an apology to the man who
tore down the painting, the motion, which had first seemed as
simple as honoring a retiring school teacher or allocating money to
plant palms, floundered.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, which had hung for decades, was hurtful to blacks
here, everybody on the Council agreed, but some members questioned
whether Yeshitela's overall legacy in St. Petersburg entitled him
to be immortalized in a plaque for that single long-ago deed.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent City Council meeting, the chairwoman, Bea Griswold,
said she had sworn an oath to the U.S. Constitution upon taking
office and would not honor Waller because he had once favored
overthrowing the U.S. government. Another councilwoman, Kathleen
Ford, said words attributed to Yeshitela on a Web site sounded like
treason.
</P>
<P>
   The divided Council, made up of two blacks and six whites, could
not reach an agreement and has not acted on the matter since.
</P>
<P>
   After his history-making act, for which he served three years in
prison, the man who was Joe Waller stayed mad, advocating not just
greater freedom for black people but also independence. He became
Omali Yeshitela and founded the African People's Socialist Party,
which advocates black self-determination, and, in a time when many
other black leaders spoke of racial harmony, he wanted nothing from
white power brokers or from the black leaders who sought to build
bridges. A lifetime of urging blacks to fight back against the
police branded him a radical, as someone not to be taken seriously
by the white and black establishments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after the shooting death of a young black man by the
police in St. Petersburg, Yeshitela and his followers here, the
Uhuru Movement, were accused by the police of inciting a riot. A
SWAT team surrounded the Uhuru headquarters in the predominantly
black neighborhood in South St. Petersburg and fired tear gas into
it as people looked on in anger. The incident won Yeshitela support
among blacks, but whites were aghast. A riot in sleepy St.
Petersburg had been unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, sitting at a table in the Uhuru headquarters,
Yeshitela said he did not need words cast in bronze or plaster to
validate his life.
</P>
<P>
   But to ignore the fact that the racist painting had been torn
down by a black man, Yeshitela said, ``is designer history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``History is powerful,'' he said. It should, he said, be told
right.
</P>
<P>
   The man The St. Petersburg Times referred to once ``this city's
ultimate outsider'' now has the ear of Mayor David Fischer and
police officials. The clash with the police in 1996 forced a
meeting between the outsider and insiders, and Yeshitela even
serves on planning committees intended to bring better jobs and a
decent standard of living to the city's poorest residents.
</P>
<P>
   Yeshitela would still prefer to see black neighborhoods improve
without aid from the outside. But ``I'm not a nihilist,'' said
Yeshitela, a tall, powerful-looking man dressed in light-gray. ``I
am not an anarchist.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, still angry, say people who know him, and know
the world he came from. Fischer, who is white, called Yeshitela's
actions of 1966 a reflection of the anger of the time and ``a
watershed moment for the civil rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this person's name should be attributed,'' Fischer
said. ``It is part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Yeshitela had been preparing for it all his life.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 9, 1941. His father was a
laborer on the railroad. His mother was a nurse and a beautician,
who ran her own shop.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things he remembers is the green benches here.
The city was known for them, quaint, old-fashioned benches where
the tourists could sit and listen to the palm fronds rattle in the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were white,'' Yeshitela said, smiling faintly.
</P>
<P>
   A grandmother urged him to read when he was still in diapers.
``You've got to learn,'' she told him, ``for the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, too, told him to better himself, for the race.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he was old enough, he joined the Army, which sent him
to Berlin as a tank mechanic. He remembers sitting in a tank at
Checkpoint Charlie at the Berlin Wall, then dividing East from
West, facing a Soviet tank, as a disk jockey on the other side spun
propaganda records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice would say, `And that was Louis Armstrong, playing
`Peace Down South,' but there is no peace down South, now that the
civil rights movement has started.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there I was, freezing in a tank in West Berlin,''
Yeshitela said, ``I read about it all, in Stars and Stripes. And I
remember thinking that when I went home I would die, because there
was no way I could put up with what was happening there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He returned in 1962, when he was 21. As he was traveling south
in an Army caravan from Fort Benning, Ga., to a base near Coco
Beach, Fla., he said a Florida waitress refused to serve him.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in St. Petersburg, the racist painting still hung in
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he and a small group of blacks marched on City Hall to
protest the way a federal grant was being used by the city. An
elderly woman, who had joined the march, began to speak, but the
police and others there made fun of the way she talked, Yeshitela
said. He lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed to the painting, ``grabbed it, tore it down,'' he
said. `` `We're going take this to the black community and see what
they think about it,''' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running down Central Avenue,'' Yeshitela said, with the
police close behind. It was hard to keep the painting off the
ground, and one police officer jumped on it, to stop him. ``I
snatched it, and the cop went flying,'' he said, and now the smile
is on full.
</P>
<P>
   The city never rehung the painting, leaving the wall bare. It
still is.
</P>
<P>
   As the civil rights movement wore on, Yeshitela was a constant
critic of a police department that had historically had poor
relations in black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the riot, when genuine anger in blacks found a voice
in him.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders had to listen, and suddenly Yeshitela had a place
at the table, however uncomfortable that may have felt. Among other
things, he convinced city officials that city money for economic
development would do more to fight crime in poor neighborhoods than
a beefed-up police presence, and even the head of the police union
agreed with him. Fischer has praised him for his work since the
riot, as have other city officials.
</P>
<P>
   But it is his legacy as a separatist, not a negotiator, that
stands in the way of Yeshitela's inclusion on the city hall plaque.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the council decides about his legacy,
Yeshitela said, one thing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't take it down,'' he said. ``I did.''

the body in a ritual known as sky burial. Deep in the mountains of
the Tibetan plateau, even in this part that spills into half of

 &HT;    Mets-Braves pitch expectoration talk
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Remlinger hit town and walked straight into a
spit fight with New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who
insinuated the Braves reliever doctors the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is an offshoot of last weekend's experience with
Mets reliever Dennis Cook, who has an ongoing three-year history
with the Braves' coach Pat Corrales. Prompted by Atlanta requests,
umpires twice last Sunday checked the ball while Cook was on the
mound at Turner Field, which led to Valentine's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think Mike Remlinger was fooling with the ball? I do,''
Valentine was quoted as saying earlier this week. ``He pitched for
me and he was always experimenting. I don't know. He's a good guy.
I don't think he does but he was always experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger, who pitched one-half season for Valentine in 1994 at
Class AAA Norfolk, has been one of the few players do say he
enjoyed working with the current Mets manager. But he rejected the
comments out of hand, particularly since he didn't even face the
Mets once last weekend, and insinuated Valentine was only trying to
divert attention from Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is something old, why didn't he say something in the
past?'' asked Remlinger, who denies he alters the ball. ``If this
is something new, then how would he know because I haven't pitched
against him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems odd, for a guy who admitted to liking him, to
come out and make something up in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrales accused Cook of working up the seams in 1997, when Cook
pitched in Florida. Cook has resented it ever since and this issue
invariably comes up every time he faces Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz throws
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to think John Smoltz will make his regular start
Sunday night except the Braves and Smoltz. The right-hander, who is
scheduled to face Orel Hershiser in the third game of the series,
threw what he called a ``normal'' 15-minute side session in an
indoor cage at Shea Stadium and while he would not say his elbow
felt good, he said, ``Ready to go Sunday. Felt normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz (8-2) went just five innings last Tuesday before the
elbow stiffened and manager Bobby Cox pulled him. Since coming off
the DL June 1, Smoltz has made it past the sixth inning only once
in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Medical update
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine had a sore left palm Monday and still bore a mark
from the seam of the ball that Montreal's Marty Martinez sent back
to the box Thursday. The pain was localized between the third and
fourth finger joints but Glavine said, ``I think we'll be ready,''
for his next start Tuesday against the Marlins. Shortstop Walt
Weiss made his second consecutive start Friday night after coming
off the disabled list Thursday and reported no discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez lingers
</P>
<P>
   The club remains uncertain on Javy Lopez's immediate future.
Though eligible to come off the DL next Tuesday, the Braves do not
know if his right knee sprain has healed sufficiently to allow him
back into action. He has remained in Atlanta to take daily therapy
at Dr. Joe Chandler's office at St. Joseph's Hospital.

NORTHERN IRELAND FACES LOSS OF LEGISLATURE IF IMPASSE ON PACT
CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: CORRECTS time element in lead, 13th,   19th grafs)    (rm) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The British and Irish governments
delivered an ultimatum to the feuding politicians of Ulster Friday
night to resolve the impasse threatening the Northern Ireland peace
settlement or see their hard fought new legislature shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern issued their formal
challenge after personally devoting five grueling days to talks
that failed to produce an agreement between the Ulster Unionists,
the Protestant group that is the province's largest party, and the
Catholic group Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute had centered on the timing of which of two key steps
in the peace settlement formula would occur first _ the creation of
a power-sharing executive to run the new Northern Ireland assembly,
favored by Sinn Fein, or the beginning of the disarming of
paramilitary groups, demanded by the Ulster Unionists. The plan
includes a first-ever disarmament pledge by Sinn Fein and sets out
a sequence that makes the two events occur within weeks of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read from the steps of the Stormont Castle
Buildings where the grinding marathon talks took place, Blair
wearily cast the document in upbeat tones but acknowledged that it
faced a test in convincing the distrustful Catholic and Protestant
communities to accept it as ``the way forward,'' as it was
entitled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most historic chance for peace that this land has
known for years and years,'' he said, ``and I ask you to give it a
chance.'' Ahern said it ``gives the whole island a bright future''
but added, ``if we can agree upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing what had blocked progress in putting into effect the
much hailed April 1998 peace agreement, the document specified that
a power-sharing executive who will run the legislature will be
nominated in two weeks, and that disarmament of guerrilla weapons
will begin in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein is entitled to two of the 10 positions in the new
cabinet, in effect the new government of Northern Ireland, and the
Ulster Unionists have refused to permit the party to occupy its
seats until the IRA begins giving up its weapons. Under the
proposal, Sinn Fein achieves its aim of entering the government
without acceding to this condition, a result that left the
Unionists complaining of unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   What the British and Irish prime ministers hoped would placate
the Unionists was a first-ever statement from Sinn Fein that it
would seek full disarmament of the IRA by the May 2000 date in the
original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also sought to reassure the Unionists with the
promise of prompt British legislation setting out the punishment of
automatic and immediate suspension of the legislature and other
institutions set up by the peace agreement if the IRA does not live
up to the disarmament pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament of paramilitary weapons, called decommissioning
here, has long been the stumbling block to peace proposals in
Northern Ireland, and the matter was left deliberately vague in the
1998 peace accord in an effort to gain Sinn Fein backing for it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Unionists' demand for immediate action on
decommissioning, and Sinn Fein's refusal to respond to it, held up
what is the most important stage of putting the overall peace
agreement into action _ the creation of the executive and the
accompanying transfer of powers from the British Parliament in
London to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That delay became particularly dramatic this week when new
legislatures in Wales and Scotland received their powers from
London in the program of constitutional reform that Blair has
brought to Britain. Northern Ireland was supposed to be part of
that move; instead Northern Ireland became the reason why Blair had
to cancel his appearance at the ceremonial opening of the Scottish
Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's blueprint, the formal exchange of powers from
London to Belfast will take place on July 18, three days after the
formation of the executive.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament proposal that led to the prime ministers' master
plan was only spelled out Saturday morning when a long-awaited
document was submitted to them by John de Chastelain, a retired
Canadian General who heads up the International Independent
Commission on Decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   The report was deliberately held up in recent days so it could
incorporate crucial compromises achieved since Monday. Thus, when
finally made public today, it referred to developments Thursday
that led the commission to conclude that Sinn Fein was now prepared
to persuade the IRA to start turning in guns on a scheduled
timetable and to have eliminated its entire arsenal by May 22,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will hold meetings promptly with representatives
of paramilitary groups to establish the dates and manner of turning
in weapons and will formally report progress in September and
December and then next May.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, appeared buoyant in his
comments on the governments' proposal. He said he wanted to work in
``partnership'' with the Unionists and urged their leadership to
stand up to ``people who want to break this down.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Trimble, the Unionists' leader and the First Minister
of the Northern Ireland Assembly, questioned Sinn Fein's commitment
to peace and criticized the governments' plan as ``fundamentally
unfair'' to his party and vague and ``aspirational'' on points
where the Unionists had hoped for ``certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble faces the task of selling a deal he clearly has little
enthusiasm for to his party members, some of whom are not
supporters of the original peace agreement and others who will find
it hard to step back from their hardline position of demanding IRA
disarmament before the entry of Sinn Fein into government. One of
them, Jeffrey Donaldson, a Unionist member of the British
Parliament, announced Friday that he opposed the way forward plan.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble will also have to confront the voluble opposition of the
Rev. Ian Paisley, the firebrand preacher-politician and head of the
Ulster Democrats, who is a much lampooned figure in British life
but still commands fervent backing from his hardline followers.
</P>
<P>
   But if they do not set up the executive on July 15 with the Sinn
Fein members, Trimble and his party members will face the shutdown
of the legislature, in which their party has the most power.

WITH TWO CONVICTIONS OVERTURNED, TEXAS TEEN AWAITS WORD ON THIRD
TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ For the past three years, LaCresha Murray says
her life has been filled with those she considers ``different,''
such as the older locked-up girls who threw chairs and attacked the
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there are the other types of ``different'' folks,
such as Mike Wallace of ``60 minutes,'' who interviewed her last
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's outspoken. Whatever he thinks, he talks _ whatever it is.
How it comes out is how it comes out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has just celebrated her 15th birthday and is back at her
grandparents' tidy brick home now, her nightmarish incarceration
for the beating death of a 2-year-old girl behind her, at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   In starts and stops she speaks, often unable to express her
feelings as the youngest child ever charged with capital murder in
Texas, as the child hounded by media when she had just turned 12,
as the girl who was twice convicted on lesser charges in the 1996
slaying of Jayla Belton.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said she didn't like being hauled into juvenile court
pretrial hearings wearing handcuffs, shackles and jailhouse
clothes. The food ``didn't taste right,'' and she was scared.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Murray becomes animated when recalling the final hours of
her three-year imprisonment, which ended after an appellate court
threw out her second conviction this spring. She had called her
grandmother, Shirley Murray, three times that morning from a Texas
Youth Commission prison in Giddings.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers exactly that it was 12:30 p.m. when her
grandmother finally told her of the court's decision to set her
free. She was so happy to leave the Giddings facility, though, that
she didn't bother to change clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't even have time to get out of her orange suit,''
said her grandfather, R.L. Murray. ``She wore it home. They called
for it, but we haven't sent it back yet.''
</P>
<P>
   She's home, but no one knows for how long.
</P>
<P>
   Found guilty by two juries, prosecutors continue to hold her
responsible for little Jayla's murder. The second jury handed down
a 25-year sentence for Murray for injury to a child. &UR;  &LR; The young
teen was facing the prospect of spending the rest of her youthful
days locked up.
</P>
<P>
   She insists, as do her attorneys and a swelling number of
supporters, that she is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, certain questionable tactics of the prosecution team
prompted national media attention, particularly from New York Times
columnist Bob Herbert, who wrote seven columns attacking Travis
County District Attorney Ronnie Earle and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome anybody looking as close as they want to look at
the evidence and doing an analysis of whatever was done in this
case,'' Earle said. ``What I strongly object to is someone
beginning that process with a conclusion in mind and using only
such pieces of information as buttress that conclusion. That is
intellectually dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately an appeals court overturned Murray's second
conviction because state District Judge John Dietz allowed the
prosecution to include in the evidence a statement Murray gave
police in a 2 1/2-hour interrogation _ without her grandparents'
knowledge and without a lawyer present.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's supporters decried the police grilling of the
11-year-old as a gross infringement of the child's rights. The
court ruled that because she was interrogated at a children's
shelter where police had taken her, she was in fact, ``in
custody,'' thereby requiring that certain steps be taken to protect
her rights.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the interrogation itself, conducted five days
after Jayla's death, drew outrage and protests from civil
libertarians and is reprinted in its entirety at a Web site called
www.peopleoftheheart.org. Murray repeatedly denied that she was
angry at the toddler or that she understood why Jayla Belton had
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, when they've figured out that she doesn't know a
thing, that she even tells them at one point, `I don't know what
happened, my family doesn't know what happened, nobody knows what
happened,' they start feeding her their scenario of what
happened,'' said an incensed former legal secretary, Barbara Taft.
``Then they start insisting that if she just, you know, tells them
this, then it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft, who created the Web site for Murray's case, worked for
years for Judge Dietz's attorney-wife at the law firm of Fulbright
and Jaworski. A transcript of Murray's police interrogation bears
Taft out:
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``I didn't do nothing. I promise to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Ernesto Pedraza: ``LaCresha, it's OK. Listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``Y'all going to take me to jail or something?''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``No. We're not taking you to jail. We're taking you
back to your shelter. You can go back. We just want to get to the
truth. It's all going to be OK ... And I want you to talk to us, so
we can get everything straight. All right? Once we get the story
straight ... it's over. OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``Yep. But I didn't do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   At several points, such as this one, detectives suggest
scenarios to Murray:
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``I know it's real hard, LaCresha. It's hard when
something like this happens, but you know there's a reason, there
might be a reason why this happened, you know, you might have been
carrying the baby and the baby might've fallen from your arms, or
fell off of the bed or something like this, and there's a lot of
reasons why something happened, but until we hear it from you, we
won't know. We'll just have our opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``You have ours, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``Right. And we need to get your side of the story
also.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``I just told you.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Murray says that as she was running with Jayla to her
grandfather, the baby did fall ``a little bit'' and her head hit
the floor. She picked her up and kept running. Later, police
suggest maybe she accidentally kicked Jayla as she tried to pick
her up. Then they try to establish an answer for why LaCresha
Murray might want to kill Jayla.
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``So, you didn't have nothing, no anger at her?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``What would she do to make me mad?''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``I don't know. Tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``OK, then, who was it?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``Nobody!''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Al Eels: ``Do you just get angry for no reason?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``I wasn't even angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Eels: ``Was it for fun then, did you enjoy it?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was one particular exchange, as Murray helped officers
with preliminaries for her official statement, that especially
alarmed her staunchest supporters:

AUSTIN, TEXAS: her staunchest supporters:
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``What's that word? Home-a-seed?''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``Yeah, we work in there, homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``Homicide?''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``There you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``Understand it?''
</P>
<P>
   Murray: ``Is that how you spell her name?''
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza: ``Jayla? Yeah, J-a-y-l-a . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The interrogators never explained in the course of considerably
more questioning what that strange word ``homicide'' actually
meant. Meanwhile, Tuesday is the deadline for Travis County
prosecutors to ask the Texas Supreme Court to reverse the appellate
court and uphold the legal validity of Murray's statement to
police.
</P>
<P>
   Without the statement, a third trial would hinge on conflicting
medical testimony alone. Prosecutors have expressed a desire to try
Murray a third time but remain undecided about whether they will.
Murray's defense lawyers, meanwhile, say they now have additional
medical evidence no jury has yet seen that they believe will clear
her.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said they wanted to meet with prosecutors, but last
week that seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Earle, criticized as conducting an overzealous
prosecution and accused of making Murray into a ``poster child for
juvenile crime,'' chafes at such attacks and insists his motives
are in the best interest of abused children.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I feel about this is (that I'm) sad for LaCresha,'' he
said. ``She killed Jayla Belton, and she is being encouraged by
irresponsible adults to deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle says Murray's case came on the heels of a similar slaying
in San Antonio, and he points to a case three weeks ago in Dallas
of an 11-year-old beating a baby she was watching. The problem, he
contends, is inadequate child care and stressed-out children being
put in charge of baby-sitting other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the real issue in this case. What really concerns me is
that by encouraging LaCresha to deny her responsibility in this
matter, that enables the whole country to remain in denial about
the absence of adequate child care,'' Earle said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's crusading supporter, Barbara Taft, eventually quit the
law firm and made Murray's cause her own, recently winning an
American Civil Liberties Union award for her efforts in pushing
through state legislation restricting &UR;  &LR; the way children can be
interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said the record shows it is ludicrous for Earle or anyone
else to claim that Murray was baby-sitting that day. Jayla Belton's
mother and live-in boyfriend who brought the toddler to the Murray
home had been told not to bring her that day, because Shirley
Murray _ LaCresha Murray's grandmother, who did the baby-sitting _
wouldn't be there that day.
</P>
<P>
   He did anyway, forcing 17-year-old Shawntay Murray to watch
Jayla. When Shawntay went to work, she told her grandfather, R.L.
Murray, to check on the baby, one of several children at the house
that day. R.L. Murray, who is paralyzed from the waist down, wasn't
worried because Jayla was sleeping most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Taft believes Earle refuses to seek the truth because he wants
to protect his reputation and his job. She is especially troubled
because she believes Earle is allowing a guilty adult to go free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie Earle was running for election. He was opposed. He
needed a handle. He needed a headline. He saw an opportunity. He
saw a photo-op. And an 11-year-old charged with capital murder!''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Austin's own child-killer case at a time when school
shootings and other heinous crimes by the young had stirred a
national hysteria, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was they made up a story and they presented it
to the public, just like a movie,'' Taft continued. ``They
presented LaCresha Murray. She's black and she's big. So you go up
and round up every 153-pound girl and charge her with murder? They
had no physical evidence, they had no witnesses, they had no proof
that anything happened to that child in that house.''
</P>
<P>
   At Murray's first trial, held in August 1996, her
court-appointed lawyer put up little defense, saying he thought the
prosecution's case was so weak it would fall on its own accord.
Yet, attorney Kameron Johnson was given only $300 to put up a
defense. That was the amount granted the court-appointed attorney
by Judge Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   Dietz declined to be interviewed, his staff said, because he
remains the sitting judge on the case if prosecutors try it a third
time. Earlier, he told ``60 Minutes'' that it was his fault the
defense had limited resources. ``At the time, we did not realize
the amount of controversy this was going to garner,'' Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dietz who agreed to grant Murray a second trial, saying
he believed justice had not been done in the first trial. Instead
of $300, this time around he provided what defense and prosecutors
alike call a generous budget, and highly unusual in a
court-appointed case. Defending her in the second trial and
successful appeal has cost $171,756 so far, enough for three
attorneys, two expert witnesses and an investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the handsome budget, some of the remaining members of
the defense team say disagreements among the lawyers led to some
bad decisions in the second trial.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, if the case goes to trial a third time,
Murray's future will hinge solely on complicated and conflicting
medical theories of the prosecution and the defense. The most
important issue, all agree, is the time the fatal injury to Jayla
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Norton, a medical expert in Dallas who normally
testifies for prosecutors, is convinced that LaCresha Murray did
not kill the 2-year-old. She says that in a third trial, she will
present even more convincing evidence, although she declined to
give details. Norton has taken such a strong interest in Murray's
case that she calls the girl's interrogation by the police the
``mental equivalent of a rubber hosing.''
</P>
<P>
   A reading of statements given independently to police, Norton
said, shows clearly that Jayla was very ill when she arrived at the
Murray house the day she died. Jayla was mostly lethargic and
sleeping, vomiting when forced to eat, and sweating profusely,
witnesses said. LaCresha Murray reported that she saw the child
shaking in distress before she was taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes very clear that she was going into shock at the
time she walked into the Murray household,'' Norton said.
``Clearly, this liver was slowly bleeding into the abdominal cavity
during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton's theory for the defense: Someone _ either the toddler's
mother or boyfriend _ inflicted Jayla's injuries before dropping
her off at the Murray home, causing a tear in the liver and
fractures to the ribs. Efforts to revive the child when she was
brought to the hospital emergency room late that day in Murray's
arms compounded the rib fractures and the liver injury as well,
Norton contends.
</P>
<P>
   The injury that state medical experts analyzed from the autopsy
was not the original injury that killed the child, Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jayla was malnourished, she said, and had bruises, some of which
were not fresh, and scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's completely ridiculous. All the injuries were fresh. All
of them occurred around the time of her lethal injury, the split
liver,'' said Travis County Medical Examiner Roberto Bayardo, who
conducted the autopsy and testified for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Why, when the child had 10 visible bruises on her forehead, did
no one notice them all day long? Not possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bayardo and Bexar County Medical Examiner Vincent DiMaio of
San Antonio _ also called as an expert _ &UR;  &LR; believe the massive and
fatal injury that split the liver occurred shortly before the
child's death. The only person around Jayla at that time was
Murray. Their theory is that Murray killed Jayla by viciously
stomping her on the chest with her full weight, so hard it split
the liver wide open and blood poured quickly into the abdominal
cavity _ a rapid death, not a slow one.
</P>
<P>
   Back at home again, Murray is still coping with people she calls
``different.''
</P>
<P>
   Until her case is resolved, she's attending an alternative
school for problem children caught fighting or carrying knives or
guns.
</P>
<P>
   All her classmates are boys, but still, it's better than being
incarcerated in the youth facility at Giddings she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is people up in Giddings, they use
(weapons) to get where they're at,'' Murray said. ``They shot
somebody or stabbed somebody or they tried to hurt somebody.''

FERNANDEZ REWRITES DOMINICAN RECORD BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the attention surrounding his run for .400, Toronto
third baseman Tony Fernandez has achieved a number of which he is
even more proud.
</P>
<P>
   His game-winning single on June 20 gave him 2,178 career hits,
the most by any major-league player from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who turned 37 on Wednesday, passed Julio Franco, a
contemporary and idol during his 15-year career. He is reluctant to
talk about his batting average, which stood at .387 heading into
Friday's game against Tampa Bay. But he is not reluctant to speak
about Franco, now playing in Mexico after spending spring training
with the Devil Rays, or Franco's place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julio told me then that it would be amazing if two little guys
like us from San Pedro de Macoris wind up being the ones with the
most hits,'' Fernandez told the Toronto Star. ``To me, Julio is
still the best hitter of all of us. It's a shame he still isn't
playing in the majors... a shame he's going to be second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can't say where this ranks (among his
achievements). Only after I sit down and think about this will I
able to place it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might mean more for my kids. It probably means a lot to the
people back home in the Dominican Republic. I know many people will
be surprised that, with guys like George Bell, Cesar Cedeno and so
on, they realize Tony Fernandez has more hits than all of them _
including Julio Franco.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's game-winning and record-breaking hit was worth more
than posterity. Blue Jays starter David Wells, who signed a
two-year contract extension before the game, promised $500 to any
player who delivered a game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Fernandez played in his 2,006th game, which broke a
tie for second place with Cedeno for games played by a Dominican.
Felipe Alou, now the Expos manager, had 2,082.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, a .285 lifetime hitter going into this season, is in
his fourth tour with the Blue Jays. He once was considered the
defensive equal of Ozzie Smith at shortstop and when Toronto's
young shortstop Alex Gonzalez went down with a shoulder problem
earlier this year, manager Jim Fregosi was asked if he would move
Fernandez back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not about to tamper with a .400 hitter,'' he said.
``These things don't come along every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret, say most Jays watchers, was Fernandez's move last
September from second base to third. Although he doesn't provide
much pop for a power position, the switch-hitting Fernandez batted
almost .390 the rest of the way and .321 overall because he no
longer had the pressure of charging baserunners trying to break up
the double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health is a big thing,'' said Hernandez's former manager, Joe
Torre. ``I've never seen a guy work as hard in the weight room as
Tony. He might be the best- conditioned athlete in baseball.''

PHONING AND DRIVING DON'T MIX IN CLEVELAND SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing)  
(rm) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Ohio _ It is illegal to drive while talking on a cell
phone in this Cleveland suburb, apparently the only place in
America with such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Coyne, 82, who is in his 52nd year in office, and who
can recall when people survived without driving automobiles or
talking on telephones, let alone doing both at once, believes it is
just a matter of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten a little out of hand, don't you think?''
said Coyne, noting that some cars now have computers, fax machines,
even televisions. ``Pull off the road if you want to use an
electric shaver, if you want to put on lipstick, if you want to use
a cell phone. But if you're driving, for goodness sakes, then keep
two hands on the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded on three sides by the city of Cleveland, this older
suburb of factories, strip malls, modest bungalows and ranch
houses, with a population of about 11,000, might not seem like a
trend-setter. But it was Brooklyn, in 1966, that passed the first
law in the nation to require the use of seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Talking on the phone while driving here carries a penalty of
$100, plus $45 in court costs. So far, the police have only issued
warnings. More than 100 people have been stopped for the offense
since the ordinance took effect in March.
</P>
<P>
   The grace period will end ``in a reasonable time period,'' said
Coyne, after the town posts some no-talking-while-driving signs and
people become familiar with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief James Maloney said he thinks most people know about
the law by now. ``When a squad car passes, you see them jump off
the phone and hide it under the dash.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the ban was fueled by an accident near City Hall,
when the automobile of an elderly motorist was rammed by a driver
talking on his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney witnessed the accident. ``The guy was so engrossed in
his telephone conversation, he just slammed into the car stopped in
front of him at the light,'' Maloney said. ``Even after the crash,
the guy still had the phone in his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Brooklyn, no town or state outlaws talking on the
phone while driving, according to Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington. But
some countries, including Israel, ban cell phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said the federal safety agency, while cautioning that
phones can be a distraction for some drivers, has not focused on
them as a particular danger.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 35 million cell phones in the United States, a
figure that is growing fast. Not so many years ago, cell phones
were seen as a toy for hard-charging business executives or those
who liked extravagant flourishes. But they have become fixtures of
middle-class life.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, a trade group that opposes the Brooklyn law,
said the issue is not the telephone, but the driver. He said the
telephone industry has been running ads and sending mail to remind
people to drive safely while using a cell phone. Some states,
including California, Wisconsin and Utah, have campaigns that do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said there are many things besides a telephone that
could distract a driver, such as ``the kid in the backseat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While driving, with or without a cell phone, you have to
exercise a series of good judgments,'' Wheeler said. ``Should I
turn around now and look at the kids in the back? Is this a good
time to change the radio station? Is it the right time to have an
argument with my spouse?''
</P>
<P>
   He said new technology has often sparked worries about road
safety. Some states once drafted legislation to ban radios from
cars.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When windshield wipers were first introduced, people
said, `These things are going to be hypnotic _ people won't be able
to drive _ better stay with the goggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a terrible hazard, cellular phones, in Wheeler's
view, have made American roads safer.
</P>
<P>
   He said nearly 100,000 calls a day are being made from cars,
just to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the ban on driving and talking has prompted mixed
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy law,'' said Tony Justice, a 35-year-old foreman
at an electroplating factory, who said he depends on a cell phone
to make arrangements to pick up his daughter after work. ``Some
people can actually talk and drive. And for people who can't
function, well then, just ticket them for bad driving.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Dan Peters, a 27-year-old tile installer,
jail time would be too easy for some chatty drivers. ``They speed
up, slow down, speed up, hit the breaks,'' said Peters. ``I think
their driving follows the rhythm of their phone conversations. It
drives me crazy. They should pass this law everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has fielded more than a few calls about the town's
policy, most of them positive.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the calls have been dialed from cell phones in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to be such a part of people's lives,'' Coyne said,
``they can't help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For passing motorists who might not be familiar with the local
ways of Brooklyn, the mayor said, the police show some
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, `Look, there's a law in Brooklyn, so please get
off the phone.'''

JULIUS ERVING ADMITS HE IS FATHER OF TENNIS STAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS from three to four children in fourth graf.)  (rm) 
 By   JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each surprising victory at Wimbledon, Alexandra Stevenson,
the 18-year-old rising tennis star, faced another set of questions
_ intensifying curiosity about everything from her style of play to
her experiences as a black woman in a predominantly white sport.
</P>
<P>
   Then this week, as she continued her run through the world's
most prestigious tournament in her first performance as a
professional, Stevenson, the daughter of a single white mother,
began to be asked insistently about an issue &UR;  &LR; that had shadowed her
during her rise through the amateur ranks: Who is your father?
Politely and repeatedly, the young player declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevenson did not stop winning _ she will play in the
women's semifinals Saturday _ and the question did not stop being
asked, the interest driven by a newspaper report that claimed to
identify the father. So Friday her father came forward, saying he
was acting to help relieve the stress on his daughter as she
prepared for the biggest match of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Erving, the Hall of Fame basketball player who had been
one of his sport's greatest performers and sturdiest models of
personal rectitude, issued a statement acknowledging that he was
Stevenson's father, and that he had, in secret, provided for her
well being from the day of her birth. Erving, who was married when
Stevenson was born, said he had kept his wife informed all along,
and that his four children were aware that he had another daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand they are being besieged because she won her match
today,'' Erving, in his only public comment, told the Associated
Press. ``Getting this statement out will help.'' He declined a
request to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson has known who her father was for years, but has only
met him once, according to her mother. And in a brief interview
Friday night, Stevenson said she did not feel cheated because she
had grown up without her father present. She pointed out many of
her friends came from homes where the parents had divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been normal to me,'' she said. Stevenson said she
had also learned to live with the secret and with the agreement not
to reveal her father's identity. ``I have been well trained,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The rather remarkable events Friday were only the latest in what
has been a tumultuous and often exhilarating 10 days for Stevenson.
Having graduated from high school in May, she arrived at Wimbledon
as a relative unknown who had won a berth for unseeded players at a
qualifying tournament. In quick succession, Stevenson won five
straight matches against mostly higher ranked players, becoming the
first qualifier in history to reach the women's semifinals of the
venerable tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stevenson declined to talk about her father and
declared her mother had served as her only role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had both parents wrapped into one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate about her father intensified, and the question
became unavoidable on Wednesday when the Ft. Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel published a copy of her birth certificate identifying
a Julius Winfield Erving 2nd as the child's father.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Stevenson has become an instant celebrity, and
the London tabloids have given her extensive coverage. Stevenson
has appeared quite comfortable amid the excitement, and her mother,
Samantha, a freelance sports writer whose work has appeared in The
New York Times, has moved easily and aggressively in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson has written extensively about her experiences
as a single mother raising a gifted tennis player, and over the
years she had not discouraged speculation that her child's father
was a prominent athlete. She has been working on a book project
about her daughter's life as a promising tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Samantha Stevenson said very little about her
daughter's father. ``I can't comment all,'' she said. ``The mother
maintains her silence.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared statement, Erving acknowledged he had had a
relationship with Stevenson's mother in 1980. ``All matters
concerning Alexandra since her birth have been handled privately
through counsel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Erving told the Associated Press he had met Stevenson only once,
when she 3 years old, but had supported her financially since her
birth. ``She was brought to me at a basketball clinic at a public
school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erving, now a vice president of the Orlando Magic basketball
team, initially denied the Sun-Sentinel's story. But reporters
mobbed Stevenson at the tournament, peppering her with questions
about her father.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson became pregnant in 1980 while she was living
in Philadelphia, covering, among other things, the 76ers. She moved
to San Diego, where her parents lived, to have the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevenson recognized her daughter's talent early and
enrolled Alexandra in tennis lessons at the age of 4 at the La
Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. When Alexandra was 9, she was taken in
and coached by Dr. Peter Fischer, the Los Angeles pediatrician and
tennis guru who helped Pete Sampras develop his game as a youth.
Three times a week, her mother drove three hours to Los Angeles for
her daughters lessons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Fischer's tutelage, Stevenson developed a classic style,
reminiscent of Margaret Court, whom she now calls her heroine.
Stevenson is almost a tennis throwback, using a wicked one-handed
backhand, a big serve and lightning volleys in an era when
two-handed backhands and dogged baseline play is the vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer also encouraged her to play in junior tournaments above
her level to better her game, so she did not wrack up the string of
victories that might have made her a household name.
</P>
<P>
   As her game developed, Stevenson received help from other
prominent coaches in California, including Pancho Segura in
Carlsbad and Robert Lansdorp in Pacific Palisades. Fischer dropped
out of her life in 1997, when he was arrested on charges of
molesting children at his medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Lansdorp, who helped Stevenson perfect her ground strokes, said
rumors that her father was a professional athlete began circulating
years ago in West Coast tennis clubs. Erving's name was sometimes
mentioned, he said, but neither the mother nor daughter would talk
about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, kiddingly, I would say, hey, who's the dad?'' he
recalled. ``But they said its not important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansdorp said the absence of her father never seemed to bother
Alexandra.``She seems a real well-adjusted kind of girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stevenson has never achieved a No. 1 ranking in the
U.S. national junior rankings, she has been a member of the U.S.
national junior team and developmental squad for several years. She
has played in international junior tournaments as a representative
of the U.S. Tennis Association, and in 1996, at age 16, she won the
U.S. Open junior doubles title.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wimbledon, Stevenson had played only a handful of
matches on the women's pro tour, and as an amateur won a
minor-league tournament in Michigan last year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she had received a wild card into the Evert Cup in
California and had lost creditably to Martina Hingis, 6-3, 6-4. In
June in the DFS Classic, a traditional Wimbledon tuneup played on
grass, Stevenson, ranked 114th at the time, upset 12th-seeded
Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France, 6-3, 5-7, 8-6, after surviving a
double match point. She lost in the quarterfinals when Magui Serna
of Spain stopped her run as Stevenson was forced to retire with a
pulled stomach muscle, trailing, 6-1, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The admission that he had fathered an illegitimate child was not
in keeping with Erving's public image. Many prominent players in
the NBA have been hit with paternity suits from single mothers in
recent years, and several have acknowledged supporting children
born outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Erving, or ``Dr. J'' as he was known, has always been held
apart by fans, not just for his breathtaking play, but as a model
family man who had deep religious beliefs. He has been married
since 1972 to his wife, Turquoise, and they have raised four
children.
</P>
<P>
   More than his numbers or his midair artistry, he became known as
one of the league's most prominent ambassadors, speaking eloquently
on issues of sportsmanship, race and the game.

10,000 DEMONSTRATE AGAINST MILOSEVIC IN YUGOSLAV CITY

<P>
   NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia _ Whistling and jeering, about 10,000
people filled the main square of Yugoslavia's second-largest city
Friday night to demonstrate against Slobodan Milosevic and heard a
parade of local opposition politicians threaten that if he did not
resign as president soon, they would throw him out.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first large public gathering in this Danube River
city since NATO bombs knocked out three bridges that were its
economic arteries. The city is the capital of the province of
Voivodina, the richest food-producing region in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kosovo, Voivodina was autonomous under Tito, but was
stripped of that autonomy by Milosevic, and now the city is
controlled by his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd and the politicians had little to say about the bomb
attacks. Instead, as in the bomb-damaged Serbian city of Cacak,
where the first opposition rally since the war took place on
Wednesday, they blamed all their troubles on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing sarcasm, black humor and threats of violent defiance,
speaker after speaker blamed the Yugoslav leader for a decade of
fomenting lost wars, for ruining the economy of Voivodina, for
forcing their children to leave the country to find work and for
fouling up local efforts to repair the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decide to throw him out by force, he will not be there
by morning,'' said Nenad Canak, president of the League of Social
Democrats, a Voivodina-based party that helped to organize the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   With the aroma of fresh popcorn drifting through the main square
on a splendid July night, the mood of the rally was jubilant, as
the crowd celebrated surviving the 11-week war.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, though, also had an edge of rage. The crowd erupted
in jeers as speakers complained that Milosevic's regime was sucking
taxes from this province to subsidize his wars and creating fuel
shortages that are hobbling the ability of farmers to harvest their
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Novi Sad and much of the region have voted against Milosevic and
his ruling Socialist Party for much of this decade. But unlike
Albanians in Kosovo, the opposition has not been violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we die of fear or are we still alive?'' Canak shouted as
he started off the demonstration and people in the crowd, young,
middle-aged and old, shouted back that they were very much alive
and furious to be part of Milosevic's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest wish is for Voivodina to be a republic, but this
is not the moment for that to happen,'' Canak told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   No police officers were in sight Friday night in or around Novi
Sad, unlike during the earlier rally in Cacak. Police there turned
away busloads of protesters and carloads of reporters outside of
town. Police here did arrest four men on Thursday for handing out
fliers about Friday night's rally. One was beaten up before they
were all released.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people said they came to the demonstration because
they believe that, in the end, the only way to get rid of Milosevic
is to force him out. They said that street demonstrations will
probably have to turn violent if they are to have any effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like it to be peaceful, but Milosevic rose to power
in blood and he will only go out in blood,'' said Jelena Radovanov,
27, a biologist who said she has been looking for work since she
graduated from college here four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Radovanov, who came to the rally with her sister, Dobrila, a
doctor, said she should have fled the country years ago, but now
feels that the reputation of people from Yugoslavia is too tainted
for her to emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at us like we are wild animals,'' Dobrila said.
</P>
<P>
   Voivodina is one of the most ethnically mixed parts of
Yugoslavia, with Serbs constituting about half of its 2 million
population, but with large numbers of ethnic Hungarians, Croats,
Slovaks and Romanians. Intermarriage of Serbs with other groups is
common. The Radovanov sisters are half Serbian, half Hungarian.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she blames the Americans for bombing her city, Jelena
Radovanov said, ``Not even a tiny bit. I am sorry for the bridges.
I cried when they went down. But if that was the price we had to
pay to stop the killing in Kosovo, then I am willing to pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister interrupted to say, ``We are not all bad in this
country. The world shouldn't hate us so.''
</P>
<P>
   The substance of the demonstration was the problems the city is
having in trying to fix the bridges before winter. Novi Sad, which
is divided from some of its suburbs by the Danube, now has to haul
people back and forth across the river on barges pushed by
tugboats.
</P>
<P>
   Vienna, Austria, has agreed to give Novi Sad a temporary bridge
and to pay $10 million to erect it, Canak told the crowd. But he
said that the Yugoslav government is insisting that the Austrian
money be funneled through Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, where
Canak said he fears it would be stolen.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the Yugoslav government has denied visas to
six Viennese engineers who want to come to Novi Sad to start
planning construction of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the bridges in Novi Sad gets at the central
question of how _ or if _ the West should get involved in aiding
Milosevic's Yugoslavia after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and many European countries have said that,
until Milosevic is removed from power, they will give only food,
medicine and perhaps help in restoring electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition leaders argue that these limits will backfire,
punishing Milosevic's victims and goading Serbs into rallying
around their government. Some opposition leaders have been trying
to persuade European countries to funnel aid through cities, such
as Novi Sad, where the opposition is strong. They say that
carefully targeted help can increase popular support for getting
rid of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Interference by Belgrade in the construction of a bridge for
Novi Sad suggests that even if Western countries want to help
individual cities in Yugoslavia, it will not be easy or quick to do
so.

LIGHTNING HITS CONTROL CENTER AND GROUNDS MANY PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Mass., Conn., N.Y., R.I., Maine, Vt.)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Air traffic across the northeastern United States
was snarled for hours Friday night, delaying tens of thousands of
travelers on the eve of a holiday weekend, after lightning hit New
England's main air traffic control center, in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Many airports were shut down almost entirely for about three
hours. Planes bound to Europe from Kennedy Airport in New York were
among those delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said it appeared that its
Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center, which handles
high-altitude, long-distance traffic, sustained a ``direct
lightning strike'' at 3:37 p.m. and did not return to normal
operations for five hours. Delays still persisted because planes
were out of position.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser Jones, a spokesman for the agency, said that the center
continued operation for a few minutes using a computer system that
provides less detailed data to controllers, which would ordinarily
allow it to keep running for hours, with a lower capacity to handle
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But the mainframe computer began reporting error messages to
technicians, because various devices attached to it were not
running properly, and the mainframe had to be shut down and
restarted. This entails a longer recovery because data on flights
in progress must be loaded into the computer again.
</P>
<P>
   The computer in Nashua also supplies data to other air traffic
offices that handle lower-altitude traffic, so those, too, were
disrupted; controllers in the Boston area had to write out some
data that is usually printed by a computer.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:22 p.m., the FAA ordered all planes in the United States
bound for the Boston area to stay on the ground, although those in
flight were allowed to continue. Planes in the air over the Midwest
were delayed so they could be spread out and bring the flow into
New England to a level that the Boston center could handle.
</P>
<P>
   Departures from the New York area for airspace controlled by the
Boston center were stopped for a few minutes, and then allowed to
resume, but with a longer interval between each plane.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the control system was restored, Logan Airport in
Boston had no space on the ground and had to continue to bar
arrivals until some planes already there could take off, the FAA
said.
</P>
<P>
   Airports affected by the lightning strike, in addition to Logan,
included Green Airport in Providence, R.I.; Bradley International,
north of Hartford, Conn.; and airports in Manchester, N.H.;
Bridgeport, Conn.; Portland and Bangor, Maine; Burlington, Vt.; and
Albany, Syracuse and Plattsburgh, N.Y. In addition to the storm
that hit Nashua, thunderstorms between Washington and New York
disrupted hundreds of flights.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA could not immediately say how many planes were delayed
by the lightning strike. But it hit at the beginning of the holiday
weekend, leaving many passengers sweltering on planes that were
completely full.

TECHNICIANS SAY FAA CAUSES BIG DELAYS IN AIR TRAFFIC
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of technicians who maintain the nation's
air traffic control computers picketed at 53 airports Friday,
handing leaflets to holiday travelers saying the Federal Aviation
Administration had caused big delays by mishandling its
modernization program, not hiring enough technicians and not
consulting with them on the new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets listed nine incidents since January, including two
in New York City in May, in which thousands of passengers were
delayed because of the failure of air traffic computers or related
equipment. The leaflets hinted that safety was at stake, but the
FAA denied this.
</P>
<P>
   The technicians' union, the Professional Airways System
Specialists, is negotiating for a new contract in which pay,
staffing levels and training are issues. The technicians' last
five-year contract with the agency expired in February 1997. There
are 7,600 unionized technicians at the agency but, as federal
employees, they are barred from striking.
</P>
<P>
   Under new personnel powers given to the FAA by Congress, the
agency now has more latitude in setting pay scales. It concluded a
new contract with its air traffic controllers earlier this year,
but is still in negotiations with the technicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average traveler has a right to know why they are so often
delayed or rerouted,'' said Thomas Brantley, a national vice
president of the union. ``I don't think the FAA is held to task
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokesman William Shumann said that 90 percent of air
traffic delays were caused by weather and that in the last five
years only 2 percent to 3 percent were because of equipment
failure. But Brantley said that equipment breakdowns lasted longer
than they used to, a factor that represented a decline in the
margin of safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things used to work, if something went down and you
were running on backup, you'd have somebody trying to fix it,'' he
said. ``Now, they will allow it to go for a few days. If it
happened today, they'd wait until after the holiday weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Brantley compared the situation to driving a car for a long time
on a temporary spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said safety was not at stake. ``I think we have proven
time and again that we will take delays, we will slow the system
down, to maintain safety,'' Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's associate administrator for air traffic services,
Steve Brown, said, ``We are disappointed that PASS is attempting to
unnecessarily alarm America's airline passengers on our
Independence Day holiday instead of joining us in a good-faith
effort to resolve our differences in a reasonable and responsible
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The technicians have complained for years that management has
allowed their ranks to dwindle, leaving some positions vacant and
contracting out some maintenance work to the companies that sell
computer hardware and programs.
</P>
<P>
   The agency acknowledged Friday that staffing had been down to 65
percent of the target level, but said it was now back up, to 72
percent. The staffing level itself is negotiable, Shumann said.
</P>
<P>
   Brantley said technicians were often called in for so many extra
hours that they had more overtime than they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to a point where people go home and they don't want
to answer the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Brown, a union official who represents technicians in the
New York area, said, ``I could use another 50 people; I have 235.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely nonsensical at this point,'' Brown added.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians are paid an average of $50,000 a year, before
overtime. Many have worked for the FAA for decades and are familiar
with computer and mechanical systems that are no longer in use
elsewhere. But as the agency has brought in new equipment, it has
often signed maintenance contracts with the equipment vendors. And
at many air traffic control offices it leaves the technician's slot
unstaffed on the midnight shift.
</P>
<P>
   The technicians also complain that some new equipment was
developed without enough thought to how malfunctions would be
detected and how it would be maintained.

REINALDA FOLLOWS LIFE PATH TO HALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON THORNBURY  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No need to remind Barbara Reinalda of the quirky turns life can
take. She knows how whims can become momentous decisions, how
pitstops can become final destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, a seemingly nonchalant decision 23 years ago
defined the road Reinalda traveled her adult life.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, that road became the signpost for all
softball players who would follow.
</P>
<P>
   As an Amateur Softball Association Major Fast Pitch hurler,
Reinalda steamrolled through opponents. The only breaks put on
Reinalda were on her uniform, playing for the Raybestos Brakettes
based in Stratford, Conn., home of the car breaks company.
</P>
<P>
   She kept steamrolling all the way to the National Softball Hall
of Fame and Museum in Oklahoma City, Okla., where she will be
enshrined with four others today at the 19th induction ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was one of the greatest players of all time, no question
about it,'' said Hall of Fame services manager Bill Plummer. ``The
thing about Barbara, she was a team player in the ultimate sense of
the word. She's not the type of player hungry for publicity.
Obviously, she did quite a job. She played in 10 Olympic Festivals.
And she was also a very good hitter. She hit .290, which is very
good for women's fast pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinalda, who grew up in Lakewood, never had some grand plan for
softball. When she enrolled at Cerritos College after a stellar
career at Valley Christian High in the mid-1970s, she was as
unsuspecting as a bench warmer given her first start. She didn't
know softball could take her around the world or make her the
subject of adoring fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going to play a couple of years at the JC level and
then go on and work,'' Reinalda said.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) Making news
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper article changed that. A Raybestos salesman read a
story spotlighting a standout freshman pitcher at Cerritos and
relayed his discovery to company headquarters, where Coach Ralph
Raymond needed to restock club.
</P>
<P>
   A new women's professional softball league ravaged the
Brakettes' roster, taking all but two players. Among the
considerable holes to fill was the team's ace hurler Joan Joyce,
the lone softball inductee in the International Women's Sports Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The team invited Reinalda, but she wasn't too sure at first. She
grew up a sun-bathing, beach-walking, care-free California girl.
Connecticut? It had only one thing in common with Lakewood:
softball.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, that was enough. She played for Raybestos each
summer following college, which included a transfer to Cal Poly
Pomona, where she enjoyed two All-American years that eventually
landed her in the school's hall of fame with a 0.31 ERA over 412
innings and .340 batting average (still a school record).
</P>
<P>
   By 1981 a job opened in the Raybestos advertising department and
Reinalda knew her future was in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game took on a whole new aspect,'' said Reinalda, 42, now
an assistant softball coach at Yale. ``You were representing
Raybestos and you had to carry yourself accordingly. They flew us
out, gave us a job and we played softball for them. It was neat how
the fans related to the team. They take to the players and make
them feel at home. The community embraces it and it makes you feel
like a family. I had done enough schooling and I said if I don't
try it I'll never know. I knew I could always move back home.''
</P>
<P>
   She never did move back. She spent 19 season with Raybestos and
rolled up numbers that would make Nolan Ryan proud. She ended her
career on a 77-game winning streak and as the winningest pitcher in
team history at 441-31, breaking Joyce's team record of 429 wins.
She hurled 19 perfect games, 31 no-hitters, 76 one-hitters and 312
shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   She was unstoppable, but not because of her speed. She didn't
overpower hitters, rather she picked her spots, hit the corners.
And if a batter did make contact, well, that was fine because she
had her team behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Her personal accomplishments genuinely don't impress her. The
Hall of Fame ranks slightly higher, but still her favorite subject
is her teams' accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   She'd rather talk about the 10 national championships, Pam Am
Games and ISF World Championships gold medals. Forget the Most
Valuable Player award she earned in her first season at the
national championship tournament. Or the 14-0 record, .038 ERA and
.145 opponent batting average in her final season incidental
byproducts to team success, according to Reinalda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember my first no-hitter,'' said Reinalda, who
retired in 1994. ``Those are things I didn't keep track of. The
team winning was more important. I left (keeping track of
highlights) to my mom. Some people are big on those things, but I'm
not. That's what mothers are for.''
</P>
<P>
   And Anna Mae Reinalda was up to the task. Barbara's mother can
recite her daughter's statistics as quickly, and with the same
glee, as a schoolchild reciting the ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Reinalda, now retired and living in Ontario, raised
four kids in Lakewood, Barbara the youngest. All played sports, but
Barbara came of age when girls' sports were just beginning to
blossom. And she played them then, just like does now.
</P>
<P>
   ``She shows no reaction,'' Anna Mae said. ``She said, `Well, I'm
gonna be inducted this year,' as if it was no big thing at all.
Around here we're making a big thing out of it. She's always been
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside she has the enthusiasm, but never shows it. When she
was 9 or 10 we didn't know she'd be an exceptional pitcher, but we
knew she'd always be a top player no matter what sport. She was
just a real competitive person. She gets it from her father.''
</P>
<P>
   She also got excellent coaching from her father.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster in Bobby Sox, Barbara spied a girl on the mound
and decided she wanted to do it, too. So, her father, Gerrit,
practiced with her nearly every day in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Gerrit emphasized control and location. Barbara would master her
control then increase speed. Then further improve her control
followed by another increase in speed.

   She was the 3-A Girls Player of the Year in the 1974-1975
season, excelling in both softball and basketball. Cal-Hi Sports
named her the top female athlete in the state for the 1974-75
season. She was also named by Cal-Hi as the state Small Schools

was the state Player of the Year in 1974 and 1975. In basketball,
she earned 3-A Player of the Year honors in 1975 and CIF Division

</P>
<P>
   Athleticism wasn't the only constant for Reinalda. Humility was
also present from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not into stats, never was,'' said Valley Christian
athletic director Eleanor Dykstra, who coached Reinalda's high
school softball team and recalled a game in which her ace pitcher
struck out 20 of 21 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the ultimate team player,'' Dykstra continued. ``She
had a great respect for teammates. She wasn't surrounded by great
players. She was always an encourager to her teammates and she
realized she needed a team behind her. Kids liked to play for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the feeling wasn't always mutual.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unintended consequences of softball becoming an
Olympic sport was the chasm that developed between a player's
individual and team goals. They no longer had the same end: to win.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic tryouts were extended to those who made the
all-tournament team at the national championship tournament. It
didn't take long before making the all-tournament team was more
important than winning the title.
</P>
<P>
   Reinalda wanted no part of it. Elevating the individual above
the team was as foreign a concept to her as not caring about first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played everybody had the same outlook,'' Reinalda said.
``For three months in the summer, during the season, we were a
family. It was emphasized that it was a team sport. Individualism
is one of the reasons I decided to retire when I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple years when they started talking about
Olympics, the whole attitude of the team changed. It started not to
be fun anymore. We got to the tournament and some kids didn't care
what place we finished, they just wanted to make the all-tournament
team. Well, that's not the way I was raised. I couldn't deal with
it. It wasn't fun anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The grossest unintended consequence, though, resulted from her
low-key persona, according to Plummer, who said said Reinalda's
substance-over-style approach may have cost her points in some
circles. That probably speaks more to the current sports culture
than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes because she wasn't flamboyant people didn't think
she was as good as she was,'' Plummer said. ``But you go back and
look at her stats and you'll say, `wow.' Some didn't realize how
good she was because she just did her job and didn't seek
publicity. She, without question, was one of most humble athletes
I've met in my 35 years here. She was a team player in every sense
of word and her numbers speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinalda, who never married, cares about perception about as
much as she cared about keeping her uniform clean. But her career
will be validated when she is officially enshrined with the game's
best, not that she ever looked for validation.
</P>
<P>
   She was just having fun.

YANKEES NIP ORIOLES, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Joe Torre knows he's going to replace a pitcher,
he walks slowly to the mound, signaling to the bullpen before he
crosses the basepath, giving the New York Yankee pitcher no
opportunity to talk him out of his decision. But when Torre is
wavering, when he's not sure what he's going to do, he will jog to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Torre moved in this manner in the sixth inning Friday night,
when David Cone's energy waned in the pivotal point of the game
against Baltimore. Torre asked questions and looked into Cone's
tired eyes for answers. The decision Torre made proved crucial, as
the Yankees edged the Orioles, 2-1, before 37,518 at Yankee
Stadium. It was New York's 11th victory in its last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Orioles managed to delay their descent into
oblivion by winning 11 of 13 games, but they are into a free fall
once more: After nine straight losses, they held another team
meeting before Friday night's game, and word from some members of
the Baltimore organization is that owner Peter Angelos is
considering changes. With the bullpen in disarray, the Orioles'
pitching coach, Bruce Kison, may be in jeopardy, but manager Ray
Miller has indicated to others that he will put his job on the line
to protect the jobs of his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   If the Orioles keep losing _ at 32-46 they are 14 games under
.500 _ Miller may not have a job to put on the line for much
longer.
</P>
<P>
   They fell behind, 2-0, in the third inning Friday night after
run-scoring singles by Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez, but the
Orioles were at least taking pieces out of Cone's stamina, forcing
him to throw 27 pitches in the third inning, another 33 over the
next two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick, Baltimore's pesky shortstop, forced Cone to throw
19 pitches in his first three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, though, Cone finagled his way out of trouble,
uncannily. The Orioles had three at-bats with runners in scoring
position in the second and could not score; they had two more in
the third, two in the fourth. Going into Friday night's game,
batters had just 10 hits in 79 at-bats (.127) with runners in
scoring position against Cone, and in only one game this year had
the right-hander allowed more than one hit with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   But his pitch count was mounting, Cone was tiring and with
nobody out in the sixth inning, Cal Ripken's bloop single allowed
Jeff Conine to score, Ripken advancing to second when Williams'
throw went homeward.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 2-1, Ripken took third on a grounder, and with
one out, the Yankees' infield moved in, attempting to cut off the
run. Charles Johnson had struck out in his first two at-bats, but
this time he hit a sharp bouncer up the middle _ and with a flash
of his glove, Cone grabbed the ball, held Ripken at third and threw
to first for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza was warming up in the bullpen. Cone's pitch count
approached 120, and against the left-handed hitting Brady Anderson,
Cone worked carefully. Anderson walked, and Bordick was due to bat.
Torre stepped out of the dugout, and jogged to the mound; he wanted
to hear from Cone before deciding whether to call on Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Cone looked away on Torre's first question. There was no doubt,
he was tired. Torre asked another question, and Cone looked Torre
in the eyes and nodded, yes, he had enough to get Bordick. Torre
turned and jogged back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Cone knew Bordick would be his last hitter. He threw a slider
for strike one, then another slider that Bordick fouled off. No
balls and two strikes. Bordick had to be wary of the slider. Cone
began his motion homeward, dropped down to throw sidearm _ he likes
to throw sliders from this angle _ and fired a high fastball.
Bordick swung and missed, ending the threat.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baltimore's best bid, for Mendoza came on in the seventh,
Mike Stanton relieved in the eighth and Mariano Rivera set the
Orioles down in order in the ninth for his 21st save.

SPORTS COLUMN: METS SEND MIXED MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was talk from the New York Mets that this
series with Atlanta would be a barometer, a measuring stick for how
far the team had come in the last month. If the game was a stick,
Atlanta used it to thrash the Mets back to reality Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta led by 10-0 after four innings and won by 16-0. The talk
about Greg Maddux losing his stuff is myth. Maddux pitched six
innings and allowed just two hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on the last couple of miserable months, eternally
optimistic Mets fans felt _ feel _ their team is on equal footing
with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But what was supposed to have been a grand first chapter Friday
night in the powerful new Mets wound up being another page in the
madcap history of an often bizarre franchise: Matt Franco was
forced to pitch, Roger Cedeno was forced to play second, and the
pitcher Rick Reed finished the game playing the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be prepared for the worst,'' manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``And that was the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   This game was a flashback to where the Mets were one month ago,
mired in one of their worst slumps of the 1990s. There were calls
for Valentine to resign; three of his coaches were fired. Finally
Valentine, in a startling strategic ploy, said at a news conference
on June 6 that perhaps he should be dismissed. ``I believe within
the next 55 games if we're not better, I shouldn't be the
manager,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 games ago. Now the Mets are in second place, in
fire-breathing distance of first-place Atlanta, despite Friday
night's loss that leaves them four games back. Valentine, looking
back on his self-imposed death sentence, said: ``I just thought
that I was stating the inevitable. I felt that if the team had a
mind and a conscience that it would either put up or shut up for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this love for the manager or a sense that the Mets have an
opportunity this season to finally catch and pass Atlanta? The
National League East door was supposedly opened by baseball's
decision to enforce a narrower strike zone, thereby robbing Maddux
and Tom Glavine of strikes called on pitches off the outside corner
of the plate. Maddux has been hit hard this season: The four-time
Cy Young award winner with a career 2.75 earned run average going
into the season took a 3.87 ERA to the mound Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe some of those guys are entering an age and time
of their life where they are going to have to change a few
things,'' Montreal manager Felipe Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has adjusted, all right. He shut out the Mets last
Sunday, 1-0, and carried a no-hitter into the fifth inning Friday
night before finishing his six innings by allowing two hits.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Atlanta, the NL team of the 1990s, and
the amorphous, aspiring Mets is confidence and consistency. The
Mets have been pointing toward the Atlanta series for days, while
Atlanta has focused on its opponent at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be thinking, `Oh, it's a big series. We got to beat
them,''' Rickey Henderson of the Mets said before the game. ``But
Atlanta's just going out there to play the game. That's the way we
have to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Henderson, the steepest mountain the Mets have to climb,
especially the young players, is learning how not to panic when
things go bad. For players like Henderson, who has been around for
19 years, slumps are merely the prelude to something great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what we do to Atlanta,'' Henderson said.
``They're not going to panic. They've been there. They've won, over
and over again. When you've done something as much as they have,
your attitude, even when you lose, is: `If it doesn't work this
time, it's going to work next time. So why panic?'''
</P>
<P>
   Who are these Mets? The team that surged at the beginning of a
season, or the team that spiraled and was filled with dissension
just a month ago? The team that was routed Friday night? Or a team
of young talent coalescing into a unit, sometimes despite rocky
relationships with the manager? Is this current surge one more peak
in a number of peaks and valleys?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won 88 games in each of the last two seasons and
haven't made the playoffs. This is a playoff-caliber team. So wait.
Wait and see. If the Mets make the playoffs, stay with Valentine;
if they don't, make the tough decision and let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we have half a season left to play,'' Valentine
said before the game. ``But we sure in heck want to beat Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it will take more than wanting it to beat Atlanta, a
team that for all the talk about fading appeared to be three levels
beyond the Mets. If ever there was a time to send Atlanta a signal,
it would be now. If Friday night is any indication, the Mets are
sending mixed messages.

 &HT;    Braves shame Mets at Shea
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the New York Mets actually intend to make something
happen in the NL East, they must know something the Braves don't.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones hit a pair of two-run homers while Ryan Klesko
continued his most torrid period of the season with two doubles and
another homer as the Braves embarrassed the Mets 16-0 to open a
weekend series at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``Baseball's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's division lead grew to four games and the same Mets who
had won eight of their last 11 games played No. 12 like an
abandoned youth team. Their bullpen empty, Matt Franco, the Mets'
heralded pinch-hitter, came in to pitch the final out while pitcher
Rick Reed ended the night in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't work. Gerald Williams' hit a three-run homer off Franco,
the last of the Braves' five pitchers. The 16-run margin tied the
biggest ever in a shutout game by an Atlanta team.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux (8-5) pitched six shutout innings, most of them long
after the Mets had submitted. Eddie Perez also homered in a game
that was completely devoid of drama from the third inning on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's a win,'' Maddux said. ``Obviously, we want to win
the series. But it's easier to lose a game like this than it is 2-1
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us one of these the first game at our place,''
second baseman Bret Boone said. ``Just one of those weird games.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Braves' third straight over the Mets after
dropping a 10-2 decision in Atlanta last Friday. More important,
Maddux followed Tom Glavine with a consecutive victory for the
third time in the last four times through the rotation. Through the
season's first 13 trips through the rotation, the No. 1 and 2
starters won consecutive games only once.
</P>
<P>
   Every Braves starting position had either scored a run or driven
one in by the fourth. Klesko, in the midst of an 8-for-17 road
trip, now has 11 RBIs in seven games. Jones' seasonal total rose to
a team-high 16 as the third baseman ended a 21-game homerless
streak with the eighth two-HR game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a break-out game. I haven't had one for a
while,'' Jone said. ``To have it come in the first game in the
biggest series you can have in July, it was a good feeling.

FILM DRAWS THOSE TOUCHED BY SON OF SAM AND A SUMMER THEY CAN'T
FORGET 
</HEADLINE>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William and Diane Perez escaped the heat in their
Brooklyn home Friday afternoon for a trip to the past.
</P>
<P>
   Their vehicle was a movie, but as they snuggled into their seats
at the nearby Fortway Cinemas in Bay Ridge, it was clear that they
had come to experience something much greater.
</P>
<P>
   They were there to relive 1977, the most memorable year of their
lives, to recall the joy of a Yankee World Series championship and
the discomfort of a heat wave, and to taste again the fear that
gripped the city as it was stalked by the killer known as the Son
of Sam. That terror struck close to home for Mrs. Perez, who was a
high school classmate of one victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came because this was a time we'd never forget, a time that
was really terrifying and full of activity, one that affected all
of our lives,'' explained Perez, 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the big blackout and it was too hot to move, and we
all remember the looters,'' he said. ``It was also a time when you
could be sitting in a car on lovers' lane and that would be your
last kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Perezes were among thousands of New Yorkers who showed up
Friday for the opening of director Spike Lee's film about that
time, appropriately titled ``Summer of Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has already made headlines in recent weeks as relatives
of the victims _ as well as the killer, David Berkowitz _ have
protested what they say is needless exploitation of the killings,
in which Berkowitz sought out and shot young lovers in cars and
women walking dark streets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has said that his film is about much more than the murders,
exploring a time that he has called an ``insane'' episode in New
York City's history.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which runs 2 hours and 20 minutes, follows the
changing lives of a group of young New Yorkers who are brought
together and pulled apart by volatile forces: race, shifting
attitudes toward sex, the disco craze, the advent of punk rock and
seemingly random violence.
</P>
<P>
   This may have seemed like ancient history to the giggling
teen-agers who sat at the front of the theater Friday to get the
full impact of the pulsing soundtrack and the visual violence that
peppers the movie. But most in the audience were older, people who
remembered the madness of the serial killings and the other events
of that summer.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Valentino and his wife, Bernadette, took two of their
three young boys to the theater to show what life was like back
when they were teen-agers. Outside the theater, Valentino recalled
that he was on a Ferris wheel in Coney Island on July 13, 1977,
when the blackout hit, and that he nearly cried when Elvis Presley
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died on Aug. 16, four days after Berkowitz was captured,
and it was the only thing that ever pulled Son of Sam out of the
headlines,'' Valentino recalled. ``All of it seems just like
yesterday, even though it's been more than 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Petrillo, 46, called that summer the most defining season
in his life. ``You were scared to do anything that you were used to
doing,'' he said. ``Going to the park? Forget about it. Lovers'
lane? Forget about it. Everyone was too scared to even go
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrillo and Mrs. Perez each knew one of Berkowitz's last two
victims, 20-year-olds who were shot on the night of July 31 as they
sat in a parked car on a quiet street near Dyker Beach Park in the
Bath Beach section of Brooklyn. The young woman, Stacy Moskowitz,
died of her wounds several days later, while her date, Robert
Violante, lost an eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were especially aware because the killings were taking
place around here and Stacy went to my high school,'' said Ms.
Perez, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Petrillo said that he still sees Violante every six or eight
months. ``He works at the post office,'' he said, adding, ``I bet
he doesn't want to see this.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz, now 46, was sentenced to more than 300 years in
prison for killing six people and wounding seven over a period of
13 months. He has said the killings were committed on the orders of
a black Labrador retriever owned by a neighbor named Sam. Now
imprisoned in the Sullivan Correctional Facility in the Catskill
Mountains, the former postal worker says he has converted to
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of the characters in the movie, Petrillo and Perez
said they, too, had hung out with their friends in 1977 trying to
figure out who in their neighborhood might be the killer, taking
mental notes of those who seemed less sociable or strange.
</P>
<P>
   That awareness and continued fear of the lurking stranger is
perhaps Berkowitz's most lasting effect on them. Now when they park
near the shore for a jog or a walk, they may recognize the site of
a murder, and if they see a stranger there, they say there is still
a split-second when they wonder if he, too, might be a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Life just seems more dangerous now, even though crime is down,
they said. Petrillo said he worries about his 17-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got no control over what happens these days, so I worry
about her,'' he said. ``And, you know, it doesn't have to be a
serial killer anymore; someone could just push her in front of a
train. Stuff happens all the time.''
