METS SWEEP CUBS WITH A 5-1 VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Rickey Henderson parlayed his first three at-bats
into three very different ways to produce runs on Sunday night to
lead the New York Mets to a 5-1 victory over Chicago at Shea
Stadium and a three-game weekend sweep of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to create,'' Henderson said recently. He certainly
did on Sunday night as the Mets (59-41) pulled a season-high 18
games over .500 with their fifth straight victory to remain a half
game behind the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's 3 for 3 performance with a homer, a double, a
single, a walk, two runs scored and two runs batted in (including
the 1,000th of his career), was surely fitting for Hall of Fame
induction day. Henderson figures to have his own day in Cooperstown
sometime.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Henderson, who missed the last two games while
he was battling the flu, is one very big reason the Mets are 32-12
since June 6, the best record in the major leagues over that span.
On Sunday night, Henderson helped make it easy for Al Leiter to win
for the first time since July 9 and improve to 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter yielded one run on seven hits in eight innings, struck
out seven and walked none. Jason Isringhausen pitched the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The only things missing from Henderson's repertory were a triple
to complete the cycle and a stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Henderson _ who is baseball's career stolen base leader
_ said recently, steals don't matter as much to him anymore. What
matters most now is getting on base and scoring runs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night was therefore a smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   After battling back from a count of no balls and two strikes for
a walk to lead off the bottom of the first inning, Henderson
eventually scored from third base standing up on Mike Piazza's
150-foot pop-up behind second base. That led to a three-run rally
even though the Mets did not record a hit. They did not need one.
</P>
<P>
   It took Cubs left-hander Dan Serafini (2-2) 40 pitches to
complete the first inning. Serafini walked five Mets, including
Robin Ventura and Melvin Mora with the bases loaded, to force two
more runs home.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson homered to lead off the second and bring on a curtain
call for his 1,000th career run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Henderson scored Rey Ordonez from second base on
an infield single that skipped over the mound and off a diving
Manny Alexander's glove onto the outfield grass. Henderson doubled
off Rod Beck into the left-field corner in the seventh, before
Manager Bobby Valentine removed him for a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The move drew its intended response: Henderson walked off to a
standing ovation from the 47,679 fans that had turned out to see
the Mets on a T-shirt giveaway evening.

GRANDCANYON (Phoenix) _ Most people walking along the edge of the
Grand Canyon don't notice the noise from helicopters and planes
filled with tourists flying overhead. But to wilderness hikers and
river rafters, the blades slapping at the sky disturb the solitude
of the isolated adventures they took months to plan and days to
reach. As part of a continuing effort to restore the natural quiet
to Arizona's most popular natural wonder, federal authorities plan,
for the first time, to freeze the number of tour flights over the
canyon. Following a public comment period, the freeze could take
effect by January. It's a move that could cost the air-tour
industry millions in lost revenue. One tour operator says he plans
to ignore the restrictions. Other operators say they fear the
restrictions will force some operators out of business. By RICHARD
RUELAS. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

AFRICA (undated) It was night in Africa. Never had the starry sky
seemed so large to Lionel Davies until that instant in 1964 when he
was no longer free. Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South
Africa's Robben Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the
freedom of the world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him
with their inaccessibility. He would be in prison for the next 11
years, put there for the ``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of
hundreds of black people imprisoned during the 44 years of
apartheid rule in South Africa. Now, 25 years later, apartheid has
ended, Davies and others have been released and South Africa's art
world is waking from its long night's sleep of apartheid. Davies
and the country's other black artists, realizing they're no longer
limited by their country's horizon, are cel ebrating with an
outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African renaissance.
The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope. Story by JAIMEE ROSE.
Will move in the ``E'' and ``A'' categories. &QL;

AFTER 3 DAYS OF MUSIC, WOODSTOCK '99 CLOSES WITH FIRES

   ROME, N.Y. _ And on the third day, it burned.
</P>
<P>
   As the Red Hot Chili Peppers brought Woodstock '99 to a close
Sunday night on the festival's gigantic East Stage, an audience
that had weathered as many as 82 hours of music began tearing the
place apart. First, they began setting fire to garbage cans and
wooden barriers, starting giant bonfires and recklessly leaping
through flames that climbed 10 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:30, shortly after the band played Jimi Hendrix's
``Fire'' for an encore, the music stopped, but the audience did
not.
</P>
<P>
   They tore down the three-story metal towers that held the huge
concert speakers aloft and swarmed all over them. They set ablaze a
string of tents about 50 feet long housing the concession stands,
setting off a string of explosions underneath. They broke into
supply trucks and tossed everything, from crates of condiments to
hailstorms of soft pretzels, into the fires, all to the sound track
of hundreds of people pounding on overturned garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   It was, one bystander said, ``Peace, love and Lord of the
Flies.'' It was a revolutionary act signifying nothing. Through it
all, the crowd chanted ``U.S.A., U.S.A.'', ``Canada, Canada'' and
``Woodstock.'' It was not clear at 11:30 p.m. if there were any
injuries, but the marauding concertgoers seemed to be taking care
to make sure that no one got hurt even as they destroyed the
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem was foreshadowed Saturday night during a set by Limp
Bizkit, a band melding hip-hop and hard rock that has become the
most popular rock act of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Urged to ``smash stuff'' by the singer Fred Durst, audience
members tore off the giant plywood barriers intended to protect the
TV camera towers and passed them overhead as teen-agers clambered
on the boards, dancing maniacally.
</P>
<P>
   When combined with thrown rocks, shoes and full water bottles,
the result was a demonstration of youth anger intimidating enough
to cause the security force to stop the show for several minutes.
Towers were evacuated, the stage was cleared and a steady stream of
stretchers hauled blood-spattered teen-agers to the medical tent.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the audience at the original Woodstock 30 years ago,
today's generation of festivalgoers and performers is not intent on
overturning the system. It is intent on being on television.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the music resumed and order was quickly restored as
dozens of cameras documenting the event for pay-per-view television
and music cable stations zoomed over the crowd, eliciting cheers
wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
   Though many announcements were made from the stage that Gov.
George Pataki had named Rome the third largest city in New York for
the three-day festival, more significantly Woodstock '99 was
perhaps the largest studio audience ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Singers repeatedly addressed comments to television watchers and
performed to the cameras, instructing the crowd to cheer for the
viewing audience; media-savvy teen-agers painted themselves green
or walked around in surgical masks and underpants, seeking out
photographers and television cameras in press areas. And signs
warned audience members that by attending they were giving consent
for their ``likeness, name and voice'' to be exploited ``in any and
all forms of media'' and ``without compensation throughout the
world and in perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the near-anarchy during the Limp Bizkit performance was in
many ways contrived: for weeks before, Durst had been bragging on
MTV that he would do or incite something to make viewers remember
his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, the moment when the audience became restless was
important because it marked the coronation of a fusion that has
been emerging since the mid-'80s, but has never before revealed its
power to this extent.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of Woodstock '99 may ultimately be for
gathering the popular rock bands of the moment and showing the
country that the ones that mattered, the ones that excited and
connected with the crowd, were the ones that were fusing rap and
hard rock. These groups included Limp Bizkit, Korn, Kid Rock and
Rage Against the Machine. It is a fusion that makes sense for a
successor to the 1969 Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a generation gap today in popular music _ a style
that the youth understand but most of their elders just don't get _
it is not rock, the music of their parents and, in some cases,
grandparents. It is hip-hop, and Woodstock '99 was a large-scale
example of rock opening up to hip-hop to make itself dangerous
again.
</P>
<P>
   More than the heavy metal of Metallica, the funk of James Brown,
the country of Willie Nelson or the self-searching rock of Alanis
Morissette, the crowd responded to the layering of big guitar riffs
over fat hip-hop beats.
</P>
<P>
   Though Limp Bizkit provided what may have been the show's most
memorable moment, the best performance came from the politically
minded rock-rap band Rage Against the Machine. Where Limp Bizkit
constantly tried to escalate the tension in the audience, Rage
played it like an instrument. The singer Zack de la Rocha crouched
quietly and calmly on stage, waiting as the band slowly made its
way toward the verse of each song before exploding with insurgent
sing-alongs about everything from Zapatistas to Leonard Peltier,
the imprisoned American Indian advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Limp Bizkit, a band that runs on megalomania, Rage had
the power of conviction and belief; the music, though as fast and
aggressive, aimed to incite thought more than violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rage was also one of the few bands that didn't patronize
Woodstock '69, yet still created music that spoke to those
disenchanted with the government and the world and told them they
could make a difference. When the band burned an American flag
after its shout-along ``Killing in the Name,'' it didn't seem like
shock value. It served as an exclamation mark to the 90-minute set.
</P>
<P>
   This stood in contrast to a self-serving, made-for-TV
performance by Wyclef Jean of the Fugees. He twisted a knife in the
heart of any music fan when he imitated Jimi Hendrix's performance
at Woodstock. This began with a very unvirtuosic version of ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' on guitar and anti-climaxed with Wyclef's
setting his guitar on fire, which Hendrix had actually done in
1967, at the Monterey Pop Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing salt in the wounds of the memory of Woodstock, Wyclef
announced that he had a special surprise, at which point an amateur
singer in a white cowboy hat emerged to mangle another Woodstock
moment, performing Janis Joplin's ``Piece of My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's most spectacular moments came when the musicians
let the immense audience watch itself: as when Korn suddenly slowed
down and instructed the seemingly endless mass of people to raise
lighters aloft; when the hard-core rapper DMX ordered the mostly
white crowd to hold up their arms in the shape of X's; and when Kid
Rock had them throw lightweight items like empty water bottles in
the air, creating a moving dome of garbage that looked like
swarming locusts. Other defining images occurred on a smaller
scale, as in the New York state policemen on Saturday who were
taking one another's photographs with topless women in the
audience.

</P>
<P>
   Woodstock may be the only outdoor rock show at which fans look
forward to a rainstorm, which brings with it the mud that has
become a tradition. During Saturday night's closing set by
Metallica, the disappointingly lackluster show was stolen by what
seemed like an approaching storm, which the audience applauded
louder than it did the band. Like most of the great rock hopes of
the last few years, the shower was small and fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   After the aggression of Saturday night's bill of Limp Bizkit,
Rage and Metallica, Sunday afternoon, the crowd thinned to make the
site seem more like a very littered picnic ground for two more
subdued performers, a somewhat hoarse Jewel and Elvis Costello, who
had the courage to play a Burt Bacharach song. At a stretch,
Costello was this year's Bob Dylan, a visionary muse adding
perspective to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   After telling the cameramen to leave him alone so he could sing
and commenting that God must be disappointed with popular
entertainment today, Costello hit the audience where it counted the
most _ in its tender nihilistic gut _ with a version of his
``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Woodstock '69 and Woodstock '99 had a common youthful
obsession with sex and drugs (though to very different political
ends), the time when '99 felt closest to '69 was late at night,
when the music on the large stages ended and an airplane hangar
pumped dance music by performers and DJ's like Moby and Fatboy
Slim. With the focus off of the cult of the rock star, the audience
was free to pay attention to one another, overturning trash cans to
create drums and forming large circles to take turns dancing in.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, was Woodstock '99 a major event in the lives of
the young people who attended? Of course it was. Camping out with
over 200,000 other music fans to spend three days watching
immensely popular rock and rap bands is an adventure, especially if
it also means a liberation from the restrictive roof of one's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   But was Woodstock '99 a watershed generational event
transcending music and seeping into the nation's historical
consciousness? Of course it wasn't. One could tell from the fake
Roman pillars that rose hundreds of feet into the sky that this was
no longer a countercultural event. It is an institution.
</P>
<P>
   And as the concert's promoters continue with their plan to hold
a Woodstock every five years, with each repetition the meaning and
distinctiveness will be diluted until Woodstock becomes just
another tradition, a periodic rerun of itself. &QL;

a Woodstock every five years, with each repetition the meaning and
distinctiveness will be diluted until Woodstock becomes just
another tradition, a periodic rerun of itself. &QL;

FAA PROPOSES FREEZE ON FLIGHTS OVER GRAND CAN YON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Most people walking along the edge of the Grand Canyon
don't notice the noise from helicopters and planes filled with
tourists flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But to wilderness hikers and river rafters, the blades slapping
at the sky disturb the solitude of the isolated adventures they
took months to plan and days to reach.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a continuing effort to restore the natural quiet to
Arizona's most popular natural wonder, federal authorities plan,
for the first time, to freeze the number of tour flights over the
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Following a public comment period, the freeze could take effect
by January.
</P>
<P>
   It's a move that could cost the air-tour industry millions in
lost revenue. One tour operator says he plans to ignore the
restrictions. Other operators say they fear the restrictions will
force some operators out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they think they've got to keep beating up on
us,'' said Bob McCune, president of the Grand Canyon Air Tour
Council, an association of the 23 tour companies that annually fly
nearly 800,000 tourists over the Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers and river rafters make up about 250,000 of the nearly 5
million annual visitors to the Grand Canyon, according to a recent
report by the Federal Aviation Administration. &QL; 
`WHO GETS BENEFITS?' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tour industry members say the government is bending over
backward to please the hikers and rafters, at the expense of
tourists who want to see the canyon from above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who gets the visitor benefits?'' McCune asked. ``Do you trade
off one hiker for 10 people who get an opportunity to see it?''
</P>
<P>
   Following a directive issued by President Clinton three years
ago, and a federal law passed by Congress a dozen years ago, the
FAA is working with the National Park Service to find ways to
reduce noise.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to make at least half the 1.1 million-acre park
quiet three-quarters of the day. The FAA says it expects to achieve
this goal, mandated in 1987, by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the FAA estimates that 42 percent of the park is
quiet 75 percent of the day. But during the busy summer tourist
season, the number drops to only 19 percent of the park, said Ken
Weber, chief of the National Park Service's Grand Canyon science
center.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, federal authorities banned air-tour flights
within an hour of sunrise and sunset, to keep the canyon quiet
during the periods of the most dramatic sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``While certain people have the benefit of viewing from the air,
people on the ground receive the byproducts of that trip, and
that's noise,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come here for solitude and quiet. That's what
makes the Grand Canyon grand. If it were noisy down there, it just
wouldn't seem so impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulation, tour companies would operate under a
flight cap. That number would be based on how many trips the tour
operators took from May 1997 to April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA report estimates the regulation will cost the $151
million air-tour industry $25.5 million each year for the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's been in a state of flux for years, and that's
the state of American business,'' Weber said, adding that it's
possible some companies could close. ``The smaller mom-and-pops are
the most economically vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators also fear it will hurt their customers, some of
whom are people too old or too young to hike into the Grand Canyon,
or foreigners looking to see the United States within a strict time
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are package tours,'' McCune said. ``No way they're going
to give up two days for a bus trip.'' &QL; 
2 YEARS FOR STUDY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed freeze would be in place for two years, the FAA
report says. During that time, technicians would measure noise
levels to see whether natural quiet had been restored. If it was
not, authorities could continue the freeze, or even make it more
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Turner, chief executive officer of HeliUSA, said he's
received the FAA's letter restricting him to 2,556 flights a year.
But Turner said he will ignore the directive and fly an estimated
8,000 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he believes the law doesn't apply to him because he
flies only over Indian land, never crossing the national park. The
FAA says that doesn't matter because it controls airspace over the
entire country, including Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said it's not just a legal battle; he's going to ignore
the policy to keep his business going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have a company if you restrict it to 2,500
flights,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA won't release the number of flights allocated to each
tour company, citing confidentiality agreements. Some tour
companies said the FAA allocations would cut their business by as
much as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA estimates that without the cap, the industry would grow
at the rate of 3.3 percent a year, Weber said. The freeze would let
authorities halt the growth and study how best to reduce the noise
levels. &QL; 
NOT ALL BUGGED BY NOISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karen Foley, a 55-year-old Phoenix artist sketching the view
from Lipan Point last week, said she wasn't bugged at all by the
helicopters and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of days, I've been here for hours
sketching and I really haven't noticed any (aircraft). I did see
three condors yesterday, though,'' Foley said. ``I guess if I
thought about it, I would find them intrusive, but I concentrate so
much on my art, I really don't notice them.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy DeVries, 43, of Vancouver, a navigator in the Canadian Air
Force, said he had heard lots of planes and helicopters while
camping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like we were at Chicago O'Hare Airport,'' DeVries
said. ``It starts about 8 o'clock and is steady in the mornings,
but tapers off by midafternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 71 percent of canyon visitors say they don't notice
the aircraft noise, according to a survey included in the report.
Most of those whose canyon experience does not dip below the rim
said they were not affected by the airplane noise.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 40 percent of those who backpack into the canyon
or take a rafting trip down the Colorado River, said they were at
least moderately affected by aircraft noise, the survey says. &QL;

BLACK SOUTH AFRICA FINDS VOICE IN FREEDOM FOLLOWING APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVIN IN ``E'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; It was night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the starry sky seemed so large to Lionel Davies until
that instant in 1964 when he was no longer free.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South Africa's Robben
Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the freedom of the
world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him with their
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would be in prison for the next 11 years, put there for the
``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of hundreds of black people
imprisoned during the 44 years of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Davies only hoped that one day he would again stand under that
sky as a man equal to the world, and not as a black South African
activist imprisoned by cultural fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We were the pariahs of our world,'' Davies says. ``It was
humiliating to be black at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, apartheid has ended, Davies and others have
been released and South Africa's art world is waking from its long
night's sleep of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and the country's other black artists, realizing they're
no longer limited by their country's horizon, are celebrating with
an outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally destroyed by apartheid and prison,'' says
Davies, now 63. ``But I searched for direction, and I discovered
making art. I learned to paint and to draw, and that transformed my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the idea of an African renaissance is all about:
the divine human gift of creation and the right of a person,
regardless of color, to share the product of that creation with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's about excavating a culture strangled by years of white
colonial rule and nourishing and encouraging the remains.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a country that has always hugged tight to the Cape of
Good Hope, dreaming of discovering itself, finding ''fortitude and
soul in time to accompany the world into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It was once merely about survival. Now it is about claiming
space. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TODAY'S BUZZWORD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``African renaissance'' has been a buzzword in today's South
Africa since newly inaugurated president Thabo Mbeki and former
president and national hero Nelson Mandela adopted it as a mantra
of their administrations.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted South Africa to experience an economic renaissance,
a rebirth into the global economy. They cited it in their speeches,
formed committees to chronicle it and whispered it into the ears of
their citizens until the idea became national ideology, and it
spread to the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Africans, we are the children of the abyss, who have
sustained a backward march for half a millennium,'' said Mbeki in
his inaugural address June 17. ``We have been a source for human
slaves. Our countries were turned into the patrimony of colonial
powers. We have been victim to our own African predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being certain that not always were we the children of the
abyss, we will do what we have to do to achieve our own
renaissance.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRATING FREEDOM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance's dawn is fragmented and still dim in the far
reaches of the country, parts of which are just now receiving
electricity, paved roads, and other modern standbys.
</P>
<P>
   These settlements, where art is chiefly the beadwork of the
Xhosa tribes (an adopted practice fueled by tourism dollars) or the
brightly painted homes of the Ndebele and Venda tribes, are just
poised to enter this century as the rest of the country prepares
for the next.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in juxtaposition, metropolitan South African cities, such as
Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg (where bars even serve a mixed
drink called the ``African renaissance''), are basking in freedom,
experimentation and a celebration of space.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the end of apartheid is evident in the art community,
where contemporary black art increasingly flows: sensory, personal
and free.
</P>
<P>
   Black artists are again sharing exhibition space with white
artists, art supply stores are welcoming patrons of all colors, and
public arts education is again available to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a culture is being reclaimed and revealed through art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid was a politics of space more than anything,'' says
black Johannesburg painter and curator David Koloane. ``Much of the
apartheid legislation was denying people the right to move.''
</P>
<P>
   During apartheid, blacks were not allowed into museums outside
the company of a white, so Koloane never saw the inside of a museum
until he was in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming art is also reclaiming space,'' he says. &QL; 
CAN ART HEAL? &QL; 
The millennium will be a tough time for this quivering country, a
place of 11 official languages; a national anthem sung for the
first time in 1995; and two primary cultures, one black, one white,
each adept at avoiding a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yet folks in and out of the country are looking to art as a
beginning way to make this divide become, instead, a tightly woven
seam.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lydia Puccinelli, curator for the Smithsonian Institution
exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming art in its broadest sense, Koloane sees that black
artists as well as white artists have a way to counteract the
restrictions of the past and deal with each other from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art then provides a place for South Africans to construct
their new, complex and diverse society together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work coming out now is still politically charged.
South Africans such as Koloane and Willie Bester and his
captivity-themed ``The Notorious Green Car'' simply aren't finished
telling the world of how they suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gavin Jantjes and his starscapes, are more
thoughtful and retrospective of apartheid; his work is just sheer
celebration of unlimited, uncontrolled space.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Kay Hassan, whose ``First Time Voters'' is featured at
the Smithsonian exhibit, is writing the post-apartheid history
books with her artwork. She has captured the spirit of a country so
excited about democracy that its citizens are willing to travel for
days and wait in line for hours to exercise the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white South Africans, who always have been the minority,
are left wondering where they stand inside the country's borders;
it is nearly a case of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the black artists, many of the white artists, Sue
Williamson, for example, are fighting to come to terms with the
civil rights movement and are producing work equally critical of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel they've lost their heritage in the new world order.
The African National Congress, Mandela and Mbeki's party, isn't
saying otherwise. At Mbeki's June inauguration celebration in
Pretoria, the memorial statues of white-minority leaders such as
Barry Hertzog and Louis Botha on the grounds of the Union Building
were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, South African art on both sides of the racial divide
is seeping out of Africa, as evidenced by the Smithsonian's
exhibition. Also, plays by South African Athol Fugard have long
been in the world's consciousness; white artist Norman Catherine is
starting to gain acclaim; and as a filmmaker/playwright, William
Kentridge is a buzzword in and of himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual arts front, another black South African exhibit is
planned for the African museum in New York next year, and bits of
art by promising artists are sneaking their way into world-class
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa has yet to have a space at the Venice Biennalle
(basically the Cannes Film Festival of the art world), and,
according to South African National Gallery curator Marilyn Martin,
the government has yet to provide adequate funding for this
renaissance to occur on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That freedom remains as empty as the notion of the
renaissance, until the conditions are created for (black artists)
to fully participate,'' she says. ``And with a funding crisis, how
are we going to close the gap between the haves and the have
nots?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, South Africa on many fronts still has
leagues to cover, but it has progressed far from the days of
ignoring black South African art. &QL; 
TROUBLED PAST &QL; 
During the apartheid regime, this art was given only sympathetic
attention, rarely exhibited, and certainly not encouraged with
publicly funded education. School cost dearly, and that was money
black South Africans didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate social engineering,'' says Davies, now
chiefly a painter, ``a way to keep the black person in his place.
We were not given education that would allow us to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black South Africans were not allowed to leave the
country without special permission during apartheid, the only
available training was found in workshops like Koloane's, called
``Thupelo'' in South Africa, which means ``teaching by example.''
His workshop has now spread throughout the continent, reaching
would-be artists hungry for training, and even into India.
</P>
<P>
   At clinics like these, artists were trained to create art from
limited means, as finding supplies was a hefty undertaking. During
apartheid, blacks had to use different entrances to art supply
shops, pay at different counters, and were often not allowed inside
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the cost of supplies, which were largely not
affordable by any standard to blacks, most of whom were herded into
large concentration camplike structures on the edges of the cities
called townships: basically large dormitories that cleared the
white cities of those they saw as less than human.
</P>
<P>
   Township residents were bused to jobs in mines or factories and
paid beggars' wages, barely enough for clothing and food, let alone
oil and canvas. Yet the black South African culture triumphed even
over this, using industrial, cast-off material that was nothing
more than urban trash to create a genre called township art that
emerged in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children twisted spent soda cans into miniature
antique vehicles, wove frayed telephone wires into baskets, braided
plastic shopping bags into rugs, and sold them in the cities to
tourists to bring in extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Painted murals decorated the seedy township walls _ one of the
less censored ways many of those inside had to express their
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Theater troupes wrote and performed plays about white government
officials being tortured and killed. A movement called Soweto
poetry emerged that chronicled the horrors of living in townships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this politically charged artwork was either confiscated,
censored or destroyed, but not before people saw it, and not before
the government heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, the township art played a key role in
overthrowing apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was so passionate, so threatening, so overtly
political and hard to ignore, that the white culture, lead by the
National Party's F.W. de Klerk, either began to understand that
black oppression was a crime against man, or became so apprehensive
about the impending civil war intoned in the work and political
climate that they gave in. With this idea in their minds (or gun to
their heads) the National Party dismantled apartheid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, a country breathed. &QL; 
`NO LONGER ASHAMED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go now into the art world and know I no longer have to
bypass my color,'' says Davies, who spent many of his 11 years in
Robben Island's infamous jail at the side of Nelson Mandela. ``I
can express myself as a person, not just as a a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Koloane, who also was once imprisoned, his crime was not
carrying the card that dictated his access into white-only areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can embrace what my African brothers are doing. I no
longer have those doors closed for me. I can wake up and know that
there's nobody watching me. I can walk in any shop without being
told that I have to use a separate entrance; I am no longer ashamed
to say that I am South African, and that has changed my art.'' &QL;

BELLINGHAM, WASH., FIRE HAS BECOME RALLYING CRY FOR PIPELINE
CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two months before two boys and a teenager
were killed when gasoline from a ruptured pipeline exploded in
Bellingham, the House Commerce Committee voted 40-0 against making
major changes to the nation's pipeline-safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came at a time when friends of the oil and gas industry
were pushing for a quick renewal of the pipeline-safety
legislation, which is scheduled to expire in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the deadly explosion and fire of June 10 has changed all
that.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been a routine hearing on Tuesday on the same
measure before the House Transportation Committee will be dominated
by the grim facts of Bellingham, of three lives that the
pipeline-safety laws failed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of environmental and safety advocates, as well
as elected officials from states that have suffered pipeline
accidents, promise to do everything they can to make Bellingham the
accident that finally forces the nation to rethink its attitude
toward pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``A situation like this can energize people,'' said Lois
Epstein, an engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund and a
member of a federal advisory panel overseeing pipeline safety
regulations. ``This is a real-world example of what can happen when
you have deficient federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not the first time a pipeline accident has
killed people, nor is it the first time Congress has debated
pipeline safety in the wake of such an accident. And although
regulators say pipeline transportation is the safest way to move
oil and gas, there have been some spectacular failures in recent
years:
</P>
<P>
   _In San Juan, Puerto Rico, a propane gas pipe sprung a leak in
1996, causing a commercial building to explode. Thirty-three people
were killed, and at least 69 were injured
</P>
<P>
   _In Lively, Texas, a pipeline carrying liquid butane ruptured in
1996, sending a butane vapor cloud into a surrounding residential
area. Two residents trying to escape got into a truck, but turning
on the ignition sparked a fire that killed them.
</P>
<P>
   _In Edison, N.J., in 1994, a natural-gas pipeline ruptured,
causing a fire that leveled an eight-building apartment complex.
One person was killed, more than 100 were injured, and 1,500 left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board and the most prominent critic of the federal Office of
Pipeline Safety, plans to testify at Tuesday's hearing, urging
Congress not to wait for another accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a pipeline accident, there is a reaction,
but that's a poor way to do business,'' Hall said in an interview.
``We don't need to be learning this community by community. The
federal government needs to require that safe systems be in place
all over the country, and there has just been a failure by the
governmental agency that has responsibility in this area to do its
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is encouraged by the promises made by new
leadership at the federal Office of Pipeline Safety, but is
skeptical because of the agency's track record. There are currently
48 NTSB recommendations awaiting action by the Office of Pipeline
Safety, which is charged with regulating pipeline safety. In some
cases, the agency is moving toward following the recommendation,
while in other cases the agency is rejecting the advice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Office of Pipeline Safety has rejected the
NTSB's recommendation to require that pipeline operators inspect
pipelines for corrosion and other forms of damage at regular
intervals defined by the federal government. The recommendation was
made after two natural gas pipelines ruptured in Kentucky in 1985
and 1986, killing five people and injuring six.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety argues that requiring inspections
be conducted on a pre-set schedule does not make sense and says it
is preferable to allow pipeline companies to decide when to perform
inspections based on risk factors such as corrosion records, leak
history and pipeline location.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 explosion in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the NTSB
recommended that the Office of Pipeline Safety come up with a set
of employee qualification and training requirements and require
pipeline operators to test employees on safety procedures. The
Safety Board says that the Office of Pipeline Safety has failed to
heed that request.
</P>
<P>
   And the Office of Pipeline Safety has questioned the workability
of another proposal now on the NTSB's list of most-wanted safety
improvements: require the installation of excess flow valves that
would automatically shut off natural-gas distribution systems in
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is at a loss to understand why the Office of
Pipeline Safety is resistant to the NTSB's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been concerned about the culture that evidently has
grown up in that organization,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's
that they're funded by the industry rather than from general
taxpayer funds, or if there's a lack of leadership and emphasis on
safety from the individuals that are responsible, but I've spoken
about this consistently for years, and it's difficult. Most people
don't even know where pipelines are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety said the two agencies simply have
honest disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the Office of Pipeline Safety and the National
Transportation Safety Board are in agreement on key safety issues
but sometimes differ on the way to resolve those issues,'' Kelley
Coyner, a Transportation Department official overseeing pipeline
safety, wrote in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some pipeline safety advocates aren't optimistic that Bellingham
will have any effect on a Congress averse to regulations and
indebted to the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in February was dominated by industry executives;
the NTSB wasn't invited to speak, while at this week's hearing no
environmentalists will participate.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials are certain to resist major new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an accident like this, there is understandable
anguish ... and people look around and say, `What can we do?'''
said Benjamin Cooper, executive director of the Association of Oil
Pipelines. ``I'm sure we'll go through a period where people are
going to say you ought to have this or that gadget on your
pipeline. But we have to see if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for change say pipelines buried underground are simply
too obscure to catch the attention of the public, and therefore
Congress can duck the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a great state of denial in Congress,'' said Bob
Rackleff, a county commissioner in Florida who serves as the
president of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition. ``There is a
combination of ignorance and a tremendous influence of the oil
industry on Congress, particularly a Congress now led by
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas industry is the seventh-largest contributor to
federal campaigns, giving $6.4 million to federal candidates in
1997 and 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Of
those contributions, 76 percent went to Republicans, who now
control both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of oil companies having a
disproportionate impact on public policy in this country,'' said
Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson, who is now trying to put together
a group of elected officials from communities that have experienced
pipeline accidents to push for change.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman who is pushing for quick renewal of the pipeline
safety laws, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, received more than $100,000
in contributions from the oil and gas industry in 1997 and 1998,
making that his single largest source of campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Barton declined to be interviewed for this story, but in
February, before the Bellingham accident, he said Congress' job is
``to minimize those accidents to the extent that it is humanly
possible,'' but that ``the safety record is respectable.'' He made
it clear he is not a fan of passing new regulations in response to
every accident, saying ``responding to specific accidents by
creating inflexible `one-size fits all' mandates ... didn't
necessarily lead to improved safety, and in some instances may have
even diverted limited resources away from more promising safety
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern congressional oversight of the nation's 2 million miles
of underground pipelines dates back to 1968, when Congress passed
the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, and 1979, when Congress passed
the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act. The laws, which
periodically expire and must be renewed, cover pipeline design,
construction, operation and maintenance, emergency procedures,
pipeline testing and inspections, corrosion control and company
reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Congress often imposed new regulations in
response to pipeline accidents. In 1992, as a result of accidents
in Kansas, a Democrat-controlled Congress required new restrictions
on customer-owned service lines, and as a result of an accident in
New York Harbor, required new rules on low-pressure hazardous
liquid pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But when Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, they were
determined to try a different approach. Committed to reducing the
amount of government regulations on industry, the Republicans
argued that public safety would be best protected if pipeline
companies were allowed to decide how best to ensure against
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed legislation requiring the Department of
Transportation to conduct cost-benefit analyses before issuing new
rules, making it more cumbersome to enact regulations. And Congress
permitted tests of risk management theory, in which some pipeline
companies are allowed to propose their own methods of reducing
risk, rather than following every federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure unanimously, and the House,
despite some angry rhetoric, voted 276-125 in favor. President
Clinton, who had succeeded in getting Congress to water down the
risk-management provisions, signed the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipelines remain our safest form of transportation,'' House
Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said in 1996.
``More people annually die from falling objects, excessive heat,
being struck by lightning and from hornet, wasp and bee stings than
from pipeline accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 measure did include some new safety provisions.
Congress encouraged states to adopt ``one-call'' systems, in which
excavators can call one phone number to determine whether there is
anything dangerous underground in the area where they plan to dig.
Industry officials and regulators say accidents by excavators are
the leading cause of pipeline accidents.
</P>
<P>
   This year, deciding that too little time has elapsed since 1996
to judge the success or failure of new safety measures, the House
Commerce Committee proposed reauthorizing the pipeline laws for
just two more years. In the meantime, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, has requested a General
Accounting Office study of how well the Office of Pipeline Safety
does its job.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee did agree to support two safety changes
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., succeeded in adding a provision that
would require the Office of Pipeline Safety to explain how it
responded to each recommendation from the National Transportation
Safety Board. And Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., inserted language
urging the Office of Pipeline Safety to complete a study on
remotely controlled shut-off valves, which Pallone believes could
have helped prevent the Edison tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But no lawmakers have endorsed all the suggestions of
environmentalists, who want to allow states to pass tougher
pipeline regulations than the federal government, and who want to
make it easier for citizens to sue pipeline companies. There is no
support for major changes from state or federal regulators, and the
pipeline industry is resisting the proposals.

BLACK SOUTH AFRICA FINDS VOICE IN FREEDOM FOLLOWING APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVIN IN ``A'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; It was night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the starry sky seemed so large to Lionel Davies until
that instant in 1964 when he was no longer free.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South Africa's Robben
Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the freedom of the
world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him with their
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would be in prison for the next 11 years, put there for the
``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of hundreds of black people
imprisoned during the 44 years of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Davies only hoped that one day he would again stand under that
sky as a man equal to the world, and not as a black South African
activist imprisoned by cultural fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We were the pariahs of our world,'' Davies says. ``It was
humiliating to be black at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, apartheid has ended, Davies and others have
been released and South Africa's art world is waking from its long
night's sleep of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and the country's other black artists, realizing they're
no longer limited by their country's horizon, are celebrating with
an outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally destroyed by apartheid and prison,'' says
Davies, now 63. ``But I searched for direction, and I discovered
making art. I learned to paint and to draw, and that transformed my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the idea of an African renaissance is all about:
the divine human gift of creation and the right of a person,
regardless of color, to share the product of that creation with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's about excavating a culture strangled by years of white
colonial rule and nourishing and encouraging the remains.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a country that has always hugged tight to the Cape of
Good Hope, dreaming of discovering itself, finding ''fortitude and
soul in time to accompany the world into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It was once merely about survival. Now it is about claiming
space. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TODAY'S BUZZWORD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``African renaissance'' has been a buzzword in today's South
Africa since newly inaugurated president Thabo Mbeki and former
president and national hero Nelson Mandela adopted it as a mantra
of their administrations.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted South Africa to experience an economic renaissance,
a rebirth into the global economy. They cited it in their speeches,
formed committees to chronicle it and whispered it into the ears of
their citizens until the idea became national ideology, and it
spread to the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Africans, we are the children of the abyss, who have
sustained a backward march for half a millennium,'' said Mbeki in
his inaugural address June 17. ``We have been a source for human
slaves. Our countries were turned into the patrimony of colonial
powers. We have been victim to our own African predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being certain that not always were we the children of the
abyss, we will do what we have to do to achieve our own
renaissance.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRATING FREEDOM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance's dawn is fragmented and still dim in the far
reaches of the country, parts of which are just now receiving
electricity, paved roads, and other modern standbys.
</P>
<P>
   These settlements, where art is chiefly the beadwork of the
Xhosa tribes (an adopted practice fueled by tourism dollars) or the
brightly painted homes of the Ndebele and Venda tribes, are just
poised to enter this century as the rest of the country prepares
for the next.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in juxtaposition, metropolitan South African cities, such as
Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg (where bars even serve a mixed
drink called the ``African renaissance''), are basking in freedom,
experimentation and a celebration of space.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the end of apartheid is evident in the art community,
where contemporary black art increasingly flows: sensory, personal
and free.
</P>
<P>
   Black artists are again sharing exhibition space with white
artists, art supply stores are welcoming patrons of all colors, and
public arts education is again available to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a culture is being reclaimed and revealed through art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid was a politics of space more than anything,'' says
black Johannesburg painter and curator David Koloane. ``Much of the
apartheid legislation was denying people the right to move.''
</P>
<P>
   During apartheid, blacks were not allowed into museums outside
the company of a white, so Koloane never saw the inside of a museum
until he was in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming art is also reclaiming space,'' he says. &QL; 
CAN ART HEAL? &QL; 
The millennium will be a tough time for this quivering country, a
place of 11 official languages; a national anthem sung for the
first time in 1995; and two primary cultures, one black, one white,
each adept at avoiding a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yet folks in and out of the country are looking to art as a
beginning way to make this divide become, instead, a tightly woven
seam.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lydia Puccinelli, curator for the Smithsonian Institution
exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming art in its broadest sense, Koloane sees that black
artists as well as white artists have a way to counteract the
restrictions of the past and deal with each other from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art then provides a place for South Africans to construct
their new, complex and diverse society together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work coming out now is still politically charged.
South Africans such as Koloane and Willie Bester and his
captivity-themed ``The Notorious Green Car'' simply aren't finished
telling the world of how they suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gavin Jantjes and his starscapes, are more
thoughtful and retrospective of apartheid; his work is just sheer
celebration of unlimited, uncontrolled space.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Kay Hassan, whose ``First Time Voters'' is featured at
the Smithsonian exhibit, is writing the post-apartheid history
books with her artwork. She has captured the spirit of a country so
excited about democracy that its citizens are willing to travel for
days and wait in line for hours to exercise the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white South Africans, who always have been the minority,
are left wondering where they stand inside the country's borders;
it is nearly a case of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the black artists, many of the white artists, Sue
Williamson, for example, are fighting to come to terms with the
civil rights movement and are producing work equally critical of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel they've lost their heritage in the new world order.
The African National Congress, Mandela and Mbeki's party, isn't
saying otherwise. At Mbeki's June inauguration celebration in
Pretoria, the memorial statues of white-minority leaders such as
Barry Hertzog and Louis Botha on the grounds of the Union Building
were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, South African art on both sides of the racial divide
is seeping out of Africa, as evidenced by the Smithsonian's
exhibition. Also, plays by South African Athol Fugard have long
been in the world's consciousness; white artist Norman Catherine is
starting to gain acclaim; and as a filmmaker/playwright, William
Kentridge is a buzzword in and of himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual arts front, another black South African exhibit is
planned for the African museum in New York next year, and bits of
art by promising artists are sneaking their way into world-class
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa has yet to have a space at the Venice Biennalle
(basically the Cannes Film Festival of the art world), and,
according to South African National Gallery curator Marilyn Martin,
the government has yet to provide adequate funding for this
renaissance to occur on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That freedom remains as empty as the notion of the
renaissance, until the conditions are created for (black artists)
to fully participate,'' she says. ``And with a funding crisis, how
are we going to close the gap between the haves and the have
nots?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, South Africa on many fronts still has
leagues to cover, but it has progressed far from the days of
ignoring black South African art. &QL; 
TROUBLED PAST &QL; 
During the apartheid regime, this art was given only sympathetic
attention, rarely exhibited, and certainly not encouraged with
publicly funded education. School cost dearly, and that was money
black South Africans didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate social engineering,'' says Davies, now
chiefly a painter, ``a way to keep the black person in his place.
We were not given education that would allow us to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black South Africans were not allowed to leave the
country without special permission during apartheid, the only
available training was found in workshops like Koloane's, called
``Thupelo'' in South Africa, which means ``teaching by example.''
His workshop has now spread throughout the continent, reaching
would-be artists hungry for training, and even into India.
</P>
<P>
   At clinics like these, artists were trained to create art from
limited means, as finding supplies was a hefty undertaking. During
apartheid, blacks had to use different entrances to art supply
shops, pay at different counters, and were often not allowed inside
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the cost of supplies, which were largely not
affordable by any standard to blacks, most of whom were herded into
large concentration camplike structures on the edges of the cities
called townships: basically large dormitories that cleared the
white cities of those they saw as less than human.
</P>
<P>
   Township residents were bused to jobs in mines or factories and
paid beggars' wages, barely enough for clothing and food, let alone
oil and canvas. Yet the black South African culture triumphed even
over this, using industrial, cast-off material that was nothing
more than urban trash to create a genre called township art that
emerged in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children twisted spent soda cans into miniature
antique vehicles, wove frayed telephone wires into baskets, braided
plastic shopping bags into rugs, and sold them in the cities to
tourists to bring in extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Painted murals decorated the seedy township walls _ one of the
less censored ways many of those inside had to express their
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Theater troupes wrote and performed plays about white government
officials being tortured and killed. A movement called Soweto
poetry emerged that chronicled the horrors of living in townships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this politically charged artwork was either confiscated,
censored or destroyed, but not before people saw it, and not before
the government heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, the township art played a key role in
overthrowing apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was so passionate, so threatening, so overtly
political and hard to ignore, that the white culture, lead by the
National Party's F.W. de Klerk, either began to understand that
black oppression was a crime against man, or became so apprehensive
about the impending civil war intoned in the work and political
climate that they gave in. With this idea in their minds (or gun to
their heads) the National Party dismantled apartheid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, a country breathed. &QL; 
`NO LONGER ASHAMED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go now into the art world and know I no longer have to
bypass my color,'' says Davies, who spent many of his 11 years in
Robben Island's infamous jail at the side of Nelson Mandela. ``I
can express myself as a person, not just as a a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Koloane, who also was once imprisoned, his crime was not
carrying the card that dictated his access into white-only areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can embrace what my African brothers are doing. I no
longer have those doors closed for me. I can wake up and know that
there's nobody watching me. I can walk in any shop without being
told that I have to use a separate entrance; I am no longer ashamed
to say that I am South African, and that has changed my art.'' &QL;

 BELLINGHAM, WASH., FIRE HAS BECOME RALLYING CRY FOR PIPELINE
CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two months before two boys and a teenager
were killed when gasoline from a ruptured pipeline exploded in
Bellingham, the House Commerce Committee voted 40-0 against making
major changes to the nation's pipeline-safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came at a time when friends of the oil and gas industry
were pushing for a quick renewal of the pipeline-safety
legislation, which is scheduled to expire in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the deadly explosion and fire of June 10 has changed all
that.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been a routine hearing on Tuesday on the same
measure before the House Transportation Committee will be dominated
by the grim facts of Bellingham, of three lives that the
pipeline-safety laws failed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of environmental and safety advocates, as well
as elected officials from states that have suffered pipeline
accidents, promise to do everything they can to make Bellingham the
accident that finally forces the nation to rethink its attitude
toward pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``A situation like this can energize people,'' said Lois
Epstein, an engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund and a
member of a federal advisory panel overseeing pipeline safety
regulations. ``This is a real-world example of what can happen when
you have deficient federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not the first time a pipeline accident has
killed people, nor is it the first time Congress has debated
pipeline safety in the wake of such an accident. And although
regulators say pipeline transportation is the safest way to move
oil and gas, there have been some spectacular failures in recent
years:
</P>
<P>
   _In San Juan, Puerto Rico, a propane gas pipe sprung a leak in
1996, causing a commercial building to explode. Thirty-three people
were killed, and at least 69 were injured
</P>
<P>
   _In Lively, Texas, a pipeline carrying liquid butane ruptured in
1996, sending a butane vapor cloud into a surrounding residential
area. Two residents trying to escape got into a truck, but turning
on the ignition sparked a fire that killed them.
</P>
<P>
   _In Edison, N.J., in 1994, a natural-gas pipeline ruptured,
causing a fire that leveled an eight-building apartment complex.
One person was killed, more than 100 were injured, and 1,500 left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board and the most prominent critic of the federal Office of
Pipeline Safety, plans to testify at Tuesday's hearing, urging
Congress not to wait for another accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a pipeline accident, there is a reaction,
but that's a poor way to do business,'' Hall said in an interview.
``We don't need to be learning this community by community. The
federal government needs to require that safe systems be in place
all over the country, and there has just been a failure by the
governmental agency that has responsibility in this area to do its
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is encouraged by the promises made by new
leadership at the federal Office of Pipeline Safety, but is
skeptical because of the agency's track record. There are currently
48 NTSB recommendations awaiting action by the Office of Pipeline
Safety, which is charged with regulating pipeline safety. In some
cases, the agency is moving toward following the recommendation,
while in other cases the agency is rejecting the advice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Office of Pipeline Safety has rejected the
NTSB's recommendation to require that pipeline operators inspect
pipelines for corrosion and other forms of damage at regular
intervals defined by the federal government. The recommendation was
made after two natural gas pipelines ruptured in Kentucky in 1985
and 1986, killing five people and injuring six.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety argues that requiring inspections
be conducted on a pre-set schedule does not make sense and says it
is preferable to allow pipeline companies to decide when to perform
inspections based on risk factors such as corrosion records, leak
history and pipeline location.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 explosion in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the NTSB
recommended that the Office of Pipeline Safety come up with a set
of employee qualification and training requirements and require
pipeline operators to test employees on safety procedures. The
Safety Board says that the Office of Pipeline Safety has failed to
heed that request.
</P>
<P>
   And the Office of Pipeline Safety has questioned the workability
of another proposal now on the NTSB's list of most-wanted safety
improvements: require the installation of excess flow valves that
would automatically shut off natural-gas distribution systems in
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is at a loss to understand why the Office of
Pipeline Safety is resistant to the NTSB's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been concerned about the culture that evidently has
grown up in that organization,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's
that they're funded by the industry rather than from general
taxpayer funds, or if there's a lack of leadership and emphasis on
safety from the individuals that are responsible, but I've spoken
about this consistently for years, and it's difficult. Most people
don't even know where pipelines are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety said the two agencies simply have
honest disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the Office of Pipeline Safety and the National
Transportation Safety Board are in agreement on key safety issues
but sometimes differ on the way to resolve those issues,'' Kelley
Coyner, a Transportation Department official overseeing pipeline
safety, wrote in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some pipeline safety advocates aren't optimistic that Bellingham
will have any effect on a Congress averse to regulations and
indebted to the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in February was dominated by industry executives;
the NTSB wasn't invited to speak, while at this week's hearing no
environmentalists will participate.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials are certain to resist major new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an accident like this, there is understandable
anguish ... and people look around and say, `What can we do?'''
said Benjamin Cooper, executive director of the Association of Oil
Pipelines. ``I'm sure we'll go through a period where people are
going to say you ought to have this or that gadget on your
pipeline. But we have to see if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for change say pipelines buried underground are simply
too obscure to catch the attention of the public, and therefore
Congress can duck the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a great state of denial in Congress,'' said Bob
Rackleff, a county commissioner in Florida who serves as the
president of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition. ``There is a
combination of ignorance and a tremendous influence of the oil
industry on Congress, particularly a Congress now led by
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas industry is the seventh-largest contributor to
federal campaigns, giving $6.4 million to federal candidates in
1997 and 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Of
those contributions, 76 percent went to Republicans, who now
control both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of oil companies having a
disproportionate impact on public policy in this country,'' said
Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson, who is now trying to put together
a group of elected officials from communities that have experienced
pipeline accidents to push for change.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman who is pushing for quick renewal of the pipeline
safety laws, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, received more than $100,000
in contributions from the oil and gas industry in 1997 and 1998,
making that his single largest source of campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Barton declined to be interviewed for this story, but in
February, before the Bellingham accident, he said Congress' job is
``to minimize those accidents to the extent that it is humanly
possible,'' but that ``the safety record is respectable.'' He made
it clear he is not a fan of passing new regulations in response to
every accident, saying ``responding to specific accidents by
creating inflexible `one-size fits all' mandates ... didn't
necessarily lead to improved safety, and in some instances may have
even diverted limited resources away from more promising safety
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern congressional oversight of the nation's 2 million miles
of underground pipelines dates back to 1968, when Congress passed
the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, and 1979, when Congress passed
the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act. The laws, which
periodically expire and must be renewed, cover pipeline design,
construction, operation and maintenance, emergency procedures,
pipeline testing and inspections, corrosion control and company
reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Congress often imposed new regulations in
response to pipeline accidents. In 1992, as a result of accidents
in Kansas, a Democrat-controlled Congress required new restrictions
on customer-owned service lines, and as a result of an accident in
New York Harbor, required new rules on low-pressure hazardous
liquid pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But when Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, they were
determined to try a different approach. Committed to reducing the
amount of government regulations on industry, the Republicans
argued that public safety would be best protected if pipeline
companies were allowed to decide how best to ensure against
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed legislation requiring the Department of
Transportation to conduct cost-benefit analyses before issuing new
rules, making it more cumbersome to enact regulations. And Congress
permitted tests of risk management theory, in which some pipeline
companies are allowed to propose their own methods of reducing
risk, rather than following every federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure unanimously, and the House,
despite some angry rhetoric, voted 276-125 in favor. President
Clinton, who had succeeded in getting Congress to water down the
risk-management provisions, signed the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipelines remain our safest form of transportation,'' House
Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said in 1996.
``More people annually die from falling objects, excessive heat,
being struck by lightning and from hornet, wasp and bee stings than
from pipeline accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 measure did include some new safety provisions.
Congress encouraged states to adopt ``one-call'' systems, in which
excavators can call one phone number to determine whether there is
anything dangerous underground in the area where they plan to dig.
Industry officials and regulators say accidents by excavators are
the leading cause of pipeline accidents.
</P>
<P>
   This year, deciding that too little time has elapsed since 1996
to judge the success or failure of new safety measures, the House
Commerce Committee proposed reauthorizing the pipeline laws for
just two more years. In the meantime, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, has requested a General
Accounting Office study of how well the Office of Pipeline Safety
does its job.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee did agree to support two safety changes
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., succeeded in adding a provision that
would require the Office of Pipeline Safety to explain how it
responded to each recommendation from the National Transportation
Safety Board. And Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., inserted language
urging the Office of Pipeline Safety to complete a study on
remotely controlled shut-off valves, which Pallone believes could
have helped prevent the Edison tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But no lawmakers have endorsed all the suggestions of
environmentalists, who want to allow states to pass tougher
pipeline regulations than the federal government, and who want to
make it easier for citizens to sue pipeline companies. There is no
support for major changes from state or federal regulators, and the
pipeline industry is resisting the proposals.

DELEGATION STEPS UP INTEREST IN INDUSTRY AFTER ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time Congress debated pipeline safety
issues, in 1996, not a single lawmaker from Washington state
entered the fray.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of last month's deadly explosion in Bellingham,
Wash., Washington state lawmakers are rushing to familiarize
themselves with the arcane issues of pipeline regulation and come
up with ways to prevent another accident.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, members of the delegation are not offering
specific proposals, but say they want to ask questions and see what
the National Transportation Safety Board has to say about what
caused the Bellingham explosion. And Gov. Gary Locke, who activists
hoped would push for congressional action, is also taking a go-slow
approach, waiting for a committee to advise him on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the delegation probably have some time. Although
the House has already begun debating renewal of the nation's
pipeline safety laws, the Senate doesn't plan to take up the issue
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the delegation are poised to play a significant
role in the debate over pipeline safety over the next year: Sen.
Slade Gorton, Rep. Brian Baird and Rep. Jack Metcalf because they
sit on committees with jurisdiction over pipeline safety, and Sen.
Patty Murray because she is forcing herself into the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a Democrat, has been the quickest to respond to the
accident, visiting Bellingham, a city about 80 miles north of
Seattle, talking regularly to the mayor there, and summoning
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to her office to inform him
that she will be seeking changes in the way his department works to
protect public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said of the nation's pipeline safety laws, ``it is clear
they have not lived up to what they were supposed to do.'' She has
criticized the Office of Pipeline Safety for failing to follow
through on required changes, and said, ``I have heard a lot of
complaints from officials in Bellingham who feel that the Office of
Pipeline Safety is in bed with the (oil and gas) industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf, a Republican whose district includes Bellingham, is
becoming increasingly vocal. Metcalf is the lone Republican from
Washington state who voted against loosening pipeline industry
regulations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, liberated from any political concerns because he is not
seeking re-election, Metcalf is promising to use the final months
of his long career in public office to fight for pipeline safety.
Metcalf plans to testify at tomorrow's hearing, and promises to
grill federal pipeline safety officials about why they haven't
heeded previous NTSB recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Murray, Metcalf says he isn't yet sure what changes he
would make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now looking very carefully to see whether it (the
Bellingham explosion) was the fault of the rules, or whether
somebody made a mistake carrying out the rules,'' he said. ``I am
deeply concerned, and want to be prepared to take an active role if
changes are needed. But at this point we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, a Democrat who represents southwest Washington, says he
is worried that Congress is not willing to impose tough new
regulations on pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last review of this process (in 1996) probably didn't
strengthen the regulations at all,'' he said. ``The Republican
Party tends to always denounce any government regulation, yet
here's a case where the regulatory process failed, and previous
attempts to weaken the regulations are being shown to have their
own hazard,'' he said. ``We inspect restaurants for food safety,
trucks for trucking safety, airplanes for airplane safety.
Pipelines obviously pose a hazard, and there's no reason we
shouldn't inspect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, arguably the most powerful member of the state's
congressional delegation, could have a loud voice in the debate
because he is one of the senior members of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and his actions are certain to be closely watched in a
year when he is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will undoubtedly pay a great deal more attention to it than
I would have had it been a normal reauthorization with no apparent
impact on the state of Washington,'' Gorton said. But Gorton said
he is waiting for the NTSB analysis of what went wrong at
Bellingham before deciding how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very real and extremely disturbing and dangerous failure in
this case may mean a failure in the law and it may mean a failure
in the enforcement of the law, and we don't know the answer to that
yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have been hoping Locke, a Democrat, will use
his influence with the Clinton administration and the state's
congressional delegation to push for change. But Locke is taking a
more deliberative approach, waiting, perhaps until the end of this
year, until a task force he appointed makes recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials from Washington state are likely to come under
increasing pressure from local activists to do something about
pipeline safety. Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson is on a crusade to
make sure what happened to his community doesn't happen again, and
a local group, SAFE Bellingham, has already sprung up to push for
pipeline safety reform. Meanwhile, WashPIRG and the Cascade
Columbia Alliance, two organizations that have been battling a
now-withdrawn proposal from Olympic Pipe Line to build a
cross-Cascades pipeline, promise to redirect their energies toward
fighting for pipeline safety changes.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists say they are hoping Locke will wind up
leading the charge to persuade members of Congress to change the
laws.
</P>
<P>
   David Bricklin, the environmental attorney now representing the
city of Bellingham, says Locke could forge an alliance with the
governors of other states that have suffered damage from pipeline
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the governors of other states that have borne the brunt
of these catastrophes are in a good position to make their voices
heard,'' Bricklin said. ``We don't know if it (the Bellingham
explosion) was a failure of regulations or a failure of a company
to follow regulations, but we do know that the regulations aren't
sufficient. Even if this accident was not the result of flawed
regulations, there's certainly room for improvement.''

BELLINGHAM, WASH., FIRE HAS BECOME RALLYING CRY FOR PIPELINE
CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two months before two boys and a teenager
were killed when gasoline from a ruptured pipeline exploded in
Bellingham, the House Commerce Committee voted 40-0 against making
major changes to the nation's pipeline-safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came at a time when friends of the oil and gas industry
were pushing for a quick renewal of the pipeline-safety
legislation, which is scheduled to expire in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the deadly explosion and fire of June 10 has changed all
that.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been a routine hearing on Tuesday on the same
measure before the House Transportation Committee will be dominated
by the grim facts of Bellingham, of three lives that the
pipeline-safety laws failed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of environmental and safety advocates, as well
as elected officials from states that have suffered pipeline
accidents, promise to do everything they can to make Bellingham the
accident that finally forces the nation to rethink its attitude
toward pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``A situation like this can energize people,'' said Lois
Epstein, an engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund and a
member of a federal advisory panel overseeing pipeline safety
regulations. ``This is a real-world example of what can happen when
you have deficient federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not the first time a pipeline accident has
killed people, nor is it the first time Congress has debated
pipeline safety in the wake of such an accident. And although
regulators say pipeline transportation is the safest way to move
oil and gas, there have been some spectacular failures in recent
years:
</P>
<P>
   _In San Juan, Puerto Rico, a propane gas pipe sprung a leak in
1996, causing a commercial building to explode. Thirty-three people
were killed, and at least 69 were injured
</P>
<P>
   _In Lively, Texas, a pipeline carrying liquid butane ruptured in
1996, sending a butane vapor cloud into a surrounding residential
area. Two residents trying to escape got into a truck, but turning
on the ignition sparked a fire that killed them.
</P>
<P>
   _In Edison, N.J., in 1994, a natural-gas pipeline ruptured,
causing a fire that leveled an eight-building apartment complex.
One person was killed, more than 100 were injured, and 1,500 left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board and the most prominent critic of the federal Office of
Pipeline Safety, plans to testify at Tuesday's hearing, urging
Congress not to wait for another accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a pipeline accident, there is a reaction,
but that's a poor way to do business,'' Hall said in an interview.
``We don't need to be learning this community by community. The
federal government needs to require that safe systems be in place
all over the country, and there has just been a failure by the
governmental agency that has responsibility in this area to do its
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is encouraged by the promises made by new
leadership at the federal Office of Pipeline Safety, but is
skeptical because of the agency's track record. There are currently
48 NTSB recommendations awaiting action by the Office of Pipeline
Safety, which is charged with regulating pipeline safety. In some
cases, the agency is moving toward following the recommendation,
while in other cases the agency is rejecting the advice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Office of Pipeline Safety has rejected the
NTSB's recommendation to require that pipeline operators inspect
pipelines for corrosion and other forms of damage at regular
intervals defined by the federal government. The recommendation was
made after two natural gas pipelines ruptured in Kentucky in 1985
and 1986, killing five people and injuring six.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety argues that requiring inspections
be conducted on a pre-set schedule does not make sense and says it
is preferable to allow pipeline companies to decide when to perform
inspections based on risk factors such as corrosion records, leak
history and pipeline location.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 explosion in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the NTSB
recommended that the Office of Pipeline Safety come up with a set
of employee qualification and training requirements and require
pipeline operators to test employees on safety procedures. The
Safety Board says that the Office of Pipeline Safety has failed to
heed that request.
</P>
<P>
   And the Office of Pipeline Safety has questioned the workability
of another proposal now on the NTSB's list of most-wanted safety
improvements: require the installation of excess flow valves that
would automatically shut off natural-gas distribution systems in
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is at a loss to understand why the Office of
Pipeline Safety is resistant to the NTSB's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been concerned about the culture that evidently has
grown up in that organization,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's
that they're funded by the industry rather than from general
taxpayer funds, or if there's a lack of leadership and emphasis on
safety from the individuals that are responsible, but I've spoken
about this consistently for years, and it's difficult. Most people
don't even know where pipelines are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety said the two agencies simply have
honest disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the Office of Pipeline Safety and the National
Transportation Safety Board are in agreement on key safety issues
but sometimes differ on the way to resolve those issues,'' Kelley
Coyner, a Transportation Department official overseeing pipeline
safety, wrote in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some pipeline safety advocates aren't optimistic that Bellingham
will have any effect on a Congress averse to regulations and
indebted to the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in February was dominated by industry executives;
the NTSB wasn't invited to speak, while at this week's hearing no
environmentalists will participate.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials are certain to resist major new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an accident like this, there is understandable
anguish ... and people look around and say, `What can we do?'''
said Benjamin Cooper, executive director of the Association of Oil
Pipelines. ``I'm sure we'll go through a period where people are
going to say you ought to have this or that gadget on your
pipeline. But we have to see if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for change say pipelines buried underground are simply
too obscure to catch the attention of the public, and therefore
Congress can duck the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a great state of denial in Congress,'' said Bob
Rackleff, a county commissioner in Florida who serves as the
president of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition. ``There is a
combination of ignorance and a tremendous influence of the oil
industry on Congress, particularly a Congress now led by
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas industry is the seventh-largest contributor to
federal campaigns, giving $6.4 million to federal candidates in
1997 and 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Of
those contributions, 76 percent went to Republicans, who now
control both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of oil companies having a
disproportionate impact on public policy in this country,'' said
Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson, who is now trying to put together
a group of elected officials from communities that have experienced
pipeline accidents to push for change.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman who is pushing for quick renewal of the pipeline
safety laws, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, received more than $100,000
in contributions from the oil and gas industry in 1997 and 1998,
making that his single largest source of campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Barton declined to be interviewed for this story, but in
February, before the Bellingham accident, he said Congress' job is
``to minimize those accidents to the extent that it is humanly
possible,'' but that ``the safety record is respectable.'' He made
it clear he is not a fan of passing new regulations in response to
every accident, saying ``responding to specific accidents by
creating inflexible `one-size fits all' mandates ... didn't
necessarily lead to improved safety, and in some instances may have
even diverted limited resources away from more promising safety
measures.''
</P>

FOES OF FLAT CAR TAX WARN OF MILLIONS LOST IN REVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ A ballot initiative to replace the state's
motor vehicle excise tax with a flat $30 fee would eliminate more
than $1 billion in revenue over the next two years, hurting police
and fire services, health programs, mass transit and highway
construction, according to several analyses.
</P>
<P>
   If voters approve Initiative 695, certified for the ballot last
week, a two-car family would save an average of nearly $300 in
annual license tab charges, according to the Governor's Office of
Financial Management. But state and local officials say they could
lose far more than that in critical public services.
</P>
<P>
   More that half the $2.1 billion collected by license fees every
two years goes to transportation programs, including the state
ferry system, while more than one-third goes to counties, cities
and local transit districts. Foes of I-695 warn that potential
effects include:
</P>
<P>
   _King County Metro bus riders might see higher fares, reduced
services or both. The state's largest transit system could lose
more than one-fourth of its budget, an amount that theoretically
would require the average fare to triple to $3.50 per ride.
</P>
<P>
   _The ferry system could lose nearly one-third of the money it
uses to maintain, operate and upgrade ferry service.
</P>
<P>
   _Road projects aimed at easing congestion could stall as
hundreds of millions of dollars are siphoned from the state's
highway construction program initiated by Referendum 49 and
authorized by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   _Local services, from police to parks, could be hardest hit in
rural counties and small cities, which rely most heavily on excise
tax distributions. Twenty percent of Des Moines' budget, for
example, is supported with these excise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult to provide the same level of
service we provide now,'' said Des Moines Assistant City Manager
Tony Piasecki.
</P>
<P>
   I-695 supporters, however, dismiss the gloomy predictions. ``If
we can't provide tax relief when we have a $1 billion surplus and a
thriving economy, then when can we?'' said Tim Eyman, the measure's
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   While the revenue losses appear serious, just as onerous is
another I-695 provision that would require voter approval to raise
taxes or fees, state and local officials say. That could force
costly elections on the most routine financial decisions, from
boosting library fines to raising rents on publicly owned
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   King County estimates it can cost about $800,000 to run a
special election. The state will spend about
</P>
<P>
   $3.5 million to pay for the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tax-cut package wrapped in a pretty bow,'' said Seattle
Mayor Paul Schell, an opponent. ``Once you open it, it looks like
chocolate chip cookies. But it's really cow chips.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as elected officials bemoan the effect of I-695, few
are stepping forward in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Many admit surprise at the strength of support for the proposal.
Sponsors submitted more than 500,000 signatures _ the
second-highest in state history _ to qualify for the November
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Ralph Munro last week certified nearly
400,000 signatures, more than twice the 179,000 needed. And early
polls have shown likely voters favoring the measure 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large number of signatures submitted has every politician
looking at it and wondering if it's a juggernaut,'' said Gary Lowe,
a spokesman for the Washington State Association of Counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of polling trying to detect any weak spots,''
Lowe said. ``And from that, they're trying to determine whether
opposition has a chance, or if it's just a matter of getting beat
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyman, the I-695 sponsor, said political leaders have no one but
themselves to blame for their dilemma. They have failed to cut
taxes on their own initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If politicians had one ounce of compassion for the taxpayer,
I-695 would not be necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of I-695 also say the measure won't affect transit,
since it allows voters to opt for local excise taxes to finance
mass transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties will continue
to pay for their Regional Transit Authority, I-695 supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Eyman stressed, the projected revenue loss from I-695
amounts to less than 5 percent of the state budget. The huge
reserve fund would give officials at least two years to design more
efficient ways to deliver services, and the provision requiring
voter approval of tax increases would help ensure that they did,
Eyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials could turn to taxpayers only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plead guilty to making it tougher to raise taxes,'' Eyman
said. Washington is one of about 20 states with a motor vehicle
excise tax. Washington drivers pay a tax of 2.2 percent of the
value of the cars, motorcycles and recreational vehicles, as well
as a $23.75 fee to renew registration.
</P>
<P>
   The state uses the money primarily to pay for transportation
programs, but also distributes hundreds of millions of dollars to
local public safety, criminal justice, transit and public health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   I-695 would replace the tax and licensing fees with an annual
$30 fee, regardless of the vehicle's value.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a 1998 Jaguar convertible, for example, would save
at least $1,400, while the owner of a '98 Honda Accord would save
about $300 under the proposal, according to the Department of
Licensing.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a 1992 Toyota Corolla would save less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to examples like this to portray the proposal as
another tax break for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who can afford a Mercedes are going to be paying the
same as those with a 3-year-old pickup,'' said Seattle's Schell.
``This will help my good friend Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates might realize bigger savings, Eyman said, but the extra
money will mean a lot more to that working family with the aging
pickup. And as working families spend that money, Eyman said, it
will generate more economic activity, more jobs and more taxes to
pay for services.
</P>
<P>
   Eyman said he expects the state's most powerful interests to
mount an aggressive campaign to stop I-695.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a coalition of big government, big business, big labor
and the press against us,'' he said. ``These groups have complete
control of Olympia, but not the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Sid Snyder, D-Long Beach, said he, too,
doubts I-695 will go unchallenged much longer. ``There will be
opposition, but we don't know if it will be enough,'' he said.

DELEGATION STEPS UP INTEREST IN INDUSTRY AFTER ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time Congress debated pipeline safety
issues, in 1996, not a single lawmaker from Washington state
entered the fray.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of last month's deadly explosion in Bellingham,
Wash., Washington state lawmakers are rushing to familiarize
themselves with the arcane issues of pipeline regulation and come
up with ways to prevent another accident.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, members of the delegation are not offering
specific proposals, but say they want to ask questions and see what
the National Transportation Safety Board has to say about what
caused the Bellingham explosion. And Gov. Gary Locke, who activists
hoped would push for congressional action, is also taking a go-slow
approach, waiting for a committee to advise him on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the delegation probably have some time. Although
the House has already begun debating renewal of the nation's
pipeline safety laws, the Senate doesn't plan to take up the issue
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the delegation are poised to play a significant
role in the debate over pipeline safety over the next year: Sen.
Slade Gorton, Rep. Brian Baird and Rep. Jack Metcalf because they
sit on committees with jurisdiction over pipeline safety, and Sen.
Patty Murray because she is forcing herself into the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a Democrat, has been the quickest to respond to the
accident, visiting Bellingham, a city about 80 miles north of
Seattle, talking regularly to the mayor there, and summoning
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to her office to inform him
that she will be seeking changes in the way his department works to
protect public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said of the nation's pipeline safety laws, ``it is clear
they have not lived up to what they were supposed to do.'' She has
criticized the Office of Pipeline Safety for failing to follow
through on required changes, and said, ``I have heard a lot of
complaints from officials in Bellingham who feel that the Office of
Pipeline Safety is in bed with the (oil and gas) industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf, a Republican whose district includes Bellingham, is
becoming increasingly vocal. Metcalf is the lone Republican from
Washington state who voted against loosening pipeline industry
regulations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, liberated from any political concerns because he is not
seeking re-election, Metcalf is promising to use the final months
of his long career in public office to fight for pipeline safety.
Metcalf plans to testify at tomorrow's hearing, and promises to
grill federal pipeline safety officials about why they haven't
heeded previous NTSB recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Murray, Metcalf says he isn't yet sure what changes he
would make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now looking very carefully to see whether it (the
Bellingham explosion) was the fault of the rules, or whether
somebody made a mistake carrying out the rules,'' he said. ``I am
deeply concerned, and want to be prepared to take an active role if
changes are needed. But at this point we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, a Democrat who represents southwest Washington, says he
is worried that Congress is not willing to impose tough new
regulations on pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last review of this process (in 1996) probably didn't
strengthen the regulations at all,'' he said. ``The Republican
Party tends to always denounce any government regulation, yet
here's a case where the regulatory process failed, and previous
attempts to weaken the regulations are being shown to have their
own hazard,'' he said. ``We inspect restaurants for food safety,
trucks for trucking safety, airplanes for airplane safety.
Pipelines obviously pose a hazard, and there's no reason we
shouldn't inspect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, arguably the most powerful member of the state's
congressional delegation, could have a loud voice in the debate
because he is one of the senior members of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and his actions are certain to be closely watched in a
year when he is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will undoubtedly pay a great deal more attention to it than
I would have had it been a normal reauthorization with no apparent
impact on the state of Washington,'' Gorton said. But Gorton said
he is waiting for the NTSB analysis of what went wrong at
Bellingham before deciding how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very real and extremely disturbing and dangerous failure in
this case may mean a failure in the law and it may mean a failure
in the enforcement of the law, and we don't know the answer to that
yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have been hoping Locke, a Democrat, will use
his influence with the Clinton administration and the state's
congressional delegation to push for change. But Locke is taking a
more deliberative approach, waiting, perhaps until the end of this
year, until a task force he appointed makes recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials from Washington state are likely to come under
increasing pressure from local activists to do something about
pipeline safety. Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson is on a crusade to
make sure what happened to his community doesn't happen again, and
a local group, SAFE Bellingham, has already sprung up to push for
pipeline safety reform. Meanwhile, WashPIRG and the Cascade
Columbia Alliance, two organizations that have been battling a
now-withdrawn proposal from Olympic Pipe Line to build a
cross-Cascades pipeline, promise to redirect their energies toward
fighting for pipeline safety changes.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists say they are hoping Locke will wind up
leading the charge to persuade members of Congress to change the
laws.
</P>
<P>
   David Bricklin, the environmental attorney now representing the
city of Bellingham, says Locke could forge an alliance with the
governors of other states that have suffered damage from pipeline
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the governors of other states that have borne the brunt
of these catastrophes are in a good position to make their voices
heard,'' Bricklin said. ``We don't know if it (the Bellingham
explosion) was a failure of regulations or a failure of a company
to follow regulations, but we do know that the regulations aren't
sufficient. Even if this accident was not the result of flawed
regulations, there's certainly room for improvement.''

`HAUNTING' LEADS BOX OFFICE WITH $33 MILLION TAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Horror-hungry moviegoers gave ``The Haunting''
possession of the top spot at the nation's multiplexes with an
impressive $33 million at 2,808 theaters during a robust
Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The above-expectations performance of ``The Haunting''
underscored the sizzling pace of summer patronage with overall
ticket sales hitting near the neighborhood of $132.8 million, the
record for a nonholiday weekend set during June 25-27.
</P>
<P>
   All top 10 films took in at least $4 million and the weekend's
total included an astounding $1.5 million at 31 theaters for the
second weekend of ``The Blair Witch Project'' as the
horror-documentary continued to draw capacity crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horror genre is alive and well,'' said industry tracker
Arthur Rockwell. ``You can't expect youth comedies to keep getting
all the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has been phenomenal,'' said Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source forecasting service, noting that hit
films are drawing well from outside their target audiences. ``We
saw a lot of cross-over business for `The Haunting' from date
crowds and kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting,'' made for a reported $80 million and based on
Shirley Jackson's novel ``The Haunting of Hill House,'' benefited
from an extensive marketing campaign by DreamWorks SKG and the
drawing power of stars Catherine Zeta-Jones and Liam Neeson. ``This
is an old-fashioned fun horror movie with big stars,'' said studio
distribution chief Jim Tharp. ``It's a great formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of family comedy ``Inspector Gadget,'' with
Matthew Broderick as a bumbling mechanical detective, posted solid
numbers in second with $22 million at 2,814 theaters following a
massive promotional push. The studio, which has seen ``Tarzan'' go
past $152 million in six weeks, will likely dominate the family
segment through the late summer with ``Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to shout pretty loud to be noticed amid all this
competition,'' said Disney distribution chief Chuck Viane, who
noted that 42 percent of the audience was between ages 2 and 11.
Bucksbaum predicted both ``The Haunting'' and ``Inspector Gadget''
could top $100 million by the end of their runs.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``American Pie'' led the rest of
the pack with $10.3 million at 2,544 sites as the comedy lost only
26 percent of its audience from the previous weekend. It edged
sexual drama ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' which plunged 54 percent from its
opening to finish with $9.9 million at 2,483 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the drop for ``Eyes,'' which has topped $40
million in 10 days, was not a surprise because of its sensitive
subject matter. ``The hype got it a good opening but this is not a
movie people were rushing to see once the initial excitement
passed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fourth weekend of ``Big Daddy'' continued to post solid
grosses in fifth with $6.3 million at 2,904 theaters, pulling its
total past $146 million. 20th Century Fox's second weekend of
``Lake Placid'' followed with $5.6 million at 2,101 sites, edging
Warner's fourth weekend of ``Wild Wild West'' with $5.3 million at
3,045 screens. ``West'' now has $104.1 million after 26 days,
making it the 191st film to crack the $100 million mark, but it
remains short of the blockbuster status many had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's second weekend of ``The Wood'' continued to perform
respectably in eighth with $4.9 million at 1,191 theaters, topping
Disney's sixth weekend of ``Tarzan'' with $4.8 million at 2,281
locations and Fox's 10th weekend of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The
Phantom Menace'' with $4.2 million at 1,614 theaters to pull its
overall total to $402.7 million. On Saturday, ``Phantom Menace''
passed ``E.T. _ The Extraterrestrial'' at $399.8 million for the
No. 3 domestic spot and it now only trails ``Titanic'' at $600.8
million and ``Star Wars'' at $460.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's sixth weekend of ``The General's Daughter'' followed
in 11th with $3.9 million at 1,668 theaters, edging New Line's
opening of beauty-pageant comedy ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' with a
modest $3.8 million at 1,207 sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' will face serious competition next weekend as
Artisan expands ``The Blair Witch Project'' into at least 700
theaters and two major entries open _ Warner's ``Deep Blue Sea,'' a
tale of genetically engineered sharks on a rampage, and Paramount's
``Runaway Bride,'' a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Richard
Gere. Bucksbaum said ``Deep Blue Sea,'' which will open Wednesday,
and ``Bride,'' which will debut Friday, should top $20 million each
during the weekend and noted that Artisan recently launched a TV
campaign for ``Blair Witch,'' which had received a massive buzz
previously on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to the movies a lot these days,'' he added.
Summer moviegoing is up more than 20 percent over the 1998 summer,
which set a record for the Memorial Day-Labor Day period with $2.58
billion.

Corrects third paragraph to show Ryan credited as Astro because of
more years of service with them, not more wins
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The face in bronze peers at you from under a
Texas Rangers cap, but in the Hall of Fame ledgers Nolan Ryan is
registered as a member of the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   This may be small consolation for Astros fans, who waited most
of their lives for The Man With The Supersonic Arm, then lost him
for the last and sweetest five years of his career. But here at
baseball's original Field of Dreams, you take what you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Hall's criteria, Ryan is assigned to Houston because
he played nine seasons with the Astros, one more than with the
Angels. The Mets hardly count, inasmuch as Nolan spent four unhappy
seasons there and had one winning record. He won six and lost three
in 1969, the year the Mets won the World Series, known in baseball
lore as The Miracle of Flushing Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly Nolan and his wife, the lovely Ruth, felt disoriented
by the city's parking rules, and how the subways worked, and trying
to buy groceries on a beginner's salary.
</P>
<P>
   So Nolan becomes the first official Houston player designated as
a Hall-of-Famer, just as George Brett and Robin Yount are the first
players to qualify from the Kansas City Royals and the Milwaukee
Brewers. Of course, they never played for any other teams, which
means they fall well short of Ryan in the category of life
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   For trivia fans, the Astros can claim five other Hall-of-Famers
who passed through Houston's doors on their way to or from
somewhere else. That would be Joe Morgan, Robin Roberts, Nellie
Fox, Don Sutton and the stormy manager, Leo (The Lip) Durocher.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of the Ryan Express, sharing seems to be the
fair and generous thing to do, and Houston is hardly in a position
to decline this discount ticket to Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   For those who made the pilgrimage over the weekend, the Hall of
Fame lived up to its billing as a place where moments become
memories, and memories come to life.
</P>
<P>
   During one of his several interviews, Ryan recalled how he was
sent by the Mets to the Instructional League for rookies the winter
after he had signed with the team for what amounted to a sliced ham
sandwich. He played on a team managed by Eddie Stanky, a firebrand
of a second baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers and other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, in his first time at bat, Ryan hit an
inside-the-park home run after two were out. The next hitter swung
on the first pitch and popped up, and Nolan, still huffing and
puffing, headed back to the mound. He walked the first batter on
four pitches and here came Stanky, getting in his face and asking
for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He motioned to the right fence, and said, ``I want you to run
from one end of that fence to the other, all night, until you can't
run anymore. And you won't ever pitch for me again, unless you get
yourself in shape. Remember that, if you want to stay in this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan complied, although not without some regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad at the guy who swung at the first pitch,'' he said.
``He hung me out to dry. But I got in shape, and I never forgot
what Stanky told me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 19 years old, and this was just a bar of the music that
made the man. He is capable of mischief and humor and even a kind
of down-home eloquence, but Nolan Ryan doesn't put on airs. So when
his Hall of Fame classmates talked about their disbelief and the
squirrels running around in their stomachs, the always focused Ryan
talked about the reasons he lasted 27 years as a major-league
pitcher with a lethal fastball.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Houston in November 1979, after the Angels
decided there was not much left in his gas tank, he discovered that
the team had a strength coach, Gene Coleman, who believed in
pumping iron and special diets. When he moved on to Arlington, he
found on the premises an innovative pitching coach named Tom House.
</P>
<P>
   One of House's training techniques involved throwing a football,
which Nolan enjoyed for the few minutes he did it. But most
baseball purists hated the idea, mainly because it seemed to
endorse another sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Gene Coleman and Tom House,'' says Ryan, ``I learned a
lot about proper nutrition, exercise and getting enough rest. They
gave me a much higher awareness of stress and how I needed to
respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But tangible things are not always what fans want to hear. They
want a little candy for the soul and Nolan gave them some.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I retired, trust me,'' he said, ``the entire Ryan family
suffered withdrawal pains. I always thought there would be life
after baseball, so I designed my life to include other interests.
But I didn't realize the grip the game had on me. It took two years
for me to get over the fact that I was no longer a player.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an eternal truth: you grip the ball, the ball grips you.
Have a wonderful rest of your life, Nolan. The Ryans have earned
it.

RUSSIAN PREMIER TOURS BOEING, MICROSOFT VISIT IS NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin touched down at Paine
Field in Everett, Wash., on Sunday from Vladivostok in a bid to
seek U.S. aid for Russian farms and airlines and to discuss a steel
trade dispute. His first official visit to the United States
started at The Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped off his four-engine Ilushin-62M to a red carpet
greeting that included a crowd of men in black suits and two small
girls offering flowers. Press photographers, cordoned off a hundred
feet away, craned their necks. ``Which one is Stepashin?'' the
Americans asked each other. They knew Yeltsin, the president, but
not one seemed to know Russia's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Half the media entourage was Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin was greeted by Washington Secretary of State Ralph
Munro, Boeing President Harry Stonecipher and a crowd of other
political and business leaders. All were then whisked away in black
limousines and vans, accompanied by Seattle police cars, Boeing
security cars and a Medic One van, just in case. Security was
tight: The broadcast media were required to place their cameras on
the tarmac to be sniffed by a police dog.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin and his group toured the Boeing plant, the VIPs in
golf carts and the not-so-VIPs on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Primorsky province, Yevgeny Nazdratenko, rode in
the cart driven by Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group. When Mulally stepped out, Nazdratenko asked if he
could drive. Sure, Mulally said, and Nazdratenko drove the rest of
the tour, looking as if he was happy to be in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko is the subject of complaints by foreign investors
who claim that he and his regional government have attempted
through extralegal means to appropriate their assets. At one point
Sunday, when he was near the media, he was asked about his alleged
attempt to commandeer stock in Fesco, the Vladivostok-based
shipping company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fesco?'' he said. He laughed and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Nazdratenko, other top Russians in Stepashin's group
included Yuri Ushakov, the Russian ambassador; Yuri Koptev, head of
the Russian Federation Space Agency; and Valery Okulov, general
director of Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians walked through a gleaming new 767 due for delivery
next month to the Russian airline Aeroflot. Viktor Anoshkin,
spokesman for Boeing's office in Moscow, said there are 42 Boeing
planes in the former Soviet Union and 19 in Russia _ all of the 19
leased. This one, and another 767 due in October, will be leased as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher went to a podium and spoke briefly of cooperation
and a bright future with Russia. Boeing has more than $1 billion in
business with Russia: the International Space Station, with a
module built by the Russians under Boeing's management; Sea Launch,
the venture to orbit satellites from a floating launch pad using
Russian rocket engines; and Russian titanium, used in the Boeing
777's landing gear and seat tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin came forward, and finally, the American correspondents
knew who he was. He's 47, has reddish-brown hair cropped close, and
a serious manner.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's background during the Soviet era was in law and the
state security services. From 1993 to 1995 he was deputy director,
then director of the Russian Counterintelligence Service; in 1995
he was named chief of Russian defense and security; in 1996 he led
the commission to settle the crisis in the Chechen Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin is a Yeltsin loyalist, and his appointment is said by
Russians to be a move for stability during the next election, when
Russia will pick Yeltsin's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   At the brief news conference (four questions), Stepashin was
asked about the recent killings in Kosovo. He said he would talk
about it in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russian relations fell to their lowest point in the
post-Cold War era during NATO's airstrikes on Yugoslavia. Russia
fiercely opposed the bombings but now has peacekeeping troops
serving alongside NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still hard work to do to ... restore confidence
undermined by NATO's military action against Yugoslavia,''
Stepashin told reporters in the Far Eastern port city of
Vladivostok before leaving Sunday, according to Russian news
agencies. ``We need to get back to serious dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian premier also is seeking to boost U.S. investment in
his country's struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin is scheduled to meet with representatives of Microsoft
Corp. before leaving the Puget Sound area Monday for Washington,
D.C., where he will meet with his host, Vice President Al Gore, and
with President Clinton and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Federal Aviation Service is appealing for $1 billion in
loans guaranteed by the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build 20
Il-96M/T planes for Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot, the
Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian delegation is to talk with U.S. farm machine
manufacturers John Deere and Co. and Case Corp. about proposed
loans for $1 billion worth of agriculture equipment, Interfax
reported. Stepashin is not planning to ask for more food aid, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing Richard Fritz, a U.S.
Agriculture Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin said Sunday he would voice Russian concerns about a
trade agreement reached earlier this month sharply limiting Russian
steel exports to the United States, which had accused Russia of
``dumping'' steel at below manufacturing cost.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said its prices are fair and warned the deal will
seriously hurt its steel industry, which makes up 7 percent of
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's talks will also focus on a proposed loan from the
International Monetary Fund, prospects for Russian ratification of
the START II arms control treaty, and U.S. concerns about the
spread of Russian nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin said Sunday that President Boris Yeltsin had
instructed the Defense and Foreign ministries to work on the
long-stalled START-2 nuclear arms reduction treaty, as well as
START-3 and the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, before his meeting
with Clinton, ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Clinton agreed to modifications in the ABM treaty
three years ago, but the U.S. administration has said it would not
submit the modifications to the U.S. Senate until the Russian
parliament ratifies START-2.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Boeing officials, Stepashin on Sunday night
went on to a dinner at the Westin Hotel hosted by Gov. Gary Locke,
and including Sens. Slade Gorton and Patty Murray, and James
Collins, the U.S. ambassador to Russia.

BELLINGHAM, WASH., FIRE HAS BECOME RALLYING CRY FOR PIPELINE
CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than two months before two boys and a teenager
were killed when gasoline from a ruptured pipeline exploded in
Bellingham, the House Commerce Committee voted 40-0 against making
major changes to the nation's pipeline-safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came at a time when friends of the oil and gas industry
were pushing for a quick renewal of the pipeline-safety
legislation, which is scheduled to expire in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the deadly explosion and fire of June 10 has changed all
that.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been a routine hearing on Tuesday on the same
measure before the House Transportation Committee will be dominated
by the grim facts of Bellingham, of three lives that the
pipeline-safety laws failed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of environmental and safety advocates, as well
as elected officials from states that have suffered pipeline
accidents, promise to do everything they can to make Bellingham the
accident that finally forces the nation to rethink its attitude
toward pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``A situation like this can energize people,'' said Lois
Epstein, an engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund and a
member of a federal advisory panel overseeing pipeline safety
regulations. ``This is a real-world example of what can happen when
you have deficient federal standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not the first time a pipeline accident has
killed people, nor is it the first time Congress has debated
pipeline safety in the wake of such an accident. And although
regulators say pipeline transportation is the safest way to move
oil and gas, there have been some spectacular failures in recent
years:
</P>
<P>
   _In San Juan, Puerto Rico, a propane gas pipe sprung a leak in
1996, causing a commercial building to explode. Thirty-three people
were killed, and at least 69 were injured
</P>
<P>
   _In Lively, Texas, a pipeline carrying liquid butane ruptured in
1996, sending a butane vapor cloud into a surrounding residential
area. Two residents trying to escape got into a truck, but turning
on the ignition sparked a fire that killed them.
</P>
<P>
   _In Edison, N.J., in 1994, a natural-gas pipeline ruptured,
causing a fire that leveled an eight-building apartment complex.
One person was killed, more than 100 were injured, and 1,500 left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board and the most prominent critic of the federal Office of
Pipeline Safety, plans to testify at Tuesday's hearing, urging
Congress not to wait for another accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a pipeline accident, there is a reaction,
but that's a poor way to do business,'' Hall said in an interview.
``We don't need to be learning this community by community. The
federal government needs to require that safe systems be in place
all over the country, and there has just been a failure by the
governmental agency that has responsibility in this area to do its
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is encouraged by the promises made by new
leadership at the federal Office of Pipeline Safety, but is
skeptical because of the agency's track record. There are currently
48 NTSB recommendations awaiting action by the Office of Pipeline
Safety, which is charged with regulating pipeline safety. In some
cases, the agency is moving toward following the recommendation,
while in other cases the agency is rejecting the advice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Office of Pipeline Safety has rejected the
NTSB's recommendation to require that pipeline operators inspect
pipelines for corrosion and other forms of damage at regular
intervals defined by the federal government. The recommendation was
made after two natural gas pipelines ruptured in Kentucky in 1985
and 1986, killing five people and injuring six.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety argues that requiring inspections
be conducted on a pre-set schedule does not make sense and says it
is preferable to allow pipeline companies to decide when to perform
inspections based on risk factors such as corrosion records, leak
history and pipeline location.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 explosion in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the NTSB
recommended that the Office of Pipeline Safety come up with a set
of employee qualification and training requirements and require
pipeline operators to test employees on safety procedures. The
Safety Board says that the Office of Pipeline Safety has failed to
heed that request.
</P>
<P>
   And the Office of Pipeline Safety has questioned the workability
of another proposal now on the NTSB's list of most-wanted safety
improvements: require the installation of excess flow valves that
would automatically shut off natural-gas distribution systems in
residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he is at a loss to understand why the Office of
Pipeline Safety is resistant to the NTSB's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been concerned about the culture that evidently has
grown up in that organization,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's
that they're funded by the industry rather than from general
taxpayer funds, or if there's a lack of leadership and emphasis on
safety from the individuals that are responsible, but I've spoken
about this consistently for years, and it's difficult. Most people
don't even know where pipelines are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Pipeline Safety said the two agencies simply have
honest disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the Office of Pipeline Safety and the National
Transportation Safety Board are in agreement on key safety issues
but sometimes differ on the way to resolve those issues,'' Kelley
Coyner, a Transportation Department official overseeing pipeline
safety, wrote in a letter to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some pipeline safety advocates aren't optimistic that Bellingham
will have any effect on a Congress averse to regulations and
indebted to the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in February was dominated by industry executives;
the NTSB wasn't invited to speak, while at this week's hearing no
environmentalists will participate.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials are certain to resist major new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an accident like this, there is understandable
anguish ... and people look around and say, `What can we do?'''
said Benjamin Cooper, executive director of the Association of Oil
Pipelines. ``I'm sure we'll go through a period where people are
going to say you ought to have this or that gadget on your
pipeline. But we have to see if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for change say pipelines buried underground are simply
too obscure to catch the attention of the public, and therefore
Congress can duck the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a great state of denial in Congress,'' said Bob
Rackleff, a county commissioner in Florida who serves as the
president of the National Pipeline Reform Coalition. ``There is a
combination of ignorance and a tremendous influence of the oil
industry on Congress, particularly a Congress now led by
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas industry is the seventh-largest contributor to
federal campaigns, giving $6.4 million to federal candidates in
1997 and 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Of
those contributions, 76 percent went to Republicans, who now
control both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of oil companies having a
disproportionate impact on public policy in this country,'' said
Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson, who is now trying to put together
a group of elected officials from communities that have experienced
pipeline accidents to push for change.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman who is pushing for quick renewal of the pipeline
safety laws, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, received more than $100,000
in contributions from the oil and gas industry in 1997 and 1998,
making that his single largest source of campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Barton declined to be interviewed for this story, but in
February, before the Bellingham accident, he said Congress' job is
``to minimize those accidents to the extent that it is humanly
possible,'' but that ``the safety record is respectable.'' He made
it clear he is not a fan of passing new regulations in response to
every accident, saying ``responding to specific accidents by
creating inflexible `one-size fits all' mandates ... didn't
necessarily lead to improved safety, and in some instances may have
even diverted limited resources away from more promising safety
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern congressional oversight of the nation's 2 million miles
of underground pipelines dates back to 1968, when Congress passed
the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, and 1979, when Congress passed
the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act. The laws, which
periodically expire and must be renewed, cover pipeline design,
construction, operation and maintenance, emergency procedures,
pipeline testing and inspections, corrosion control and company
reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Congress often imposed new regulations in
response to pipeline accidents. In 1992, as a result of accidents
in Kansas, a Democrat-controlled Congress required new restrictions
on customer-owned service lines, and as a result of an accident in
New York Harbor, required new rules on low-pressure hazardous
liquid pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But when Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, they were
determined to try a different approach. Committed to reducing the
amount of government regulations on industry, the Republicans
argued that public safety would be best protected if pipeline
companies were allowed to decide how best to ensure against
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed legislation requiring the Department of
Transportation to conduct cost-benefit analyses before issuing new
rules, making it more cumbersome to enact regulations. And Congress
permitted tests of risk management theory, in which some pipeline
companies are allowed to propose their own methods of reducing
risk, rather than following every federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure unanimously, and the House,
despite some angry rhetoric, voted 276-125 in favor. President
Clinton, who had succeeded in getting Congress to water down the
risk-management provisions, signed the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipelines remain our safest form of transportation,'' House
Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said in 1996.
``More people annually die from falling objects, excessive heat,
being struck by lightning and from hornet, wasp and bee stings than
from pipeline accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 measure did include some new safety provisions.
Congress encouraged states to adopt ``one-call'' systems, in which
excavators can call one phone number to determine whether there is
anything dangerous underground in the area where they plan to dig.
Industry officials and regulators say accidents by excavators are
the leading cause of pipeline accidents.
</P>
<P>
   This year, deciding that too little time has elapsed since 1996
to judge the success or failure of new safety measures, the House
Commerce Committee proposed reauthorizing the pipeline laws for
just two more years. In the meantime, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, has requested a General
Accounting Office study of how well the Office of Pipeline Safety
does its job.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Committee did agree to support two safety changes
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., succeeded in adding a provision that
would require the Office of Pipeline Safety to explain how it
responded to each recommendation from the National Transportation
Safety Board. And Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., inserted language
urging the Office of Pipeline Safety to complete a study on
remotely controlled shut-off valves, which Pallone believes could
have helped prevent the Edison tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But no lawmakers have endorsed all the suggestions of
environmentalists, who want to allow states to pass tougher
pipeline regulations than the federal government, and who want to
make it easier for citizens to sue pipeline companies. There is no
support for major changes from state or federal regulators, and the
pipeline industry is resisting the proposals.

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Everyone had come to see George Brett cry.
It was Brettstock Sunday in Cooperstown, a festival of George, an
open field crowded with Royals caps and powder blue jerseys and
Brett streamers and Gates T-shirts and Buck O'Neil. The weather was
Midwestern humid. The sun burned. It was a beautiful day to see
George Brett cry.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we knew he would cry. We all knew. This is a love affair,
this crazy connection between Kansas City and George Brett. He
knows Kansas City, its rhythms, its quirks, its wonders, its
insecurities. ``It's the place where I met my wife and our three
children were born,'' he would say on Sunday. ``And to this day I'm
so proud to call Kansas City home.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just as surely, everyone in Kansas City knows him. Seven
persons were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday, and
each one had his own splendid history, his own fans, his own
family, his own cheering section.
</P>
<P>
   Only George Brett heard an entire city cheering, though. Kansas
City people wandered everywhere in Cooperstown through the weekend,
a barrage of friendly folks wandering the city streets,
window-shopping, asking in those wonderful Missouri flat tones,
``OK, how much for the Baseball Beanie Baby?''
</P>
<P>
   It was eerie. Going to Cooperstown always feels a bit like going
back in time anyway. The houses are quaint, the soda shop packed,
the traffic dull; this place is a ``Happy Days'' rerun. This
weekend, though, there were all these Royals fans wandering about,
wearing old George Brett jerseys, talking about Goose Gossage and
the World Series and such things, and it felt like 1980 in Kansas
City, that hot summer when Royals Stadium overflowed, and the
Royals went to the World Series, and Brett hit like no baseball
player had for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the Royals fans,'' Jamie Quirk, Brett's old
teammate and best friend, said Sunday. ``It's unbelievable. It's
like going back in a time machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett had to wait two and a half hours before giving his speech.
He had dreaded giving the speech anyway, but the wait was almost
more than he could handle. The sweaty afternoon had been filled
with rich moments and bizarre ones. Robin Yount spoke sweetly about
living in a dream. Texas Gov. George W. Bush twice was asked to
stand up and take a bow. Nolan Ryan's speech sounded like a laundry
list of ``thank-yous.'' Orlando Cepeda spoke tenderly about Puerto
Rico. A man dressed in an old-time baseball uniform performed
``Casey at the Bat,'' with a little too much gusto.
</P>
<P>
   And all along, Brett fidgeted, he crossed and uncrossed his
legs, he fanned himself, he whispered to the person next to him.
``It was unbearable up there,'' he would say, and in the open
field, far from the stage, thousands of Kansas City fans baked in
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, George Brett walked to the lectern. And everybody
stood. And everybody cheered wildly. George Brett looked relieved.
None of the other inductees had cried. He started to speak.
</P>
<P>
   And right away, you could see it was different. You could hear
it was different. The others had spoken prepared words, they said
things they had practiced over and over a hundred times. Brett
spoke fresh words. He spoke heartfelt words. He talked about how he
despised the New York Yankees and how his old manager Whitey Herzog
made him eat at least one home-cooked meal a summer. He talked
about how Charley Lau made him a great hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about friends and loved ones and the players he faced
and the teammates he admired and, oh yeah, three minutes into the
thing you knew it was only a matter of time before he broke up.
</P>
<P>
   He did. He looked at Jamie Quirk. Their eyes did not meet,
because Quirk was wearing sunglasses _ ``I didn't want him to see
me crying,'' Quirk would say _ but it did not matter. Brett had to
stop. He had to cry. A moment later, he talked about his brothers,
looked at all three of them _ John, Ken, Bobby _ and that sent him
sobbing. He heaved and pushed through the rest of the speech, warm
words about his mother and father and the town he adores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you made this trip, and I really appreciate that,'' he
said. ``I know Cooperstown is a long way from Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too far.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, George Brett was exhausted. He stopped. The speech was
not exactly over. He left four cards of his speech up there on the
lectern. But he could not go on. The Kansas City people roared, and
Brett waved, and they waved back, and he waved again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Brett would say as he wandered off. ``It's time
to party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, a huge rain dumped on Cooperstown, and people in
Kansas City hats and Royals shirts gathered under awnings and
ducked into stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it rains in Kansas City,'' one of them said, and
he held out his hand to feel it pour down. ``Yep, exactly like
Kansas City.''

BRETT DELIVERS EMOTIONAL WINNER OF A SPEECH AT COOPERSTOWN

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ George Brett has always had a flair for the
dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only fitting that, on the day he was catapulted into
baseball immortality, Brett hit one out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the best speech up there,'' said Eva Piercey, from
Overland Park. ``It was so heartwarming. I was crying like a
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tears were inspired by his. Brett wept several times in a
speech that was emotional and poignant, heartwarming and amusing.
He thanked a host of names familiar to Kansas City fans: Dick
Howser, Hal McRae, Whitey Herzog, Charley Lau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much to be thankful for, and the people of Kansas
City have made it possible for me,'' Brett said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, whose 21-year career ended in 1993, on Sunday was
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame before a record
crowd of 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   He had been sweating through a steamy Sunday afternoon, fanning
himself with the official ``Induction Ceremony'' program as the
bright sun penetrated his pinstriped suit. Speaking last, he was
scrunched in a folding chair, wedged between fellow inductee Nolan
Ryan and baseball commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, Robin Yount and Orlando Cepeda set the tone with composed
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brett broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what made him such a great player _ that emotion, that
passion,'' said John Wathan, a former Brett teammate and manager
who was in Cooperstown for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The whole afternoon seemed to build up toward a Brett grand
finale. Long before the ceremony even began, Brett fans were fed a
steady stream of Brett clips and sound bytes. The song Kansas City
blared from the system's mammoth speaker system.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Kansas City crowd heard the words they had been
waiting for: ``George,'' Selig boomed into the microphone,
``Welcome to Cooperstown.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett stood on the podium and peered out at the crowd, at the
scads of Royals' fans who made the pilgrimage to Cooperstown and
now held signs that hollered ``Brett for president!'' He looked at
his wife and three sons sitting in the front row, at the ESPN
cameras staring holes right through him.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him was the plaque bearing his likeness, the one that
will hang in Cooperstown's hallowed halls. Surrounding him were
some of the greatest players in the history of the game, guys like
Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   The sweat was beading up on his forehead, the knot churning a
hole in his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today concludes a long journey that has taken me from Southern
California throughout America,'' Brett said, ``and I very honestly
stand humbly before you today in Cooperstown.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotions started to flow when, almost 10 minutes into the
speech, Brett tried to express gratitude toward good friend Jamie
Quirk, a former teammate and now a coach for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Brett could muster the strength only to point and whisper,
softly, ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the thrill of a lifetime,'' Quirk said after the
speech. ``It was amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't have to say anything at all. I already knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett talked about his mother, Ethel, about his father, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   And, when he addressed his three older brothers, he nearly lost
it.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Brett recovered, of course, and even shrewdly got out of
the jam by joking to his brothers that, ``Right now, I wish it was
one of you'' standing on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we talk and that we're a real close
family,'' said Bobby Brett, one of the Brett brothers and George's
business manager. ``We're not the kind of family that has to keep
reminding each other, `Oh, you're great.' That's just understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you start talking about your father and your family,
it's tough to keep it together. That was genuine. It was real.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett even stole a page from ``Jerry Maguire'' fame before it
was over, thanking wife Leslie for making his life more enjoyable
and reminding her that, ``You had me from hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett addressed his three sons, the scout who first signed him,
former owners Ewing and Muriel Kauffman.
</P>
<P>
   And he saved one of his final expressions of gratitude for the
Kansas City fans. Looking earnestly into a camera, he even
addressed the throng that eventually watched the speech at Kauffman
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first arrived in Kansas City in 1973, you welcomed me
into your beautiful city and into your homes,'' Brett said. ``It's
the place where I met my wife and our three children were born, and
to this day I'm so proud to call KC home.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, and Brett had delivered a speech that stopped
just short of 18 minutes long, the crowd roared its applause with a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly what I thought it would be _ from the heart,''
said Mark Kessel, who lives in Kansas City. ``Well worth the
trip.''

   OSCEOLA, Iowa _ Nine persons.
</P>
<P>
   For GOP presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander, the crowd at this
stop will be no larger than the six men and the three women at the
Quilt Patch Family Restaurant here on a sultry summer afternoon.
That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a former Tennessee governor, has driven 30 miles for
this visit in his borrowed Winnebago, which is nicknamed
``Exceeding Expectations.'' Earlier he had been in Lamoni, four
miles from the Missouri border. Crowd size: 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep a good sense of humor and keep my patience and
hope that sooner or later, my qualifications will come to the
front,'' says Alexander, who has really never stopped campaigning
here since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the fable of the tortoise and the hare, and I know who
won.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone knows the identity of the hare: Gov. George W.
Bush, the Texas tornado sucking away money, endorsements and media
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has lots of company in the tortoise ranks _ Elizabeth
Dole, Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan and Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher who can match
Bush's spending, is clearly stuck in the second tier, polls show.
</P>
<P>
   Like Alexander, he pushes on day by day, town by town, voter by
voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you do it, step by step by step all around this
huge state,'' Forbes said. ``You don't realize how big Iowa is
until you go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   He travels the state in two well-appointed buses and pointedly
stays in unglamorous Days Inn and Super 8 hotels. He was in the
midst of a 26-county, seven-day tour. By mid-August, Forbes will
have spent 37 days in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Alexander, who visited all 99 Iowa counties in
his 1996 presidential run, was on another grand swing _ a 60-county
tour billed as his Iowa ``homecoming.'' By the end of last week
Alexander had spent 35 days in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   So far Bush has spent four days in Iowa, flying in on a
chartered jet dubbed ``Great Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   All are trying to round up support for the Iowa Straw Poll, on
Aug. 14 in Ames.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a fund-raiser for the state Republican Party, the
informal and absolutely unscientific poll this year shapes up as
something more serious than usual. Because of Bush's big lead,
candidates who finish far out of the running may be effectively
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits already are writing that with little money in the bank
(about $90,000 at last report) and low poll ratings, Alexander must
finish in the top three in the Straw Poll to have any chance in the
January caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Alexander is spending more time in Iowa than anyone
else. At his small gatherings he criticized Bush as lacking
experience, which contrasts with Alexander's background as a
governor, a Cabinet secretary and a college president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a one-term governor once about 15 years ago, and I'm not
sure I was ready to be president of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one stop Alexander accused the son of the former president of
``trying to sound like Bill Clinton.'' And he posed, in blunt
terms, the threat that the Bush juggernaut poses to Iowa's
cherished caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush, who has collected more than $37 million in donations so
far, can spend only a few days campaigning here, spend a ton of
money on TV advertising and still win easily, Alexander warns, ``it
will be the end of the Iowa caucuses as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer, he said, will candidates feel they must emphasize the
type of old-fashioned, one-on-one campaigning that Iowans say they
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also jabs at Bush, though he rarely mentions his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite truthfully, the longer he tries to stay in a bubble, the
stronger we're going to get, because we're defining the agenda,''
Forbes said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' crowds were somewhat larger, drawn perhaps by the
black-and-white television ads the magazine publisher has splashed
across Iowa in recent weeks. Still, they don't compare with Bush,
who often draws crowds of hundreds when he visits the larger towns.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and Forbes are banking on the notion that Iowans are
independent voters who won't rush to crown Bush just because the
Washington establishment has.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to fuel some resentment, Forbes aides point out that Bush
is taking a vacation before the Straw Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters appear to be latching onto the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid Bush will be able to buy his way in and we won't
have the change we need,'' said Dave Herman of Missouri Valley,
Iowa, who said he was undecided.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to this notion that Iowans sometimes do the
unexpected. In 1976 the state's caucuses helped propel little-known
Jimmy Carter to the White House. In 1988, Iowa nearly derailed
then-Vice President George Bush, who came in a disappointing third.
</P>
<P>
   So the second-tier contenders trudge on. In towns such as
Creston (population 7,900), Denison (6,600) and Sheldon (4,900),
Forbes and Alexander recite the same speech so often that the eyes
of campaign aides often glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   The grind can be humbling. In Osceola, a nervous radio disc
jockey mispronounced a tough-to-botch last name, calling him Lamar
``Alexanderia.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Fast Times Restaurant in Lamoni, where the candidate
stopped for an ice-cream cone, co-owner Shirley Francis yelled out
to an Alexander supporter, ``Did you bring that Lamar guy?''
</P>
<P>
   After his recent Lamoni speech, Alexander toured the small
downtown. He greeted Christie Christensen, a retired language
professor sitting in a metal chair and the sole figure on the
street. With time to kill, Alexander browsed through an antiques
store and wound up spending $155 for a blue-and-pink quilt for his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   When Alexander prepared to hit the road, Mayor Jim Hammer bade
him farewell. ``I wish you well against that big juggernaut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see if we can bring it down to size,'' Alexander
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Recently in Missouri Valley, Iowa, Forbes began his day with an
8 a.m. stump speech at the same Days Inn where he spent the night.
But first things first.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the candidate arrived, voters were invited to have
their pictures snapped with the candidate and his wife, Sabina.
With the help of two high-speed printers, the photos were ready by
the end of Forbes' speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love 'em,'' says Steve Grubbs, Forbes' Iowa
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes entered the campaign late in '96 and didn't have time for
grass-roots campaigning, although he spent huge dollars on
30-second TV ads, many of them critical of Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
The strategy backfired and Forbes finished fourth in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   This time will be different, Forbes pledged. Although he hints
that he may again be aggressive on TV, he says he is now a believer
in the grass-roots, voter-by-voter approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way to get real strength for the caucuses and early
primaries,'' Forbes said. ``That way, you have the staying power to
go for the duration.''

FANS RAMPAGE IN LAST HOURS OF FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With BC-WOODSTOCK-99) (sw) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Before the music ended, Woodstock '99 started going
up in violent flames on Sunday night as marauding bands of
shirtless, bellowing men set fire to 12 trucks, looted T-shirts
from concession stands and tore open cash machines in search of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The riot began around 10:30 p.m. after the Red Hot Chili Peppers
finished their set, the final act of the three-day show. As a film
tribute to Jimi Hendrix played on a giant screen, dozens of people
in the crowd, carrying ``peace candles'' that had been passed out
beforehand, used them to set fire to an overturned car.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Woodstock descended into an unsupervised, sometimes
frightening chaos, as bands of young men, inspired by the car fire,
used cigarette lighters to start a dozen bonfires in the grassy
field away from the stage. For almost an hour, Woodstock revelers,
the music long over and the floodlights turned out, rampaged.
</P>
<P>
   As bottles of water flew overhead, they ripped open boxes of
pretzels and soda looted from the trucks and started a vociferous
food fight. Other rioters beat on metal trash drums with
two-by-fours while still others fed the bonfire flames with tables,
tent fabric, boxes, bottles _ anything that could burn and many
other objects, like metal wash basins, that could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just going mad,'' said Daniel Bar, 22, of Toronto,
watching 100-foot billows of luminous ash lick the starless sky.
``I think it's pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly an hour of flames and smoke, smashed bottles and
looted tents, squads of New York State Police troopers arrived,
clad in riot helmets and wielding 3-foot wooden batons. The police,
shouting and sometimes cursing at disobedient revelers, cleared a
100-yard perimeter around the blazing semi-trailers. Minutes later,
explosions ripped open one trailer, than another, each boom evoking
a cheering roar from the thousands of onlookers peacefully standing
off with the police.
</P>
<P>
   As the authorities sought to rein in the chaos, there was no
immediate word on injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to what Woodstock '99 was, this is what
people will remember,'' Renee Lemieux said as she ducked a flying
bottle and was struck by a pretzel. ``It's actually scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the people in the crowd clearly reveled in the scene
of chaos and disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were asking for it,'' Randy Voytas, 26, a
warehouse worker from Connecticut, said of the concert's
organizers. ``They were charging people so much money for
everything. The pizza was $12.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the concertgoers seemed troubled by the chaos, and many
seemed proud of it. They jammed the pay phones to call their
parents and tell them to turn on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look back at this and never forget it,'' said
Kristen Mediros, 24, a hospital administrator from Massachusetts.
``We didn't tear half as much stuff down as the last Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Hamet, an 18-year-old college student from Massachusetts,
wondered only why the madness took so long to get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to start a riot twice today because I was bored,'' he
said, then excused himself. ``I'm going to steal some more stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the 240-acre Woodstock campground resembled
a dusty United Nations refugee city, but one where packs of young
men exchanged crumpled dollar bills for clumps of marijuana or
hallucinogenic mushrooms. Portable toilets ran over into some
tents. Exiting fans ripped down pieces of plywood from the
Woodstock ``Peace Wall'' for souvenirs, and tiptoed through
stagnating ponds in which condoms and bottles floated past sodden
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the 72-hour Woodstock concert climaxed, musically and
emotionally, on Saturday night when bands like Limp Bizkit, Rage
Against the Machine and Metallica played before what seemed like
most of the 200,000 or so people here. Officials estimated that
Sunday's crowd had thinned to 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sunday's lineup included
Willie Nelson, Elvis Costello and the Brian Setzer Orchestra, none
of whom seemed to inspire many young fans exhausted after two
nights of rave parties in an airplane hangar here at the former
Griffiss Air Force Base, which has been transformed into a theme
park devoted to the lost notion of the original Woodstock.

DELEGATION STEPS UP INTEREST IN INDUSTRY AFTER ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last time Congress debated pipeline safety
issues, in 1996, not a single lawmaker from Washington state
entered the fray.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of last month's deadly explosion in Bellingham,
Wash., Washington state lawmakers are rushing to familiarize
themselves with the arcane issues of pipeline regulation and come
up with ways to prevent another accident.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, members of the delegation are not offering
specific proposals, but say they want to ask questions and see what
the National Transportation Safety Board has to say about what
caused the Bellingham explosion. And Gov. Gary Locke, who activists
hoped would push for congressional action, is also taking a go-slow
approach, waiting for a committee to advise him on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the delegation probably have some time. Although
the House has already begun debating renewal of the nation's
pipeline safety laws, the Senate doesn't plan to take up the issue
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the delegation are poised to play a significant
role in the debate over pipeline safety over the next year: Sen.
Slade Gorton, Rep. Brian Baird and Rep. Jack Metcalf because they
sit on committees with jurisdiction over pipeline safety, and Sen.
Patty Murray because she is forcing herself into the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a Democrat, has been the quickest to respond to the
accident, visiting Bellingham, a city about 80 miles north of
Seattle, talking regularly to the mayor there, and summoning
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to her office to inform him
that she will be seeking changes in the way his department works to
protect public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said of the nation's pipeline safety laws, ``it is clear
they have not lived up to what they were supposed to do.'' She has
criticized the Office of Pipeline Safety for failing to follow
through on required changes, and said, ``I have heard a lot of
complaints from officials in Bellingham who feel that the Office of
Pipeline Safety is in bed with the (oil and gas) industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf, a Republican whose district includes Bellingham, is
becoming increasingly vocal. Metcalf is the lone Republican from
Washington state who voted against loosening pipeline industry
regulations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, liberated from any political concerns because he is not
seeking re-election, Metcalf is promising to use the final months
of his long career in public office to fight for pipeline safety.
Metcalf plans to testify at tomorrow's hearing, and promises to
grill federal pipeline safety officials about why they haven't
heeded previous NTSB recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Murray, Metcalf says he isn't yet sure what changes he
would make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now looking very carefully to see whether it (the
Bellingham explosion) was the fault of the rules, or whether
somebody made a mistake carrying out the rules,'' he said. ``I am
deeply concerned, and want to be prepared to take an active role if
changes are needed. But at this point we don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, a Democrat who represents southwest Washington, says he
is worried that Congress is not willing to impose tough new
regulations on pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last review of this process (in 1996) probably didn't
strengthen the regulations at all,'' he said. ``The Republican
Party tends to always denounce any government regulation, yet
here's a case where the regulatory process failed, and previous
attempts to weaken the regulations are being shown to have their
own hazard,'' he said. ``We inspect restaurants for food safety,
trucks for trucking safety, airplanes for airplane safety.
Pipelines obviously pose a hazard, and there's no reason we
shouldn't inspect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, arguably the most powerful member of the state's
congressional delegation, could have a loud voice in the debate
because he is one of the senior members of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and his actions are certain to be closely watched in a
year when he is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will undoubtedly pay a great deal more attention to it than
I would have had it been a normal reauthorization with no apparent
impact on the state of Washington,'' Gorton said. But Gorton said
he is waiting for the NTSB analysis of what went wrong at
Bellingham before deciding how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very real and extremely disturbing and dangerous failure in
this case may mean a failure in the law and it may mean a failure
in the enforcement of the law, and we don't know the answer to that
yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have been hoping Locke, a Democrat, will use
his influence with the Clinton administration and the state's
congressional delegation to push for change. But Locke is taking a
more deliberative approach, waiting, perhaps until the end of this
year, until a task force he appointed makes recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials from Washington state are likely to come under
increasing pressure from local activists to do something about
pipeline safety. Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson is on a crusade to
make sure what happened to his community doesn't happen again, and
a local group, SAFE Bellingham, has already sprung up to push for
pipeline safety reform. Meanwhile, WashPIRG and the Cascade
Columbia Alliance, two organizations that have been battling a
now-withdrawn proposal from Olympic Pipe Line to build a
cross-Cascades pipeline, promise to redirect their energies toward
fighting for pipeline safety changes.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists say they are hoping Locke will wind up
leading the charge to persuade members of Congress to change the
laws.
</P>
<P>
   David Bricklin, the environmental attorney now representing the
city of Bellingham, says Locke could forge an alliance with the
governors of other states that have suffered damage from pipeline
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and the governors of other states that have borne the brunt
of these catastrophes are in a good position to make their voices
heard,'' Bricklin said. ``We don't know if it (the Bellingham
explosion) was a failure of regulations or a failure of a company
to follow regulations, but we do know that the regulations aren't
sufficient. Even if this accident was not the result of flawed
regulations, there's certainly room for improvement.''

PEREZ LOOKS UNFAMILIAR TO DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From $15.5 million signee to Triple-A starting pitcher. That
appears to be the path of Los Angeles Dodgers lefty Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was yanked from the Dodgers' rotation Saturday in favor of
right-hander Robinson Checo, and Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said
Sunday it's possible Perez will be sent to Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at options I could (use) with him,'' Johnson said.
``It's one thing if your velocity is down and another thing if the
location is down. There's also an option he can be sent down (to
Albuquerque) and make a couple of starts down there.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting rocked for a career-high 10 runs in six innings
Friday by Arizona, Johnson banished Perez to the bullpen, which
irked the pitcher. But with Perez's record at 2-10 and his ERA
7.43, it's tough to argue on Perez's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I see him as a starter,'' Johnson said. ``I don't
see him in the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson grew tired of watching the Dodgers get blown out in
his starts, and that leaves one option.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers must make a roster move before Checo starts against
Cincinnati on Wednesday. The choices appear to revolve around Jamie
Arnold or Perez. But Arnold is a valuable commodity in the bullpen
and, apparently, Perez is not. It doesn't bode well for Perez, who
was 33-35 with a 3.71 ERA when he signed a three-year contract in
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, the guy we signed, we haven't seen him this
year,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone. ``I don't know
where the guy is we signed. People in the industry thought it was a
tremendous deal when we signed him. He was dependable, could pitch
deep into games and the guy was successful, and that's not the guy
we've seen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Checo's second go-round with the Dodgers. He was
blistered in two outings earlier this season after being acquired
in the Dave Mlicki trade with Detroit, going 0-0 with a 17.18 ERA.
But Johnson said his velocity is 96 mph and he's 3-6 with a 4.19
ERA with Albuquerque. Checo pitched three innings of shutout ball,
striking out five, against Iowa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been dominating the last couple starts,'' Johnson said.
``Other clubs have inquired about him. He's been dominating and
(Albuquerque manager Mike Scioscia and Dodgers pitching coordinator
Jim Benedict) said he's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Change of thinking? Malone has remained steadfast in saying
the Dodgers would likely hold on to their starting pitchers, but he
admitted during the weekend series with Arizona that he might have
to alter that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has been high in right-hander Ismael Valdes, but
getting rid of the 25-year-old is risky. He's 8-8 with a 3.44 ERA
this season and has been the Dodgers' most consistent pitcher. He's
also 60-48 with a 3.26 ERA in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be on the radar screen,'' Malone said. ``It's got
to be considered. You might have to subtract so you can add some
flexibility in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would love to trade Perez, but, with his contract
situation, that's unlikely. Malone also has considered trading
Darren Dreifort, whose stuff is baffling but whose inconsistency is
more baffling. And Dreifort, who is 8-9 with a 5.68 ERA, is no
longer a pup, though he's in only his second season as a starter.
He turned 27 earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Closing Mondesi's moment: Johnson talked with right fielder
Raul Mondesi and said the situation regarding Mondesi's decision to
sit in the Dodgers' bullpen instead of coming to bench for the top
of the fifth in Friday's 10-1 loss is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong that he did it, but I don't think he had any
sinister motive,'' Johnson said. ``He knows not to do it again.''

ARMSTRONG'S CYCLE IS COMPLETE 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ American Lance Armstrong Sunday triumphantly completed
an improbable journey. He won the top bicycle race in the world
almost three years after a life-threatening battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star-Spangled Banner'' played, and the American flag was
raised on the Champs Elysees as Armstrong, 27, became just the
second American to win the Tour de France. Greg LeMond, of Wayzata,
Minn., won three, the last in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shock, I'm in shock, I'm in shock,'' said Armstrong
after the race. ``It was a long road to get to the Tour and an even
longer one to get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who rides for the US Postal Service team and was
world champion in 1993, has ridden the Tour three other times and
won two stages. But testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs,
abdomen, and brain, interrupted his career in the fall of 1996, and
it was uncertain _ even to him _ whether he'd return to his bike.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, after three weeks and 2,286 miles of racing in the 86th
version of the event, Armstrong felt he had made his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those people who look at my case as an example, I would
just say one thing: If you ever get a second chance in your life
for something, go all the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-mile ride from just south of Paris that finished with 10
circuits on the Champs Elysees was all but ceremonial for
Armstrong, who has worn the leader's yellow jersey for the past two
weeks and had a 7-minute 37-second lead over Swiss rider Alex
Zulle. So even when Armstrong got a flat tire on the course before
the pack reached Paris, he and his team just shrugged. He quickly
got a new wheel from the mechanics in the team car, and teammates
Kevin Livingston and Tyler Hamilton helped draft him to get back to
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Robbie McEwen bolted over the line first in a sprint
finish of 3 hours 37 minutes 39 seconds. The other 140 racers were
given the ``same time,'' and the race was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two days are kind of coming down for teams, after the
Pyrenees,'' said Livingston. ``Tonight we're going to make up for
that with a big party.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could say for sure how many thousands of fans lined
Paris's main drag as the racers rode from the Arc de Triomphe to
the Place de la Concorde. But the spectators, many of them waving
American flags, stood six deep behind the barriers set up on the
Champs Elysees on the sunny, 85-degree day.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the yellow jersey, along with a yellow helmet and
yellow racing shoes, evoked cries of ``Lance! Lance! Lance!'' every
time the pack whizzed past the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong made more than $400,000 for the final win, plus his
three other stage wins, all of which will be split by the team, in
cycling tradition. After putting a new yellow jersey over the one
he already was wearing and raising his hands in victory, Armstrong
bounded from the podium to climb into the stands and kiss his wife,
Kristin, and mother, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, of Brookline, Mass., was the top American to finish
behind Armstrong, almost 27 minutes back.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Tour since 1926 in which the French didn't win
a stage in their own race. They got some consolation, though, when
Frenchman Richard Virenque was awarded the polka-dot jersey for the
fifth time for winning the most climbing points. German Erik Zabel
won the green jersey as the best sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will set off for some criterium races in Holland and
Belgium Monday and Tuesday. Then he'll fly to New York Wednesday
for TV appearances; have lunch with filmmaker Bud Greenspan, who
wants to make a movie of Armstrong's life; and meet with people
from Putnam Publishing, which has paid $400,000 for the rights to
his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   He probably won't get back home to Austin, Texas, until Aug. 10,
when he will be welcomed with a parade.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, before he was diagnosed with cancer, Armstrong
didn't make it to Paris, dropping out of the Tour after the first
week. Last year he was here as a TV commentator.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, after a break from his bike because of cancer that
resulted in chemotherapy, brain surgery, and his French team
dropping him, Armstrong was back with a new team and a new goal.
Not to win the Tour, necessarily, but to get back to racing at his
pre-cancer level.
</P>
<P>
   When he won the prologue time trial three weeks ago and was
given the yellow jersey, he said he had surprised even himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``It was oddly
emotional, because the yellow jersey wasn't a big dream of mine in
my career. But to put it on, it just hit me. To do it on that
stage, to represent what I've been through, was fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   That first week, the jersey was passed around from Jann Kirsipuu
to Tom Steels to Mario Cipolini as sprinters won the flat stages.
Armstrong stayed close to the lead in the standings, and he was
helped by more than just good riding. An accident on a wet road in
the second stage involved almost three dozen riders and put them
back by six minutes . . . minutes that would be hard to get back in
the mountain stages.
</P>
<P>
   LeMond, who won the Tour de France in 1986, '89, and '90 and
spent 10 days here watching the race and riding some of it while
leading a tour group, said the drama of this year's Tour was more
outside the race than in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting that Lance has come back, but it's not a very
exciting race,'' he said, pointing out that the top competitors
weren't here.
</P>
<P>
   All four previous Tour winners, in fact, weren't involved.
Spaniard Miguel Indurain, who won in 1995, has retired. Bjarne
Riis, the '96 winner, broke his arm at the Tour of Switzerland in
June, and '97 winner Jan Ullrich is sidelined with a broken leg.
Last year's winner, Italian Marco Pantani, said when the course was
announced last fall that it was not mountainous enough for him.
Coincidentally or not, Pantani was ejected from last month's Tour
of Italy, which he was leading, for testing positive for EPO.
</P>
<P>
   A rider also expected to make a run at the yellow jersey was
Zulle. But he was involved in that crash in the second stage, and
he never could make up the deficit. If Armstrong held his own in
the mountains, he was guaranteed to stay in front of Zulle _ and he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Armstrong's tactics and Zulle's non-tactics that made
the difference,'' LeMond said. ``Lance took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition was further thinned when Bobby Julich of
Philadelphia dropped out after he crashed in the time trial at the
beginning of the second week and suffered broken ribs. He finished
third in last year's race and was 20th overall before he quit.
</P>
<P>
   That was the time trial that Armstrong won to vault him into the
lead. He would put on the yellow jersey and hang onto it through
the Pyrenees and the Alps and into Paris.
</P>
<P>
   If anything affected him, it was the way some of the French
press wrote about his exceptional racing, accusing him of using
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he won't feel like the race was marred, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the innuendo and speculation which has gone on is minor,''
he said. ``This is going to give hope and inspiration to millions
of people. So I won't look back on it as tainted. My mind is clear,
and I did the hard work. I had people who believed in me, and I
finish a happy man.''

DODGERS DUO IS DYNAMITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It was everything opening day was supposed to be but
wasn't, and everything the Los Angeles Dodgers season was supposed
to be but hasn't been.
</P>
<P>
   The NL's two premier pitchers met for the second time this year,
and this time Kevin Brown outpitched Arizona's Randy Johnson to
give the Dodgers a 2-1 victory Sunday at Bank One Ballpark to end a
five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros, the fan favorite who represents the link from the
O'Malley Dodgers to the Corporate Dodgers, had the decisive hit
with a solo homer in the sixth inning to break a 1-1 tie. It was
the 200th homer of his career, which is 200 more than some scouts
thought he would hit when he was in the Dodgers' minor-league
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the furthest thing from my mind,'' Karros said of being
the sixth Dodger to hit 200 homers. ``There's so much other (stuff)
going on here, you don't have time to think about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   For Karros, that couldn't be more true. It seems like every year
at this time his name is bandied about in trade talks. The latest
rumor has the Dodgers already shopping for Karros' replacement if
the deal goes through, even though Karros is adamant about
remaining in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has talked
with the Montreal Expos about first baseman Brad Fullmer, a
Montclair Prep graduate. Fullmer has missed half of the season with
a knee injury but has power potential and could be the left-handed
bat the Dodgers crave. Sources said Fullmer, 24, could be acquired
for one or two minor-league prospects because the Expos have soured
on him.
</P>
<P>
   In his second full season in the big leagues, Fullmer is hitting
.259 with four homers and 15 RBI. He hit .273 with 13 homers and 73
RBI last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy for anybody in this situation to want to jump
off and want to go somewhere else,'' Karros said. ``Whether it's
the front office, the manager, the coaches, nobody wants to be in
this situation. I don't want to go anywhere, but that's something
that's completely out of my control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now a new organization, a new front office, new
management, new everything. Do I want to be a part of this
organization? Yes, but that's not for me to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't kept teams from inquiring, and the interest is growing
with his numbers. Karros is hitting .293 with team-highs is homers
(23) and RBI (63) and he's hitting .331 with 16 homers and 38 RBI
in his last 43 games.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Karros hit a big homer off the Big Unit with his
willingness to hit the ball the other way. After the Diamondbacks
tied it 1-1 on Jose Vizcaino's throwing error in the fifth, Karros
hit a 1-2 Johnson fastball to right field for a homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful thing to see that,'' said Brown, who improved
to 11-6 after allowing one unearned run on three hits in eight
innings. ``After giving up the lead right there, I thought we were
going to get out of it without a run . . . it's a pretty good swing
on a tough pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino's high throw to Karros cost Brown the lead once, but he
atoned for it with a couple of nice defensive plays. He began a
double play to stem a threat in the seventh, then made a sliding
stop and threw out Travis Lee in the ninth to help Jeff Shaw earn
his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who struck out 11 and leads the NL with a 2.65 ERA,
fell to 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we turned that double play, (Brown) came over to me and
said good job,'' said Vizcaino, who had two hits against Johnson.
``When you make an error like that, you're hoping the next guy hits
it to you.''

BRETT, YOUNT AND RYAN LIVEN UP HALL 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Every year organizers try to end the
induction ceremonies for the baseball Hall of Fame with a good
speaker who carries a strong message. George Brett stepped forward
Sunday, and no one was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Kansas City Royals star was a perfect bridge from
the days of past legends to the wave of future greats, who may be
better athletes and may have longer careers, but not necessarily in
one city. Brett, 47, was the last of seven inductees to receive
baseball's highest honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true,'' said Brett. ``I've been on a long
journey. From Southern California across America. And I stand
humbly before you today. I have been helped by so many people. That
is why this induction is so special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ceremonies follow time-honored traditions, there
was definitely a distinctive manner in which the Class of 1999 took
its place. Also honored were fireballer Nolan Ryan, longtime Brewer
Robin Yount, and Orlando Cepeda, a selection of the Veterans
Committee who played one season (1973) with the Red Sox. Only
Cepeda had a connection with the glory days of the 1950s and '60s.
He became only the second Puerto Rican player to reach the Hall and
the fifth overall from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Brett, Ryan, and Yount, all first-ballot
selections, actually gave a charge to the traditionally stuffy
weekend gathering along the banks of Lake Otesaga. Cooperstown was
jumping for three days, with autograph-seekers eager to pay $75 per
signature, and not just from Hall of Famers. More than 9,000 people
passed through the turnstiles at the Hall Saturday. Sunday, Hall
officials estimated there were a record 50,000-plus on the grassy
plain just beyond the Clark Sports Center.
</P>
<P>
   There were 34 members of the Hall, including Ted Williams, on
the scene. Normally, they mingle among themselves, and one
complaint you hear around town is that the gap between the
old-timers and the newest members has been widening in recent
years. But Brett, Ryan, Yount, and Cepeda are all players whose
work ethic and career accomplishments followed traditional paths.
</P>
<P>
   Brett stayed in Kansas City and Yount in Milwaukee, each for 20
years. Ryan spent his last 14 years in Texas, the last five with
the Rangers, whose cap he wears on his plaque. The large number of
Puerto Rican fans supporting Cepeda is a sign of the future. The
Puerto Rican national anthem was played. Governors from New York,
Texas, and Puerto Rico made appearances. The sleepy little town in
upstate New York is waking up. But maybe the transition won't be as
difficult in the future as one might imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to thank the many, many people who have helped me in my
career so many different ways besides playing baseball,'' said
Brett. ``I've always believed we live with our friends, not with
our accomplishments. I haven't accomplished one thing in baseball
since retiring. But I still have a lot of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard at Cooperstown is not always a smooth
process. Egos dictate. Friends drift apart. Others simply die. But
on induction day, all the Hall of Famers have a duty to praise
those who have achieved success in the game. Brett was a great
all-around player, Yount a two-time Most Valuable Player. Both
amassed 3,000 hits. Nolan Ryan is Nolan Ryan, and with modern
medicine, Cepeda might not have been as injury-plagued as he was at
the end of his career and might have put up better numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say we've been treated very well by the people
here,'' said Brett. ``We're like rookies in this group, but we've
been well accepted. These are people I grew up watching or maybe
played against. Maybe a year from now some of my friends will make
the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yount took an early slot on the nationally televised
program, Brett did not hesitate to use the cleanup position as a
way to pay tribute to Kansas City and its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first arrived in 1973,'' he said to a large contingent
from Kansas City, ``you welcomed me to your beautiful city and into
your homes. It's a place where I met my wife and where my three
children were born. To this day, I'm so proud to call KC home. I
know many of you made the trip here from Kansas City. It's a long
way to Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't thank you enough for your support and the support you
gave the Royals. I don't know if I would have been the same player
if I was playing in Los Angeles, Chicago, or New York. Maybe the
pressure would have gotten to me. I don't know. But if I had to do
it all over again, I would do it again in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett said the fact that he made the Hall still amazes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever wanted to do was be as good as my brothers,'' he
said. ``Ken played in a World Series in Boston (1967) when he was
just 18. My brothers John and Bobby both played in the minor
leagues. I'm happy they're with me today.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 Ryan fans came from Texas. Ryan had a 27-year
career and faced Brett many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When George came up,'' said Ryan, ``eventually he developed
into a hitter thanks to Charlie Lau, who helped make him keep his
weight back. I always thought he had a nice swing, but he became
the type of hitter that you didn't want to see come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to be in the American League when both George
and Robin came in as rookies. They were both tough hitters and
competitors. You knew they would do anything they could to win a
ballgame. They were the type of hitters who got better with runners
in scoring position.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also said the Hall of Fame experience is special.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a baseball player, you realize that you are out of your
element up here,'' he said. ``It's pretty overwhelming to sit there
and see that many (fans) who have made that effort to be here. That
in itself is overwhelming. Then you find yourself around people who
as a kid you idolized. Also players you respected and knew how
tough they were to get out and how competitive they are. There are
just an array of emotions that you are experiencing. It's a relief
to get it out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other inductees were Frank Selee, a turn-of-the-century manager
who was born in Amherst, N.Y.; American League umpire Nestor
Chylak; and Negro league pitcher Smoky Joe Williams. Bob Stevens
(writing) and Arch McDonald (broadcasting) received media awards .
. . The Hall of Fame has agreed to a five-year study to decide when
it should end the Negro league exemption. The Veterans Committee
will vote on players for 2000 and 2001 and then decide if there are
any more worthy candidates. There are 16 Negro leaguers in the Hall
voted in by special committees.

&HT;    ... INSERTS DATELINE 
PEREZ LOOKS UNFAMILIAR TO DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ From $15.5 million signee to Triple-A starting
pitcher. That appears to be the path of Los Angeles Dodgers lefty
Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was yanked from the Dodgers' rotation Saturday in favor of
right-hander Robinson Checo, and Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said
Sunday it's possible Perez will be sent to Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at options I could (use) with him,'' Johnson said.
``It's one thing if your velocity is down and another thing if the
location is down. There's also an option he can be sent down (to
Albuquerque) and make a couple of starts down there.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting rocked for a career-high 10 runs in six innings
Friday by Arizona, Johnson banished Perez to the bullpen, which
irked the pitcher. But with Perez's record at 2-10 and his ERA
7.43, it's tough to argue on Perez's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I see him as a starter,'' Johnson said. ``I don't
see him in the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson grew tired of watching the Dodgers get blown out in
his starts, and that leaves one option.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers must make a roster move before Checo starts against
Cincinnati on Wednesday. The choices appear to revolve around Jamie
Arnold or Perez. But Arnold is a valuable commodity in the bullpen
and, apparently, Perez is not. It doesn't bode well for Perez, who
was 33-35 with a 3.71 ERA when he signed a three-year contract in
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, the guy we signed, we haven't seen him this
year,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone. ``I don't know
where the guy is we signed. People in the industry thought it was a
tremendous deal when we signed him. He was dependable, could pitch
deep into games and the guy was successful, and that's not the guy
we've seen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Checo's second go-round with the Dodgers. He was
blistered in two outings earlier this season after being acquired
in the Dave Mlicki trade with Detroit, going 0-0 with a 17.18 ERA.
But Johnson said his velocity is 96 mph and he's 3-6 with a 4.19
ERA with Albuquerque. Checo pitched three innings of shutout ball,
striking out five, against Iowa Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been dominating the last couple starts,'' Johnson said.
``Other clubs have inquired about him. He's been dominating and
(Albuquerque manager Mike Scioscia an Dodgers pitching coordinator
Jim Benedict) said he's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Change of thinking? Malone has remained steadfast in saying
the Dodgers would likely hold on to their starting pitchers, but he
admitted during the weekend series with Arizona that he might have
to alter that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has been high in right-hander Ismael Valdes, but
getting rid of the 25-year-old is risky. He's 8-8 with a 3.44 ERA
this season and has been the Dodgers' most consistent pitcher. He's
also 60-48 with a 3.26 ERA in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be on the radar screen,'' Malone said. ``It's got
to be considered. You might have to subtract so you can add some
flexibility in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would love to trade Perez, but, with his contract
situation, that's unlikely. Malone also has considered trading
Darren Dreifort, whose stuff is baffling but whose inconsistency is
more baffling. And Dreifort, who is 8-9 with a 5.68 ERA, is no
longer a pup, though he's in only his second season as a starter.
He turned 27 earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Closing Mondesi's moment: Johnson talked with right fielder
Raul Mondesi and said the situation regarding Mondesi's decision to
sit in the Dodgers' bullpen instead of coming to bench for the top
of the fifth in Friday's 10-1 loss is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong that he did it, but I don't think he had any
sinister motive,'' Johnson said. ``He knows not to do it again.''

NOT A FOND FAREWELL FOR SOX AT TIGER STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TIGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When the series began, Red Sox buffs watched the
Boston baseball team step onto the grass of Tiger Stadium for the
last time and waxed nostalgic about Cy Young's pitching at the
corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues, Babe Ruth's legendary
swats, and Roger Clemens's 20 strikeouts, too. There were memories
of Ted Williams, Jimmie Foxx, Fred Lynn, Joe Cronin, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jason Varitek Sunday flied out to Gabe Kapler in center
field on the last Boston at-bat in the stadium's fabled history,
Sox fans had lowered their sights and were thinking of others who
had trod the hallowed grass here. Lesser Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Keough and Faye Throneberry and Willie Tasby in the
outfield, Syd O'Brien at third, Don Buddin at short, George Smith
or Pumpsie Green at second, and maybe Dick Gernert at first. Not to
mention Don Gile catching Murray Wall and, later, Arnold Early from
nearby Flint, Mich., on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it was that bad, the Red Sox' last foray into Tiger Stadium,
a 9-1 loss to the Tigers in a performance lower than low. The ghost
of manager Pinky Higgins could have been seen patroling the Boston
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good pitching explains it,'' said Jimy Williams, the real,
live Boston manager who presided in a Tiger Stadium dugout for the
last time. And good pitching is not what the Red Sox have been
getting; Boston twirlers allowed 28 runs in three weekend games to
Detroit hitters, none of whom was named Ty Cobb, Al Kaline, or
Mickey Cochrane.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the 10 hits by the Tigers Sunday marked the ninth
time in the last 10 games that Boston pitchers have allowed 10 hits
or more. ``It all starts with pitching and defense,'' said
Williams. ``It always has in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And it always ends in baseball for teams without pitching. This
grim weekend saw Boston ace Pedro Martinez go down with a sore
shoulder, which landed him on the disabled list for 15 days. And if
there were such a concept as a team disabled list, Boston would be
rushed onto it. The Red Sox have lost nine of their last 13 games
and have not won back-to-back games since July 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Of this year. It only seems longer ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stunk,'' said Brian Rose, the last Boston pitcher to start
at The Corner. ``It's my job to keep the team in the game, and I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's demise came in the Tiger sixth when Tony Clark _ and not
Hank Greenberg _ came to the plate. Detroit was leading, 2-0, and
had two runners on, just as Williams had two lefthanders, Rheal
Cormier and Mark Guthrie, warming in the bullpen. Williams,
pondering strategy concerning the switch-hitting Clark, moved out
to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But the manager did not yank Rose and force Clark to hit
righthanded; instead, he merely talked to his rookie pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I said to him didn't work,'' said Williams when asked
what he had told Rose. After Williams reached the dugout, Rose
threw a changeup that Clark hammered onto the roof of Tiger
Stadium, only 5-10 feet to the wrong side of the foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was going to hook,'' said Clark of that
mammoth blast. But soon enough, Clark found his aim, driving a
three-run blast into the lower deck in right, increasing Detroit's
lead to 5-0, and burying the Red Sox for good.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has been on a tear since the All-Star break. The Detroit
first baseman has hit in 13 straight games, but more importantly,
he has hit eight home runs in 11 games and has recorded 22 RBIs in
July. And when Clark homered again in the seventh off the
right-field foul pole _ this time batting righthanded _ it marked
the second time this season and the sixth time in his career that
he homered from both sides of the plate in one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to hit home runs,'' said Clark of his surge.
The slugger credited a videotape put together by Detroit manager
Larry Parrish of the swings of those who have hit 500 or more home
runs in their careers, ``and I noticed they weren't trying to hit
the ball out of the park; they just hit the ball hard. That's what
I'm trying to do . . . hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Newhouser was not on the mound for the Tigers, although Red
Sox batters made it seem as though he were. Dave Mlicki (5-9)
totally baffled the thoroughly inconsistent Boston attack with a
popup pitch working to perfection; 18 of the 27 Boston outs were
popups or fly outs.
</P>
<P>
   The only bright news for the Red Sox, who now slump their way
into Toronto, was the continued hot hitting of Trot Nixon (now
hitting .284), who hit two long pokes to center field, the first a
ground-rule double to the right of the 440-mark and the second a
triple off the flag pole in deep center.
</P>
<P>
   That Tiger Stadium flag pole, as all baseball buffs know, is the
only flag pole in major league baseball standing in the field of
play. One last tidbit of history incorporated as the Red Sox,
visitors to The Corner of Michigan and Trumbull for 98 straight
years, left for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Looking more like Gary Geiger than Ted Williams.

SILENCE GOLDEN FOR US IN OLYMPIC QUALIFIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ The United States showed up Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, did what
it was supposed to do, and will head back home Monday. The US
played 10 games and won them all easily, the finale being Sunday
night's 92-66 gold-medal-securing thrashing of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks then joined the Canadians and the Argentines for a
medal presentation ceremony that brought a merciful close to the
1999 Tournament of the Americas Pre-Olympic qualifier. The US won
its 10 games by an average of 31.6 points and won Sunday night the
same way it had won the previous nine, by taking an early lead and
building on it. Gary Payton had 19 points to lead seven Yanks in
double figures. The US led, 48-36, at the half and then went on a
15-0 run in the second half to seal it. The US is now 40-0 in
international games with NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Americans were riding herd over the rest of the
hemisphere, there were others who emerged to highlight the
proceedings over the last dozen days. Here are some observations:
</P>
<P>
   --The home team: It is the end of an era for the Puerto Rican
national squad, which not only failed to qualify, but lost Sunday's
bronze medal game to Argentina. The most enduring figure on that
squad, Jose Ortiz, announced after Sunday's game that he is
retiring from international play. Those who saw Ortiz as a skinny
rookie with Utah in the late 1980s were stunned to see his sculpted
physique on display here. (He beat a FIBA steroid charge only a few
months ago.) At 35, he still can get up and down the floor and can
score from down low. In other words, he probably could be a decent
NBA backup. He will continue to play in Puerto Rico and possibly in
Europe. He also is not alone in hanging 'em up. Joining him in an
emotional farewell news conference were James Carter and Jerome
Mincy, both of whom have logged long hours for the national team.
Both have American roots: Mincy played at Alabama-Birmingham, while
Carter has played in the CBA and USBL.
</P>
<P>
   --Richard Hamilton: One wayward step torpedoed his entire
tournament. The day before the US began play, Hamilton badly
sprained his right ankle and never recovered. (He could have been
more diligent in rehab, however, we hear.) It had to be hard for
him, knowing he won't be going to Sydney (nor will Elton Brand and
Wally Szczerbiak). Hamilton also never got a chance to play here,
his first, and probably only, association with an NBA-dominated
international team. Tom Gugliotta broke his nose, but at least he
got to play. And he's ticketed for Sydney. Hamilton got nothing and
now has to play for the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   --Andres Nocioni: He didn't do much statistically over the
course of the tournament, averaging 8 points and 3.4 rebounds in
17.7 minutes a game. But, at the age of 19, he is destined to be a
poster boy in his native Argentina. He forever will be remembered
for his wraparound dunk over Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan, two
pretty good shot-blockers, in the first-round loss to the US. A
week later, he was still carrying the photo, courtesy of Agence
France-Press photographer Robert Sullivan. He may never do another
thing, but at least he has that. Then again, in three years, he
could be in an NBA city near you.
</P>
<P>
   --Oh Canada!: They were missing one of their best (free agent
Rick Fox) and still won a trip to Sydney with a big victory over
Puerto Rico. Incredibly, not a single Canadian newspaper was here
to chronicle it.
</P>
<P>
   --The defectors: The best of the Cuban defectors, Lazaro Borrel,
is 26. He probably could hang around in an NBA camp. But the most
chilling aspect of the defections was the remark by the Cuban
delegation chief. After calling them traitors, he then said he
wondered if the lads had taken the time to think about their
families.
</P>
<P>
   --Duncan: It didn't take him long to convince his teammates just
how special he is. In many ways, he's like Larry Bird was in Bird's
first few years in the league. He knows he's good. But he's also a
man of few words and is very cautious and brief with reporters. He
may, like Bird, open up and share what his friends say is a very
comic side. Right now, however, he's letting his play do the
talking, and that is more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   --The fans: They never embraced this tournament. They were there
for their home team, especially in a big win over Canada that
enabled them to avoid playing the US in the semifinals. But they
didn't fill the place for the crucial re-match with Canada and
barely bothered to watch the US play. But they stood and cheered
Puerto Rico after it lost to Canada, perhaps knowing it was the end
of the line for this group. They also were very appreciative of the
Finlandia City Dancers, who may be the only dance team to ever wear
more clothes than the locals.

<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Before the music ended, Woodstock '99 started going
up in violent flames on Sunday night as marauding bands of
shirtless, bellowing men set fire to 12 trucks, looted T-shirts
from concession stands and tore open cash machines in search of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos began around 10:30 p.m. after the Red Hot Chili
Peppers finished their set, the final act of the three-day show. As
a film tribute to Jimi Hendrix played on a giant screen, dozens of
people in the crowd, carrying ``peace candles'' that had been
passed out beforehand, used them to set fire to an overturned car.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Woodstock descended into an unsupervised, sometimes
frightening chaos, as bands of young men, inspired by the car fire,
used cigarette lighters to start a dozen bonfires in the grassy
field away from the stage. For almost an hour, Woodstock revelers,
the music long over and the floodlights turned out, rampaged.
</P>
<P>
   As bottles of water flew overhead, they ripped open boxes of
pretzels and soda looted from the trucks and started a vociferous
food fight. Other people beat on metal trash drums with
two-by-fours while still others fed the bonfire flames with tables,
tent fabric, boxes, bottles _ anything that could burn and many
other objects, like metal wash basins, that could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just going mad,'' said Daniel Bar, 22, of Toronto,
watching 100-foot billows of luminous ash lick the starless sky.
``I think it's pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly an hour of flames and smoke, smashed bottles and
looted tents, squads of New York State Police troopers arrived,
clad in riot helmets and wielding 3-foot wooden batons. The police,
shouting and sometimes cursing at disobedient revelers, cleared a
100-yard perimeter around the blazing semi-trailers. Minutes later,
explosions ripped open one trailer, than another, each boom evoking
a cheering roar from the thousands of onlookers peacefully standing
off with the police.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 on Monday morning, most of the flames had been
extinguished and the crowd had been dispersed. There were no
reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to what Woodstock '99 was, this is what
people will remember,'' Renee Lemieux said as she ducked a flying
bottle and was struck by a pretzel. ``It's actually scary.'' Other
people who joined in the rampage toppled light stands and speaker
towers and smashed bottles, while another group tried to destroy a
radio station truck.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd simply watched the melee with a mixture of awe
and disappointment, neither participating in the destruction nor
condemning it. Several people blamed the chaos on Woodstock's
organizers for setting high prices for the very soda and water that
was whizzing by their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four bucks a soda!'' one young man yelled as he roamed about,
holding up a carton of looted Coke bottles and offering them to
anyone who wanted one. ``Go on, we're here, might as well get
ripped off!''
</P>
<P>
   As fire trucks slowly chugged through a mesmerized crowd staring
at the fires, bands of men a few hundred yards away, near the
Emerging Artists stage, were feverishly slamming automatic teller
machines onto the pavement, trying to pry loose money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are the police?'' Ruth Mahorn, 36, of Binghamton, asked
in an interview with The Associated Press as she walked quickly
away from the disturbance with her friends.
</P>
<P>
   One Rome police officer who would not give his name said it took
tHe police so long to arrive because they had to figure out what to
do. ``We had to come with a plan,'' he said. ``It's 250,000 against
50.''
</P>
<P>
   But few of the concertgoers seemed troubled by the chaos, and
many seemed proud of it. They jammed the pay phones to call their
parents and tell them to turn on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look back at this and never forget it,'' said
Kristen Mediros, 24, a hospital administrator from Massachusetts.
``We didn't tear half as much stuff down as the last Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Hamet, an 18-year-old college student from Massachusetts,
wondered only why the madness took so long to get started. ``I
tried to start a riot twice today because I was bored,'' he said,
then excused himself. ``I'm going to steal some more stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the 240-acre Woodstock campground resembled
a dusty United Nations refugee city, but one where packs of young
men exchanged crumpled dollar bills for clumps of marijuana or
hallucinogenic mushrooms. Portable toilets ran over into some
tents. Exiting fans ripped down pieces of plywood from the
Woodstock ``Peace Wall'' for souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the 72-hour Woodstock concert climaxed, musically and
emotionally, on Saturday night when bands like Limp Bizkit, Rage
Against the Machine and Metallica played before what seemed like
most of the 200,000 or so people here. Officials estimated that
Sunday's crowd had thinned to 150,000. Along with the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Sunday's lineup included Willie Nelson, Elvis Costello and
the Brian Setzer Orchestra, none of whom seemed to inspire many
young fans exhausted after two nights of rave parties in an
airplane hangar here at the former Griffiss Air Force Base

LIVINGSTON MAKES HIS POINT  
 CBA MEMORIES INCENTIVE FOR POSSIBLE KIDD BACKUP 
</HEADLINE>
 BACKUP-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Continental Basketball Association has a way of making NBA
players hungry, and Suns point guard Randy Livingston learned that
firsthand in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After his first game with the Sioux Falls Skyforce, his
teammates raved about how they were always treated to dinner on the
road. Livingston, who already had stints with two NBA teams, soon
learned dinner meant Circle K at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were buying loaves of bread and cold cuts,'' he said.
``I'm thinking, `This is crazy.' It was a humbling experience, but
nothing I regret at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Livingston has shown zeal during the Suns'
rookie and free-agent camp. He is one of several players trying to
make a case for the backup point guard job. Also in the mix is
Gerald Brown, who played in 33 games as a Suns rookie last season.
Two other hopefuls, rookie free agents Arthur Lee and Robbie Reid,
were cut from the summer roster Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That job is wide open right now,'' Suns General Manager Bryan
Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns went through five backups last season in the search for
someone to spell starter Jason Kidd: Brown, Livingston, Shawn
Respert, Alvin Simms and Jimmy Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kidd averaged more than 41 minutes a game,
Livingston said he believes the backup job in Phoenix may be ``more
important than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the amount of minutes he plays and the intensity of
the game, you've got to have someone who can step right in and fill
that role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said: ``In a best-case scenario, you want a strong
backup at every position. When you're structuring your 12-man
roster, you want to put together players who can complement your
five best players.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Livingston have made strong cases for the job during
the three-day camp.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Carl Hayden High School graduate who signed as a free
agent with the Suns on Jan. 25, averaged 7.2 minutes and 2.4 points
last season. Recurring knee tendinitis put the 6-foot-4, 210-pound
guard on injured reserve on April 28, prompting the Suns to sign
Livingston, who had most recently played for Sioux Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-5 Livingston came just in time for the regular-season
finale against Minnesota and played 22 minutes, posting 12 points
and three assists. He appeared in all three playoff games against
Portland, averaging 5.3 points and 2.3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy and, honestly, relieved to get out of the CBA,''
Livingston said. ``I thought I played fairly well, and I think the
team thought I did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston ``gave us a tremendous lift,'' Colangelo said. ``I
think Danny (Ainge) was very comfortable with him running the team,
and I think a lot of players felt comfortable, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who recently played in the Los Angeles Summer
League, impressed the Suns by coming to Phoenix early and making it
known that he's committed to making the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that saying, `Out of sight, out of mind,' '' Colangelo
said. ``There's something to be said for making yourself
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Livingston left Louisiana State after his sophomore season
in 1996, his short career has been a wild ride. He played with the
Houston Rockets, who drafted him, during the 1996-97 season, and
spent 12 games with the Atlanta Hawks the next year before landing
in the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the Miami Heat's last training camp cuts in 1998,
so he returned to Sioux Falls, where he averaged 19.4 points and
7.8 assists and led the team to the CBA finals, where the Skyforce
lost to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hungry,'' Livingston said. ``I always feel I have
something to prove. I was in the CBA for a reason. I'm not even
sure I know what that reason is, but I'll continue to fight and try
to prove myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lee was cut, he hopes the Suns don't forget him. As
he was leaving Sunday night, Colangelo told him, ``Nice job. I was
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1, 180-pound Stanford standout wasn't counting on
anything, not after listening to everyone tell him he was a lock to
get drafted. He didn't, despite averaging 13.1 points and 4.4
assists as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   He shot 40.5 percent in his career on three-pointers and is the
NCAA's career leader in free throw shooting (93.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   And he knows about backing up a star. Before he became a starter
at Stanford, he spelled standout Brevin Knight, now with the
Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had to prove myself,'' he said. ``I'll keep
trying.'' &QL;

REVOLUTION LOSE FOOTHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution reverted to form Sunday. They
continued their run of futility against D.C. United, falling, 2-0,
their second successive defeat in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution had reason to be especially discouraged,
since United was playing with only four regular starters, they
remained in third place in the Eastern Conference. And there were
indications help could be on the way _ defender Joseph Addo and
striker Ariel Graziani have been proposed additions, plus US
national team players John Harkes and Joe-Max Moore, who will miss
Saturday's visit to Tampa Bay, should return for the Aug. 6 visit
to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game showed that any and all help will be necessary for
the Revolution to remain in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams presented lineups concerned more with prevention than
creation. And the Revolution created little, while United produced
just enough of its trademark offense to clinch the victory with
first-half goals by Roy Lassiter and Carey Talley. United then
retreated into defense and survived a second-half Revolution rally
sparked by substitute Paul Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan earned a penalty kick in the 21st minute of the second
half, but Johnny Torres missed high to the left with goalkeeper Tom
Presthus having dived in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Revolution pressed forward and created some
desperation chances. But the contest essentially had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have won only twice in regulation time in 17 MLS
games against United. But after playing United to a 2-2 tie, then
losing in a shootout, and taking a 3-2 victory in Washington in
April, the Revolution seemed to have gained confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And, though the Revolution have struggled in their last two
games, including a 5-2 loss to Chicago July 11, they are still in
position to qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played with the same starting 11 for two games in a
row,'' defender Ted Chronopoulos said. ``But D.C. showed they can
play without all of their starters, and we haven't shown that. We
are not consistent. Last year we played Benfica well, then lost to
Chicago at home. The same thing happened this week when we played
well against Ajax, then couldn't get up for a team in our league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to pinpoint why. But D.C. won a lot of first and
second balls. They fought and didn't rely on finesse and
possession. They wanted it more, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution midfield displayed little offense in the first
half, though backheels by Jair set up Jamar Beasley and Mike Burns
for good chances. But Jair did not play a pivotal role until after
the Revolution were trailing, and then he was well-marked by former
Revolution midfielder Geoff Aunger.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter's aggressiveness helped knock the Revolution off
balance early in the game. Lassiter and Aunger were involved in
starting the first scoring play, and Lassiter converted a sharp
header in the 11th minute after passes by Clint Peay and John
Maessner.
</P>
<P>
   Jair's playmaking kept the Revolution in striking range. But a
weak backpass from Mike Burns to player-coach Walter Zenga nearly
resulted in a United goal. And in the 33d minute, Presthus set up
Lassiter with a long throw, resulting in a corner kick. Talley
crashed through for a header and a two-goal lead off Antonio
Otero's corner.
</P>
<P>
   United remained compact and avoided the temptation to become
overly ambitious without starters such as Marco Etcheverry, Jaime
Moreno, Diego Sonora, and four US national team players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do well in the first half,'' Jair said. ``We did
better in the second half and we had enough chances to tie the
game. Now we have to stay positive and all come together and fight
for a playoff spot.''

NBA PARTICIPATION HERE TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Dream Team IV completed its sweep
through the Tournament of the Americas on Sunday, trouncing Canada,
92-66, for a gold medal that really meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The important games were Saturday's semifinals, which clinched
the two available berths to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Now the inevitable questions will follow. Does the United States
really need to send NBA players to these international events? Has
the novelty worn off the Dream Team concept? Do fans want to watch
blowouts, even if it means seeing a team of NBA stars?
</P>
<P>
   The Dream Team's 10 games here drew an average of only 5,389 in
the 12,345-seat Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Take away the sellout
crowd that showed up for the match-up between the Dream Team and
host Puerto Rico, and the average was 4,619 for the other nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the outpouring of interest generated by
the original Dream Team, featuring players such as Michael Jordan,
Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA and USA Basketball officials don't believe that's the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Without NBA players, U.S. teams are no longer unbeatable. Other
countries include their best professionals. To compete, the United
States has to send its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have any choice,'' said Russ Granik, the
NBA's deputy commissioner and president of USA Basketball. ``I
think it's clear that we're not going to win these if we don't have
our best players. I don't think there's any question it's going to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Olympic qualifier games were televised by Turner
Sports, and the Olympics-clinching semifinal was seen on NBC.
Granik said he hasn't seen ratings for those games, but he isn't
worried about the television audience at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody expected high ratings for this,'' he
said. ``The people in the United States aren't even used to the
notion that we have to qualify for the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, most of the players love the concept _ even if
it means non-competitive games. The exception is Atlanta's Steve
Smith, who said the teams should be split between NBA and college
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, Dream Team X will be compared to Dream Team I or
IV,'' said Suns guard Jason Kidd, who will join Phoenix teammate
Tom Gugliotta in the 2000 Games in Sydney. ``Any Dream Team has to
prove itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Coach Larry Brown maintains that the idea isn't
just to win but to show the world the highest level of basketball.
And after the 1994 World Championships, where Dream Team II left an
ugly-American impression on fans, USA Basketball and the NBA have
tried to be more selective in choosing players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want just the best players, we wanted to take our
best guys,'' Brown said. ``That's why this is good for our game.
You add some more great players, like Shaq (O'Neal), Grant Hill,
and maybe Allen (Iverson), and that's going to make people enjoy
our game even more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me two years ago, definitely (I would have
said college players). But I think what we're trying to do is
improve our game all over the world. The only way you can do it is
to expose people to our best players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is going to make some kid in Argentina or Italy dream
of being the next Kevin Garnett or Tim Duncan, I think that's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said the rest of the world's players aren't among
those clamoring for an end to the Dream Teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players from other countries like it when the NBA
plays,'' Gugliotta said. ``Everybody wants to play against the
best. That's what it's all about. And the players in this league
are noticed around the world. These players have seen guys in the
NBA Finals and in the All-Star Games, and now they get to play
against them. They play hard and they seem to enjoy this.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tournament, the Americans extended their record to 40-0
in international competition with NBA players included. The feeling
is that the rest of the world is closing the gap, and the U.S.
team's average margin of victory here _ 31.6 points _ is the lowest
of any Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a huge gulf remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Gugliotta said. ``There are a few countries
that are close. I don't think any of the countries in this
tournament were that close. But there might be some like Yugoslavia
that can make it close. We'll have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   How long can the streak go on?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Kidd said. ``I hope it continues. As
long as I'm on board, (a loss) won't happen.'' &QL;

DURAZO CALLED UP TO FILL DELLUCCI SLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Tucson Amphitheater High School baseball star  &UR; Erubiel
Durazo got a surprise call Saturday night. It was the Diamondbacks
telling him to pack and be at Bank One Ballpark in time for
Sunday's game with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, who tore it up at Double-A El Paso and at Triple-A
Tucson, was promoted after outfielder David Dellucci was placed on
the 60-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said Durazo, 24, who came from Mexico to play
baseball at Amphitheater in the mid-'90s. ``I never thought this
would happen. I kept working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said there were a number of outfielders
_ notably  &UR; Jason Conti,  &UR; Rob
 &UR; Ryan and &UR; Ernie Young _ who could have been promoted. But Showalter
felt that Durazo earned it after hitting .403 with 14 homers and 55
RBIs in El Paso, then hitting .407 with 10 homers and 28 RBIs in 30
games in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, a left-handed hitter who is 6 feet 3, 225 pounds, spent
two years in the Mexican League, before the Diamondbacks signed him
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican League is a good level of play,'' Showalter said.
``So it's not like he's a kid right out of high school and
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said that Durazo will be used primarily off the bench
as a pinch-hitter, but could spell  &UR; Travis Lee at times at first
and possibly play the outfield. Durazo played in the outfield in
the Mexican League, but he's played every game at first base in the
minor leagues this season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still some zing left &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals quarterback  &UR; Boomer Esiason, who has a home in
the Valley, spent some time in the Diamondbacks' clubhouse before
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   He said he talked to Showalter, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Buck if he needed a left-handed setup guy,'' Esiason
said. ``He thought about it. I think he wanted to see what I had. I
told him that I'm not afraid to throw at batters, either.'' &QL;

DELLUCCI OUT FOR SEASON  
 CAREER SHOULD RE SUME AFTER WRIST SURGERY, DOCTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All those diving catches, head-first slides into base, long
throws from the outfield, endless hacks in the batting cage caught
up to David Dellucci, who had bounded around the baseball field as
if he had an ``S'' on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks outfielder will undergo what he hopes is
career-saving surgery on his left wrist this week for an uncommon
condition known as Kienbock's disease, named after the physician
who discovered it.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sheridan, an orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon who will
perform the operation, said the injury was caused by the way
Dellucci's wrist has developed since childhood and the stress he
has placed on it by playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said that repeated jarring of the radius bone in
Dellucci's forearm led to damage to one of the small bones, the
lunate, in his wrist. That, in turn, was cutting off blood flow to
his hand, Sheridan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Dellucci, who is lost for the season and
was placed on the 60-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep saying, over and over, `It's not like I rode a
motorcycle and fell and crushed my hand.' This is something my body
has done. I can't understand why it's happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially at a time when Dellucci was playing more. With the
Diamondbacks playing at American League parks, where the designated
hitter is used, and with second baseman Jay Bell nursing a
hamstring injury that moved Tony Womack in from right field,
Dellucci had started eight games after the All-Star break and was
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci, who started in left field much of last season as a
rookie and led the National League in triples, hit .528 (19 for 36)
with 11 runs scored, two doubles, a homer and seven RBIs over his
past nine starts. Before that, he had been a valuable left-handed
bat off the bench, batting .394 (43 for 109) in 63 games.
</P>
<P>
   All that effort Dellucci gave, however, ultimately took a toll
on his wrist, partly because of the way it is structured. He said
he was told that it could have become serious at any time, whether
five years ago or 10 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said that he would like to do surgery Tuesday, if he
can obtain the special instruments needed.
</P>
<P>
   Had he continued playing, Dellucci risked the chance of the bone
dying and causing it to fragment, which would have given him very
little movement and ended his playing career at age 25.
</P>
<P>
   It was caught at an early enough stage that there should be no
irreversible damage. Sheridan said Dellucci has a 70 percent chance
to return to strenuous activity.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan planned to shorten the radius bone by three to four
millimeters to more evenly distribute the force across Dellucci's
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   If the surgery is successful and recovery goes well, Dellucci
should be ready for spring training next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said it is a risky procedure, and rehabilitation takes
up to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how it turns out, it won't interfere with his
ability to play,'' Sheridan said. ``But I'll probably be holding my
breath every time he dives for a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci's arm will be in a cast for two months. Sheridan said
it will take about two months for Dellucci to work on his range of
motion and another two months for strengthening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said that I'd quit when I'm tired and old, but this
isn't going to stop me,'' Dellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about when the cast comes off and my arm is the
size of a toothpick. That's what I keep picturing in my head.''

IT'S RIGHT RESULT FOR RONGEN

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He left here 11 months ago, his Revolution
heading in the wrong direction, and by the end of the year he was
on duty as coach of Major League Soccer power D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Thomas Rongen was back at Foxboro Stadium, where his
league-leading D.C. United club shut down the Revolution, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The win was especially sweet because his team pulled it off
while playing without eight starters who were out on assorted
national team assignments or missing for other reasons, Rongen
said.
</P>
<P>
   His pleasure, he said, had nothing to do with any revenge
against the Revolution, who cut him loose last August when the team
was 8-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another game,'' Rongen said. ``We play 32 games. I can't
get caught up in that. I mean, I was in Tampa before and 10 years
from now I might have done all 12 teams, you know. If I do get too
excited or become too emotional about games I need to take more
valium and probably die when I'm 60. It was just another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is not to say he isn't happy being with D.C.
United, the team that won the first two MLS championships and was
runner-up last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization, top to bottom, prides itself in
excellence,'' Rongen said. ``It prides itself in winning games,
winning a lot of games, and in winning championships. We've set
that standard for ourselves and we perform accordingly. It doesn't
mean we're going to win every game, but we're certainly going to
compete in every game and we know we're good enough to compete in
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a certain mindset that unfortunately here they maybe
haven't been able to get over the last three years and into the
fourth year,'' Rongen said. ``The psyche of the athlete, the psyche
of the team, and the chemistry of the team is always very
important. Teams can be healthy if they win, unhealthy if they
don't win. It's not necessarily anything to do with the ability of
a coach. It's just the way it works at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution went 3-3 the rest of the way last season after
Rongen left and was replaced by Walter Zenga. In December, Rongen
was named to take over at D.C. United for Bruce Arena, who moved on
to coach the United States national team.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United is 13-7-3 overall at the top of the Eastern
Conference. United and the Revolution played to a 2-2 tie here on
April 10 and United won the shootout. Two weeks later, New England
beat United, 2-1, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's win put United up in the season series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gratifying win,'' Rongen said. ``I was excited for
these kids before the game. I've been in that position before as a
player, not always contributing all the time. But when you get the
chance and get the ball, you've got to take care of business and do
the job, which they did today. I can't be happier for the 12-13
guys who battled and contributed to this team. Sooner or later, we
might have to fall back on one or two of those players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution get one more regular-season shot at D.C. United.
The teams meet again in their season finale, Oct. 9 in Washington.

IT'S TIME TO COMPROMISE, GET ROSE IN HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. - Two blocks away from the Baseball Hall of
Fame Museum, Pete Rose sat at an eight-foot table Sunday morning
signing autographs at a mini-baseball shrine called the American
Baseball Experience.
</P>
<P>
   The two blocks may as well have been a million miles, because
Rose is not about to enter baseball's holiest halls. And those
halls will forever have a void as long as Rose sits on the outside
looking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate would be to have a plaque on the wall down the
street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate, though, remains out of Rose's reach. His name does
not appear on the annual ballot mailed to the more than 500 Hall of
Fame voters. Traditionally, Rose receives a write-in total of 5 to
10 percent of the ballots, nowhere close to the 75 percent
necessary for induction.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he ever received 75 percent, he wouldn't get in. His
votes do not count. Since he was banned from baseball for gambling
on Aug. 24, 1989, Rose has been a pariah to the game he played with
such passion, heart, fury and determination.
</P>
<P>
   As he approaches his 10th full year away from the game, Rose is
willing to accept concessions on a possible admission to the Hall
that still seems impossible to reach. Asked if he would accept
enshrinement with the stipulation his plaque read he remains banned
from the game, Rose replied, ``I'll take anything I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with that, Commissioner Bud Selig? You don't have
to reinstate Rose. Just let him have his rightful place in the Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that Rose has done wrong. There's also no
denying several contradictions that took place this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As Rose was signing autographs Saturday afternoon, just four
chairs down from the game's all-time hit king was former Cleveland
pitcher and Hall of Fame member Bob Feller, who was doing the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Feller has been one of Rose's harshest critics over the years,
spewing a contempt for Rose that is almost legendary. Yet, here he
sat, under the same tent in a small 15-foot by 15-foot area,
feeding off Rose's crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The two never spoke to each other as fans clamored for their
autographs, with interest in Rose easily running 4-1 in his favor.
For Feller, it was total hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Hall of Famer and I have respect for that,'' Rose said.
``But how is Bob Feller an expert on my case when we've never
talked about it?''
</P>
<P>
   For further contradiction, consider the induction of Orlando
Cepeda. A convicted felon was welcomed into the sacred sacristy of
the greatest game ever.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, Cepeda was convicted on marijuana smuggling
charges. In Cepeda's case, all seems to have been forgotten and
forgiven. Ty Cobb, one of the original inductees, claimed to have
killed a man, though charges were never filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Pete will get in here because he wants to be and
deserves to be here,'' Cepeda said. ``Everyone deserves a second
chance, and I'm proof of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to find anyone in baseball who played the
game with more grit and all-out determination than Rose. The game
he loves so dearly continues to make him pay dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said I'm sorry to everyone,'' Rose said. ``I've made
mistakes and I can't change them. I haven't done anything that
deserves me to be in the penalty box for 10 years. It's sad to
think if I had been addicted to drugs I'd be in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he commit crimes against the game while gambling? Probably
so. If there is concrete evidence, it's never been made public. But
what of the contradictions we see between baseball and the gambling
industry at many major league ballparks? Look no further than the
Diamondbacks, who have the Gila River Casino as one of their
primary sponsors. In St. Louis and Florida and a half-dozen other
parks, there are advertisements for casinos, Las Vegas or Atlantic
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about the integrity of the game?'' Rose said. ``Maybe
they ought to do some soul searching themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   New inductee Nolan Ryan, a staunch conservative, shared his
opinion on the Rose matter, a surprising one considering his
conventional beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts are that Pete should be in the Hall of Fame,''
said the highly respected Ryan. ``I would have loved to have him as
a teammate. I knew he would do anything to beat you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know all the details about everything that went on
(with the investigation), but I think he should be judged on his
merits as a player. I've expressed my feelings on that (to the
commissioner).''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, maybe Rose and Selig should get together and
meet. The two never have exchanged a word or ever shaken hands.
It's possible the two men might discover the one common ground they
both cherish so deeply, the game of baseball, may bring them
together to forge some sort of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, it could be the first step in closing one of
baseball's biggest wounds. &QL;

LONG JUMPER FALLS SHORT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _  &UR; Dwight Phillips' first jump into
international competition didn't go as far as he had hoped it
would.
</P>
<P>
   His seventh-place Sunday in the long jump at the Pan American
Games fell short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed, and that pretty much sums it up,'' said
Phillips, who emerged last spring at Arizona State with the
nation's best collegiate jump during the Pac-10 championships. ``I
was feeling great, and had all the enthusiasm in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the atmosphere. The crowd was really into it. I just
didn't jump well.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Phillips' attempts counted. As a capacity crowd of
5,000 at the Unversity of Manitoba watched, he went 7.68 meters, or
25 feet, 2{ inches, which is about a foot short of his best.
Cuba's &UR; Ivan Pedroso, ranked No. 1 in the world this year, won the
gold at 8.52 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to where I know I can jump,'' Phillips
said. ``I want to make it up on that awards stand. I just couldn't
pop off a big jump tonight. All the ingredients were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good crowd, good competition, bad jumps.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hammer high &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Caroline Wittrin of Vancouver, British Columbia, won the bronze
medal in the hammer throw with a toss of 61.28 meters, but it was
short of her Canadian record, 63.47, which would have been good
enough for the silver.
</P>
<P>
   She set the record in Flagstaff about two weeks ago while the
Canadians trained at Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably did it at the wrong time and at the wrong place,''
Wittrin said of a national mark established in a different nation.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly . . . &QL;

<P>
   Missing Before Action: Two Peruvian wrestlers took off jogging
Friday. As of Sunday, they had yet to return, according to Winnipeg
police, who have listed them as missing persons.

<P>
   Busy day:  &UR; Courtney Johnson of the U.S. women's water polo team
did double duty Sunday. After the U.S.-Canada game, Johnson, a
second-year law student at California, took a monitored, three-hour
final exam in commercial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   No, there are no horses in water polo. But some of the players
sound as if they've been kicked in the head too many times.
Canadian  &UR; Garrett Heard, on suffering four concussions in 10 years:
``They're fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Bernard Williams of Baltimore was so happy to win the
100-meter dash that he even thanked the media. ``Please come back,
sir,'' he told sportswriters. ``I've never won a gold medal before.
I didn't expect to win, and I never expected to talk to you all.
This is the first time I've ever interviewed.'' &QL;

TIME MACHINE DIAL STUCK  
 RUNNER HARDEN'S RESULTS GO SOUTH ON TRIP NORTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ In an age with tracks made of flubber and
shoes designed by geeks, Tim Harden must have felt as though he
just had been transported to a different time.
</P>
<P>
   A much slower time.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-meter dash Sunday at the Pan American Games was a race
run at a sun-dial pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the digital clock, nobody in the field of eight finished
faster than 10.0. That's seconds, not hours. It was as if the track
were coverered in cinders and the feet were in spikes.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been an exercise in nostalgia, it might have been
entertaining. But for Harden, this Pan Am excursion was as much fun
as motion sickness.
</P>
<P>
   After two days full of delayed flights and lost sleep, Harden
arrived at the finish line like a piece of lost baggage. He was
fourth. As it turned out, a gold-medal plan would have been to stay
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a zombie,'' said Harden, who finished at 10.19, a
step behind the 10.08 clocked by surprising gold medalist Bernard
Williams, his unknown U.S. teammate.
</P>
<P>
   As the fates or the flight plan would have it, Harden seemed to
be out of sync from the moment he boarded his flight at Sky Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   First, he was doomed to sit through a long delay in Minneapolis
while waiting for a connection. He didn't arrive in Winnipeg until
2 a.m. After very little sleep, he managed to qualify sixth in
Saturday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   It was fair to guess that a solid night of sleep would adjust
Harden's inner clock. But by Sunday evening, Harden still found
himself operating without synchronicity.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was a false start by Brazil's Andre Silva, who won
the bronze at 10.13.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was a second false start by Cuban Mayola Fernandez,
who won silver at 10.10.
</P>
<P>
   The false starts left Harden feeling edgy. He waited on a delay
in Minneapolis and wound up waiting too long to react at the start
of a race he was favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the race with the field's fastest time this season.
Within the last year, he has run 9.92. The bad start eliminated any
chance of equalling that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' said Harden, who has been living and training in
Phoenix for about a year. ``I just got caught at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the way everything happened, I just felt drained mentally
and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harden, the good news is that the race doesn't mean much.
The Pan Am Games are without most of the world's best in track and
field. Future and former Olympians are pointing toward the World
Championships later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the missing: U.S. sprinter Maurice Greene, who recently
set the world record at 9.79.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing: Canadian Donovan Bailey, the 1996 Olympic gold
medalist. Other notable absences included Bruby Surin and Alto
Boldon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the circumstances, I wouldn't have wanted to race those
guys today, anyway,'' said Harden, who won a 1996 Olympic silver on
a U.S. relay team that he joined after Carl Lewis finally decided
to withdraw after several days of personal contemplation and public
debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Harden's day against that stellar field is on the horizon.
He also is planning to compete in the World Championships in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate plans are to go back to Phoenix and rest for a
few days,'' he said. ``Then, I'll head for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Harden said he'll probably fly out next week. That should give
him enough time to ensure that he eventually covers the 100 meters
in his own time. &QL;

ACE IN THE HOLE  
 RANDY JOHNSON LOSES DUEL WITH KEVIN BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like a terrible trick of fate, but this time the
Diamondbacks had an easy answer for why they managed just three
hits with their ace, Randy Johnson, on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown showed Sunday why he's baseball's richest pitcher,
changing speeds and movement, giving the Diamondbacks nothing to
take deep and being graced with the fortune that Johnson has dearly
missed this season. The Dodgers pulled out one victory in the
three-game series, winning, 2-1, before 47,238 fans at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Brown is one of the best, too _ for a long time,''
Diamondbacks outfielder Bernard Gilkey said. ``Give him his
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite another hard-luck loss for Johnson, the Diamondbacks
(54-46) maintained their half-game lead in the National League West
over the San Francisco Giants, who lost to the Cincinnati Reds,
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give up a couple of runs, and a pitcher like Kevin
Brown is on, it makes it tough,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Brown lived up to the hype that surrounded them on
opening day, when they went at it in Los Angeles, where neither
figured in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came out with his usual ferocious, high-octane stuff and
struck out 11 batters, the 117th double-digit strikeout total in
his career and 15th this season.
</P>
<P>
   He walked just one, but it was that fourth-inning pass to Eric
Karros that eventually gave the Dodgers their first run (on Adrian
Beltre's sacrifice fly) and broke Johnson's string of 23 scoreless
innings, 4 innings shy of the team record set by Andy Benes last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The big left-hander made one other mistake _ a pitch that Karros
yanked out to lead off the sixth. That was enough for Brown and
Jeff Shaw, who retired the Diamondbacks in order in the ninth for
his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who had a five-game winning streak snapped,
could swallow this defeat easier than the four in which Johnson was
provided no runs and no more than three hits in any of them.
Johnson got offensive backing and snapped a five-game losing streak
in Seattle last week.
</P>
<P>
   With a little offense, Johnson, whose league-leading ERA
remained at 2.65, could be 15-3, not 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   There is always next time, and the next time should pit him
against Brown again, in Los Angeles on Friday. ``I'll work hard in
between now and my next start,'' Johnson said. ``I'll just try to
pitch a little bit better next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who improved to 11-6, said he had no better stuff Sunday
than he had Tuesday, when he picked up his first victory in five
starts in an 8-4 game at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Could have fooled Gilkey, who homered twice in the season-opener
against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filthy,'' is what Gilkey called Brown's pitches. ``Opening
day, he missed a couple of spots with me, but today he didn't. He
didn't give me anything to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' lone run, in the fifth, was unearned, courtesy
of a throwing error by second baseman Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks threatened in the seventh when Andy Fox beat
out an infield hit and advanced to second on a passed ball. After
catcher Damian Miller grounded out to shortstop, Manager Buck
Showalter let Johnson face Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has improved greatly as a hitter, but, after striking
out twice, he grounded meekly to first for the second out. Fox
ended up stuck on third base after Womack popped out in the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he considered pulling Johnson for a pinch-hitter,
but ``we felt we had a better chance with Randy pitching, the way
he was pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, left in the eighth after giving up successive
singles to start the inning. By then, he had thrown 143 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, instrumental in getting the Florida Marlins and the San
Diego Padres into the World Series the past two years, stopped
short of saying he's back on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' he said. ``You can pitch well and have bad
luck and you can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knows that feeling all too well. &QL;

ANOTHER FRUSTRATING OUTING FOR JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After his 143rd pitch, he held out the ball and reluctantly
placed it in Buck Showalter's open hand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with all eyes on him, he began the solitary walk from the
mound to the dugout. Head down, his long hair lank with sweat, he
didn't see the crowd come to its feet in appreciation, nor did he
acknowledge the supportive cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Tight-jawed, he marched off the field with those long strides of
his.
</P>
<P>
   Another heroic effort wasted.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what Randy Johnson does in private. Maybe he goes
into a closet and screams. Or pounds a heavy bag, like a prize
fighter in training.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe away from TV cameras, he seizes a bat and takes out his
pent-up feelings on a water cooler the way Dodgers pitcher Carlos
Perez did in public view during a game earlier this summer,
violently whacking at it until he exhausted himself. Perez looked
like some crazed party guest beating a pinata.
</P>
<P>
   After a night like this _ isn't every game he pitches like this
one? _ the Diamondbacks ace must be frustrated and a little angry.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't show it. Or hasn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   Not to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of baseball,'' Johnson said quietly, giving a
shrug of an answer, after the Diamondbacks again failed to provide
their ace with run support in a 2-1 loss to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched well enough to win. ``He does every time he goes
out,'' Luis Gonzalez said. ``Randy's having a Cy Young season.''
</P>
<P>
   But his record doesn't reflect it. Johnson is 10-8. He knows,
and his teammates know, he easily could be 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Johnson's fifth in his last six starts. In four of
the defeats, the Diamondbacks didn't score a run. They managed only
three hits Sunday against the Dodgers' $105 million pitcher Kevin
Brown, who went eight innings before Jeff Shaw finished up,
retiring the D-Backs in order.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was good, Brown just a little better.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the luck has gone for Johnson. The major league's
strikeout leader lost a 1-0 decision the night Jose Jimenez pitched
his no-hitter for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson threw seven innings. He made one mistake, giving up a
solo home run to Eric Karros in the sixth. The man who is chasing
Nolan Ryan's single-season strikeout record fanned 11 and the sound
his fastball made when it popped into Damian Miller's mitt brought
to mind an anecdote about Ryan in the book ``The Umpire Strikes
Back'' by Ron Luciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``'' One time Ryan stood on the mound, awaiting the sign.
``Strike 1!'' Luciano bawled behind the plate. The hitter stepped
out of the box and looked at the umpire as if he were crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Luciano said, ``he's really on tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched the way we have come to expect. He fanned
leadoff hitter Mark Grudzielanek three times. Twice, on high
fastballs, the LA batter swung hard enough to cause 12-foot waves
off Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diamondbacks had even less success against Brown.
Johnson chose to praise his counterpart's craftiness rather than
critique his teammates' shortcomings at the plate. ``He knows we're
trying,'' Gonzalez said. ``It's not like we're just throwing our
hat out there.''
</P>
<P>
   A $50 million contract can buy a lot of patience. Still, it must
be maddening to an athlete as competitive as Johnson is to go
unrewarded once again.
</P>
<P>
   Once more he dressed in silence. Once more he said what happened
is part of baseball. Once more he said he would just have to work
harder between now and his next start.
</P>
<P>
   Resting on a shelf beside his chair was a small red cardboard
box. ``Ultimate Stress Relief'' the words on the box read. Maybe
that's how Randy Johnson copes. Take two, every four hours, or as
needed. &QL;

MORE GEMS TO COOPERSTOWN COLLECTION  
 HALL WELCOMES BRETT, CEPEDA, RYAN, YOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ They talked about cheers, tears and beers as
baseball welcomed the class of 1999 into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   George Brett, Nolan Ryan and Robin Yount _ all first-ballot
inductees _ and Orlando Cepeda, who entered via the veterans
committee, were warmly welcomed by an overflow crowd into
Cooperstown, where the game's heart and soul reside.
</P>
<P>
   With a who's who of 34 Hall of Fame members at their backs and a
record crowd estimated at 50,000 sitting in a meadow in upstate New
York, the largest first-time class since the inaugural one of 1936
had its say.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, a career Kansas City Royal, openly wept as he finished
the afternoon of speeches from the newest of the now 244-member
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder why all this has happened to me and not
you,'' Brett said as he broke down in talking about his older
brothers, Bobby, Ken and John. ``All I ever wanted was to be as
good as you.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett's oldest son, Jackson, 7, also began crying as he sought
his mother's comfort during his father's moving speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently, I didn't practice as much as Robin. Then again,
sometimes when I watch ``Leave'' ``it to Beaver'' and something
happens to the Beav, maybe with Lumpy or something, I get a little
teary-eyed. I've always worn my emotions on my sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett mused aloud how much he misses the days of talking
baseball while sharing ``a few cold ones'' with teammates such as
Hal McRae, how those were the best days of his professional life
and how today's players seem to leave a clubhouse 15 minutes after
a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Yount, Orlando Cepeda and Ryan spoke first, followed by
Brett. Late umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro Leagues pitcher Smokey Joe
Williams and turn-of-the-century Manager Frank Selee also were
honored.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one common denominator among the inductees, it was
an intense desire to always get better, to discuss baseball as much
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were times when I was with my family physically,
but my mind was always on the game,'' Yount said in praising his
wife for her guidance of their family during the baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Yount, who spent all 20 of his big league seasons with the
Milwaukee Brewers, also spoke movingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I used to dream of becoming a major league
player and it came true,'' said Yount, a Paradise Valley resident.
``I dreamed of hitting a home run in the World Series and playing
in the All-Star Game, and those came true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If now is the time I'm supposed to wake up from all of this,
then it's OK. It's been a great dream. If it's reality, then, with
all due respect to Mr. Gehrig, today I consider myself the luckiest
man on the face of the earth. The game of life can sometimes be too
short, so play it with everything you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda, who joins Roberto Clemente as the only Puerto Rican-born
players in the Hall, used his time to talk up the merits of other
Latin American ballplayers he believes warrant induction, such as
Tony Perez, Tony Oliva and Luis Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one day they will be here,'' Cepeda said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, the greatest strikeout pitcher ever, made special mention
of former players association leader Marvin Miller, citing how he
was paid the major league minimum of $7,000 and needed to work all
winter to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players had to have off-season jobs,'' Ryan said. ``My job was
working at a service station pumping gas from 3 to 9 at night, and
then closing up.''
</P>
<P>
   While the names change every year, the work ethic seems to be
the one trait shared by all Hall of Famers. And this day, every
year, is also shared by all close to the game to celebrate
everything that is great about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is our finest hour,'' Commissioner Bud Selig
said. &QL;

FAA PROPOSES FREEZE ON FLIGHTS OVER GRAND CAN YON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Most people walking along the edge of the Grand Canyon
don't notice the noise from helicopters and planes filled with
tourists flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But to wilderness hikers and river rafters, the blades slapping
at the sky disturb the solitude of the isolated adventures they
took months to plan and days to reach.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a continuing effort to restore the natural quiet to
Arizona's most popular natural wonder, federal authorities plan,
for the first time, to freeze the number of tour flights over the
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Following a public comment period, the freeze could take effect
by January.
</P>
<P>
   It's a move that could cost the air-tour industry millions in
lost revenue. One tour operator says he plans to ignore the
restrictions. Other operators say they fear the restrictions will
force some operators out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they think they've got to keep beating up on
us,'' said Bob McCune, president of the Grand Canyon Air Tour
Council, an association of the 23 tour companies that annually fly
nearly 800,000 tourists over the Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers and river rafters make up about 250,000 of the nearly 5
million annual visitors to the Grand Canyon, according to a recent
report by the Federal Aviation Administration. &QL; 
`WHO GETS BENEFITS?' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tour industry members say the government is bending over
backward to please the hikers and rafters, at the expense of
tourists who want to see the canyon from above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who gets the visitor benefits?'' McCune asked. ``Do you trade
off one hiker for 10 people who get an opportunity to see it?''
</P>
<P>
   Following a directive issued by President Clinton three years
ago, and a federal law passed by Congress a dozen years ago, the
FAA is working with the National Park Service to find ways to
reduce noise.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to make at least half the 1.1 million-acre park
quiet three-quarters of the day. The FAA says it expects to achieve
this goal, mandated in 1987, by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the FAA estimates that 42 percent of the park is
quiet 75 percent of the day. But during the busy summer tourist
season, the number drops to only 19 percent of the park, said Ken
Weber, chief of the National Park Service's Grand Canyon science
center.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, federal authorities banned air-tour flights
within an hour of sunrise and sunset, to keep the canyon quiet
during the periods of the most dramatic sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``While certain people have the benefit of viewing from the air,
people on the ground receive the byproducts of that trip, and
that's noise,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come here for solitude and quiet. That's what
makes the Grand Canyon grand. If it were noisy down there, it just
wouldn't seem so impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulation, tour companies would operate under a
flight cap. That number would be based on how many trips the tour
operators took from May 1997 to April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA report estimates the regulation will cost the $151
million air-tour industry $25.5 million each year for the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's been in a state of flux for years, and that's
the state of American business,'' Weber said, adding that it's
possible some companies could close. ``The smaller mom-and-pops are
the most economically vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators also fear it will hurt their customers, some of
whom are people too old or too young to hike into the Grand Canyon,
or foreigners looking to see the United States within a strict time
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are package tours,'' McCune said. ``No way they're going
to give up two days for a bus trip.'' &QL; 
2 YEARS FOR STUDY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed freeze would be in place for two years, the FAA
report says. During that time, technicians would measure noise
levels to see whether natural quiet had been restored. If it was
not, authorities could continue the freeze, or even make it more
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Turner, chief executive officer of HeliUSA, said he's
received the FAA's letter restricting him to 2,556 flights a year.
But Turner said he will ignore the directive and fly an estimated
8,000 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he believes the law doesn't apply to him because he
flies only over Indian land, never crossing the national park. The
FAA says that doesn't matter because it controls airspace over the
entire country, including Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said it's not just a legal battle; he's going to ignore
the policy to keep his business going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have a company if you restrict it to 2,500
flights,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA won't release the number of flights allocated to each
tour company, citing confidentiality agreements. Some tour
companies said the FAA allocations would cut their business by as
much as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA estimates that without the cap, the industry would grow
at the rate of 3.3 percent a year, Weber said. The freeze would let
authorities halt the growth and study how best to reduce the noise
levels. &QL; 
NOT ALL BUGGED BY NOISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karen Foley, a 55-year-old Phoenix artist sketching the view
from Lipan Point last week, said she wasn't bugged at all by the
helicopters and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of days, I've been here for hours
sketching and I really haven't noticed any (aircraft). I did see
three condors yesterday, though,'' Foley said. ``I guess if I
thought about it, I would find them intrusive, but I concentrate so
much on my art, I really don't notice them.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy DeVries, 43, of Vancouver, a navigator in the Canadian Air
Force, said he had heard lots of planes and helicopters while
camping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like we were at Chicago O'Hare Airport,'' DeVries
said. ``It starts about 8 o'clock and is steady in the mornings,
but tapers off by midafternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 71 percent of canyon visitors say they don't notice
the aircraft noise, according to a survey included in the report.
Most of those whose canyon experience does not dip below the rim
said they were not affected by the airplane noise.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 40 percent of those who backpack into the canyon
or take a rafting trip down the Colorado River, said they were at
least moderately affected by aircraft noise, the survey says. &QL;

BLACK SOUTH AFRICA FINDS VOICE IN FREEDOM FOLLOWING APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>

 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVIN IN ``E'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; It was night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the starry sky seemed so large to Lionel Davies until
that instant in 1964 when he was no longer free.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South Africa's Robben
Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the freedom of the
world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him with their
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would be in prison for the next 11 years, put there for the
``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of hundreds of black people
imprisoned during the 44 years of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Davies only hoped that one day he would again stand under that
sky as a man equal to the world, and not as a black South African
activist imprisoned by cultural fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We were the pariahs of our world,'' Davies says. ``It was
humiliating to be black at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, apartheid has ended, Davies and others have
been released and South Africa's art world is waking from its long
night's sleep of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and the country's other black artists, realizing they're
no longer limited by their country's horizon, are celebrating with
an outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally destroyed by apartheid and prison,'' says
Davies, now 63. ``But I searched for direction, and I discovered
making art. I learned to paint and to draw, and that transformed my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the idea of an African renaissance is all about:
the divine human gift of creation and the right of a person,
regardless of color, to share the product of that creation with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's about excavating a culture strangled by years of white
colonial rule and nourishing and encouraging the remains.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a country that has always hugged tight to the Cape of
Good Hope, dreaming of discovering itself, finding ''fortitude and
soul in time to accompany the world into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It was once merely about survival. Now it is about claiming
space. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TODAY'S BUZZWORD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``African renaissance'' has been a buzzword in today's South
Africa since newly inaugurated president Thabo Mbeki and former
president and national hero Nelson Mandela adopted it as a mantra
of their administrations.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted South Africa to experience an economic renaissance,
a rebirth into the global economy. They cited it in their speeches,
formed committees to chronicle it and whispered it into the ears of
their citizens until the idea became national ideology, and it
spread to the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Africans, we are the children of the abyss, who have
sustained a backward march for half a millennium,'' said Mbeki in
his inaugural address June 17. ``We have been a source for human
slaves. Our countries were turned into the patrimony of colonial
powers. We have been victim to our own African predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being certain that not always were we the children of the
abyss, we will do what we have to do to achieve our own
renaissance.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRATING FREEDOM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance's dawn is fragmented and still dim in the far
reaches of the country, parts of which are just now receiving
electricity, paved roads, and other modern standbys.
</P>
<P>
   These settlements, where art is chiefly the beadwork of the
Xhosa tribes (an adopted practice fueled by tourism dollars) or the
brightly painted homes of the Ndebele and Venda tribes, are just
poised to enter this century as the rest of the country prepares
for the next.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in juxtaposition, metropolitan South African cities, such as
Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg (where bars even serve a mixed
drink called the ``African renaissance''), are basking in freedom,
experimentation and a celebration of space.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the end of apartheid is evident in the art community,
where contemporary black art increasingly flows: sensory, personal
and free.
</P>
<P>
   Black artists are again sharing exhibition space with white
artists, art supply stores are welcoming patrons of all colors, and
public arts education is again available to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a culture is being reclaimed and revealed through art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid was a politics of space more than anything,'' says
black Johannesburg painter and curator David Koloane. ``Much of the
apartheid legislation was denying people the right to move.''
</P>
<P>
   During apartheid, blacks were not allowed into museums outside
the company of a white, so Koloane never saw the inside of a museum
until he was in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming art is also reclaiming space,'' he says. &QL; 
CAN ART HEAL? &QL; 
The millennium will be a tough time for this quivering country, a
place of 11 official languages; a national anthem sung for the
first time in 1995; and two primary cultures, one black, one white,
each adept at avoiding a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yet folks in and out of the country are looking to art as a
beginning way to make this divide become, instead, a tightly woven
seam.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lydia Puccinelli, curator for the Smithsonian Institution
exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming art in its broadest sense, Koloane sees that black
artists as well as white artists have a way to counteract the
restrictions of the past and deal with each other from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art then provides a place for South Africans to construct
their new, complex and diverse society together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work coming out now is still politically charged.
South Africans such as Koloane and Willie Bester and his
captivity-themed ``The Notorious Green Car'' simply aren't finished
telling the world of how they suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gavin Jantjes and his starscapes, are more
thoughtful and retrospective of apartheid; his work is just sheer
celebration of unlimited, uncontrolled space.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Kay Hassan, whose ``First Time Voters'' is featured at
the Smithsonian exhibit, is writing the post-apartheid history
books with her artwork. She has captured the spirit of a country so
excited about democracy that its citizens are willing to travel for
days and wait in line for hours to exercise the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white South Africans, who always have been the minority,
are left wondering where they stand inside the country's borders;
it is nearly a case of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the black artists, many of the white artists, Sue
Williamson, for example, are fighting to come to terms with the
civil rights movement and are producing work equally critical of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel they've lost their heritage in the new world order.
The African National Congress, Mandela and Mbeki's party, isn't
saying otherwise. At Mbeki's June inauguration celebration in
Pretoria, the memorial statues of white-minority leaders such as
Barry Hertzog and Louis Botha on the grounds of the Union Building
were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, South African art on both sides of the racial divide
is seeping out of Africa, as evidenced by the Smithsonian's
exhibition. Also, plays by South African Athol Fugard have long
been in the world's consciousness; white artist Norman Catherine is
starting to gain acclaim; and as a filmmaker/playwright, William
Kentridge is a buzzword in and of himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual arts front, another black South African exhibit is
planned for the African museum in New York next year, and bits of
art by promising artists are sneaking their way into world-class
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa has yet to have a space at the Venice Biennalle
(basically the Cannes Film Festival of the art world), and,
according to South African National Gallery curator Marilyn Martin,
the government has yet to provide adequate funding for this
renaissance to occur on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That freedom remains as empty as the notion of the
renaissance, until the conditions are created for (black artists)
to fully participate,'' she says. ``And with a funding crisis, how
are we going to close the gap between the haves and the have
nots?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, South Africa on many fronts still has
leagues to cover, but it has progressed far from the days of
ignoring black South African art. &QL; 
TROUBLED PAST &QL; 
During the apartheid regime, this art was given only sympathetic
attention, rarely exhibited, and certainly not encouraged with
publicly funded education. School cost dearly, and that was money
black South Africans didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate social engineering,'' says Davies, now
chiefly a painter, ``a way to keep the black person in his place.
We were not given education that would allow us to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black South Africans were not allowed to leave the
country without special permission during apartheid, the only
available training was found in workshops like Koloane's, called
``Thupelo'' in South Africa, which means ``teaching by example.''
His workshop has now spread throughout the continent, reaching
would-be artists hungry for training, and even into India.
</P>
<P>
   At clinics like these, artists were trained to create art from
limited means, as finding supplies was a hefty undertaking. During
apartheid, blacks had to use different entrances to art supply
shops, pay at different counters, and were often not allowed inside
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the cost of supplies, which were largely not
affordable by any standard to blacks, most of whom were herded into
large concentration camplike structures on the edges of the cities
called townships: basically large dormitories that cleared the
white cities of those they saw as less than human.
</P>
<P>
   Township residents were bused to jobs in mines or factories and
paid beggars' wages, barely enough for clothing and food, let alone
oil and canvas. Yet the black South African culture triumphed even
over this, using industrial, cast-off material that was nothing
more than urban trash to create a genre called township art that
emerged in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children twisted spent soda cans into miniature
antique vehicles, wove frayed telephone wires into baskets, braided
plastic shopping bags into rugs, and sold them in the cities to
tourists to bring in extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Painted murals decorated the seedy township walls _ one of the
less censored ways many of those inside had to express their
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Theater troupes wrote and performed plays about white government
officials being tortured and killed. A movement called Soweto
poetry emerged that chronicled the horrors of living in townships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this politically charged artwork was either confiscated,
censored or destroyed, but not before people saw it, and not before
the government heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, the township art played a key role in
overthrowing apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was so passionate, so threatening, so overtly
political and hard to ignore, that the white culture, lead by the
National Party's F.W. de Klerk, either began to understand that
black oppression was a crime against man, or became so apprehensive
about the impending civil war intoned in the work and political
climate that they gave in. With this idea in their minds (or gun to
their heads) the National Party dismantled apartheid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, a country breathed. &QL; 
`NO LONGER ASHAMED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go now into the art world and know I no longer have to
bypass my color,'' says Davies, who spent many of his 11 years in
Robben Island's infamous jail at the side of Nelson Mandela. ``I
can express myself as a person, not just as a a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Koloane, who also was once imprisoned, his crime was not
carrying the card that dictated his access into white-only areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can embrace what my African brothers are doing. I no
longer have those doors closed for me. I can wake up and know that
there's nobody watching me. I can walk in any shop without being
told that I have to use a separate entrance; I am no longer ashamed
to say that I am South African, and that has changed my art.'' &QL;

VENTURA PREVAILS OVER PEROT AT REFORM PARTY CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th-6th grafs for clarifying matter; subs last graf for
rewriting) (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ In a raucous rejection of Ross Perot, the
Reform Party's national convention voted overwhelmingly Sunday to
install a chairman backed by the party's new star, Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a significant setback to Perot, who in 1992 won 19
percent of the presidential election vote, more than any other
independent candidate since 1912. His two presidential campaigns _
he ran again in 1996 _ were memorable for his charts and graphs,
and for language like his saying he was ``all ears,'' his promising
to ``get under the hood'' of the national economy and his declaring
that the national debt was like a ``crazy aunt in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   The fresh leadership can be expected to try to make the party
much more attractive to potential third-party candidates next year.
The outcome of Sunday's race was closely watched because the Reform
Party can claim one of the great pinatas in politics: Its nominee
is eligible for $12.6 million in federal money, based on Perot's
showing in his 1996 bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the more conservative Republican candidates for
president have weighed the possibility of switching to an
independent bid, and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire left the
Republican Party this month and is now running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell P Weiker Jr., the former independent governor of
Connecticut, has said he is considering seeking the Reform Party
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   Draft movements are under way for Donald Trump, the New York
real estate developer, and Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day convention climaxed with a showdown between
Perot's loyalists and backers of Ventura, the party's only major
electoral success story. The 400 delegates elected John ``Jack''
Gargan, 68, who had promised to move the party's headquarters from
Dallas, Perot's base, to his home state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed reference to Perot's staff, Gargan, whose
supporters wore ``Gargan's Geezers'' T-shirts, criticized ``control
freaks'' in the party. Gargan called Ventura's victory ``not only
the greatest thing that's happened to this party, but the greatest
thing that's happened to the third-party movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has blown away forever that old Republican and Democratic
lie that says your vote doesn't count for a third-party
candidate,'' Gargan said. To capitalize on that momentum,
especially among young voters, he said he plans a national
advertising campaign for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan took 61 percent of the vote in a run-off against Patricia
Benjamin of Cherry Hill, N.J., who had been endorsed by the
founding chairman, Russell Verney, an aide to Perot. Thomas
McLaughlin of Bartonsville, Pa., lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Verney, who is Perot's spokesman, said Sunday that Perot would
have no comment on the results of the party election.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, a retired financial consultant from Cedar Key, Fla., is
best known for a series of full-page newspaper advertisements he
bought throughout the country in 1991 calling for term limits for
members of Congress. In a reference to his signature on the
advertisements, he was nominated Sunday as ``Jack `Mad as Hell'
Gargan.'' In his speech, he said he was a regular guy and noted
playfully, ``I do have an eye for the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party grew out of petition drives for the
presidential bids of Perot, 69, who, after drawing 19 percent of
the vote in 1992, drew 8 percent in 1996. Sunday, party members
said they were grateful to Perot but that it was time for new
blood. ``A man must know his time,'' said Greg Brown, the Oklahoma
state chairman. ``He exits the stage to applause.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Perot wore ``Ross Was Right'' buttons, and some
put ``Remember Ross?'' posters in the windows of their campers,
parked in the front lot of the Hyatt Regency hotel here, where the
convention was held. Ventura's fans sported T-shirts from his
campaign, with his promise to ``Retaliate in `98.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the bounding economy and the centrist stands
of the leading candidates in both major parties, Vice President Al
Gore for the Democrats and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the
Republicans, pollsters have found mixed signals about the potential
for a third-party candidate this year. But Michael Harrison, the
publisher of Talkers magazine, the trade journal of talk radio,
said people are hungry for some excitement, so the candidate would
at least be guaranteed tremendous attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for a third party is better than ever,''
Harrison said. ``This race is the old vs. the old, the inside vs.
the inside. There's a terrible feeling of letdown, because there's
nothing to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, 48, has said he will not seek the presidency this year,
but many members hope he will run in 2004. Ventura's two top
political aides buzzed around the convention, one gumming an unlit
cigar and the other wearing a black ``Jesse Ventura, Man of
Action'' polo shirt. Their mission was to help the party attract a
presidential candidate who would draw at least 5 percent of the
vote, preserving the party's federal funding and its ballot slots.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the tension that fueled Gargan's candidacy, the
convention was hamstrung by infighting and administrative matters.
Bickering e-mail with headings like ``Re: Mavis' Reply to Kevin''
was run off by the hundreds and circulated as campaign fliers.
</P>
<P>
   All day Saturday was devoted to wrangling over which faction
from which states would be seated as delegates, and over what the
parliamentary rules would be. The convention did not take up its
platform _ the issues to motivate its members and perhaps lure new
ones _ until 10:43 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The distractions did not discourage one of the Reform Party's
more serious strategists, Michael Zumbluskas, 39, of New York City,
who ran unsuccessfully for vice chairman as ``Big Z.'' He has a
plan for using term limits to help take two New York City Council
seats for the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of crackpots in the party _ I should say
zealots,'' he said. ``But I'm not playing on the Internet, or
worrying about the rules. I'm out recruiting people.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Off the convention floor, the chief activity was a series of
draft movements encouraging famous names to seek the party's
presidential nomination. Perhaps the largest movement was for
Donald Trump, a Republican who has supported Democrats, and who
said in an interview that he had no interest in running. A ``Trump
Tribune'' was circulated, and supporters put out position papers
for him, based on quotations they found on the Internet. Ira Cohen,
65, passed around a rumor that Trump was willing to commit $40
million ``to save the Reform Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached on an airplane, Trump sounded taken aback but was coy.
``I don't know anything about what's happening,'' he said. ``But
I'm nevertheless greatly honored by all the hoopla for Trump.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Cummings of Gaithersburg, Md., has never talked to
retired Gen. Colin Powell, a Republican who has said he will never
run for national office. But she held a news conference to announce
a draft, and named herself national chairman. She vowed to collect
the signatures of 500 people who would each give $50.
</P>
<P>
   Another draft was under way for Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more serious efforts was launched on behalf of Pat
Buchanan, the conservative Republican presidential candidate, with
a champagne reception thrown by William von Raab of Virginia, who
was U.S. customs commissioner from 1980 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Von Raab's group blanketed the convention with circulars
denigrating Weicker. Von Raab's group attacked Weicker as a liberal
tax-raiser who is ``wrong for reform.''

BLACK SOUTH AFRICA FINDS VOICE IN FREEDOM FOLLOWING APARTHEID

   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVIN IN ``A'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; It was night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the starry sky seemed so large to Lionel Davies until
that instant in 1964 when he was no longer free.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South Africa's Robben
Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the freedom of the
world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him with their
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would be in prison for the next 11 years, put there for the
``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of hundreds of black people
imprisoned during the 44 years of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Davies only hoped that one day he would again stand under that
sky as a man equal to the world, and not as a black South African
activist imprisoned by cultural fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We were the pariahs of our world,'' Davies says. ``It was
humiliating to be black at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, apartheid has ended, Davies and others have
been released and South Africa's art world is waking from its long
night's sleep of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and the country's other black artists, realizing they're
no longer limited by their country's horizon, are celebrating with
an outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope.

   ``Art then provides a place for South Africans to construct
their new, complex and diverse society together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work coming out now is still politically charged.
South Africans such as Koloane and Willie Bester and his
captivity-themed ``The Notorious Green Car'' simply aren't finished
telling the world of how they suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gavin Jantjes and his starscapes, are more
thoughtful and retrospective of apartheid; his work is just sheer
celebration of unlimited, uncontrolled space.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Kay Hassan, whose ``First Time Voters'' is featured at
the Smithsonian exhibit, is writing the post-apartheid history
books with her artwork. She has captured the spirit of a country so
excited about democracy that its citizens are willing to travel for
days and wait in line for hours to exercise the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white South Africans, who always have been the minority,
are left wondering where they stand inside the country's borders;
it is nearly a case of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the black artists, many of the white artists, Sue
Williamson, for example, are fighting to come to terms with the
civil rights movement and are producing work equally critical of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel they've lost their heritage in the new world order.
The African National Congress, Mandela and Mbeki's party, isn't
saying otherwise. At Mbeki's June inauguration celebration in
Pretoria, the memorial statues of white-minority leaders such as
Barry Hertzog and Louis Botha on the grounds of the Union Building
were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, South African art on both sides of the racial divide
is seeping out of Africa, as evidenced by the Smithsonian's
exhibition. Also, plays by South African Athol Fugard have long
been in the world's consciousness; white artist Norman Catherine is
starting to gain acclaim; and as a filmmaker/playwright, William
Kentridge is a buzzword in and of himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual arts front, another black South African exhibit is
planned for the African museum in New York next year, and bits of
art by promising artists are sneaking their way into world-class
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa has yet to have a space at the Venice Biennalle
(basically the Cannes Film Festival of the art world), and,
according to South African National Gallery curator Marilyn Martin,
the government has yet to provide adequate funding for this
renaissance to occur on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That freedom remains as empty as the notion of the
renaissance, until the conditions are created for (black artists)
to fully participate,'' she says. ``And with a funding crisis, how
are we going to close the gap between the haves and the have
nots?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, South Africa on many fronts still has
leagues to cover, but it has progressed far from the days of
ignoring black South African art. &QL; 
TROUBLED PAST &QL; 
During the apartheid regime, this art was given only sympathetic
attention, rarely exhibited, and certainly not encouraged with
publicly funded education. School cost dearly, and that was money
black South Africans didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate social engineering,'' says Davies, now
chiefly a painter, ``a way to keep the black person in his place.
We were not given education that would allow us to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black South Africans were not allowed to leave the
country without special permission during apartheid, the only
available training was found in workshops like Koloane's, called
``Thupelo'' in South Africa, which means ``teaching by example.''
His workshop has now spread throughout the continent, reaching
would-be artists hungry for training, and even into India.
</P>
<P>
   At clinics like these, artists were trained to create art from
limited means, as finding supplies was a hefty undertaking. During
apartheid, blacks had to use different entrances to art supply
shops, pay at different counters, and were often not allowed inside
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the cost of supplies, which were largely not
affordable by any standard to blacks, most of whom were herded into
large concentration camplike structures on the edges of the cities
called townships: basically large dormitories that cleared the
white cities of those they saw as less than human.
</P>
<P>
   Township residents were bused to jobs in mines or factories and
paid beggars' wages, barely enough for clothing and food, let alone
oil and canvas. Yet the black South African culture triumphed even
over this, using industrial, cast-off material that was nothing
more than urban trash to create a genre called township art that
emerged in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children twisted spent soda cans into miniature
antique vehicles, wove frayed telephone wires into baskets, braided
plastic shopping bags into rugs, and sold them in the cities to
tourists to bring in extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Painted murals decorated the seedy township walls _ one of the
less censored ways many of those inside had to express their
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Theater troupes wrote and performed plays about white government
officials being tortured and killed. A movement called Soweto
poetry emerged that chronicled the horrors of living in townships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this politically charged artwork was either confiscated,
censored or destroyed, but not before people saw it, and not before
the government heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, the township art played a key role in
overthrowing apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was so passionate, so threatening, so overtly
political and hard to ignore, that the white culture, lead by the
National Party's F.W. de Klerk, either began to understand that
black oppression was a crime against man, or became so apprehensive
about the impending civil war intoned in the work and political
climate that they gave in. With this idea in their minds (or gun to
their heads) the National Party dismantled apartheid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, a country breathed. &QL; 
`NO LONGER ASHAMED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go now into the art world and know I no longer have to
bypass my color,'' says Davies, who spent many of his 11 years in
Robben Island's infamous jail at the side of Nelson Mandela. ``I
can express myself as a person, not just as a a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Koloane, who also was once imprisoned, his crime was not
carrying the card that dictated his access into white-only areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can embrace what my African brothers are doing. I no
longer have those doors closed for me. I can wake up and know that
there's nobody watching me. I can walk in any shop without being
told that I have to use a separate entrance; I am no longer ashamed
to say that I am South African, and that has changed my art.'' &QL;

HEALTH PROS HAIL ARMSTRONG'S WIN AS GREATEST COMEBACK EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lance Armstrong raced across the French countryside,
through the mountains and into Paris, his once cancer-polluted body
proving stronger than those whose worst affliction might have been
the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway around the world, Armstrong's Tour de France cycling
victory is being hailed as the greatest sports comeback ever.
</P>
<P>
   We in Seattle tend to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say I am in awe of him, given the sport,''
said Dr. Celestia Higano, an oncologist at the University of
Washington Medical Center and former bike racer.
</P>
<P>
   Now some might question whether Armstrong's feat is
unparalleled. After all, Ben Hogan was closer to death from
injuries received in a 1949 auto crash before reclaiming his place
as the best golfer on the planet. And Greco-Roman wrestler Jeff
Blatnick overcame Hodgkin's Disease to win a gold medal at the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to health professionals in our city, Armstrong has
everyone else beat. Hands down. He wins because of the demands of
his sport and the depth of his despair.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclist from Texas has faced down testicular cancer that
spread to his brain and lungs. Treatment was radiation and surgery,
the odds of survival 50-50 at best.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's body now is noticeably smaller in size, with muscle
mass wiped out by the life-saving procedures. It's a wonder he's
even clear-headed considering what he's been put through.
</P>
<P>
   ``They radiate your whole brain, not just parts where they
eradicate the tumors,'' said Higano, who treats cancer patients in
distress similar to Armstrong. ``It takes a lot to come back
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Creveling is a sports medicine physicians assistant at
Virginia Mason Medical Center and weekend bike racer. He followed
news accounts of Armstrong's recovery with great interest, duly
noting the cyclist's patient, deliberate approach to training meant
to avoid injury.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Creveling never imagined that Armstrong could rise
to such heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do this marathon for three weeks after what he's been
through, it's just incredible,'' he said. ``Just to be able to
detoxify these things shows he has a very unusual physiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John O'Kane of the UW sports medicine clinic notes that
figure skater Scott Hamilton also beat testicular cancer and
returned to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's sport, however, takes a backseat to no other in
terms of degree of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is particularly significant about cycling, and the Tour
de France, is how much the body is tested,'' O'Kane said. ``It's
the death zone. You talk about climbers who climb above 25,000
feet. It really takes a machine to do what Armstrong is doing.
There's only a few people in the world who can win that bike race.
They're all there. Yet somehow he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Creveling scoffs at French news accounts that claimed Armstrong
somehow must have used performance-enhancing drugs. He says the
accusers don't understand. More drugs had to be the last thing on
Armstrong's mind after the heavy doses forced upon him during
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think he wouldn't be using anything after all the stuff
he had to take in chemotherapy, where you were just poisoning your
body,'' Creveling said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's health-care workers say Armstrong's enormous pain
tolerance and will to succeed made him healthy again and brought
him victory at the Tour de France. Not to mention athletic
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   With cancer and cycling, it's obvious to them that Armstrong has
used one to defeat the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me with a sport you enjoy, getting back into that
sport is really an important part of getting back into life, with
your treatment,'' Higano said. ``I'm sure it's probably the same
with Armstrong. He's proving something to himself.''

TEAMS NEED TRADES _ NOW
</HEADLINE>
  ...  CORRECTS SPELLING OF BYLINE (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN BEENE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Dodgers and Angels are to salvage something from this
baseball season, then they had better circle Saturday on their
calendars.
</P>
<P>
   That's the deadline for making trades without sending a player
through waivers, and we suggest they get busy dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about making a playoff run; these two are in last place
in their respective divisions . . . and in first place in TEAM
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for both organizations to admit the hard, awful
truth: They stink; just pull the handle and flush.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we suggest each do:
</P>
<P>
   __ Dodgers: Call it chemistry or whatever, this year's edition
is no different from the ones that have imploded in recent years.
Trade 'em, trade as many of 'em as other teams will take.
</P>
<P>
   Start with Raul Mondesi. Sure, he's got tons of talent, but he
also has no idea what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   His latest escapade of staying in the bullpen after the end of
an inning instead of returning to the dugout is only the latest in
a series of selfish moves. Remember the whining Mondesi did about
being dropped in the order when he was in a monster slump? It just
shows that it's all about him, not the team.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's comments about the bullpen incident, as reported in
Sunday's Daily News, illustrates the point further. Said Mondesi:
``Why do people want to make a big deal of it? Because we are
losing? I was there because I was the (second out) last inning.
What's the problem with that?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that it looks bad, Raul. It makes you look like a
selfish brat. Have fun wherever you wind up.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Eric Karros. Forget the dependable RBI and home run
numbers Karros puts up each year. This guy is always the one saying
how early it is when the Dodgers stumble out of the gate year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Eric, games in April and May count just as much as the ones
in August and September. Maybe if the team got off to better
starts, you guys wouldn't have to worry about being 10 games back
in July. See ya.
</P>
<P>
   Dump Eric ``Often Injured'' Young. Ship out nonchalant Devon
White. Trade whomever, but find some young players who respect the
game enough to play hard every day.
</P>
<P>
   __ Angels: They've tried to model themselves after the Cleveland
Indians by tying up young position players with long-term
contracts. The problem is that the model is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is the AL Central's dominant team. But for all their
regular season success, it's netted them zero World Series titles.
Why? Because the Indians don't have enough pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing with the Angels. You can't keep slapping on retreads
_ Jack McDowell, Steve Sparks, Ken Hill, et al _ when you are going
against the Yankees, who own a stable of Cy Young Award winners.
Just ask the Texas Rangers, who've got an awesome offense but the
pitching staff of a Triple-A team.
</P>
<P>
   That means Garret Anderson and Chuck Finley have to go but only
if the Angels get pitching prospects in return. If the San
Francisco Giants are willing to part with two of their top
minor-league pitchers for Livan Hernandez, imagine what Anderson
and Finley would net.
</P>
<P>
   One final thought for both teams: Before training camps open
next spring, try some humility. Don't talk of your playoff hopes or
boast about your lineups, because it only builds the public's
expectation and gives it ammunition to fling back at you when you
find yourselves out of the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Raiders haters, rejoice. The Silver and Black will probably
wind up black and blue thanks to the NFL's schedule makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders, who finished 8-8 last season, begin the season with
what might be the toughest schedule of any team. How's this for
tough starts:
</P>
<P>
   Week 1, at Green Bay; Week 2 at Minnesota; Week 3 home vs.
Chicago (this is the easy one); Week 4 at Seattle; Week 5 home vs.
Denver; Week 6 at Buffalo; Week 7 home vs. N.Y. Jets, and Week 8
home vs. Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears and Seahawks are the only two nonplayoff teams the
Raiders face in the first eight weeks. If they win both of those
games, it's still conceivable the Raiders could be 2-6 going into
their bye week.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, Al Davis, it's early.
</P>
<P>
   __ So long, J.P. Losman, we hardly knew ya.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stanford, MIT, Harvard . . . CSUN?
</P>
<P>
   When asked after CSUN fired head football coach Ron Ponciano _
who was a players' favorite _ why athletes would want to come to
Northridge to play football, acting President Louanne Kennedy
replied: ``For the great education.''
</P>
<P>
   __ If you are wondering why the Lakers would even bother having
their summer-league entry _ which is basically a collection of CBA
guys who will never, ever see the Staples Center _ in Long Beach
run their new offense, consider this: What better place is there to
try out the triangle than at the Pyramid? &QL;

THEY'RE OUT! PHILLIPS' PLAN FOR UMPIRES A GIFT TO BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Not since O.J. Simpson's pursuit of the real killer
has a sports figure come up with such a masterful, dedicated plan
as Richie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   You may have read that Phillips, one of the more dangerous
people in the jock industry, at the baseball All-Star break
announced a plan to blow up the major league umpires union that he
runs.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to teach baseball a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   To which he received a Clint Eastwood-style response that was as
universal as it was amusing:
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, punk. Make my day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of the utter disconnect between Phillips and
sports reality that absolutely no one recoiled in fear at his
threat to have all umpires resign Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   His theory was that the enforced use of minor league and amateur
umps would throw the stretch drive into such disarray that baseball
would come screaming back to him, meeting all his union demands if
he would just be nice and reinstate his beloved arbiters.
</P>
<P>
   What he failed to recognize was that he was the lone soul in
sports who didn't know that everyone was eager to get rid of these
guys.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That isn't meant to condemn all umpires, many of whom are
quality professionals dedicated to the game and proud to be a part
of it. It's just that their collective will has come to dominate
the game to such a disproportionate degree that it warps the play.
</P>
<P>
   In the most egregious example, baseball's matter-of-fact
acceptance of differences in the American and National League
strike zones, as well as differences between umpires in each
league, has always been dumbfounding.
</P>
<P>
   The de facto system has gone unchallenged for so long no one
seems to realize it's stupid. It's mindful of the old Soviet Union,
where citizens who saw a line of people reflexively joined up, just
because that was the only way to get anything, even if the queue's
purpose was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires collectively have been so strong, and baseball's
management so weak, that the greater good of the game almost never
prevails. The point was made again recently when the National
League attempted the unprecedented _ suspending umpire Tom Hallion
for bumping a player.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the justice in the judgment was plain to anyone, the
episode was the final straw for Phillips, who plotted out his
cockamamie resignations stunt immediately thereafter. Much like
Nixon and Clinton, Phillips was persuaded that his actions and
those of his people needn't be encumbered by the rules of fairness
and law.
</P>
<P>
   Because the umpires agreed to a no-strike clause in the current
collective bargaining agreement, Phillips believed his only
leverage was to create a mass resignation, then form a corporation
that would sell umpiring services to the major leagues. It also
would force baseball to pay the umpires about $15 million in
severance.
</P>
<P>
   What he apparently didn't figure on was that he created perhaps
the one issue in baseball's brutally contentious labor history upon
which players and owners can agree _ the best move with umpiring is
to start over, even if it costs $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball needs to seize this rare opportunity. The game needs to
centralize the umpiring instead of operating by leagues. Umpire
training needs to be done by a baseball academy, not an independent
umpiring school.
</P>
<P>
   Performance standards need to be established, as they are in
other major sports, so an umpire can be dismissed if he's unfit
physically or emotionally. Behavior standards need to be created
too, not just for physical contact but for engaging in macho,
trash-mouthed tirades just because a player or manager stoops to
childishness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It isn't necessary to bust the union, because the umpires still
need protection. Baseball is, after all, baseball, an utterly
chaotic monopoly that will exploit every citizen, government,
player, umpire and sponsor in the quest for an easier buck.
</P>
<P>
   And Phillips has not been without his virtues. As union head
since 1978, he's inspired loyalty by negotiating major improvements
in wages, benefits and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the increasing defections from his scheme, at
least some members realize that when it comes to cliff-jumping,
loyalty has its limits. Baseball has begun signing potential
replacements and many umpires realize that Phillips has hung a fat
curve in baseball's wheelhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Said 16-year umpiring veteran Tim Welke: ``Those who follow this
guy (Phillips) are going to be led to doom.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' time is more than over. His latest maneuver epitomizes
the arrogance that permeates the umpiring world. They have the
mistaken impression that fans have come to see them, that they
control baseball, and their needs prevail above all others.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the roles remain essential. But as with an automotive
transmission, just because one is needed isn't the reason a car is
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, baseball umpires are going to have to be as
accountable as everyone else in life above the age of 2.

LYING IS THE NAME OF THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  This is going to be a tough month for the judges, so you
nominees, please get your bribes in as soon as possible, to avoid
the rush.
<P>
   There is a dazzling lineup of contenders for the coveted Liar of
the Month award. Did I say liar? My keyboard malfunctioned. This is
an award for the veracity challenged, for drinkers of Truth Lite.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody loses. Every nominee receives a handsome desktop
paper weight engraved: ``The buck? What buck? Nobody passed  &UR; me &LR; 
any buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, congratulations to our several San Francisco Bay
Area nominees in this national contest. And a judges' note: The
49ers are being investigated by the NFL on charges that they
cheated on the league's salary cap. This would be a major breach of
ethics and sportsmanship and would make 49ers officials liars,
liars, pants on fire. But it would be unfair to give them credit
until all the evidence is in.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes, please:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RIVER WILD:'' Al Gore, who is paddling for president, took
a canoe trip on the Connecticut River in New Hampshire with state
Governor Jeanne Shaheen. It made for cute pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Gore looks like Hiawatha's canoe-certification instructor, Stiff
Paddle. And where's Al's wife? I guess you don't go canoeing with
someone named Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: There was very little water in the river, and
nobody looks good paddling a canoe on mud, so somebody ordered the
floodgates opened, even though the area is suffering a drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't release water for fish when we ask them to,'' said
John Kassel, a state official, ``but somehow, they find themselves
able to release it for a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kassel said he was misquoted and that the water release was
``absolutely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   After the canoe trip, Gore announced a $100,000 federal grant
for the river commission. So it was a $100,000 photo op.
</P>
<P>
   This, incidentally, is the same Al Gore who began his vice
presidency vowing to wage war on government waste and excess.
</P>
<P>
   Who exactly is the liar here, you ask? This one is entered in
our contest's team competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``BAD CODE'': Providian Financial of San Francisco charged
improper late fees to credit-card holders at least 700,000 times.
And ignored the pleas and protests of the over-billed. Until the
heat came down. Then Prov blamed the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the heat's really on, Providian officials explain that
it was simply a bad computer code.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify the situation, Providian officials plan to hold the
code's nose down in the mess it made on the carpet and say, ``Bad
code! Bad code!''
</P>
<P>
   ``BLEEP THE WAVES'': Royal Caribbean Cruises employees wear
``Save the waves'' buttons, but they also dump tons of toxic,
illegal and yucky stuff into the waves. So Royal agreed to pay an
$18 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   A spinperson for Royal said, ``The majority of these violations
reflect a lapse in our enforcement efforts, not a lapse in our
corporate conscience or our commitment to protecting the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   If those words were dumped into the ocean, Royal's fine would be
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   TV note: Royal ships will star in a new fall series, ``Love
Canal Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CONFESSION BOX'': Catholic Bishop Patrick Ziemann of Santa
Rosa denied that he had sex with Father Jorge Salas, as Salas
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ziemann admitted that, hey, OK, he did have sex with that
man, Father Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Salas says he was forced into the sex over a three-year period,
fearing Ziemann would blow the whistle (excuse the expression) on
him for stealing church money.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody is fibbing. Maybe everyone. The matter has been
referred to God for investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``DR. STRANGELOVE'': Congress claims the Pentagon sneakily and
illegally spends billions on programs that were shut down by
Congress. Which says a lot about Congress and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, secretary of defense, explained that Pentagon
officials sometimes struggle with inconsistent advice from the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistent advice like, ``Yo, Pentagon! Terminate the Medium
Altitude Air Defense program, pronto.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth ``Bringin' Home the'' Bacon said,
``We work very hard to respond to the direction Congress gives us.
Do we get it right 100 percent of the time? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon didn't say what percentage of the time the Pentagon does
get it right, but experts say the Pentagon's batting average is
roughly equivalent to that of a typical major league backup
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``YOU SAY BANANAS'': A Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
researcher made up data in studies that linked exposure to
electromagnetic fields to cancer, according to a federal watchdog
agency. Of course, who can trust a federal agency?
</P>
<P>
   The scientist says in his own defense, ``They are not talking
about the data being invalid. They are talking about the
interpretation of the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Yada-yada-data.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the data simply had a bad code.
</P>
<P>
   ``HAIL TO THE AX'': When Hillary Clinton arrived at the Kennedy
Space Center to watch the launch of the space shuttle Columbia, an
Orlando TV news anchorman reported, ``Just moments ago, the first
lady rolled in.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, thinking his mike was shut off as the film rolled,
anchordoofus Steve Rondinaro said, ``There she comes, the old
battle ax.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, instead of being nominated for an Emmy for honest
reporting, Rondinaro was criticized by station management.
</P>
<P>
   The contest judges love Rondinaro's on-air apology:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please rest assured that I have the highest respect for the
first lady and her role ...''
</P>
<P>
   As a battle ax.

SUSPECT IN YOSEMITE BEHEADING LINKED TO TRIPLE SLAYING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By STACY FINZ, MICHAEL TAYLOR and JAXON VAN DERBEKEN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Cary Stayner _ member of a family traumatized
years ago by the sensational kidnapping of his brother Steven _ is
expected to be charged Monday in the decapitation slaying of a
naturalist and has been named by the FBI as the prime suspect in
the February slayings of three Yosemite tourists.
<P>
   In a dramatic press conference Sunday, FBI Special Agent in
Charge James Maddock announced that Stayner, a 37-year-old
maintenance man, was arrested Saturday at a nudist camp near
Sacramento. He is scheduled to appear Monday in U.S. District Court
in Sacramento on charges that he killed Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, an
environmental educator whose decapitated body was found Thursday at
Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday marked the first time that the FBI had officially named
anyone as a suspect in the disappearance of Carole Sund, her
15-year-old daughter Julie and their 16-year-old friend Silvina
Pelosso. Until now, authorities have said that the key participants
in their killings were all behind bars on unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last 24 hours, we have developed specific
information linking Stayner to the Sund-Pelosso murders,'' said
Maddock, who declined to elaborate. ``With Stayner's arrest, we
believe that no other people in any of these murders are still on
the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's belated naming of Stayner seemed to bring a sense of
finality to the Sund family, which has endured months of waiting
for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that the case is coming to a close,'' said Carole
Sund's mother, Carole Carrington. Her husband, Francis, said, ``I
feel so sad for the Armstrong family. I'm so sad that we could not
have resolved this sooner and saved someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was questioned early in the Sund-Pelosso investigation,
but was excluded as a suspect. He worked as a maintenance man at
the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, where the three slain sightseers were
last seen alive February 15.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge is about four miles from the spot where Armstrong's
body was discovered Thursday afternoon near her small home at the
western edge of the park. Armstrong She &LR;  was reported missing
Thursday morning after failing to arrive at a friend's house in
Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   A tip eventually led FBI agents to Stayner in connection with
Armstrong's killing. Investigators then later found undisclosed
evidence and information that linked Stayner to the Sund-Pelosso
killings, Maddock said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Maddock appeared to be trying to head off potential
criticism that the FBI had made a mistake by initially overlooking
Stayner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself if we could have done anything differently that
would have prevented the death of Joie Armstrong,'' he said
reflectively. ``I've struggled with that over the last 24 hours,
and I continue to do so ... (but) I'm confident that we've done
everything that reasonably could have been done.``
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was arrested Saturday morning at Laguna del Sol, a
``clothing-optional resort'' in Wilton, about 25 miles southeast of
Sacramento. A woman he met there notified the FBI of his
whereabouts after seeing a television report that authorities
wanted to question him about Armstrong's death.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest is the latest blow to a family that has already
suffered much tragedy. Stayner is the older brother of Steven
Stayner, who was kidnapped from a Merced street in December 1972
and sexually abused by his kidnapper for more than seven years. He
escaped in March 1980 and was reunited with his family, only to be
killed nine years later in a motorcycle crash at the age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the whole Stayner family was pretty well traumatized
by the Steven kidnapping,'' Bill Bailey, the now-retired Merced
chief of detectives who supervised the Steven Stayner kidnapping
case, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the family suffered the effects of another violent
crime when the boys' uncle, Jerry Stayner, was killed in his home
in December 1990 in Merced.
</P>
<P>
   Merced County Assistant Sheriff Henry Strength said his
department is now reopening its investigation into the uncle's
death and looking at Cary Stayner. ``We are looking at him to see
if there is any connection with him and his uncle's death,''
Strength said. ``Any time we get information on an open homicide,
we need to take a look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not comment as to whether Cary Stayner had been
a suspect at the time his uncle was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities, meanwhile, are being very secretive about
why they think Stayner was involved with the sightseers' slayings.
They did say, however, that there was no known connection between
Stayner and a number of people who are currently in jail and are
unofficially considered suspects in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had found fibers and other physical evidence that
connected a loose-knit group of Central Valley ex-convicts to the
February abductions. But law enforcement officials were still
working on the entire puzzle and had not charged anyone with the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do look forward to the day when I can share the details,''
Maddock said. ``I can't, unfortunately, discuss specific steps that
were taken or not taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was hired in August 1997 as a maintenance worker at the
Cedar Lodge in El Portal, the same hotel where the three tourists
had been staying on their sightseeing trip to the Yosemite area in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was laid off in January of this year, when business
slowed down. He was rehired on March 20, a day after the bodies of
Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso were found in their rental car's
badly burned trunk in nearby Tuolumne County. Federal agents
discovered Julie Sund's body a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Yosemite Institute, which employed Armstrong as a
naturalist, maintains its main office in El Portal and has some
housing there for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Maddock said Sunday that there was no evidence that Stayner and
Armstrong had a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   From his drawn and haggard look, as well as his clipped tone, it
appeared that Maddock was disturbed by the most recent twist in the
Sund-Pelosso murders, the high-profile case he has been supervising
for the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   He said that earlier in the long investigation, agents had
publicly said they thought they had the key players in the
sightseers' slayings behind bars. ``That was my sincere belief at
the time,'' he said. ``But in light of (Saturday's) arrest, that's
been re-evaluated.''

   GUN-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ The perverse effect of gun
control laws: concern about gun violence stirs legislative interest
in gun control; the ensuing controversy energizes demand for guns
among people who fear they may soon disappear from stores;
manufacturers and distributors build up inventories to handle the
new business; gun control measures that eventually pass are deeply
compromised; the result is a net increase in gun ownership. By
David C. Anderson. (Story has moved in `a' category.) WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-JEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iran's arrest of 13 Iranian Jews
on spying charges earlier this year was a menacing sign that bigger
trouble might lie ahead _ trouble that could lead to the last
Jewish community of any size in the Middle East outside Israel
following others into virtual oblivion. A look at the history of
troubles of Jews in Mideastern countries other than Israel. By John
F. Burns. (Story has moved in `i' category.)

<P>
   SEXISM-VOCABULARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Misogyny, a term referring
to men's hatred of women, has long been in common use, but
misandry, a term referring to women's hatred of men, has not, and
appears in few dictionaries. But misandry is currently being seen,
if not heard, more than ever, reflecting an escalation in the
behavior it describes. Misandrous humor is now politically correct.

   MAKESHIFT-SHRINES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some see kitschy makeshift
shrines for victims of publicized tragedy, such as John Kennedy
Jr., as distasteful exhibitionism, another version of venting on
talk radio or confessing sleazy secrets on daytime TV. Others
believe that our celebrity culture has enabled people to replace
the joy and heartbreak of real intimacy with phony _ and
undemanding _ emotional connections. By Jane Gross.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-RIVALS-REVIEW (Washington) _ For all the accepted wisdom
that George W. Bush will be the Republican presidential nominee,
nine other candidates are persevering and insisting that the race
has not ended before it began. They all (mostly with straight
faces) happily spin scenarios of how they could lasso the prize
Texas longhorn. A look at some possible scenarios. By Richard L.
Berke.

<P>
   STRIP-SEARCH-REVIEW (New York) _ Recent court decisions
restricting correction officials' authority to conduct strip
searches may force them to rethink a policy that has been effective
in keeping drugs and weapons out of detention centers and reducing
violence in jails. Critics say the officials who authorized
searches later judged illegal either misunderstood, ignored or were
unaware of established legal boundaries defining who could be
strip-searched. By Kevin Flynn.

<P>
   VIDEO-CAMERAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why would professional
athletes, who have spent their careers striving for the celebratory
moments that follow a championship victory, opt instead to stand on
the sidelines videotaping teammates as they jump and scream and
enjoy the moment? To these children of the postmodern,
media-drenched age, is recording the mement more important than
being a part of it? By Ed Wyatt.

<P>
   ANTHROPO-ANIMALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Making animals human: Seeing
a highly intelligent creature like a dolphin or a chimpanzee,
people cannot resist imputing to it whatever human feelings would
be appropriate for the context. This is probably part of our
genetic programming. The whole art of living in social groups,
after all, is to figure out the intentions of other members and to
act accordingly. People do this without thinking, and almost any
fellow mammal will trip the reflex. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   TASTELESS-TV-ADS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ One sign of the
coarsening of culture is gross-out TV commercials. An increasing
number of ads follow the same rationale that films and TV shows do:
If you shock with crudeness, lewdness or violence, people pay
attention, especially those who equate frankness with hipness.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PROMISES-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton has
boasted about keeping the promises he made in his first
presidential campaign. An objective examination reveals that he did
reach many of the goals he set in 1992, tried but was thwarted by
political opponents on some, and never even attempted to achieve
others. By David E. Rosenbaum.

   AFRICA-INTERVENTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Suppose the United States
and Europe responded to the charges arising from Africa that they
are indifferent racists willing to spend $1.50 per Kosovo refugee
but only 11 cents per African refugee. Suppose they actually tried

   &UR; AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF RED: A NOVEL IN VERSE &LR;  By Anne Carson. Vintage
Contemporaries, $12. In this literary hybrid, a poet and scholar
reimagines an ancient Greek myth as a destructive love affair
between Hercules and a winged red monster, who also happens to be a
gifted American boy. ``Carson writes in language any poet would
kill for: sensuous and funny, poignant, musical and tender,'' Ruth
Padel wrote last year in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUMMER OF DELIVERANCE: A MEMOIR OF FATHER AND SON &LR;  By
Christopher Dickey. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14. This angry,
affectionate account portrays the author's father, the brilliant
but unstable James Dickey, as a chronic liar and boozer who felt
compelled to reinvent himself every day. Yet Dickey, best known for
his novel ``Deliverance,'' was also a magnetic showman and an
enthusiastic parent who managed to earn the love of his children.
```Summer of Deliverance' contains more sex and violence and
alcohol and celebrity high jinks than a year's worth of tabloids,''
David Kirby wrote in 1998. ``But it contains poetry, too, and a
father-son conflict worthy of the pen of a Sophocles.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OYSTER &LR;  By Janette Turner Hospital. Norton, $14. At the center
of this dreamlike novel, set in a parched mining town in the
Australian outback, are a charismatic cult leader and his
followers, who may or may not be responsible for the disappearance
of strangers who turn up looking for lost sons and daughters. ``It
is both a rare story and an accomplished piece of writing,'' Dale
Peck wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE SERVICE OF CLOUDS &LR; , by Delia Falconer (Picador USA,
$13), a pharmacist's assistant falls in love with a half-mad
photographer who arrives in her frontier outpost in Australia's
Blue Mountains in 1907 to take pictures of clouds. Last year the
reviewer Deirdre McNamer called this first novel ``an exuberant
meditation on the `history of the air,' the art of seeing and the
end of romance as the pre-moderns knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECOLOGY OF FEAR: LOS ANGELES AND THE IMAGINATION OF DISASTER &LR; 
By Mike Davis. Vintage, $14. This fervid polemic on southern
California's alarming natural history _ and the social and
psychological forces it has unleashed _ raised a lot of hackles
among critics who attacked the author's methods and some of his
assertions. Last year the reviewer William Finnegan praised
``Davis' great intellectual breadth and agility.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; PARADISE LOST: CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE, AMERICA'S FUTURE &LR; ,
by Peter Schrag (University of California, $14.95), a journalist
links the decline in the state's public services and financial
health to the advent of rule by voter initiative. In 1998 in The
New York Times Book Review, Nicholas Lemann called this an ``angry
and persuasive book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAILING ALONE AROUND THE WORLD &LR;  By Joshua Slocum. Edited by
Thomas Philbrick. Penguin, $7.95. The author of this true-life
ripping yarn tells how he braved stormy seas, narrowly escaped
pirates and met the explorer Henry Stanley during his three-year,
46,000-mile circumnavigation in a 40-foot sloop at the turn of the
century. His lively memoir is ``full of interest to lovers of
adventures,'' The New York Times wrote in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUT OF SHEER RAGE: WRESTLING WITH D.H. LAWRENCE &LR;  By Geoff Dyer.
North Point, $13. The author set out to write a scholarly study of
Lawrence but came up instead with this wild, meandering book, which
includes musings on everything from Italian drivers to his own
hatred of seafood. ``Unsystematically and with great humor, it
lights up what really matters to him about his hero,'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The New York Times last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHITE BOYS: STORIES &LR;  By Reginald McKnight. Owl/Holt, $13. Most
of the characters in these stories are middle-class blacks seeking
to make connections across the color divide, and weary of the
script that society has given them. ``What wins you over ... is
McKnight's attentiveness to the complexities of racial
antagonism,'' Rand Richards Cooper wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIG CON: THE STORY OF THE CONFIDENCE MAN &LR;  By David W.
Maurer. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. A linguistics professor explores
the world of grifters and scam artists, and the many means by which
``marks'' (victims) are ``taken off'' (cheated). The book,
originally published in 1940, is ``entertainment for crime
literature addicts'' and ``a textbook for prospective confidence
men,'' Edward Frank Allen wrote in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CORDELIA UNDERWOOD: OR, THE MARVELOUS BEGINNINGS OF THE
MOOSEPATH LEAGUE &LR;  By Van Reid. Penguin, $12.95. This genial first
novel, which takes place in Maine in 1896, has to do with a young
woman who inherits some land from her seafaring uncle, but it's
laced with red herrings and a bunch of eccentric locals with
stories of their own. ``Reid's gazillion characters sparkle,'' Kit
Reed wrote in 1998. ``Escapists will be charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLAIRVOYANT &LR;  By Marian Thurm. Harper Paperbacks, $6.50.
Victor Mackenzie is a psychic loose cannon who can't control what
he sees and who longs for a little mystery in his life. He gets his
wish when he gazes at the palm of a single mother whose future
involves not only her but him. In 1997 the reviewer Peter Lefcourt
called this an ``entertaining novel.''

<P>
   Like most California gun shop owners, Louis Baldridge complains
about the law that Gov. Gray Davis signed July 19. ``People see
that the state government has overstepped itself,'' he says of the
restrictions on assault weapons, and he welcomes talk of a ballot
initiative that might repeal them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Baldridge finds himself complaining all the way
to the bank. However objectionable, he says, the law has
``definitely increased business'' at his shop in El Cajon, near San
Diego, as customers rush to purchase assault weapons before it
takes effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar, if perverse, syndrome: Concern about gun
violence stirs legislative interest in gun control; the ensuing
controversy energizes demand for guns among people who fear they
may soon disappear from stores. Manufacturers and distributors then
build up inventories to handle the new business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, measures that eventually pass are deeply compromised;
the result is a net increase in gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the tragedy of ineffective laws,'' observes Tom Diaz,
author of ``Making a Killing,'' (The New Press, 1999) a tough new
analysis of the firearms industry. ``You have the run-up in sales,
then you have a law that doesn't deal with the problem. People get
jaded, disillusioned with gun control.'' Such disillusionment has
prompted cities to sue firearms manufacturers in hopes of achieving
more effective gun control through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and others point to the 1994 federal law that banned an
array of assault weapons by name and those with design features
distinguishing them for military use; it also banned magazines
holding 10 rounds or more. But it exempted existing weapons in
legal hands nationwide before Sept. 13, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at the Urban Institute, Jeffrey A. Roth and
Christopher S. Koper, found that prices of guns and magazines
subject to the ban rose 50 percent or more, in some cases doubling,
as the bill was being debated in 1993 and 1994, then declined after
the bill passed. Prices of other guns remained stable during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Roth and Koper also found that manufacturers boosted production
to take advantage of surging demand and premium prices. Output of
five banned models remained steady at about 91,000 guns per year
from 1989 to 1993, then more than doubled to about 204,000 in 1994.
During the same period, annual production of certain unbanned guns
fell from an average of 283,000 to 184,000.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz reports that high-capacity magazine producers not only
stepped up production and hoarded inventories as the law headed for
passage; they also negotiated trade-ins of guns used by police and
other law enforcement agencies, thereby obtaining many pre-ban
magazines that remained perfectly legal to sell on the civilian
market.
</P>
<P>
   The new California assault weapons law reflects the failures of
a state law passed in 1989. That law banned sales of assault
weapons by name and empowered the state attorney general to add
similar new guns to the list, subject to court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers responded with cosmetic changes and new names for
guns, but when the attorney general asked the court to add one of
these ``copycat'' weapons to the banned list, judges questioned
giving courts the power to ban guns. The issue remains on appeal,
and the post-ban assault weapons continue to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gun control are more hopeful about the measure
enacted last week. Rather than relying on a list of names and
models, it bans the manufacture, sale or other transfer of any gun
with one or more of the characteristics that define assault
weapons, like pistol grips and barrel shrouds. The new law also
exempts such guns now legally owned and requires their
registration.
</P>
<P>
   But it forbids their sale or transfer, even as part of an
estate. When an owner dies, the banned gun will have to be shipped
out of California, destroyed or turned in to the police. ``In one
generation, all these weapons will be gone'' from the state,
predicts Louis Tolley of the California office of Handgun Control
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such confidence is justified remains to be seen,
however, given gun makers' ingenuity. In his book, Diaz documents
industry pride in ``rule-beating'' guns that appeared after the
1989 California law, the 1994 Federal law and other local measures.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Helsley, the Nation Rifle Association's liaison for the
state, ridicules the law's attempt to base a ban on design
features, noting its reference to ``a pistol grip that protrudes
conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that by the first of the year, there will be a
`California grip,' which will allow everyone to do a part swap'' _
exchanging a removable illegal grip with a legal one for purposes
of compliance. As part of his campaign against the law, he
distributed illustrated instructions for such a modification.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the law argue that it remains a positive step
despite the sales surge and the chance for new evasions of its
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Garen Wintemute, a California emergency room physician who
also researches gun issues, points out that pre-ban increases in
gun sales tend to be short-lived. The Roth-Koper study, for
example, found that assault weapons sales plunged and prices fell
after 1994 ``apparently under the combined weight of preban
overproduction of grandfathered guns and the introduction of new
legal substitute guns at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wintemute also notes that while sales may have increased before
the 1989 California ban and the 1994 federal ban, the proliferation
caused no detectable increase in crime and may have reduced it.
Roth and Koper calculate that the 1994 law contributed to a decline
in the nation's murder rate in 1995. The researchers speculate that
most of the customers who drive up sales before a ban are
collectors and speculators rather than criminals; their rush to
acquire assault weapons may even divert them from the criminal
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the impact is on production,'' Wintemute
concludes. ``My interest is in the impact of bans generally on the
incidence of violence.'' But it's still an open question whether
guns acquired by collectors and speculators will eventually find
their way into criminal hands.
</P>
<P>
   California, in any case, is once again the laboratory for ban
research: Despite hoopla over its signing last week, the new law
doesn't take effect until Jan. 1. As a result, manufacturers and
distributors have another five months to sell as many assault
weapons as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer is saying, `Get it now because you won't be able
to get it again,''' declares Baldridge, the El Cajon dealer. ``The
more they go after guns, the more people buy them.''

author of ``Making a Killing,'' (The New Press, 1999) a tough new
analysis of the firearms industry. ``You have the run-up in sales,
then you have a law that doesn't deal with the problem. People get
jaded, disillusioned with gun control.'' Such disillusionment has
prompted cities to sue firearms manufacturers in hopes of achieving
more effective gun control through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and others point to the 1994 federal law that banned an
array of assault weapons by name and those with design features
distinguishing them for military use; it also banned magazines
holding 10 rounds or more. But it exempted existing weapons in
legal hands nationwide before Sept. 13, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at the Urban Institute, Jeffrey A. Roth and
Christopher S. Koper, found that prices of guns and magazines
subject to the ban rose 50 percent or more, in some cases doubling,
as the bill was being debated in 1993 and 1994, then declined after
the bill passed. Prices of other guns remained stable during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Roth and Koper also found that manufacturers boosted production
to take advantage of surging demand and premium prices. Output of
five banned models remained steady at about 91,000 guns per year
from 1989 to 1993, then more than doubled to about 204,000 in 1994.
During the same period, annual production of certain unbanned guns
fell from an average of 283,000 to 184,000.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz reports that high-capacity magazine producers not only
stepped up production and hoarded inventories as the law headed for
passage; they also negotiated trade-ins of guns used by police and
other law enforcement agencies, thereby obtaining many pre-ban
magazines that remained perfectly legal to sell on the civilian
market.
</P>
<P>
   The new California assault weapons law reflects the failures of
a state law passed in 1989. That law banned sales of assault
weapons by name and empowered the state attorney general to add
similar new guns to the list, subject to court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers responded with cosmetic changes and new names for
guns, but when the attorney general asked the court to add one of
these ``copycat'' weapons to the banned list, judges questioned
giving courts the power to ban guns. The issue remains on appeal,
and the post-ban assault weapons continue to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gun control are more hopeful about the measure
enacted last week. Rather than relying on a list of names and
models, it bans the manufacture, sale or other transfer of any gun
with one or more of the characteristics that define assault
weapons, like pistol grips and barrel shrouds. The new law also
exempts such guns now legally owned and requires their
registration.
</P>
<P>
   But it forbids their sale or transfer, even as part of an
estate. When an owner dies, the banned gun will have to be shipped
out of California, destroyed or turned in to the police. ``In one
generation, all these weapons will be gone'' from the state,
predicts Louis Tolley of the California office of Handgun Control
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such confidence is justified remains to be seen,
however, given gun makers' ingenuity. In his book, Diaz documents
industry pride in ``rule-beating'' guns that appeared after the
1989 California law, the 1994 Federal law and other local measures.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Helsley, the Nation Rifle Association's liaison for the
state, ridicules the law's attempt to base a ban on design
features, noting its reference to ``a pistol grip that protrudes
conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that by the first of the year, there will be a
`California grip,' which will allow everyone to do a part swap'' _
exchanging a removable illegal grip with a legal one for purposes
of compliance. As part of his campaign against the law, he
distributed illustrated instructions for such a modification.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the law argue that it remains a positive step
despite the sales surge and the chance for new evasions of its
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Garen Wintemute, a California emergency room physician who
also researches gun issues, points out that pre-ban increases in
gun sales tend to be short-lived. The Roth-Koper study, for
example, found that assault weapons sales plunged and prices fell
after 1994 ``apparently under the combined weight of preban
overproduction of grandfathered guns and the introduction of new
legal substitute guns at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wintemute also notes that while sales may have increased before
the 1989 California ban and the 1994 federal ban, the proliferation
caused no detectable increase in crime and may have reduced it.
Roth and Koper calculate that the 1994 law contributed to a decline
in the nation's murder rate in 1995. The researchers speculate that
most of the customers who drive up sales before a ban are
collectors and speculators rather than criminals; their rush to
acquire assault weapons may even divert them from the criminal
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the impact is on production,'' Wintemute
concludes. ``My interest is in the impact of bans generally on the
incidence of violence.'' But it's still an open question whether
guns acquired by collectors and speculators will eventually find
their way into criminal hands.
</P>
<P>
   California, in any case, is once again the laboratory for ban
research: Despite hoopla over its signing last week, the new law
doesn't take effect until Jan. 1. As a result, manufacturers and
distributors have another five months to sell as many assault
weapons as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer is saying, `Get it now because you won't be able
to get it again,''' declares Baldridge, the El Cajon dealer. ``The
more they go after guns, the more people buy them.''

   David Cone won 20 games for the New York Yankees last year, but
after the season _ when other pitchers were signing deals for as
much as $105 million _ he received a polite one-year, $8 million
offer from the Yankees, who were concerned about his shoulder. At
36, Cone had thrown as many as 100,000 pitches in his major-league
career and he was only three years removed from an aneursym that
affects the feeling in his fingertips on cold days. Despite much
more lucrative overtures from the Los Angeles Dodgers and Baltimore
Orioles, Cone accepted the Yankees' deal to remain in the city he
loves.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by acupuncture and deep massage in spring training, Cone
felt his shoulder strengthen. Last Sunday, less than a week after
he pitched in the All-Star Game, Cone was electric against the
Montreal Expos. His slider, diving away from right-handed batters,
was so extraordinary that even in the early innings, a no-hitter
seemed almost inevitable; Orlando Cabrera, the ninth-place hitter
for the Expos, said that in the sixth inning, he already was
thinking about being the last out in a perfect game. Throwing just
88 pitches, Cone completed the 16th perfect game in history _ 27
batters, no hits, no walks, no errors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were stranger-than-fiction coincidences: Don Larsen
threw the first perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World
Series and attended the same high school as David Wells, who threw
the second Yankee perfect game last year _ and by chance or fate,
Larsen was in Yankee Stadium to throw out the first ball before
Cone's gem, and was in the clubhouse afterward to greet him with a
bear hug. &QL;

   Hospital Inspections Crticized
</P>
<P>
   Patients face life-threatening risks because the private
organization inspecting the nation's hospitals is ``unlikely to
detect substandard patterns of care,'' federal investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services, harshly criticized the work of the inspectors
from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations, who announce their visits in advance and rely on
hospital employees to select records, so clinical problems could be
easily hidden.

   Pentagon Misspending Spree  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon defied the law and the Constitution by spending
hundreds of millions of dollars on programs Congress never
approved, the House Appropriations Committee charged. The Defense
Department acknowledged failing to notify Congress about how it was
spending taxpayers' funds, and admitted that the Air Force had
started a super-secret ``black program'' without telling anyone, an
act the House panel said broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we have to do to make them understand what we mean
when we say no?'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis, Republican of California
and chairman of the committee's defense spending panel.

</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To those who monitor events in Iran, the arrest of 13 Iranian
Jews on spying charges this year is a menacing sign that bigger
trouble may lie ahead _ trouble that, unchecked, could cause one of
the last two Jewish communities of any size in the Islamic Middle
East to follow most of the others into virtual oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Until the arrests, Jews in Iran had survived the 20-year
dominion of Iran's ruling ayatollahs better than many feared in
1979, when the Islamic republic was declared. In fact, the 30,000
Jews in Iran, while down from the 80,000 who lived there before the
revolution, constitute the largest Jewish community to have
survived in the Muslim Middle East and North Africa. The only other
one of similar size is in Turkey, another non-Arab country, where
about 20,000 Jews remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Jews' significance becomes clearer when their
endurance is measured against what happened elsewhere after the
birth of Israel. From Morocco through Algeria, Tunisia, Libya,
Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Turkey, Jewish communities
that totaled perhaps 1 million people in 1948 dwindled between the
1950s and 1980s to the point that barely 60,000 _ including the
50,000 in Iran and Turkey _ remain.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Iran's Jews must worry that tactics used against Jewish
minorities elsewhere could erode their security, making migration
more attractive. For the time being, the U.S. and European
diplomats who have been leading a discreet campaign to persuade
Iran to drop the spying charges remain hopeful. They point to the
opprobrium that would be sure to fall on Iran if the cases come to
trial, or _ improbable, but still possible, in the view of experts
on Iran _ if the Jews were convicted and sentenced to long prison
terms or death.
</P>
<P>
   The case has unfolded slowly. When the first of the 13 was
arrested in January, the State Department kept the matter quiet,
hoping diplomacy could resolve the issue. But that had not happened
by early June, when Iran announced the arrests over the state
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The spying charges bear every earmark of a trumped-up case.
Those arrested _ including a rabbi, three Hebrew teachers, a kosher
butcher and even, by some reports, a 16-year-old boy _ were
originally picked up for alleged infringements of Iranian laws that
conflict with Jewish practices. The rabbi was charged with teaching
Hebrew, the language of Jewish prayer; others were accused of
closing their shops on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Their actions were condemned as evidence of disloyalty to Iran,
and thus as proof that those arrested were in the service of
``world arrogance'' and ``the Zionist entity,'' meaning the United
States and Israel. By escalating infractions of religious laws into
treason, the conservatives who control Iran's police and courts
evidently hoped to stir antagonism toward the West and place fresh
obstacles before Iran's reformist president, Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   By no coincidence, the charges originated in the southern city
of Fars, a stronghold of Islamic conservatives loyal to Ayatollah
Ali Khamanei, Iran's supreme leader. Although the violent clashes
earlier this month between students supporting Khatami and security
forces loyal to the Muslim clerics have now abated, the underlying
dispute between those favoring a broadening of freedoms and the
clerics' insistence on tight control remains. With it, at least
theoretically, remains the risk that other Jews might become
political pawns.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation redolent of the hazards Jews have faced
throughout history, made more poignant in Iran by the fact that
Jews there seemed, until the spying case, to have a more secure
place than elsewhere in the Muslim Middle East. The Islamic
constitution recognizes Jews as a religious minority, allows them a
representative in Parliament and accepts Jewish laws on burial and
divorce. In Tehran, 27 synagogues function, Jewish schools flourish
and the Jewish hospital is among the city's most respected.
</P>
<P>
   Now all this could be at risk, and with it a crucial vestige of
the Jewish settlement that has left a deep imprint on virtually
every country in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates in the ``Atlas of the Jewish World,'' a
survey by Dr. Nicholas de Lange of Cambridge University, as many as
4 million Jews lived in parts of the Roman Empire beyond Judea, the
Jewish homeland, at the dawn of the first millennium; most of these
lived in the Arab lands that now surround Israel. On the eve of the
third millennium, these countries together could not muster a
Jewish population as numerous as those that were once to be found
in many of the major cities of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, where there were about 150,000 Jews in 1948, has about 70
now. In Syria, there are about 300, in Lebanon about 80, in Jordan,
Egypt and Yemen fewer still. In Saudi Arabia there are no Jews, at
least by official count. In Morocco, which had about 300,000 Jews
in 1948, about 6,000 remain. In Algeria, which saw 115,000 Jews
emigrate hastily to France at independence in 1962, the count is
down to a few hundred. In Tunisia, which counted 105,000 Jews in
1950, there are no more than 2,500. In Libya, where a 1931 census
counted 24,500 Jews, one recent count put the number of Jews
remaining at 5. In Turkey, a community of 90,000 in 1948 has shrunk
to less than a quarter of that now.
</P>
<P>
   While flight from the Muslim lands has been precipitous in the
last 50 years, a slower decline dates from the Middle Ages, when
the rise of Christian Europe attracted large westward migrations
among Jewish populations in the Middle East. Other factors,
including local pogroms, prompted Jews to leave over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But in the modern era, the watershed was the creation of Israel.
Living in a Jewish state was an attraction in itself; a surge of
hostility among Arabs toward Jews, or at least toward Zionism, was
another factor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of those who left did so reluctantly, and many chose
not to leave until much later. This attests to something widely
accepted among Jews who have lived as minorities in Muslim nations
_ that the Islamic world has been less fertile ground for
anti-Semitism than the Christian lands of Europe. Why this has been
so has been endlessly debated, but Islamic scholars cite stories
from the life of the Muslim prophet, Mohammed, to show that respect
for Jews was close to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Jewish experience in the Middle East came remotely
close to the Holocaust. But even long before Hitler's killing
machine, Jews in Muslim countries were comparing their experiences
favorably with those of Jews in Europe. In his survey, de Lange
quotes a Jew writing from Constantinople to Jews in the Rhineland
in 1454. ``Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than
under Christians?'' he wrote. ``Here, every man may live at peace
under his own vine and fig tree.''

IN THE ISLAMIC MIDEAST, SCANT PLACE FOR JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   To those who monitor events in Iran, the arrest of 13 Iranian
Jews on spying charges this year is a menacing sign that bigger
trouble may lie ahead _ trouble that, unchecked, could cause one of
the last two Jewish communities of any size in the Islamic Middle
East to follow most of the others into virtual oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Until the arrests, Jews in Iran had survived the 20-year
dominion of Iran's ruling ayatollahs better than many feared in
1979, when the Islamic republic was declared. In fact, the 30,000
Jews in Iran, while down from the 80,000 who lived there before the
revolution, constitute the largest Jewish community to have
survived in the Muslim Middle East and North Africa. The only other
one of similar size is in Turkey, another non-Arab country, where
about 20,000 Jews remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Jews' significance becomes clearer when their
endurance is measured against what happened elsewhere after the
birth of Israel. From Morocco through Algeria, Tunisia, Libya,
Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Turkey, Jewish communities
that totaled perhaps 1 million people in 1948 dwindled between the
1950s and 1980s to the point that barely 60,000 _ including the
50,000 in Iran and Turkey _ remain.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Iran's Jews must worry that tactics used against Jewish
minorities elsewhere could erode their security, making migration
more attractive. For the time being, the U.S. and European
diplomats who have been leading a discreet campaign to persuade
Iran to drop the spying charges remain hopeful. They point to the
opprobrium that would be sure to fall on Iran if the cases come to
trial, or _ improbable, but still possible, in the view of experts
on Iran _ if the Jews were convicted and sentenced to long prison
terms or death.
</P>
<P>
   The case has unfolded slowly. When the first of the 13 was
arrested in January, the State Department kept the matter quiet,
hoping diplomacy could resolve the issue. But that had not happened
by early June, when Iran announced the arrests over the state

   According to estimates in the ``Atlas of the Jewish World,'' a

Jewish homeland, at the dawn of the first millennium; most of these
lived in the Arab lands that now surround Israel. On the eve of the

   Since 1948, of course, there has been no lack of discrimination
toward Jews in Arab countries. Eighteen months after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, Iraq convicted 14 people, nine of them Jews, on
dubious spying charges and hanged them from lampposts in a Baghdad
square. In many Arab countries, Jews could not emigrate, or could
only on forfeit of all they owned. Jewish religious practices were
restricted. In many countries, Jews were excluded from government
employment, at least at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish historians have argued that Israel, or at least
Zionists, must accept a share of the blame. These scholars cite the
Zionists' plan to encourage Jews everywhere to migrate to Israel,
and link that plan to covert Israeli intelligence operations in the
years after 1948. One often-cited case involves a bungled Israeli
intelligence schemet in 1954 in which bombs were placed at key
centers in Cairo, including the American library, with a view to
disrupting relations between Western countries and Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser. These historians say another aim _
and certainly one effect _ was to encourage Egypt's 50,000 Jews to
flee to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Avi Shlaim, a professor of international relations at Oxford
University who has written on relations between Israel and the Arab
states, says that actions like these accelerated the flight of Jews
from communities where many might otherwise have remained. But
Shlaim, whose own family left Iraq for Israel in 1950, believes
that now that the Jewish communities in the region have all but
vanished, not even a lasting peace between Israel and the Arab
states will lead to their regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he says, is not that the Arab states or Iran are
innately anti-Semitic, but that they lack democratic institutions
and economic opportunities. ``I can't imagine anyone in their right
mind going back to Iraq, or Syria, for that matter,'' he says. King
Hassan of Morocco, who died last week, ``held out this opportunity
to Moroccan Jews all along, and even they haven't exercised it,''
Shalim added. ``The most I can imagine now is that Jews born in
these countries may eventually want to return as tourists, but
nothing more.''

IN THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES, THIS WORD IS A WEAPON

<P>
   The London debut of ``Swetnam the Woman-Hater'' may not have
been the biggest event of 1618, but it had lasting impact.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this play introduced
the word misogynist into the English language. The word caught on
immediately, which makes sense, since there have always been men
who have despised women.
</P>
<P>
   But there have always been women who have despised men. Why,
then, wasn't it until 1946 that an equivalent word for hostility
toward males appeared? And why, once the word misandry surfaced (in
``Scrutiny,'' a defunct British journal of literary criticism), did
it sink quickly into near oblivion?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a word one almost never finds in literature,'' says
Harold Bloom, the Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale
University and author most recently of ``Shakespeare: The Invention
of the Human'' (Riverhead Books). ``It's not even much of a
critical term.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet once Bloom began thinking about it, he had no trouble coming
up with examples of implicit, even explicit, misandry (not to be
confused with misanthropy, which means ``hatred of  &UR; mankind &LR; '').
``I cannot think of one instance of misogyny,'' Bloom said,
referring to the works of Shakespeare, ``whereas I would argue that
misandry is a strong element. Shakespeare makes perfectly clear
that women in general have to marry down and that men are
narcissistic and not to be trusted and so forth. On the whole, he
gives us a darker vision of human males than human females.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in literature as in real life, neither misogyny nor
misandry has the upper hand for long. This makes all the more
perplexing the fact that there's so clearly a winner in the battle
of the language of sexism. Misogyny has made it into just about
every dictionary of the English language. Misandry has not.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the word is currently being seen, if not heard,
more than ever, reflecting an escalation in the behavior it
describes. Misandrous humor is now politically correct. Consider
these recent book titles: ``Women Are From Venus, Men Are From
Hell,'' ``All Men Are Jerks Until Proven Otherwise,'' ``Dads Say
the Dumbest Things: A Collection of Fatherly Wit and Wisdom'' and
``Men and Other Reptiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When peoples' attitudes change,'' says Frank Abate, editor in
chief of the U.S. Dictionaries Program for Oxford University Press,
``that changes the language.''
</P>
<P>
   But even societal acceptance of misandrous, as opposed to
misogynous, attitudes has not helped misandry catch up with
misogyny in everyday parlance or in print. Misogyny needs no
introduction; misandry appears accompanied by a parenthetical
translation. The following sentence is from the National
Organization for Men's Web site: ``The deleterious effect on men
has been even further exacerbated by the emergence during these
past decades of a misandry (male hatred) that characterizes men in
general as violent, abusive and as historical oppressors.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that political correctness is not a critical
determinant of which words get into dictionaries. ``You can't make
the language do what you want it to do,'' Abate said in an
interview. ``It does what it will do. Modern lexicography regards
itself as recording and reporting much more than prescribing.''
</P>
<P>
   Misandry has lacked the necessary word of mouth. Perhaps it's
simply too much of a mouthful. But, as Harold Bloom points out, the
same could be said of misogyny, ``an absolutely ghastly word,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Misogyny, however, has a buzz that has somehow eluded misandry.
``A word is used in a literary context,'' Abate said, ``or on TV,
in a song, an advertising piece, it could be anything _ it gets
picked up, people hear it and read it and say it _ and then it
sticks. Or it doesn't stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1618, buzz could make a word happen. ``Swetnam the
Woman-Hater,'' whose author remains unknown to this day, is a case
in point. Its main character, Misogenos, was based on one Joseph
Swetnam who had published a pamphlet trashing the female sex, which
caused considerable debate. Dissenting pamphlets included one
titled ``Ester Hath Hang'd Haman'' by Ester Sowernam, who wanted
``to proue, that . . . if there be any offense in woman, men were
the beginners.'' So what launched misogyny was not merely the word;
it was the play, and, beyond the play itself, the fact that it got
people talking.
</P>
<P>
   But some recent wisdom from the Internet, where many people do
their talking nowadays, suggests that it may not take a play called
``The Misandrist'' or a movie called ``Misandry'' (a Stephen King
project?) to put the M-word over the top. Consider the words of
Lynette, age 8: ``Even boys have something to say if you listen
long enough.'' Or Anita, age 9: ``It's better for girls to be
single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after
them.'' Perhaps it's only a matter of time.

picked up, people hear it and read it and say it _ and then it
sticks. Or it doesn't stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1618, buzz could make a word happen. ``Swetnam the
Woman-Hater,'' whose author remains unknown to this day, is a case
in point. Its main character, Misogenos, was based on one Joseph
Swetnam who had published a pamphlet trashing the female sex, which
caused considerable debate. Dissenting pamphlets included one
titled ``Ester Hath Hang'd Haman'' by Ester Sowernam, who wanted
``to proue, that . . . if there be any offense in woman, men were
the beginners.'' So what launched misogyny was not merely the word;
it was the play, and, beyond the play itself, the fact that it got
people talking.
</P>
<P>
   But some recent wisdom from the Internet, where many people do
their talking nowadays, suggests that it may not take a play called
``The Misandrist'' or a movie called ``Misandry'' (a Stephen King
project?) to put the M-word over the top. Consider the words of
Lynette, age 8: ``Even boys have something to say if you listen
long enough.'' Or Anita, age 9: ``It's better for girls to be
single but not for boys. Boys need someone to clean up after
them.'' Perhaps it's only a matter of time.

   WASHINGTON _ At times it semes like the Republicans should just
shut down the campaign and crown George W. Bush as their
presidential nominee. He has the most money. The fanciest
endorsements. The highest poll ratings. The most admiring press.
The scent of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There are nine other contenders out there. Don't they
read the newspapers? Watch the polls? Don't they know it's over
before it's begun?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes and no. They read and watch. And they keep telling
themselves they can win.
</P>
<P>
   What do they know that we don't? For one thing, they know that
politics is unpredictable, and they know that the new compressed
calendar of primaries next year makes things doubly unpredictable.
They know that people make mistakes. They know that it is rare for
anyone to win the Republican nomination without having run at least
once before. And they think that the Texas governor has
vulnerabilities, like inexperience, that they can exploit in the
ferocious national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   So the other candidates construct elaborate scenarios of how
they could lasso the prize Texas longhorn. When all else fails,
they pray for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meltdown
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents have a picture in their heads: Bush steps up on
a flatbed truck for the cameras, gets hounded by the press and
snaps. He snarls and says something mean-spirited _ raising
questions about whether he has the temperament to lead the free
world.
</P>
<P>
   Front runners have melted before. Michigan Gov. George Romney's
bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination imploded after
he said he had been brainwashed by generals during a visit to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Sen. Edmund Muskie, D-Maine,
foundered in 1972 after he stood on a bitter New Hampshire day and
denounced the publisher of the Union Leader of Manchester for
editorials skewering his wife. While the debate was never settled
over whether Muskie was crying or wet-eyed from the snow, the
episode made him appear weak.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has been a cool operator on the campaign trail. Yet
he is known to have a temper. So his rivals hope that unscripted
turbulence on the stump will trigger a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush foes think that rather than a single dramatic event, a
series of missteps will cause voters to reconsider. They say a
pattern could leave people thinking that Bush does not have a grasp
of issues, particularly foreign policy. Already, he has called
Kosovars ``Kosovarians'' and Greeks ``Grecians'' and mixed up
Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Forbes Factor
</P>
<P>
   The scenario that terrifies Bush's advisers the most is that
multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes will blanket the airwaves
with nasty commercials skewering Bush. Forbes can do that because,
unlike the others, he is so rich that he can afford to forfeit
federal matching subsidies, which allows him to spend as much as he
wants in the primaries. (Bush, with a gargantuan campaign war
chest, is also forgoing matching funds.)
</P>
<P>
   Forbes tried this in the 1996 campaign and severely damaged Bob
Dole, but not enough to deprive him of the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big unknown is the Godzilla vs. King Kong factor,'' said
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole. ``What happens when
Steve Forbes and George Bush start spending all their money on each
other? Sometimes in the Godzilla vs. King Kong movies, it was the
civilians on the sidewalks who survived.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Fuzz Factor
</P>
<P>
   Republicans of all stripes are so thirsty for a winner that they
have allowed Bush to steer a be-everything-to-everyone course:
Unlike past Republican contenders, he has not panicked over trying
to placate the right wing, but he has not alienated those voters
either.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has addressed many major issues, he has often done so
in a fuzzy way. Eventually, there will be debates, and he will have
to delve into complexities of matters like tax cuts, abortion and
foreign policy. The more details that come out, the more he is
likely to vex somebody. Last week, Bush began to put meat on his
positions by saying the government should provide tax incentives
and federal money for churches and neighborhood groups to help the
needy _ a proposal that critics say would violate the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not know today what the precise issue is that starts to
cut, starts to get people to peel off,'' said Kyle McSlarrow, who
runs the campaign of former Vice President Dan Quayle. ``But the
one that has the highest potential is foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said,
``It's not that someone's going to wake up one day and say, `Oh my
God, I think John McCain's tax platform is better than George
Bush's. I've got to switch.' But as time passes, the voters are
going to judge the candidates in the context of a comparison, not a
vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the prospect that Bush might neglect to spot a
major issue or demographic group that is important to the primary
electorate. In 1988, for example, the elder George Bush did not
anticipate the rise of the religious right _ a phenomenon that
threatened to unhinge his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure in your own head to try to keep people from being
mad at you is awfully great,'' said Patrick Caddell, who helped
engineer Jimmy Carter's victory in 1976. ``But he's got Jerry
Falwell with him. And when you're losing only people to the right
of Jerry Falwell, you can breathe easier.''

   _ Too Much Money
</P>
<P>
   Bush rocked the political establishment, not to say his rivals,
when he announced that he had amassed a record-shattering $36.3
million in four months. But his opponents hope that Bush's massive
financial advantage can be turned against him. They spread the
notion that Bush is trying to buy the White House _ and is getting
it handed to him on a gold-plated platter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see his strongest card becoming the joker in the deck and
the money becomes a liability rather than an asset,'' said Gary
Bauer, a religious conservative in the race. ``The more days we go
through where stories are written only about the money instead of
where he wants to take America, he runs the risk of a backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Coronation Factor
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he goes, Bush says he has to earn the nomination. But
his foes grouse that he has not had to earn anything. Several
suggested that Bush's appealing self-confidence could cross into
unappealing cockiness. For instance, on the stump in California
recently he referred to himself as ``the president of the United
States'' before correcting himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``American voters like a touch of cockiness in their
presidents,'' said one rival campaign manager. ``They don't like
arrogance in a presumptive nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Calendar Caper
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns agree that if Bush falls apart, it has to happen
in the pivotal early Iowa caucuses or New Hampshire primary. That's
because the primary schedule has become so fast-paced that
candidates who stumble have no time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't always so; in the 1984 Democratic race, Gary Hart
scored an upset in New Hampshire against the front-runner, Walter
Mondale. But Mondale had time to claw his way back to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, with primaries bunched together earlier, including in
electoral-vote rich California, the race is expected to be decided
by mid-March. Bush's rivals hope his vast operational advantages
may be neutralized by an early loss. ``If this were 1988, Gary Hart
would have been the nominee of the Democratic Party,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bombshell
</P>
<P>
   In this era of political and personal scandal, rivals say
(usually in off-the-record whispers) that they cannot help but
fantasize that there might be something lurking out there that
would sink Bush. Bush himself has raised their hopes by
acknowledging youthful ``mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all some vague notion that they're going to wake up one
morning and pick up the paper and see a headline and say, `There it
is! The door's wide open!''' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican
strategist. ``But that's not going to happen.''

YOU COULD LOOK IT UP: WHAT HE PROMISED. AND WHAT HE DID. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At his news conference last week, President Clinton
was asked why he ridiculed George W. Bush's slogan of
``compassionate conservatism.'' Another questioner wanted to know
what the president found objectionable about the Texas governor's
``trying to present a new moderate face for his party, just like
you did for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded that Bush had not met the responsibility of
presidential candidates to ``make their positions clear on the
great debates going on now and make their positions clear on what
they would do if they got the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton offered this version of his own race for president
in 1992: ``The first thing I did was tell the American people what
I thought was going on in our country and what I would do. And if
you remember, the late Senator Paul Tsongas and I were actually
almost ridiculed at the time because we both put out these very
detailed plans of what we would do. If you go back and get one of
those plans now, you'll see that virtually everything we said we'd
do we did do, except for the things we tried to do and were
defeated on.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that right or not?
</P>
<P>
   No one can challenge Clinton's point that he offered a detailed
agenda, which he refined over the months. By the fall, he and Al
Gore had published a 240-page book called ``Putting People First''
that offered explicit proposals on issues running the alphabetical
gamut from agriculture to women.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the promises were grand, like cutting the budget deficit
in half, guaranteeing Americans affordable medical insurance,
``ending welfare as we know it'' and providing equal economic
opportunity for all.
</P>
<P>
   Other promises were microscopic in their detail, like saving $2
million in 1993 by adjusting nuclear waste disposal fees for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And some were simply unmeasurable, like the pledge to give
America ``the best-educated, best-trained workforce in the world,
linked together by transportation and communication networks second
to none.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the quantity, breadth and specificity of Clinton promises
cannot be contested, one can quibble with his view that he
accomplished, or at least tried to accomplish, ``virtually
everything'' he promised to do.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Clinton did reach many of the goals he set in 1992,
was thwarted by political opponents on some, and never even tried
to achieve others.
</P>
<P>
   On the central issue of the 1992 campaign, the economy, his goal
of halving the deficit was left in the dust. The budget was
balanced, and Clinton is now able to foresee enormous surpluses in
government accounts. The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level
in decades and millions of new jobs were created. Inflation was
tamed. The U.S. economy became, as Clinton pledged it would, second
to none.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, over the opposition of Republicans in Congress,
Clinton fulfilled promises to enact a tough gun-control law,
finance 100,000 new community police officers, increase the minimum
wage, start a national service program, give workers time off to
deal with family emergencies and block efforts to restrict
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Working with and in many cases following the Republicans' lead,
he expanded international trade, ended the 60-year-old national
welfare system, reduced the size of the government work force, gave
tax breaks to cities for special empowerment zones and won
authority for a line-item veto, which was ultimately found
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On some other goals established in 1992, Clinton made an effort
but was stopped by Congress. His most spectacular failure, of
course, was his proposal to provide affordable health insurance
coverage for all Americans through local networks of insurers,
hospitals and doctors. As a campaign theme, it sounded workable.
When Clinton submitted a plan along those lines after he became
president, it proved to be unwieldy and unpopular and died while
Democrats still controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents forced the president to withdraw his promise to let
homosexuals serve in the military. He instead instituted the
compromise policy of ``don't-ask, don't-tell,'' which satisfies no
one.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also stopped the president from keeping his promises to
``rebuild America'' by spending billions on a jobs and public works
program. And it rejected his proposal that companies with striking
workers be prohibited from hiring replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton simply broke other promises. Here are some of the ones
he reneged on:
</P>
<P>
   Even before he took office, he dropped his proposal for a
middle-income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   He never tried to repeal the limit on how much money people over
65 can earn before their Social Security benefits are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   He gave lip service to campaign finance reform but exerted no
effort to attain it.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly forgot a plan to require businesses to spend 1.5
percent of their payroll on continued education and training of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   He never ended tax breaks for companies that shut down American
plants and ship jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He never made improvement in China's human rights record a
condition for favorable trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting an increase in the gasoline tax, he
sponsored legislation that raised it by 4.3 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the fewer promises from 1992 Clinton kept, the
more popular he became. His grandest achievements were in 1993, his
first year in office, and the public did not seem particularly
grateful. Late in 1994, his second year, Clinton's presidency was
in a shambles, and Republicans won control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton began thinking small bore. He won re-election in
1996 without big promises and has concentrated since then on
blocking Republican ambitions. ``There was a misreading of how much
change people wanted,'' explained Clinton's former adviser, Harold
M. Ickes.
</P>
<P>

YOU COULD LOOK IT UP: WHAT HE PROMISED. AND WHAT HE DID.

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At his news conference last week, President Clinton
was asked why he ridiculed George W. Bush's slogan of
``compassionate conservatism.'' Another questioner wanted to know
what the president found objectionable about the Texas governor's
``trying to present a new moderate face for his party, just like
you did for the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded that Bush had not met the responsibility of
presidential candidates to ``make their positions clear on the
great debates going on now and make their positions clear on what
they would do if they got the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton offered this version of his own race for president
in 1992: ``The first thing I did was tell the American people what
I thought was going on in our country and what I would do. And if
you remember, the late Senator Paul Tsongas and I were actually
almost ridiculed at the time because we both put out these very
detailed plans of what we would do. If you go back and get one of
those plans now, you'll see that virtually everything we said we'd
do we did do, except for the things we tried to do and were
defeated on.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that right or not?
</P>
<P>
   No one can challenge Clinton's point that he offered a detailed
agenda, which he refined over the months. By the fall, he and Al
Gore had published a 240-page book called ``Putting People First''
that offered explicit proposals on issues running the alphabetical
gamut from agriculture to women.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the promises were grand, like cutting the budget deficit
in half, guaranteeing Americans affordable medical insurance,
``ending welfare as we know it'' and providing equal economic
opportunity for all.
</P>
<P>
   Other promises were microscopic in their detail, like saving $2
million in 1993 by adjusting nuclear waste disposal fees for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And some were simply unmeasurable, like the pledge to give
America ``the best-educated, best-trained workforce in the world,
linked together by transportation and communication networks second
to none.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the quantity, breadth and specificity of Clinton promises
cannot be contested, one can quibble with his view that he
accomplished, or at least tried to accomplish, ``virtually
everything'' he promised to do.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Clinton did reach many of the goals he set in 1992,
was thwarted by political opponents on some, and never even tried
to achieve others.
</P>
<P>
   On the central issue of the 1992 campaign, the economy, his goal
of halving the deficit was left in the dust. The budget was
balanced, and Clinton is now able to foresee enormous surpluses in
government accounts. The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level
in decades and millions of new jobs were created. Inflation was
tamed. The U.S. economy became, as Clinton pledged it would, second
to none.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, over the opposition of Republicans in Congress,
Clinton fulfilled promises to enact a tough gun-control law,
finance 100,000 new community police officers, increase the minimum
wage, start a national service program, give workers time off to
deal with family emergencies and block efforts to restrict
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Working with and in many cases following the Republicans' lead,
he expanded international trade, ended the 60-year-old national
welfare system, reduced the size of the government work force, gave
tax breaks to cities for special empowerment zones and won
authority for a line-item veto, which was ultimately found
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On some other goals established in 1992, Clinton made an effort
but was stopped by Congress. His most spectacular failure, of
course, was his proposal to provide affordable health insurance
coverage for all Americans through local networks of insurers,
hospitals and doctors. As a campaign theme, it sounded workable.
When Clinton submitted a plan along those lines after he became
president, it proved to be unwieldy and unpopular and died while
Democrats still controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents forced the president to withdraw his promise to let
homosexuals serve in the military. He instead instituted the
compromise policy of ``don't-ask, don't-tell,'' which satisfies no
one.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also stopped the president from keeping his promises to
``rebuild America'' by spending billions on a jobs and public works
program. And it rejected his proposal that companies with striking
workers be prohibited from hiring replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton simply broke other promises. Here are some of the ones
he reneged on:
</P>
<P>
   Even before he took office, he dropped his proposal for a
middle-income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   He never tried to repeal the limit on how much money people over
65 can earn before their Social Security benefits are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   He gave lip service to campaign finance reform but exerted no
effort to attain it.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly forgot a plan to require businesses to spend 1.5
percent of their payroll on continued education and training of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   He never ended tax breaks for companies that shut down American
plants and ship jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He never made improvement in China's human rights record a
condition for favorable trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting an increase in the gasoline tax, he
sponsored legislation that raised it by 4.3 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the fewer promises from 1992 Clinton kept, the
more popular he became. His grandest achievements were in 1993, his
first year in office, and the public did not seem particularly
grateful. Late in 1994, his second year, Clinton's presidency was
in a shambles, and Republicans won control of both houses of
Congress for the first time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton began thinking small bore. He won re-election in
1996 without big promises and has concentrated since then on
blocking Republican ambitions. ``There was a misreading of how much
change people wanted,'' explained Clinton's former adviser, Harold
M. Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Bush is promising so little. And maybe, just
maybe, it's why Clinton is egging him on.

   A snub-nosed California child who loves to dance in glittery
costumes is kidnapped from her bed during a sleep-over and
murdered. An infant in day care, just turned a year old, is crushed
to death when the Oklahoma City federal building explodes at the
hand of terrorists. A Colorado teen-ager, proclaiming her faith in
God, is shot at close range by a rampaging schoolmate.
</P>
<P>
   Like John F. Kennedy Jr., who few knew but many mourned, Polly
Klaas, Baylee Almon and Cassie Bernall became America's nearest and
dearest, however briefly, through the unique intimacy of
television, which brought them, brimming with life, into our living
rooms and bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, people knew more about them than about their
neighbors and colleagues. But it was impossible to pay a condolence
call, deliver a casserole, offer a hug or cry at the funeral. And
so they built shrines.
</P>
<P>
   For Polly, there were mountains of teddy bears in a parking lot
in Petaluma, Calif. For Baylee, there were letters in childish
script, pushed through the gaps in the chain-link fence that
contained the rubble of the Murrah Building. For Cassie, there was
a handmade wooden cross not far from Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for Kennedy, there are flickering candles, poems and
prayers, bouquets heaped upon bouquets, outside his New York
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Memorials to the dead date from the beginning of time, an
impulse hard-wired in the human psyche to comfort the soul of the
dead and relieve the sadness of the living. But ``the size and
elaboration of these public displays of grief are a new phenomenon
of the pop culture,'' said Phillips Stevens Jr., a professor of
anthropology at the State University at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Some see these shrines _ the largest by far was for Princess
Diana outside Kensington Palace _ as distasteful exhibitionism,
another version of venting on talk radio or confessing sleazy
secrets on daytime television. Others believe the celebrity culture
has made it possible for people to replace the joy and heartbreak
of real intimacy with phony _ and undemanding _ emotional
connections.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more sympathetic way to view these makeshift
shrines to strangers, be they celebrities or unknown victims of
great public tragedy. Joshua Meyrowitz, a professor of
communication at the University of New Hampshire, calls them
``media friends'' who enter our lives with such intensity that our
feelings for them are both powerful and genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Meyrowitz described his own interior conversations with such
people. In 1980, after a gunman killed John Lennon outside his New
York apartment building, the scene of one of the earliest of these
shrines, Meyrowitz wished with an intensity usually reserved for
loved ones that Lennon had chosen a different moment to exit his
car. So, too, with Kennedy's fatal flight. ``John, why didn't you
wait until morning?'' Meyrowitz said he asked himself, this time
aloud.
</P>
<P>
   With attachments so deep, there must be rituals for mourning,
and so people invent them. ``We have to find a place to hang these
feelings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Levinson, a professor of media studies at Fordham
University, agreed. ``Funerals exist in all human societies,'' he
said. ``We are a communal species, and throughout history we have
worked out ways to express communal grief. So this is what we do
when we're not invited to the funeral.''

UNREASONABLE SUSPICION: DRAWING THE LINE ON THE STRIP-SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The jail-house drill is simple, if humiliating: Take
off your clothes. Raise your hands over your head. Be prepared to
bend over or squat. Someone may run a hand through your hair.
</P>
<P>
   You have just been strip-searched, a procedure that is done
thousands of times a day in jails, prisons and police stations
throughout the country. But its very routineness has been called
into question in the wake of recent lawsuits filed by people who
were searched after being arrested for fare beating and other minor
offenses. Just last week in New York, Alton Fitzgerald White, who
plays a leading role in the Broadway musical ``Ragtime,'' suffered
the indignity of such a search after being mistakenly arrested on
drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in New York ruled in June that people charged
with misdemeanors could not be strip-searched unless there was
reasonable suspicion that they were hiding something. This spring
an estimated 4,000 people in Kentucky were searched illegally, and
the authorities agreed to pay $11.5 million to settle a lawsuit
brought on their behalf. White is discussing a lawsuit against New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The legal decisions may force correction officials to rethink a
policy that has been effective in keeping drugs and weapons out of
detention centers and reducing violence in jails. Critics say the
officials who authorized searches later found to be illegal either
misunderstood, ignored or were unaware of established legal
boundaries defining who could be strip-searched.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade the courts have struggled to define these
parameters. There has been little objection to searching prison
convicts or suspects charged with violent felonies or drug crimes.
But the courts have said that those charged with petty crimes like
urinating in public cannot be routinely strip-searched.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction was lost on officials at the Nassau County jail
and at several New York City booking facilities, where people are
held until they can be brought before a judge. They set up policies
that resulted in strip-searching everyone in custody. Now thousands
may claim damages as part of the class-actions suits that have been
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent rulings, New York City still strip-searches
everyone entering its major jail at Rikers Island, regardless of
the charge. ``It is remarkable, after all these years, that the
jail people just can't figure it out,'' said Richard Emery, an
attorney whose office has filed several suits on behalf of people
who have been searched.
</P>
<P>
   Some searches are clearly legal. Prisons search inmates because
they have already been convicted and because security is a
paramount concern. The courts have also enabled police officers or
jail guards to search people arrested for misdemeanors if there is
a reasonable suspicion that they are hiding a weapon or other
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   But ``reasonable suspicion'' is a phrase open to broad
interpretation, and some law enforcement officials argue for wide
latitude, suggesting that all prostitutes, for example, could be
strip-searched given the prevalence of drug use among them.
</P>
<P>
   None of those distinctions were made at New York City booking
locations in Manhattan and Queens during a 10-month period between
1996 and 1997. Everyone was searched. Emery, who has brought a suit
against New York City on behalf of many of those searched,
estimates that as many as 63,000 people may have been subjected to
the procedure. City officials privately acknowledge the mistake,
saying that when the Corrections Department took over operations
from the Police Department, it transferred the policy used at city
jails; everyone _ even those awaiting arraignment _ stripped.
</P>
<P>
   New York has since revised the policy, but it may become an
expensive error. In one case decided last month, one woman, who was
strip-searched after her arrest in a domestic dispute, was awarded
$19,600 in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.
If the thousands of people represented in the class-action case
were awarded even the lesser sum, the financial toll on the city
would be huge.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers are confident that a jury will decide that many
people, though their rights may have been violated, endured only a
momentary inconvenience. ``Not very many people felt they
experienced emotional or physical damages,'' said Norma Kerlin, an
assistant corporation counsel for the city, because only about a
dozen of those searched bothered to file lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many jail officials in the country had assumed
they could search anyone after arraignment and before admitting the
person to jail. But in June, in a Nassau County case, a federal
judge ruled that the county could not search people without cause
if they were jailed for minor offenses. Nassau has since amended
its policy, but is pursuing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, New York City continues to strip-search
everyone at Rikers as part of an enhanced security initiative that
has seen slashings drop dramatically. City officials plan to file a
brief supporting Nassau's appeal. ``The judge's ruling was specific
to the Nassau jail,'' said Thomas Antenen, a corrections spokesman.
``It does not impact our system.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, police officers are required to get a
supervisor's approval for such a search. But critics say
unauthorized searches still happen. In White's case, officials, who
have apologized for the mistaken arrest, said searching the actor
was authorized because he was brought in as a suspect in a felony
drug case.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, who has been advising White, questioned how police
could have developed a reasonable suspicion to search him since
they had no grounds for the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the city recently had to pay $25,000 each to
four Fordham University students who were forced to disrobe in the
restroom of a Bronx station house last year after they were
arrested for doubling up to pass through a subway turnstile. As it
turned out, a police supervisor filled out a document approving the
searches _ after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted to protect them so they would not be
searched again when they got to central booking,'' said the
students' lawyer, Martha Rayner.

unauthorized searches still happen. In White's case, officials, who
have apologized for the mistaken arrest, said searching the actor
was authorized because he was brought in as a suspect in a felony
drug case.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, who has been advising White, questioned how police
could have developed a reasonable suspicion to search him since
they had no grounds for the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the city recently had to pay $25,000 each to
four Fordham University students who were forced to disrobe in the
restroom of a Bronx station house last year after they were
arrested for doubling up to pass through a subway turnstile. As it
turned out, a police supervisor filled out a document approving the
searches _ after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted to protect them so they would not be
searched again when they got to central booking,'' said the
students' lawyer, Martha Rayner.

CAMCORDERS AT THE READY: CELEBRITIES CELEBRATING CELEBRATIONS

<P>
   At the White House last week, the U.S. women's soccer team stood
behind President Clinton facing an ocean of cameras that has
recorded the team's every move for the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But peering back at the cameras was a video camera held aloft by
Kristine Lilly, the most valuable player of the World Cup
tournament and one of several team members who served as
chroniclers of the chronicled.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lilly is not the only prominent athlete to move behind the
camera recently. After his team won the National Basketball
Association championship in June, Tim Duncan, the forward of the
San Antonio Spurs and the most valuable player of the playoff
finals, grabbed a camcorder to document his teammates' post-game
celebration on the court, barely joining the frenzy himself.
</P>
<P>
   At baseball's All-Star festivities at Fenway Park this month,
Barry Larkin, the Cincinnati shortstop, sat on the bench taping the
other stars' feats. And last October, following the New York
Yankees victory in the World Series, David Wells and Jorge Posada
each videotaped the blizzard of ticker tape and screaming crowds
from their float as they glided up the Canyon of Heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a professional athlete, who has spent a career
striving for the celebratory moments that follow a championship,
choose to stand on the sidelines videotaping teammates as they
enjoy the moment? To these children of the post-modern,
media-drenched age, is recording the moment more important than
participating in it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if living it doesn't make it real,'' said Neal Gabler,
the cultural historian and author of ``Life the Movie: How
Entertainment Conquered Reality'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1998.) Because
of the ubiquity of media images today, he said, events seem real
for some people ``only when we see them on TV and we can record
them and review them _ transforming them from reality into a
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The urge to record and memorialize important events is not
remarkable in itself. What parent has not filmed a youngster's
school play or first time at bat?
</P>
<P>
   Cheap technology has helped fuel the trend. But there is
probably a different motivation for those who want to record events
in which they are the center of attention _ particularly for a
sports star wealthy enough to hire a personal documentarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an effort to regain some kind of power, to be the
observer rather than the observed,'' said Leo Braudy, the author of
``The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and Its History'' (Oxford University
Press, 1986).
</P>
<P>
   Stepping behind a camera, Braudy said, ``gives you power over
the audience, rather than the audience having power over you.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Foudy, the women's soccer team co-captain whose camera was
passed around at events, said that she aimed to capture the
``little details'' of the team's public and private moments that
are forgotten over time. And because she filmed from the first
practices to the White House visit, ``we have on tape how it grew
into this frenzied following,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who are used to being celebrated can feel
overwhelmed, particularly at the pinnacle of achievement, said Neil
Goldberg, a New York video artist. Perhaps these athletes are
simply seeking shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When thousands of people who you do not know are showering you
with love,'' Goldberg said, ``it can feel very safe to be behind a
camera.''

MY DOG LOVES ME, AND OTHER DELUSIONS

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ``If you want a friend in Washington,'' the saying goes, ``get a
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this advice is that it's not nearly cynical
enough. All that can be said about a dog's state of mind is that
its behavior is hard-wired to encourage that belief.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds paranoid, recent research has exposed, yet again,
the copious pitfalls of deceit in human-animal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are con artists, according to Stephen Budiansky, author of
``If a Lion Could Talk.'' ( Budiansky's dog snookered him into
sharing the author's photograph on the book's dust jacket, and
doubtless into a 50-50 split of the royalties too).
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are particularly adroit at manipulating human emotions;
they have inherited a sharp sensitivity to social cues from their
wolf forebears. They can read human body language and tones of
voice, divining just what is required of them. When you yell at
your dog for soiling the carpet and he cringes, you are probably
mollified by his obvious regret. It may be obvious, but is it
sincere?
</P>
<P>
   ``The cringe is a successful technique for deflecting
aggression,'' Budiansky wrote in the July issue of The Atlantic
Monthly. ``Millions of years of wolf evolution have selected such
behaviors because they are socially effective; thousands of years
of dog evolution have fine-tuned such behaviors so that they are
socially effective on people.''
</P>
<P>
   In kicking the wolf way of life for that of a hanger-on in human
societies, dogs have achieved extraordinary success. Wolves number
no more than 150,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   There are 50 million dogs in this country alone, costing their
owners $5 billion a year in dog food, $7 billion in veterinary care
and $250 million in insurance claims for the 800,000 people bitten
seriously enough to warrant medical attention, Budiansky writes.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs couldn't pull off this monstrous trick without a lot of
help from their victims. The way that people relate to another
species, dolphins, shows how strong is the urge to project their
desires and expectations onto animal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, unlike dogs, are wild mammals with no experience in
interpreting or manipulating the weird behavior of higher primates.
Yet they have acquired a saintly image. They save drowning sailors.
They like playing with swimmers. New Age dolphins have healing
powers. They are wise, gentle and love people.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have recently learned that bottlenose dolphins, far
from being the pacifists of the Pacific, are ferocious killers of a
related species, the harbor porpoise. The protective behavior
imputed to dolphins arises from misconstruing aspects of their
natural behavior. Dolphins don't get a kick from swimming alongside
boats: They're just enjoying a free ride in its wake. They are not
trying to save you from a shark attack: They are just
rubber-necking at your fish-out-of-water antics and sharks know to
stay out of the way of these dangerous animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert Terrace, a Columbia University psychologist who
studies cognition, says animal aggression is not a popular topic,
even among scientists, in part because it is hard to study.
``People will persist in their preconceived notions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a highly intelligent animal like a dolphin or a
chimpanzee, people cannot resist imputing to it whatever they would
feel in the same context. This is probably part of our genetic
programming. The whole art of living in social groups, after all,
is to figure out other members' intentions and act accordingly.
People do this instinctively, and almost any fellow mammal will
trip the reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Even a horse. The classic case of human self-deception is that
of Clever Hans, a performing horse in Berlin around 1900. By
tapping his hoof a certain number of times, the horse could count,
make correct change, tell time and calculate the day and date in a
given calendar year. He would perform these feats not only for his
trainer, a schoolteacher named Wilhelm von Osten, but for many
others too, provided they knew the answer beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The Clever Hans phenomenon was solved by a clever psychologist,
Oskar Pfungst, who found that the testers, ever eager to be
astounded, were unconsciously cueing the horse. As Hans approached
the right number of hoof taps, expectant questioners would betray
their interest with an involuntary tensing of the body. Dr. Pfungst
ascertained that Hans could detect head movements as small as
one-fifth of a millimeter. The psychologist even played the role of
horse himself, finding that 23 out of 25 questioners cued him as to
the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   His findings, first published in English in 1911, failed to put
an end to the charade. By 1937 there were more than 70 cats, dogs
and horses with marvelous cognitive powers. Many of the recent
attempts to teach chimpanzees language may have been marred by the
same fallacy.
</P>
<P>
   When Odysseus returned to Ithaca from the Trojan wars after 20
years, he disguised himself as a beggar to survey the palace where
his wife's suitors were partying and to plan their slaughter. No
one perceived the hero beneath his contemptible rags and grime _
none save his dog Argos. The dog thumped his tail, Homer records,
but expired in the effort to greet Odysseus, making even the
hardened warrior shed a tear that nearly betrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   Are animals uncanny judges of human character? Do they know us
better than we know ourselves? Who can tell what they really think?
Their actions are as opaque as a mirror, reflecting the projections
of our innermost desires, not theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Human relationships that go sour are often attributed to
misunderstanding, even when the obvious cause is that the parties
understand each other only too well. Total misunderstanding can
frame the perfect basis for a relationship: In such a setting,
one's partner fulfills every expectation, never rejects,
disappoints or betrays. And how else can you achieve such
gloriously happy misunderstanding, except with a dog?

UNSETTLING TV COMMERCIALS: AND NOW, A GROSS-OUT FROM OUR SPONSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gross-out comedy: Its vulgarity, in movies like ``American Pie''
and television shows like ``South Park,'' has younger viewers in
stitches. But its proliferation _ there's more in store this fall
on television _ has parents and others bemoaning anew the
coarsening of American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both younger and older viewers can claim a measure of
dubious credit for a less-noted factor in the coarsening of
culture: gross-out TV commercials. Both are, after all, target
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of ads follow the same rationale that
youth-oriented films and TV shows do: If you shock with crudeness,
lewdness, black humor or violence, people pay attention, especially
those who equate such qualities with being hip.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more conventional TV advertisers are attuned to the way
of all flesh, particularly that of aging, self-indulgent baby
boomers _ and lately that's not so pretty either.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot of the two trends? ``It's often not fun to turn on TV,''
says Bob Garfield, a critic for Advertising Age. A judicious
sampling illustrates the point.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL No. 1: THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DETROL.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factors: Discussion of overactive bladder, and
possible side effects if you treat it.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: March 3 on ``The Price Is Right'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   (The words ``Overactive Bladder'' fill the TV screen.)
</P>
<P>
   Male announcer: Overactive bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: Those strong sudden urges.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: Going to the bathroom so often.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 3: Wetting accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Discover prescription Detrol. Detrol is proven
effective to treat overactive bladder. Detrol reduced bathroom
visits by 2.2 times in 24 hours versus 1.1 times with a sugar pill.
</P>
<P>
   Husband (in park, pushing wife on swing): Stay a little longer?
</P>
<P>
   Wife: Love to. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Announcer's disclaimer: Do not take Detrol if you have certain
types of stomach, urinary or glaucoma problems. The most common
side effect is dry mouth. . . . Common, but less frequent ones, may
include dry eyes, headache, constipation and indigestion. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Husband (strolling with wife at beach): Head back?
</P>
<P>
   Wife: Not right now. . . .
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL No. 2: GAS-X.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factor: Husband and wife bloated with intestinal gas
after big meal.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: Last Monday, during ``World News Tonight'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Husband (sitting in car with wife): Great meal.
</P>
<P>
   (But then, thanks to special effects, the husband and wife blow
up like balloons.)
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Uh-oh. Gas pressure. What now? What else? Gas-X. For
the most powerful medicine for fast relief, nothing works faster.
</P>
<P>
   Husband (deflated): Hey, want to go for ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   (Wife, still inflated, doesn't look so sure.)
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Gas-X, the power to fight gas fast.
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL No. 3: POND'S CLEAR PORE STRIPS.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factor: Blackheads being ripped from the faces of
young women.

   Unsettling factor: A pack of wolves attacks a high school
marching band.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: Nov. 21, 1998, during a nationally broadcast college
football game on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Man (in suit, seated in a leather armchair in tony
surroundings): In an effort to get people to remember our name,
Outpost.com, we contacted the local high school marching band and
asked them to help us out.
</P>
<P>
   (The marching band forms the letters of the company's name on a
football field, to the tune of ``When the Saints Go Marching In.'')
</P>
<P>
   Man: And to help make this memorable, we decided to release a
pack of ravenous wolves.
</P>
<P>
   (The wolves attack the band members, who scream and flee as
carnage ensues.)

<P>
   Man: Ha, ha, ha. That's good stuff.

   COMMERCIAL No. 5: A WORD ABOUT IMPOTENCE FROM PFIZER, THE MAKER
OF VIAGRA.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factor: Bob Dole discussing erectile dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: Feb. 14, during the Daytona 500 on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Dole (seated in armchair): Courage, something shared by
countless Americans, those who risked their lives, those who battle
serious illness. When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I was
primarily concerned with ridding myself of the cancer, but
secondly, I was concerned about possible post-operative side
effects like erectile dysfunction, ED, often called impotence.
</P>
<P>
   You know, it's a little embarrassing to talk about ED, but it's
so important to millions of men and their partners that I decided
to talk about it publicly. And after all, it can be associated with
many conditions, including prostate surgery, high blood pressure,
diabetes, even smoking. And the point I want to make is that there
are many treatments available for E.D. So my advice is to get a
medical checkup. . . . It may take a little courage, but I've
always found that everything worthwhile does.

affiliate in Houston. (The spot was withdrawn after complaints.)
</P>
<P>
   (The patient is shown in bed, with his heart monitor beeping.)
</P>
<P>
   Priest: Relax, my son. You're going to be just fine. What's your
name?
</P>
<P>
   Patient: Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Priest: And what do you do, Bob?
</P>
<P>
   Patient: I work for a big long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   Priest (suddenly angered): You dirty, rotten. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (The curtain shrouding the patient's bed is shown as sounds of
the priest beating Bob mercilessly ensue.)
</P>
<P>
   Nurse (arriving on scene): Father, stop!

<P>
   Priest: He works for a big long-distance company!

   Nurse (reconsidering): Then let me help!
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL No. 7: SMARTBEEP BEEPER SERVICE.
</P>

   Unsettling factor: Woman passing gas in car, unaware of
occupants in back seat.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: Oct. 20, 1998, on ``The Ricki Lake Show'' airing in
Dallas on KDFI, an independent station.
</P>
<P>
   Man (picking up date at house, heading to car): I can't believe
it. It's my first blind date.
</P>
<P>
   Woman: Oh, I do it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Man: Really?
</P>
<P>
   (She gets in the front seat of the car on the passenger side
and, thinking she is alone, passes gas before her date enters on
the driver's side.)
</P>

   Man (after getting in car): Whew.
</P>
<P>
   Woman: Whew.

UNSETTLING TV COMMERCIALS: AND NOW, A GROSS-OUT FROM OUR SPONSOR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Gross-out comedy: Its vulgarity, in movies like ``American Pie''
and television shows like ``South Park,'' has younger viewers in
stitches. But its proliferation _ there's more in store this fall
on television _ has parents and others bemoaning anew the
coarsening of American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both younger and older viewers can claim a measure of
dubious credit for a less-noted factor in the coarsening of
culture: gross-out TV commercials. Both are, after all, target
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of ads follow the same rationale that
youth-oriented films and TV shows do: If you shock with crudeness,
lewdness, black humor or violence, people pay attention, especially
those who equate such qualities with being hip.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more conventional TV advertisers are attuned to the way
of all flesh, particularly that of aging, self-indulgent baby
boomers _ and lately that's not so pretty either.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot of the two trends? ``It's often not fun to turn on TV,''
says Bob Garfield, a critic for Advertising Age. A judicious
sampling illustrates the point.

   COMMERCIAL No. 1: THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DETROL.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling factors: Discussion of overactive bladder, and
possible side effects if you treat it.
</P>
<P>
   When seen: March 3 on ``The Price Is Right'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   (The words ``Overactive Bladder'' fill the TV screen.)

   Woman No. 2: Going to the bathroom so often.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Wife: Love to. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Announcer's disclaimer: Do not take Detrol if you have certain
types of stomach, urinary or glaucoma problems. The most common
side effect is dry mouth. . . . Common, but less frequent ones, may

BOMBING WON IN KOSOVO. AFRICA IS A TOUGHER CASE. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Now that NATO's bombers have forced
the Serbs to capitulate in Kosovo, the question naturally arises:
Couldn't the world's big powers try the same thing in Africa, which
has been in dire need of peacemaking and peacekeeping for so long?
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Victor Malu of Nigeria hinted at one answer two years ago,
when he led a Nigerian army unit overseeing an election in Liberia.
Having warned the warring militias that his peacekeepers would
``pour fire into anyone trying to disrupt the vote,'' he taunted a
reporter: ``What's the matter with you Americans? You lost your
stomach for peacekeeping in Somalia after you lost, what, 21 men?
I've lost 500 here already.''
</P>
<P>
   An American looking at the Nigerian peacekeepers might well
wonder, as the Cowardly Lion did: ``Whadda they got that I ain't
got?'' Well, stomach for that kind of warfare, for one thing. But
whether to wade into Africa's wars involves a lot more than just
courage.
</P>
<P>
   The question is especially pointed now, because two cease-fire
deals have recently been negotiated in Africa _ in Sierra Leone,
where there is some promise that the truce will hold, and in Congo,
where such prospects seem bleak. In both, outsiders are being
called on by the warring parties to send peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Will they be from the West? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for a moment, that the United States and Europe would
actually try to make peace in an African war. What lessons from
Kosovo might apply in Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone or Eritrea?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, can an African war be won with air power? Can
ground troops be inserted without putting them in harm's way? If
so, would they do any good?
</P>
<P>
   Military and political analysts here say the first question is
easy to answer. Air power has never been much use in Africa,
because rural Africans already lack factories, electricity, bridges
and armored divisions. ``Bomb what?'' said Claude Kabemba, a
foreign policy analyst for the Center for Policy Studies, a
research institute in South Africa. ``In Congo, war is a guy under
a tree with an AK-47.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some bombing on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border, but
that war is fought the way World War I was: with human waves flung
against trenches. In the Congo, Zimbabwean jets have sunk ferries
said to be carrying rebels, but haven't been decisive in a battle.
</P>
<P>
   One war here might be ended with a precision strike: If a
missile tracked Jonas Savimbi's satellite phone signals into the
Angolan bush, it might behead the Unita rebel movement. But that
would require unpalatable choices: it would be a bald
assassination, it would hand victory to a government whose behavior
is only slightly better than Savimbi's, and some analysts say
Savimbi's generals might fight on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Helmoed-Romer Heitman, an analyst for Jane's Defense Weekly,
discerned two uses for air power in peacekeeping: AWACS planes and
fighters could impede, but probably not stop, the flow of men and
weapons around Congo and northern Angola, where roads are so bad
that decrepit ex-Soviet cargo planes ferry both.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if a force of African soldiers willing to go
into danger areas was mustered, transports for the troops and
helicopters for their commanders would be a very useful Western
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Any mission for ground troops is more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations troops have poor reputations in Africa. Many are
small units from poor nations like Bangladesh, sent because the
United Nations pays their governments hundreds of dollars a day for
each soldier. A dozen units from a dozen countries whose only
mission is to look around and maybe get shot at are bound to fail,
as such a force did in Angola this year.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's well-trained and equipped troops are a different matter.
They could easily win battles. But that isn't peacekeeping. Congo
is 215 times the size of Kosovo, Angola 114 times. The terrain is
far more difficult, the fighting a patchwork of skirmishes without
front lines. If some 20,000 NATO troops have found it hard to
prevent murders of Serbs and Albanians in remote Balkan villages,
what could they do in Congo? The United Nations Department of
Peacekeeping Operations told one military analyst in Pretoria that
patrolling Congo would require 100,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   And for how long? And what would they do when they were shot at?
The Congo cease-fire document expects the peacekeepers to disarm
more than a dozen armed forces, including Unita, the Mayi-Mayi
guerrillas and the Hutu militias. Unita has been at war for 25
years. The Mayi-Mayi charge into battle naked, thinking they're
bulletproof. The Hutu militias, if disarmed, would be deported to
Rwanda to be executed for genocide, so it is unlikely that they
will disarm voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's the ``stomach'' issue. Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, whose troops are fighting in Congo, was recently reported
to be mocking Western peacekeepers. ``Which U.N. troops will stay
in these mountains for six months?'' the Monitor newspaper quoted
him as saying. ``They will just run away like they did in Rwanda.
European soldiers go only to areas where there is no death.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the battle zone is contained, as in the Badme Triangle
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, peacekeepers could be a buffer
between the sides, as in Cyprus or the Golan Heights. But such
situations can be open-ended. Heitman put it this way: ``Cyprus?
The U.N.'s been there since the 60's. And if they left, the Turkish
and Greek Cypriots would go right back to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in Washington, London and Paris know this. They
haven't volunteered troops for Africa and thus far are reluctant to
pay for a United Nations effort.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for a couple of years now, the United States and Europe
have been prodding African countries to form a joint force to calm
the continent's constant crises. Even France, whose Foreign Legion
once aggressively policed its ex-colonies, wants out, said Chris
Landsberg, deputy director of the Center for Policy Studies. Africa
is slowly warming to the idea of a regional joint force, but it's
still all theory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the skittishness of the West infuriates Africans, who
often say it is racism to spend $1.50 per Kosovo refugee but only
11 cents per African refugee. Many African nations like Nigeria and
South Africa say they would be willing to provide the men to do
peace-keeping, but need help paying for them _ lots of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-Somalia, post-Rwanda, the West is able but unwilling, and
Africa is willing but unable,'' said Landsberg. ``Somehow, we have
to convince the West that peace in this area is in their interest.
And then hundreds of millions of dollars has to come from somewhere
_ $20 million here and $20 million there isn't going to do it.''

Kosovo might apply in Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone or Eritrea?
</P>
<P>
   For instance, can an African war be won with air power? Can
ground troops be inserted without putting them in harm's way? If
so, would they do any good?
</P>
<P>
   Military and political analysts here say the first question is
easy to answer. Air power has never been much use in Africa,
because rural Africans already lack factories, electricity, bridges
and armored divisions. ``Bomb what?'' said Claude Kabemba, a
foreign policy analyst for the Center for Policy Studies, a
research institute in South Africa. ``In Congo, war is a guy under
a tree with an AK-47.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some bombing on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border, but
that war is fought the way World War I was: with human waves flung
against trenches. In the Congo, Zimbabwean jets have sunk ferries
said to be carrying rebels, but haven't been decisive in a battle.
</P>
<P>
   One war here might be ended with a precision strike: If a
missile tracked Jonas Savimbi's satellite phone signals into the
Angolan bush, it might behead the Unita rebel movement. But that
would require unpalatable choices: it would be a bald
assassination, it would hand victory to a government whose behavior
is only slightly better than Savimbi's, and some analysts say
Savimbi's generals might fight on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Helmoed-Romer Heitman, an analyst for Jane's Defense Weekly,
discerned two uses for air power in peacekeeping: AWACS planes and
fighters could impede, but probably not stop, the flow of men and
weapons around Congo and northern Angola, where roads are so bad
that decrepit ex-Soviet cargo planes ferry both.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if a force of African soldiers willing to go
into danger areas was mustered, transports for the troops and
helicopters for their commanders would be a very useful Western
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Any mission for ground troops is more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations troops have poor reputations in Africa. Many are
small units from poor nations like Bangladesh, sent because the
United Nations pays their governments hundreds of dollars a day for
each soldier. A dozen units from a dozen countries whose only
mission is to look around and maybe get shot at are bound to fail,
as such a force did in Angola this year.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's well-trained and equipped troops are a different matter.
They could easily win battles. But that isn't peacekeeping. Congo
is 215 times the size of Kosovo, Angola 114 times. The terrain is
far more difficult, the fighting a patchwork of skirmishes without
front lines. If some 20,000 NATO troops have found it hard to
prevent murders of Serbs and Albanians in remote Balkan villages,
what could they do in Congo? The United Nations Department of
Peacekeeping Operations told one military analyst in Pretoria that
patrolling Congo would require 100,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   And for how long? And what would they do when they were shot at?
The Congo cease-fire document expects the peacekeepers to disarm
more than a dozen armed forces, including Unita, the Mayi-Mayi
guerrillas and the Hutu militias. Unita has been at war for 25
years. The Mayi-Mayi charge into battle naked, thinking they're
bulletproof. The Hutu militias, if disarmed, would be deported to
Rwanda to be executed for genocide, so it is unlikely that they
will disarm voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's the ``stomach'' issue. Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, whose troops are fighting in Congo, was recently reported
to be mocking Western peacekeepers. ``Which U.N. troops will stay
in these mountains for six months?'' the Monitor newspaper quoted
him as saying. ``They will just run away like they did in Rwanda.
European soldiers go only to areas where there is no death.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the battle zone is contained, as in the Badme Triangle
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, peacekeepers could be a buffer
between the sides, as in Cyprus or the Golan Heights. But such
situations can be open-ended. Heitman put it this way: ``Cyprus?
The U.N.'s been there since the 60's. And if they left, the Turkish
and Greek Cypriots would go right back to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in Washington, London and Paris know this. They
haven't volunteered troops for Africa and thus far are reluctant to
pay for a United Nations effort.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for a couple of years now, the United States and Europe
have been prodding African countries to form a joint force to calm
the continent's constant crises. Even France, whose Foreign Legion
once aggressively policed its ex-colonies, wants out, said Chris
Landsberg, deputy director of the Center for Policy Studies. Africa
is slowly warming to the idea of a regional joint force, but it's
still all theory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the skittishness of the West infuriates Africans, who
often say it is racism to spend $1.50 per Kosovo refugee but only
11 cents per African refugee. Many African nations like Nigeria and
South Africa say they would be willing to provide the men to do
peace-keeping, but need help paying for them _ lots of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Post-Somalia, post-Rwanda, the West is able but unwilling, and
Africa is willing but unable,'' said Landsberg. ``Somehow, we have
to convince the West that peace in this area is in their interest.
And then hundreds of millions of dollars has to come from somewhere
_ $20 million here and $20 million there isn't going to do it.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: `Dixie' _ is it the words or the concept?
 &HT;    For release July 28, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWS ITEM: U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist led a sing-along
of ``Dixie'' at a recent law conference in Virginia, upsetting
lawyers who view the song as a nostalgic appeal to the days of
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, 48 years ago my basic training drill sergeant, an
African-American, didn't feel that way when he made our platoon run
through the tear gas chamber whistling ``Dixie'' _ or did he?
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly in defense of ``Dixie,'' or what people have come
to believe is the Confederate flag. If a portion of our population
sees only slavery in those two representations, then we ought to be
most careful of how we use it.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true about the Nazi flag. It is an affront not only
to Jews but to all those whose countries were occupied or otherwise
terrorized by those gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are times when it is pertinent to show that flag _ in
a historic context. While the people who put on the 4th Circuit
Judicial Conference felt the song was a proper piece of Americana,
the black lawyers did not.
</P>
<P>
   Something you should know: ``Dixie'' was composed by a
damnyankee!
</P>
<P>
   It was written in New York City in 1859 by Daniel Emmett, a
native of Mount Vernon, Ohio. Emmett wrote lots of songs, but
``Dixie'' was his legacy. It became the anthem of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite searching all over, I could not find out if the
Confederacy modified his original words to meet their needs. What I
did find out, however, is that ``Dixie'' had a Union version during
the 1861-65 unpleasantness. Reportedly, it was ordered by Union
generals to offset the popularity of the Southern ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Away down South in the land of traitors,
</P>
<P>
   Rattlesnakes and alligators,
</P>
<P>
   Right away, come away, right away, come away.
</P>
<P>
   Where cotton's king and men are chattels,
</P>
<P>
   Union boys will win the battles,
</P>
<P>
   Right away, come away, right away, come away.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'll all go down to Dixie,
</P>
<P>
   Away, away,
</P>
<P>
   Each Dixie boy must understand
</P>
<P>
   That he must mind his Uncle Sam,
</P>
<P>
   Away, away,
</P>
<P>
   And we'll all go down to Dixie,
</P>
<P>
   Away, away,
</P>
<P>
   And we'll all go down to Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that version also would not be acceptable to the
offended because the feeling against ``Dixie'' is for what it
represents rather than the specific words.
</P>
<P>
   That brings me to the Confederate flag that moreso offends
blacks and even most whites. I have a color copy of a flag that is
composed of three broad stripes _ red on top and bottom and white
in the middle _ and its upper left corner much like the U.S. flag,
stars on a field of blue; seven stars in a circle for the original
Confederate states.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, I could wave that flag in front of most
African-Americans and get no reaction because they might think, as
I did, that it was the flag of Chile or Texas or Liberia. But it
was the first Confederate flag, adopted in 1861. That was the flag
that was called ``The Stars and Bars.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag everyone has come to despise is the one with crossed
blue bars on a field of red with white stars running the length of
the bars. That was not the Confederate flag; it was the Confederate
battle flag. Perhaps a distinction without a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the war, the Confederacy embraced two more official
flags and each of those had a replica of the battle flag in its
upper left corner. More recently, various Southern state flags that
include the battle flag as part of their renderings have had
knock-down, drag-out battles with offended citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But, the question: If Rehnquist and his buddies hadn't sung
``Dixie'' but instead had displayed the original Confederate flag,
would anyone have known?
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't that have been sneaky?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A beaten drum for tax cuts
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the day House Republican leaders were whipping uneasy GOP
moderates into line to pass a massive $792 billion, 10-year tax cut
package, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his semiannual
report to Congress, was promising the Fed will ``act promptly and
forcefully'' against the first sign of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, put another way, there ain't no free lunch. A tax cut as
huge as the House wants would likely ignite the feared inflation
and would be snatched back by the higher interest rates the Fed
would use to douse the sparks.
</P>
<P>
   What's the percentage in trading lower taxes for bigger credit
card bills and costlier mortgages?
</P>
<P>
   Little to none, but never mind. This is all theater and theory
anyway. President Clinton says he will veto even the somewhat
smaller tax cuts that Senate Republicans, less hell-for-leather
than their House confreres, propose.
</P>
<P>
   The president, for his part, is tendering $250 billion in
targeted cuts, itself risky. Maybe the parties will split the baby;
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the real game here is to strike poses for next
year's elections, the Republicans as the big tax cutters, the
Democrats as the responsible tax cutters.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP plan, however, seems configured more to jolly core
Republican constituencies than a broad electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent cut in income taxes would amount to little more
than pocket change for middling earners but would let the high
rollers move up another model on the Mercedes ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the 25 percent cut in capital gains taxes and an end to
estate taxes and Citizens for Tax Justice figures 69 cents of every
$1 payoff would go to the 10 percent of taxpayers with the highest
incomes _ for that matter, 45 cents to the richest 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is, in effect, succor for the privileged.
</P>
<P>
   There's no popular appeal, either, in the grab bag of tax
goodies for the oil, timber, steel and gas industries. And, to
boot, a recent CNN/USA Today poll found that two-thirds of us don't
want to use the federal budget surplus for tax cuts of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   At least you can't accuse House Republicans of pandering to the
majority, and there's another queer twist here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Republicans denounced the national debt as if it
were the economic anti-Christ. To hold GOP moderates, House leaders
made the cuts conditional on reducing the arrears, but if Congress
means to steady Social Security and Medicare for the imminent
senior slam, and doesn't mean to ream out the rest of the nation's
civil agenda, big tax cuts would allow only token debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War it loved to fight won and those awful welfare
queens finally in their place, the Republican Party is increasingly
dependent upon tax cutting, and the corollary anti-governmentism,
as its animating rationale, and everything else go hang, debt
included.
</P>
<P>
   As with any percussion section that's down to one drum, the
drummer is reduced to banging the same drum louder and louder.

   If you're still eating all the wrong foods, it'll only get
harder for you to blame it on ignorance. Nutritional information is
a growth industry, and one place where it's popping up with
increasing frequency is the grocery-store shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the U.S. Food and Drug Administration opted
to allow food manufacturers to make claims on certain products
about the healthful benefits of whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   Labels on foods that consist, by weight, of at least 51 percent
whole grains now may state the following: ``Diets rich in whole
grain foods and other plant foods, and low in total fat, saturated
fat and cholesterol, may help reduce the risk of heart disease and
certain cancers.'' By KAREN UHLENHUTH. 660 words. Story will move

THE NARCOTICS CAPITAL OF EUROPE The Netherlands' vaunted drug

synthetic drugs what Colombia is to cocaine. Not only is Holland's
increasingly potent marijuana not staying in the legal coffee
shops, but its illegal export brings in far more money than that
traditional Dutch export, tulips. Meanwhile, drug addiction has

WITHOUT SWEAT, THE HEAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   ... 95, 96, 99, 100 degrees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're having a heat wave. And you know what that means.
Dripping, beading, drenching and vastly under-appreciated sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, under-appreciated. Because while sweat may seem bothersome
on these sultry days _ sopping your shirt, wetting your brow,
dripping down your spine, soaking saddlebags under your arms _
truth is, without it every one of us would be melting like a
Salvador Dali pocket watch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if sweating doesn't do its job and your core body
temperature rises beyond 105 degrees Fahrenheit, you're talking
kidney dysfunction, muscle breakdown, disruption of brain
functions, even death.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the human body employs all the processes at its
disposal _ convection, radiation and, of course, precious
perspiration _ to stay close to the temperature at which it runs
best: 98.6 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise, contract a fever, stand in the summer sun, let
nervousness set your heart racing, do anything to increase the
body's temperature just a fraction and you'll quickly appreciate
how reliable the body's 5 million sweat glands are.
</P>
<P>
   Thar she flows! Almost instantaneously. And all for your bodily
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, in the midst of these scorching temperatures, we
offer this salute to sweat, a primer on perspiration and some of
the other important ways the body, in all this hot weather, stays
cool.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who say don't sweat the heat _ hey, be glad you
can.
</P>
<P>
   You heat up; you cool down
</P>
<P>
   1. Nerves called thermoreceptors inside the body and on the skin
signal the brain to a rise in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   2. In the brain, the hypothalamus is the body's thermostat. When
body temperature rises above 98.6 degrees _ from fever,
nervousness, exercise, outside temperature _ the nervous system
reacts to get rid of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   3. Flushed skin: Blood vessels dilate, opening up like big
pipes, rushing more blood to the skin's surface, causing more heat
can escape.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sweat glands pump perspiration to the surface of the skin
through pores. Cooling occurs when body heat is transferred to the
sweat, causing it to evaporate and cool the skin. Dripping sweat
means perspiration can't evaporate fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sweat is 99 percent water and 1 percent dissolved substances
such as salt.
</P>
<P>
   6. About a pint of water is lost through the skin in normal
conditions, although as much as 3 gallons can be lost in a day
through strenuous exercise or during hot weather. That's why
staying hydrated is vital.
</P>
<P>
   7. The body's 5 million sweat glands are packed so tight that a
green pea placed on the skin's surface would cover more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   8. Sweat glands come in two types: Eccrine glands, which are the
most common, and appocrine glands found mostly in hairy areas, such
as the armpits, chest and genital area, and which become active
during puberty.
</P>
<P>
   9. Sweat itself is odorless. A reaction with bacteria produces
odor.
</P>
<P>
   10. Aluminum and zirconium salts in antiperspirants react with
sweat to create a plug that stops up the sweat gland. They also
contain some anti-bacterial agents, as do deodorants, which are
mostly perfume. The best roll-on and soft-solid antiperspirants
reduce sweat output by about 50 percent; sticks 25 to 45 percent;
aerosols 25 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   11. Facial sweating from spicy foods comes from capsaicin, a
component in the food that stimulates nerves in the mouth that
usually respond to rises in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   12. Fans, washcloths, air conditioners and breezes reduce body
temperature through convection, in which the heat of the body is
transferred to currents of water or cool surrounding air.
</P>
<P>
   13. When comfortable and at rest, the body typically gets rid of
about 60 percent of excess heat via infrared radiation. Heat
travels from the skin to cooler surrounding objects. It's when the
body heats up that sweat and evaporation become more vital.
</P>
<P>
   14. Humidity: The body stays hot because the air is already
thick with water vapor. There's little place for evaporated sweat
to go, so the rate of evaporation slows. Since it's evaporation and
not sweat, per se, that cools the skin, the skin stays hot and wet.

   15. Danger is at hand if someone suddenly stops sweating in hot
weather. That means the body is in shock, preserving water and
going into possibly fatal heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   16. Some people are born without working sweat glands. The
condition, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, is rare, inherited
and incurable. It also produces dry skin, wrinkled skin, sparse dry
hair, small brittle nails and cone-shaped teeth. Reduced activity
is the most common treatment.
</P>
<P>
   17. Hyperhidrosis is a socially embarrassing disorder that
causes people to sweat excessively, especially from the arms, feet
and hands, even in normal conditions. The use of botulism toxin, or
Botox, to paralyze the sweat gland is the most recent effective
treatment, lasting up to 6 months, after which new nerve endings
grow and the treatment must be repeated.

FDA ALLOWS FOOD MAKERS TO TOUT BENEFITS OF EATING WHOLE-GRAIN
PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're still eating all the wrong foods, it'll only get
harder for you to blame it on ignorance. Nutritional information is
a growth industry, and one place where it's popping up with
increasing frequency is the grocery-store shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the U.S. Food and Drug Administration opted
to allow food manufacturers to make claims on certain products
about the healthful benefits of whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   Labels on foods that consist, by weight, of at least 51 percent
whole grains now may state the following: ``Diets rich in whole
grain foods and other plant foods, and low in total fat, saturated
fat and cholesterol, may help reduce the risk of heart disease and
certain cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 the FDA has authorized food manufacturers to make 10
different health claims about products that meet certain
specifications. The permitted claims refer, for example, to the
benefits of diets high in calcium, soluble fiber and folate, and
low in fat, sodium and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, labels on some General Mills products
will incorporate the whole grains statement, which is the 11th
health claim to appear on food packaging. General Mills sought
permission from the FDA to make the claim. It applies to all food
manufacturers, as long as the product in question meets
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have demonstrated that their purchasing decisions are
affected by information about the connection between diet and
health, according to Tom Johnson, spokesman for General Mills in
Minneapolis. Whenever there is a news report about research
indicating that whole grains help to ward off disease and maintain
good health, sales of Cheerios and Wheaties increase, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that people view television commercials with a fair
amount of skepticism. They know they're being pitched to, that the
company just wants them to buy their product,'' Johnson said.
``What's more impactful is to provide them news they can use.''
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, they put more stock in information from a
presumably neutral source, such as a government agency. Consumers
``don't have to take our word for it'' on health claims OK'd by the
FDA, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although she believes that nutrition labels _ those breakdowns
on amounts of fat, sodium, protein and other nutrients _ have
improved somewhat, Leslie Bonci believes many people still are
``incredibly confused by them.''
</P>
<P>
   More accessible, and more helpful, she believes, are the simpler
health claims such as the one regarding whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's giving people a reason to use it, rather than just
numeric information'' that they may not know how to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   Americans as a whole fall short of the recommended levels of
grain consumption by about 30 percent, according to the American
Dietetic Association. The U.S. Department of Agriculture advises
eating between six and 11 servings daily.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons to eat not only grains, but also whole
grains, noted Bonci, who is the director of sports medicine
nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and a
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   They are a source of some phytochemicals (plant chemicals) that
are emerging as important defenses against cancer. Whole grains are
a good source of lignin, which seems to offer some protection
against breast cancer. Also contained in whole grains is phytic
acid, which binds to excess iron. Excess iron causes cholesterol to
adhere to artery walls and increases the incidence of cell
mutations that can lead to cancerous growths.
</P>
<P>
   Whole grains are also a source of selenium, another
anti-oxidant. It is thought possibly to be active against the
development of prostate cancer, Bonci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not found in that many foods,'' Bonci said. ``A few nuts
have selenium. Turkey does as well. But if you're looking for a
daily source of selenium, whole grains are one of the best ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The new whole-grain health claim may help shoppers distinguish
between breads that are mostly whole-grain and those that are
mostly refined flour. Brown-colored bread does not necessarily
contain whole grains. It may just be molasses you're seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Bonci recommends picking bread in which the first listed
ingredient is whole wheat, whole rye or some other whole grain.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the virtues of whole grains is the nondigestible
fiber they contain, Bonci said. Wheat has a lot of insoluble fiber,
which helps with bowel health. Oats, rye and barley are better
sources of soluble fiber, which lowers the blood cholesterol level
by binding to the fat and carrying it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to eat a heck of a lot,'' to do yourself a lot
of good, Bonci said. ``It would behoove people to try to
incorporate both of those things into their diet every day.''

 &HT;    Chasm between the `haves' and `have-nots' is widening
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We Americans generally assume that the next century will bring
us heaps of new high-tech tools, toys and gadgets. In the
Information Age, we'll be living the George Jetson lifestyle,
zooming around in our advanced vehicles and coming home to a host
of labor-saving devices.
</P>
<P>
   But millions, indeed billions, of people in other countries may
be living more like Fred Flintstone in the new century, using rocks
and other raw materials to pound out a bare existence. A recently
released United Nations report suggests that unless wealthy nations
do more to help poor ones catch up, the 21st century will see the
Earth split into two very different planets, one inhabited by a
minority enjoying new technologies, and another populated by
poverty-stricken, low-tech masses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course technological advances have always allowed some people
to lead much better lives than others. When Egyptian Queen
Cleopatra was lounging by the Nile, many cavemen were still wearing
skins and chasing wild animals for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology gap has never been so wide as today. For
example, 200 years ago, a wealthy American could sip fine wine,
ride in an elegant carriage and wear well-tailored clothes. Still,
he was no better off than his poorest neighbor in many ways: Both a
rich man and a beggar got their light from a flame and their warmth
from logs on a fire. The wealthiest families had no more protection
against smallpox than the poorest. The U.N. Development Program's
report on the ``haves'' and ``have-nots'' measured the enormity of
the gap today. One statistic told the story: The world's 200
richest people _ a group small enough to gather easily for dinner
in a hotel ballroom _ together have more money than the combined
income of the lowest 40 percent of the world's population, or about
2.4 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Among nations, Canada, Norway and the United States are the
richest. The poorest 22 countries are all in Africa, but poverty
also abounds in Asia and Latin America. The report says technology
and wealth clearly are linked. For example, in the wealthy
principality of Monaco in 1996, there were 99 telephone lines for
every 100 people. In poverty-plagued Cambodia, there was one phone
line per 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Such contrasts will increase because wealthy people can afford
to keep buying more advanced tools, while the poorest people still
can't get basic equipment for participation in the Information Age.
The report noted that the average American pays about one month's
wage for a personal computer; the average Bangladeshi would need
eight years of income to buy a computer. Then the Bangladeshi would
have to learn English to take full advantage of the Internet, where
80 percent of the sites are in English.
</P>
<P>
   To help poor countries, the U.N. report floated the idea of
having advanced countries impose upon themselves a tax of one U.S.
cent on every 100 lengthy e-mails sent by an individual. The U.N.
economists said such a tax would have raised about $70 billion in
1996 to help pay for wiring undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. politicians and Internet users raced to attack the
tax, and U.N. officials backed off.
</P>
<P>
   But while the e-mail tax was sent straight to the dead letter
office, no other serious plans for narrowing the technology gap are
circulating. So as the George Jetsons of the world prepare to zip
around faster and higher, the Stone Age families are slipping
further behind. Whether two such different worlds can share the
same planet will be one of the great questions for the next
century.

 &HT;    Freedom and (driver's) license
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I have been walking around for weeks with
no clue as to who I am.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know me would say this is neither new nor news. But I
mean external clues, proof, documentation. All were lost along with
my wallet.
</P>
<P>
   I had moved swiftly to get a new bank card, cancel the credit
card and restore my library checkout privileges. But the driver's
license took some time. The old one had been with me so long it
deserved a mourning period before some flashy new thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, like many states, you can pass significant periods
of your life using the same driver's license. Licenses are issued
for six years but you can renew by mail twice and slap new stickers
on the old photo. If you're careful about your wallet, your license
picture can remain 20 years old until you are 38.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not quite that careful. Nonetheless, the Mark Lane on the
lost license is altogether less frayed on the edges than the
bearer. He is a vibrant bon vivant, ungrayed and possessing the
spring in his step one associates with people who are not parents
of teen-agers. His depiction was an unusually fine example of the
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles' portraiture
skills.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pleasure trying to pass as that person. I shall miss
him.
</P>
<P>
   The old license was complete with a long-expired address (a
violation of Florida Statute 322.19, punishable by a fine of $32)
and a restriction denoted by the letter A. (``Restriction A: Bearer
should not so much as walk to the end of his driveway without
wearing corrective lenses. He may drive without them in emergencies
only if his car is equipped with huge flashing lights and a public
address system that repeats the phrase `run for your lives!' at
regular intervals.'')
</P>
<P>
   The new license retains my A. As though to emphasize it, the man
it depicts is already wearing corrective lenses. He is a more solid
citizen whose face swells to fill the frame allotted him. He does
not need to show this card to buy beer. Hasn't for ages.
</P>
<P>
   I was in no hurry to see him.
</P>
<P>
   That I was able to put him off so long not only is a tribute to
my powers of positive procrastination, but to the freedom enjoyed
in American society _ at least for a white person of bland
appearance. Not once during this time was I asked to produce a
photo ID. Not by police, the National Guard, security guards, guys
at desks or men in black.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Walking around without so much as a fake ID is a
luxury over most of this planet. Internal passports, laminated
national ID cards and typed-on-the-dotted-line slips of cardboard
with a box for thumbprints usually are the rule, even in countries
classified as ``democracies'' in any encyclopedia or almanac.
</P>
<P>
   I wish some group would conduct a study of the relative freedom
of nations by timing how long one can walk around before someone
makes you show an ID. They could hit the stopwatch after clearing
Customs, walk out of the main airport and time how long it takes.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be a freedom index in minutes and hours and
days. This would be far more enlightening that merely noting
whether elections are held once in a while. At last, we would have
an accurate barometer of government paranoia and the eagerness of
minor authorities to hassle folks.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the U.S., I successfully waited weeks before even
inquiring about a new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``About how long is the wait if I come over now?'' I asked the
first human voice that answered the number for the Division of
Driver Licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that depends on how many people are in line ahead of
you, wouldn't it,'' replied a woman, in the slow and patient tones
one would use with a very dim child.
</P>
<P>
   I took this as bad news and went yet another week without ID
before driving to the next county to find walk-in service.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a very striking license with a new more mature
picture, a shiny holographic outline of the state and the word
``Florida'' repeated in letters not dissimilar to those shown on
second-grade handwriting lesson books. These touches are meant to
deter counterfeiting, but they also make for an altogether spiffier
card.
</P>
<P>
   I put it deep in the recesses of an old wallet I had recalled
into service. It is my sincere hope that it remains there
undisturbed.

 &HT;    Trip to the vet a nightmare _ for me and my cats
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Last night I had one of those ``wake myself
up screaming nightmares'' that I have come to dread, not only
because I scare myself, but since I'm sleeping in a hammock on the
screened porch, it probably gives the neighbors quite a start as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, these nightmares are a pretty simple plot _ someone has
me by the throat and is telling me I'm history because of an
imagined slight back in kindergarten. No fooling. One night this
mean boy was throttling me because I'd grabbed his favorite
airplane out of the sandbox and flown home with it.
</P>
<P>
   But last night I was not being threatened by a second-grader
with a grudge, nor had I discovered an alien life form in the
refrigerator (other than the leftovers). Last night was a whole
different approach to the midnight collywobbles that attack under
cover of darkness and without warning. Last night, I dreamed I had
taken my two cats, Stella and Biddy, on a vacation in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The girls hated everything _ the ocean, the cottage, and our
visitors. They turned their little wet noses up at freshly caught
fish, and loudly objected to the idea of a wall-to-wall sandbox.
They were righteously disgruntled with the whole notion of travel.
Their pussycat protests quickly escalated into a parody of a
Stephen King pulper.
</P>
<P>
   Stella, normally a skittish little lady, had metamorphosed into
a fire-breathing dervish, cutting loose with blood-curdling
shrieks, and feverishly flinging her entire body at the screens in
an attempt to claw her way to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy, ordinarily a pushy Siamese with a big mouth, was
curiously silent as she pinned me to the floor and sat motionless
on my chest, dangling a behemoth of a bug in my face. She was
trying to cut a deal. Either I took her home at once, back to her
pink water dish and favorite sofa, or she would launch the bug from
my nose.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't wake up screaming? I shouted the owls off their
nearby limbs. I'm sure I woke the neighbors, and probably even
panicked the raccoon that hangs out on the porch roof just over my
head. It took a few minutes to recoup and realize I was safe in my
hammock and that the girls were just inside in my son's old
bedroom, curled up for the night in the top bunk.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been big on analyzing my dreams because I usually
can't remember them very well _ except the one where Robert Redford
drives his pickup right up to my front porch, demanding I leave
immediately with him for Mexico where we will rob banks and report
the 6 o'clock news. While I'm not too keen on the idea of heisting
pesos and winding up in a south-of-the-border lockup, it's tough to
resist his lopsided grin and the naval officer's uniform he wore in
``The Way We Were.'' But last night's nightmare is pretty easy to
figure. It's time to take the girls in for their annual checkup and
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly folks, doing battle with Attila's Huns couldn't be any
tougher than playing ``Capture the Kitty'' when it's time for a
trip to the vet. The girls hate their carriers, they hate the
truck, they hate me, and they especially hate Doc. Biddy bites him
and Stella usually plays dead on the examining table _ except last
year when she broke out of her basket, sprinted through the waiting
room and out the front door that was being held open by a startled
lady and her equally amazed basset.
</P>
<P>
   Stella sped under a hedge, through a flower bed and into a
nearby house by means of a handy pet door accessing a glassed-in
back porch. Fortunately, the four-footed owner seemed to be away.
Unfortunately, so did the two-footed owner. No one answered the
doorbell and I was reduced to lying on my belly with my head stuck
through a Pet Port, swearing.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while and we gathered quite an audience, but
eventually Stella came to investigate why her person was making
such an ass of herself in front of all those people. That's when I
snatched her.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's time to do it again. No wonder I can't sleep.

<P>
   Those who know me would say this is neither new nor news. But I
mean external clues, proof, documentation. All were lost along with
my wallet.
</P>
<P>
   I had moved swiftly to get a new bank card, cancel the credit
card and restore my library checkout privileges. But the driver's
license took some time. The old one had been with me so long it
deserved a mourning period before some flashy new thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, like many states, you can pass significant periods
of your life using the same driver's license. Licenses are issued
for six years but you can renew by mail twice and slap new stickers
on the old photo. If you're careful about your wallet, your license
picture can remain 20 years old until you are 38.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not quite that careful. Nonetheless, the Mark Lane on the
lost license is altogether less frayed on the edges than the
bearer. He is a vibrant bon vivant, ungrayed and possessing the
spring in his step one associates with people who are not parents
of teen-agers. His depiction was an unusually fine example of the
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles' portraiture
skills.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pleasure trying to pass as that person. I shall miss
him.
</P>
<P>
   The old license was complete with a long-expired address (a
violation of Florida Statute 322.19, punishable by a fine of $32)
and a restriction denoted by the letter A. (``Restriction A: Bearer
should not so much as walk to the end of his driveway without
wearing corrective lenses. He may drive without them in emergencies
only if his car is equipped with huge flashing lights and a public
address system that repeats the phrase `run for your lives!' at
regular intervals.'')
</P>
<P>
   The new license retains my A. As though to emphasize it, the man
it depicts is already wearing corrective lenses. He is a more solid
citizen whose face swells to fill the frame allotted him. He does
not need to show this card to buy beer. Hasn't for ages.
</P>
<P>
   I was in no hurry to see him.
</P>
<P>
   That I was able to put him off so long not only is a tribute to
my powers of positive procrastination, but to the freedom enjoyed
in American society _ at least for a white person of bland
appearance. Not once during this time was I asked to produce a
photo ID. Not by police, the National Guard, security guards, guys
at desks or men in black.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Walking around without so much as a fake ID is a
luxury over most of this planet. Internal passports, laminated
national ID cards and typed-on-the-dotted-line slips of cardboard
with a box for thumbprints usually are the rule, even in countries
classified as ``democracies'' in any encyclopedia or almanac.
</P>
<P>
   I wish some group would conduct a study of the relative freedom
of nations by timing how long one can walk around before someone
makes you show an ID. They could hit the stopwatch after clearing
Customs, walk out of the main airport and time how long it takes.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be a freedom index in minutes and hours and
days. This would be far more enlightening that merely noting
whether elections are held once in a while. At last, we would have
an accurate barometer of government paranoia and the eagerness of
minor authorities to hassle folks.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the U.S., I successfully waited weeks before even
inquiring about a new card.
</P>
<P>
   ``About how long is the wait if I come over now?'' I asked the
first human voice that answered the number for the Division of
Driver Licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that depends on how many people are in line ahead of
you, wouldn't it,'' replied a woman, in the slow and patient tones
one would use with a very dim child.
</P>
<P>
   I took this as bad news and went yet another week without ID
before driving to the next county to find walk-in service.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a very striking license with a new more mature
picture, a shiny holographic outline of the state and the word
``Florida'' repeated in letters not dissimilar to those shown on
second-grade handwriting lesson books. These touches are meant to
deter counterfeiting, but they also make for an altogether spiffier
card.
</P>
<P>
   I put it deep in the recesses of an old wallet I had recalled
into service. It is my sincere hope that it remains there
undisturbed.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: Is it more economical to turn out the lights
every time you leave a room (lower electric bill) or is it better
to leave them on (light bulbs do not burn out as fast when not
turned on and off all the time)? _ Gail W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Off. Whether you have fluorescent or incandescent lighting,
you will use less electricity and save on your electric bill by
turning lights off, says Kathy Kirwin of Austin Energy. The savings
most likely will offset any cost associated with the wear and tear
on the bulb. Lights left on unnecessarily also add heat to a room.
Turn off the lights and save on your air-conditioning bill, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did Charismatic break his leg at Belmont? _ M.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Veterinary technician Danny Hays suspects the injury was
sustained at the start of the race, when horses dig their hooves
into the ground. Any slippage at the get-go could have produced
hazardous stress on a fragile lower leg. Q: Some say Bob Barker is
about 80 years old or more. I say he is 76 years old. Also, is he
married to Janice Pennington? _ Dorothy R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Good guess, but you have both gone over the actual Bob Barker
age. Mr. ``Price is Right'' will turn 76 on Dec. 12. A widower who
remains single, Barker was married to Dorothy Jo Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that the electricity coming into your house often
may not be at full capacity. It apparently can affect the
performance of appliances and perhaps even damage them. How can a
homeowner check, or better yet, have checked, whether he/she is
receiving the full capacity of the electric power to the house? The
ceiling fans in my house groan at times and not at others. After
checking each one for its proper oil level, I suspect the
electricity feeding them is at times not at full capacity. _ J.
James
</P>
<P>
   A: Call your electricity provider. Voltage problems with home
electric service are likely to show up in higher-demand appliances
or flickering lights rather than ceiling fans. A virtue of the
ceiling fan is its small power pull. Are you using fan controls
rather than dimmer switches? Fan motors are meant to start on high
speed. Dimmer switches actually work just the opposite, causing the
fan to work hard to move from low speed to high speed
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I learn how to read tarot cards? Instructions? Book?
Video? _ J.A.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Tarot cards are a fortunetelling aid showing ``possible
paths,'' says Book People's S. Sutterfield Winn, who oversees the
tarot card section. (Today's word is ``arcana,'' readers, meaning
``specialized knowledge unfamiliar to Joe Six-Pack.'') The deck
usually consists of minor arcana (56 suit cards) and major arcana
(22 pictorial symbol cards). Minor arcana cards often resemble
familiar playing cards such as kings, queens, etc. For a primer,
try ``Tarot Plain and Simple'' by Anthony Louis or ``Tarot Made
Easy'' by Nancy Garen. Now pass the tea leaves. Contact Jane Greig,
author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box 670, Austin TX 78767;
(512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512)

 &HT;    Computer advice sites more than ample
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What could be more sensible than to use your computer
and the Internet to get the advice you need to help fix your
computer?
</P>
<P>
   The Web is rich with sites like these _ some commercially
sponsored, a few that charge for the advice and many that are pure
works of love.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop today is Help2Go at www.help2go.com/index.htm.
You'll get tips on buying a computer and working on it, and there's
also a help section on using the Internet. One of the best features
is a topic area called ``Five Minute Guides.''
</P>
<P>
   True to the title, this is simple advice in abbreviated form.
But it may be all you need for some topics. For instance, if you're
a beginner and curious about the difference between a DVD and CD,
the five minutes' worth of information is probably all you need.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a search function here. It works, but you'll have
to be patient. A search, for instance, for USB (universal serial
bus) turned up several pages where the term was mentioned in
passing. But the third page suggested by the search engine was a
glossary of terms that offered a definition of USB.
</P>
<P>
   One negative on this page is the lack of a way to ask a specific
question. A lot of computer predicaments are unique, and more than
general help is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The next page is called the Advice Guy(at)Cyber Komfort. You'll
find it at mysiteinc.com
</P>
<P>
   /theadviceguy/. Cyber Komfort is in the business of selling
computers, and you'll find plenty of ads for that service on the
page. But this page does have an e-mail link that you can use to
ask computer questions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequent requests from both experienced and
novice users alike is for advice on buying a new computer. You'll
find some excellent reviews and advice at a page called PC Shopping
Advice at compreviews.miningco.com/msubsho.htm.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find some excellent articles here, including some from
Family PC and Computer Shopper. You'll also find links to other
sites on the Web that offer computer advice.
</P>
<P>
   The next page is anything but fancy and seems to be part of a
personal home page. But if you are new to computers, you'll profit
from the advice found on a page called Computer Advice at
showme.net/(tilde)fkeller/advice/.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending a lot of time explaining how things work,
the proprietor of this page just offers the sort of basic tips that
would help any newcomer to computing. If you don't care how things
work but just want to make sure that your computer does work over
the long haul, you'll profit from the tips on this page.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, there are literally hundreds of computer advice sites
on the Web. If you visited them all, you never have time to get in
trouble with your computer _ you'd be too busy reading.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are times when a general advice site won't help.
Some of the most valuable sites are those maintained by specific
software manufacturers (for instance, most Windows users will find
Microsoft's site at www.microsoft.com invaluable, and Macintosh
users will find plenty to like at www.apple.com).
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for sites maintained by almost every reputable
manufacturer of computers or computer accessories.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find everything from troubleshooting hints to updated
drivers for video cards and modems to ``bug fixes'' _ little
programs that correct a problem in a manufacturer's software.

 &HT;    Apple turns the tables on PCs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer's once-crippling weakness has become
its strength.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness was, of course, Apple's Macs were not PCs. A year
ago, few people wanted a computer that didn't run Microsoft's
Windows operating system and all the software published for that
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Macs still aren't PCs, but now Apple has managed to turn that
distinction to its advantage. With the introduction of the iMac
last August, Apple's computers have once again become fashion
statements, a symbol that their owners are special and different.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of buyers are willing to pay a little extra for a
computer they believe is special. Mac users are paying more as
prices for computers in general are falling fast, hurting many PC
makers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some industry analysts are now saying Apple no
longer needs to convert PC users to its platform. The company can
prosper, they say, by just capturing a growing number of first-time
users with its iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the iMac phenomenon more evident than in Apple's
recently released third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Apple beat Wall Street's estimates that it would earn 64 cents a
share. Instead, the company reported net income of $114 million, or
69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   What drove those results was the continuing surge in iMac sales.
Overall, sales of all Macs were up 40 percent from a year earlier _
twice the growth rate of the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Macs captured 11.5 percent of retail and mail-order sales
for computers during the first two months of this year, according
to market researcher PC Data. That figure is up from 6.3 percent a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the company's gross profit margin improved to 27.4
percent from 25.7 percent. The improvement was attributed to
falling prices for computer components.
</P>
<P>
   Such strong results are driving Apple's stock higher. It has
risen about 55 percent in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone views Apple's strong third-quarter results as
irrefutable evidence of a turnaround. Naysayers still see signs of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They point, for example, to Apple's third-quarter revenue. It
grew at a much slower pace than unit sales, up only 11 percent to
$1.6 billion, compared with $1.4 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures portray a company that is still down sharply from
its peak of $11 billion in sales annually in the mid-1990s. Yet,
for Apple, those record sales were not translating into profit. The
company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs has refashioned Apple
into a smaller company focused on three key markets: education,
home and desktop publishing. So far, it looks like a winning
strategy.

 &HT;    NPR still sluggish, but at least it's trying
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When we last left our hero, the Web-challenged
National Public Radio, we were both amused and confused by NPR's
sheer lack of Web marketing know-how. Also taken to task were
Amazon.com and other online retailers for seriously underestimating
NPR's audience.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when I wrote the column about NPR's minimal use of the
Web, none of the big three booksellers was doing much to promote or
even stock NPR titles, which was odd, given the upscale, literate
and computer-savvy audience of NPR listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners were cheered somewhat several weeks ago when NPR
announced a deal to offer its programming on America Online. Users
who go to AOL keyword NPR will be connected to the latest news from
NPR in audio or video slide show format.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it seemed that NPR was hopping on the Web bandwagon in
a big way. A presence on AOL, consistently ranked the top news
destination on the Web by Media Metrix, would be a giant step
forward toward giving NPR a greater online presence.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that NPR will be a great asset to AOL's
already-considerable news area. Now users who are tired of generic
news have the option of tuning in to NPR's unique perspective on
world and national events. It's also a great opportunity for NPR to
put its best foot forward in front of AOL's 20 million users.
</P>
<P>
   However, NPR may have been smart enough to do the deal, but
still not smart enough to figure out how to build out its brand in
the interactive world. It makes you kind of want to shake your head
the way ABC newsman Ted Koppel did at presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis the night before Ronald Reagan won his landslide
victory in 1988, and mutter, ``You just don't get it, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   The NPR area of AOL is just as bland and boring and completely
devoid of personality as the NPR Web site. AOL users can listen to
NPR broadcasts without downloading any special software. This is
good. Listeners can also e-mail comments to NPR for possible on-air
reading. This is also good.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, here is where all the good things end. There are too many
missed opportunities to count. However, the area isn't even a month
old and, hopefully, there's a lot to this area users haven't seen
yet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a link called ``transcripts,'' but all it
does is give you a phone number and an address to either call or
send away for tapes. Very reliable sources tell us that calling
this number to order tapes puts you into a voice mail system
reminiscent of Dante's seven circles of hell. Why NPR just doesn't
take advantage of AOL's infrastructure to let people order tapes
online is positively bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the message boards so listeners can e-mail such
airwave celebrities as Scott Simon, Nina Tottenberg or Terri Gross?
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging to see a link called ``programs,'' but here
again, NPR drops the ball. Clicking any of the NPR programs listed
just gives you a written description _ a written description! _ of
the programs. At the very least there could have been a little
bitty sound clip of Gross plugging her wonderful show ``Fresh
Air.'' If there are issues involving rights and clearances that
keep NPR from putting more of its content online or making more of
it available online, please just tell us. We'll understand.
</P>
<P>
   However, users can link to the far more colorful Web sites for
member stations from Maine to California. Even the smallest site
for the smallest station in the smallest city lets users pledge
money, check out program schedules, volunteer, post messages and
provide feedback to the station. Makes you think, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the world waits for National Public Radio to
develop a Web strategy, Amazon and Borders were busy stocking up on
NPR-featured books and CDs. They were also busy building out
special areas for the items featured on NPR.
</P>
<P>
   Special mention goes to Borders.com, which also has an in-store
relationship with NPR. It went from a sad little NPR page that
didn't even have pictures of half the books to a pretty nice area
highlighted by some clever copy about how hard it is to keep track
of every book mentioned on NPR. However, the site gallantly offers
to try, and its selection is good. Amazon.com, which had a small
section devoted to NPR-featured materials, has added more stock to
its NPR area, which can be found in its ``As Featured in the
Media'' section.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, retailers don't need to be told twice when there's
money to be made on the Web. Hopefully, NPR will use its new home
on AOL to take advantage of the interactive as well as the audio
and text aspects of the Web and create something that will charm
longtime listeners and attract new ones.

 &HT;    +Ahh, the good old days

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sick and tired of your mom saying, ``Now, back when I
was your age . . . ''? You can get the skinny on what the olden
days were really like with a new book, ``The Way Things Never Were:
The Truth About the Good Old Days'' by Norman H. Finkelstein
(Atheneum, $16). It's loaded with facts on everything from fast
food and family life to protests and pollution. It's a quick way to
become a mini-expert on the '50s, '60s and '70s _ decades that had
their share of problems, as the author points out.

States? There are approximately 66.1 million cats as pets vs. 58.2
million dogs, according to the ``Kid's Almanac for the 21st
Century'' (Scholastic, $18.95). Parakeets are in third place with
14 million, followed by small animals, such as rabbits, hamsters
and gerbils, at 12.7 million.

 &HT;    Unwrapping the mystery of mummies
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's one of the great mysteries of the universe: Is
there life after death?
</P>
<P>
   And, if there is life after death, comedian Woody Allen once
joked: ``How should you dress for it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Egyptians long ago concluded there is life after death
and the way to dress for it is to have your body mummified.
</P>
<P>
   People find humor and horror in mummies. Their bandaged bodies
have appeared in many books, movies and TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   For Egyptians, mummies were as serious as life and death.
Egyptians began mummifying their dead about 5,000 years ago. It was
an elaborate process that took 70 days, but it preserved the body
for all time. You can see real mummies and other Egyptian artifacts
at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   For archeologists who study ancient civilizations, mummies are
vital in understanding Egyptian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Egyptians built pyramids to protect the graves of their
kings, who were known as pharaohs. About 50 royal pyramids still
exist.
</P>
<P>
   The kings were buried with their worldly goods so they could
enjoy the afterlife. The items included things such as hunting
weapons, game boards and food.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands upon thousands of Egyptians were mummified during the
3,000-year history of ancient Egypt. Even cats, which the Egyptians
believed were sacred, were mummified.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, many of the human mummies were removed by grave
robbers along with the contents of their tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Different cultures have not always respected the ancient
Egyptians' religious beliefs. During the Middle Ages, mummies were
ground up by Europeans who believed they made good medicine.
Mummies also have been used as fertilizer. Mummies have even been
burned as fuel to run steam engines!
</P>
<P>
   Americans became fascinated with mummies after British
archeologist Howard Carter discovered in 1922 the tomb of King
Tutankhamen (also known as King Tut), with much of its contents
intact, including a solid gold death mask.
</P>
<P>
   King Tut's tomb was such a worldwide sensation, it caused
Egyptian art and architecture to be very popular.
</P>
<P>
   Tut's discovery also brought about a belief in the so-called
``Mummy's Curse.'' Six weeks after Carter opened Tut's tomb, Lord
George Carnarvon _ who financed the expedition _ died of
complications after being bitten by a mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE A MUMMY!
</P>
<P>
   Making a mummy is not as difficult as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   All it requires is the following recipe, which calls for adding
lots of salt called natron, which is found along the Nile River.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins with removing all the internal organs of the
body except the heart (which ancient Egyptians considered more
important than the brain).
</P>
<P>
   The internal organs were preserved and put in what were known as
canopic jars, then stored in the tomb along with the body.
</P>
<P>
   The body was packed and covered with salt and left to dry for 40
to 50 days. Then the body was filled with resin, sawdust or linen
and shaped to restore the person's form and features.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes fake stone eyes were added. If the person was royalty,
an elaborate mask was made, such as the solid gold one for King
Tut.
</P>
<P>
   The body was then tightly wrapped with layers of linen, with
good luck charms put between the layers. At each stage of wrapping,
a priest recited prayers.
</P>
<P>
   The wrapping procedure could take as long as 15 days. Then the
body was put into a casket.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the process took about 70 days.

 &HT;    Teacher punished over Beanie Babies
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A high school teacher in Georgia has been suspended
for offering her students extra credit for bringing her Beanie Baby
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Penland, who taught economics at Campbell High in Cobb
County, will be out of school for 60 days, the county school board
ruled on Thursday. After that, she'll be sent to a different
school.
</P>
<P>
   Penland's lawyer said he would fight the ruling in court.
</P>
<P>
   He contended Penland was using Beanie Baby bonuses as a lesson
in economics and charity work. He said she planned to donate the
toys to foster kids.
</P>
<P>
   Penland was Campbell's teacher of the year last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two boys guilty of cruelty
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia's Hall County last week, two teen-agers were
convicted of animal cruelty and damage to property after they
killed a kitten by setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, ages 13 and 14, will undergo psychological testing
before the judge decides their sentence. They will be under house
arrest at their homes in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The trial attracted the interest of animal-welfare activists
from around the Atlanta area. Many appeared at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The activists hope that the incident will cause the state
Legislature to make animal cruelty a felony, the most serious kind
of crime. Now it is a misdemeanor, which carries lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is a dangerous place to walk
</P>
<P>
   Even though streets across the nation are becoming safer for
pedestrians, in the Atlanta area more walkers are being killed.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the conclusions from a study on pedestrian safety
by the state and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   For the study, the Atlanta area was defined as Fulton, DeKalb,
Cobb and Gwinnett counties. In 1998 alone, 69 people were killed in
pedestrian accidents in the four counties. That was up 13 percent
from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers blamed several factors for the danger, including too
few sidewalks and reckless behavior by both drivers and walkers.
Georgia transportation officials say they will be adding more
crosswalks and walk signals at intersections.
</P>
<P>
   President's son mourned
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who
died in a plane crash July 16, were remembered during two memorial
services last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 1,000 people crowded into a church to hear tributes
to the Kennedys. Thousands more stood outside.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, friends and family members held another service at a
smaller church. President Clinton and his family attended.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the Kennedys' ashes were scattered in the
Atlantic Ocean, near where their plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy Jr., who worked as a magazine editor, was the son
of President John F. Kennedy.

 &HT;    Well-connected: Home networking concept booming
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A network computer crash is never a pretty thing.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on Richard Bodor's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My users cry, kick and hold their breath when the network is
down,'' he says. ``They say, `I don't like Daddy. He's not getting
a Father's Day present.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bodor has been networking the computers in his Alpharetta home
for seven years. That network gets extensive use by the five
computer-adept Bodors. Wife Kim uses it for real estate searches
and tracking stocks; Denise, 13, uses America Online Instant
Messenger to keep up with friends; Richard, 11, is the gamer; and
Amy, 8, is into ``activityware'' like ``Mr. Potatohead'' and
``Spiderman Animator.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the network is up and running smoothly, things can
still be, well, tricky on the Bodor network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son convinced me to set up a `Quake' (a game that can be
played over a network) server for the network, then ran crying to
his mother an hour later screaming, `Daddy is trying to blow me
up,''' says Bodor. ``He expected me to just stand there and let him
shoot me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a fine line between dad and sysop.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his job at Rockwell Automation outside Atlanta, where
Bodor is up to his elbows in hardware, he has been able to indulge
in what he calls a hobby. His five-machine home network consists of
some 448 megabytes of RAM and 18 gigabytes of hard drive space
running on Pentiums of all flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Bodor says that when he connected his home network to the
Internet, his kids' interest in computers increased tenfold. Since
then, the network has become an integral part of the Bodors' home
life.
</P>
<P>
   While he admits it might appear odd to walk into his house and
find the whole family logged in at machines in different rooms,
Bodor says the family still does things offline together, like go
to movies. And the home network has opened a new avenue of family
communication, especially between father and adolescent daughter:
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I could bring up things in an e-mail, like about her
friends or about boys, that I could never say face to face,'' he
says. ``When she tells me she's getting married, it'll be in an
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bodors' situation may be unique in that their network
has been around since 1992, they are an example of a market that
has the computer industry salivating. The home networking boom,
which began to build industry buzz only last year, is about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is just developing and starting to take off,''
said Thomas L. Funk, manager of strategic marketing for Compaq, but
speaking on behalf of the HomePNA. The Home Phoneline Networking
Association is a consortium of industry heavyweights formed last
summer to help develop standards for the technology allowing people
to use their existing telephone lines as a home network
infrastructure. Besides Compaq, other founding companies include
Microsoft, 3Com, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Lucent, AMD and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, generally there are about 15 to 20 million homes in
the United States that have multiple PCs,'' Funk said. ``Any home
that has multiple devices or is considering buying another computer
is a candidate (for home networking).''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with shrinking margins from PC sales, the computer
manufacturers see a way to recoup some of those losses: marketing
home networks so people will buy more than one computer. In fact,
computer companies large and small will gather in San Francisco
this week for Homenet '99, a two-day affair addressing this
emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a home network becomes more enticing as telecoms,
cable companies and Internet service providers merge and morph into
one-stop shops providing phone service, TV signals and Internet
access through a single big, fat data pipe into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Mike Wolf, networking industry analyst for the
high-tech market research firm Cahner's In-Stat Group, is that the
2 million home networks in the United States today will explode
into 13.8 million networked households by 2003, with end-use
revenues projected to be $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and Funk point to plummeting PC prices and access to
high-speed broadband technology as the main forces helping to drive
this new trend. Besides the wholehearted endorsement of the
computer industry, there are other factors at play as well _ like
the way people have so readily adapted to high technology and the
Internet and its staggering growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands what the Net is, and the concept of a
network isn't as foreign as it used to be,'' says Wolf.
``Manufacturers have masked the difficulty of the technology.
They've softened and candy-coated it with install wizards and
things like that to make it easier, so the end user won't have to
really understand how a TCP stack works.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he could probably offer a credible definition of a
TCP stack, Bob Vogel, who manages a 40-person network engineering
department for the satellite company Panamsat Corp., never really
had to deal with it. Even when he used software called Wingate, one
of several server software packages tailored to home networking, to
set up the three-machine Local Area Network running off a cable
modem in his Rockdale County home. The only thing required on his
end was for Vogel to install Wingate on the machine he designated
as a server and to copy a small program onto each of his other
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program sets itself up,'' he said. One thing Vogel plans
to change, though, is which machine he uses as the server. It's
currently on the machine used by his 15-year-old son, Eric, who is
deeply into network gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he reboots, the whole network freezes,'' Vogel says.
``He's one of these kids who actually blows out his machine and
reloads Windows every now and then. He's always downloading stuff
from the Internet to try out and rebooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a home network is not much more difficult than
installing Wingate. The network doesn't need to be anything more
than some machines using Windows 95 or better and each equipped
with a network interface card and some cable connecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people want to use a home network to share a single
Internet connection _ which can be done easily whether you use a
cable modem, ADSL or even a 56k dial-up modem _ some server
software is needed. (It acts as a traffic cop, making sure that the
different requests from each user's machine for access to the Net
don't collide and crash the whole shooting match.)
</P>
<P>
   If there will be more than two machines on the network, hardware
like a hub or router acts as a distribution point to the computers
on the LAN.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most difficult aspect of installing their networks
for Vogel and Bodor was running the cable. They each bought Cat5
cable, which consists of four twisted pairs of wire, as opposed to
standard telephone wire, which is two twisted pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with not much more than a drill, Vogel and Bodor ran wire
through closets, across the basement, around baseboards and out of
ceilings when they retrofitted their homes for a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not elegant,'' said Vogel. ``What I did was go from the
bottom floor down to the basement, and the builder had a PVC pipe
with a flue that went from the basement to the attic. If that
wasn't there, I don't know what I would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men said they wanted Cat5's capabilities to transmit data
at the blazingly fast speed of 100 megabytes per second. While that
may sound like the be-all and end-all in data speed, Cat6 cable _
which boasts a transmit rate of 250mbps _ is already on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel and Bodor recommend buying network hardware from the Web
for the best prices and the most current versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't skimp on the NICs (network cards) and hubs,'' says
Vogel, who also suggests online auctions as a source of good
hardware. Vogel paid $30 apiece for some ``slightly used''
name-brand 100BaseT network interface cards that retail for about
$100 directly from the manufacturer's resellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great deals, and they worked fine. (There's) no software or
documentation, but you can get the latest drivers and manuals
directly from the 3Com Web site,'' he said. ``Name-brand LAN
hardware is so simple. There is little risk of DOAs (equipment that
doesn't work when it arrives), so Web buying is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to go around the house drilling holes in the
floor. But, like any good computer technology story, there are
several ways to go when setting up a home network ... none of which
is compatible with any of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Funk's consortium would call Vogel's network ``structured
wiring.'' The HomePNA advocates technology using already existing
phone lines, making home network set-up that much easier. Other
options currently available include RF (radio frequency) networks
and ``powerline'' networks, which use existing electrical lines as
a network infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Although structured wiring-type networks are predominant today
among the 2 million homes In-Stat currently counts, more than half
of those 13.8 million networks in 2003 are expected to use
phone-line technology, according to Wolf's research.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology's development will follow the whims of the
consumers, says Funk.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, consumers are weighing their choices while assessing
the benefits of home networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the old days when there was one telephone
and everyone had to fight over it. There are lots of anecdotal
stories of schedules hung by the PC _ whoever has a school paper
due tomorrow gets to use the computer first,'' Funk said. ``(When)
the consumer can have multiple points in the house using an
Internet connection, there's no more fighting over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter which technology is used to realize those
multiple-access points, the impact on families _ and how families
communicate in the new millennium _ should be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, my son, wife and myself were all chatting with
grandpa at the same time,'' says Frank Romero, another home LAN
administrator who put a network into his Doraville home six months
ago when cable modem became available. ``He couldn't believe we
could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel offers another example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally one of the kids will write a paper for
homework,'' he says, ``and I can be downstairs, and Eric will say,
`Would you take a look at one of my homework papers?' And I can
call it up (on the network).''
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits will always carry a downside, like where,
exactly, is that line between dad and sysop drawn? Certainly the
home networking boom will bring its own set of intrafamilial
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the gateway out (to the Internet). But I respect their
privacy, I don't look at their e-mail,'' says Bodor, defining the
gray area between dad and netmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a user calling me (about network trouble) after 9
p.m., I got a problem.''

 &HT;    Start day with a wake-up call
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tired of waking to smarmy drive-time banter on your
clock radio? Miss the convenience of the hotel wake-up call? A new
Web site blends the two. And for now at least, it does it for free.
</P>
<P>
   Type your phone number and rise time into the form at www
</P>
<P>
   .mrwakeup.com, and a computer dials your home phone and delivers
a prerecorded wake-up call. The call tells you what time it is and
what the outside temperature is. You can also get a dose of daily
news or your horoscope or a motivational message along with your
wake-up call. You can choose from a handful of such choices when
you set it up.
</P>
<P>
   The service is mostly free, but you'll have to listen to a short
advertisement. Recent advertisers include Yahoo! and Starbucks. The
company that runs the service, New York-based iPing, might
eventually start charging a fee for the wake-up call. But if so,
the advertising would more than likely be limited or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Registered users can record a 4- or 10-second greeting to be
played back with the wake-up call. They also can type a message of
up to 125 characters to be read back by a computer-generated voice
that sounds about like what you would expect a machine to sound
like.
</P>
<P>
   The site and service are still in the testing phase, but are
available to anyone with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's Web site offers wide range of advice
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, America's largest home improvement warehouse, has
built up its Web site, adding advice and tips on building, fixing,
growing, decorating and installing things.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www.homedepot.com, divides its pointers into five
categories: fix it, build it, grow it, decorate it and install it.
Since most computers are not portable, the tips are presented in
such a way that makes them easy to print.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes calculators that help you decide, based
on the size of the room, how much wallpaper and paint you will need
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient Web users are costing businesses sales
</P>
<P>
   Do they sell Ritalin on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   People are willing to wait an average of eight seconds for a Web
page to download, according to a study by Zona Research. Anything
more, and people are likely to head off to another site.
</P>
<P>
   The study is mentioned in the July 12 edition of Info World
magazine. According to Zona, companies might be losing as much as
$4.3 billion to attention-span-challenged people on the Web. The
study found that a significant number of the estimated 44.1 million
people online in the United States use slower, 14.4k bps modems.
The potentially lost sales amount to about $73 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Faxes, voice mail can morph to e-mail
</P>
<P>
   The home office of the typical remote employee can get pretty
cluttered and pretty costly: a telephone, voice mail, a PC, a
monitor, a printer and a fax machine. What if you trim all that
convenience by a few machines?
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site offers a free service that lets you receive voice
mail and faxes in your e-mail in box.
</P>
<P>
   To get the service, go to www.messageclick.com. Once you
register, you will be issued a New York-based phone number you can
give to people who want to send faxes or leave voice mail. There is
no limit to the number of faxed pages the system can hold. Voice
messages are limited to two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the service is free. The company that runs the site,
Comfax.com, might start offering services for which it will charge,
but they will be optional. Messageclick.com also plans to start
offering a toll-free number later this year, but that will cost
extra.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for receiving a fax are included on the
messageclick.com site. You will need an audio program to hear voice
mail through e-mail messages. The messageclick.com site has links
to sites from which you can download free copies of audio software
as well as imaging software so you can view the faxes. Both the fax
and the voice mail come in the form of a file attached to your
e-mail message.

 &HT;    Frankie and Louie talk on screen saver
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Until recently, I never had much use for fancy screen
savers. I always picked the plain one from the selection Microsoft
offers with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But, acting upon the advice of someone on a mailing list to
which I subscribe, I found satisfaction at a Web site,
www.screensavershot.com.
</P>
<P>
   This is a vast repository of screen savers of every kind. Under
the Animals section, in the 24th selection, is the Frank and Louie
screen saver. Frank _ more properly Frankie, I think _ and Louie
are, of course, the Budweiser lizards. The screen saver features
all the dialogue from the commercials: ``Our audition was
flawless,'' ``This is the happiest day of my life, Frankie,'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   The lizards' lips don't sync too well with the audio, but what
the heck. Dragonflies flitter by, and occasionally one of the boys
nails one and gulps it down. I had it installed for a long time
before I realized that their turret-like eyes move to follow the
cursor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since it's largely static, this isn't a really
efficient screen saver, so after awhile, it goes to black. The
audio continues.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the dialogues of Louie and Frankie (''What have
you done?'') drive my wife crazy. Fortunately for our connubial
bliss, there are on-screen switches to turn off the audio, and even
eliminate the arrival of dragonflies, presumably for those
squeamish about lizards gobbling insects.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, even if you aren't enthralled by querulous lizards,
you will surely find something to delight you at this site. There
are hundreds of screen savers, all of them free for the download.
Everything from cars, trains and planes to cartoons and Playboy
centerfolds.
</P>
<P>
   EASY WAY TO TRANSFER FILES
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it was about six weeks ago that I issued an appeal for
help regarding a very nice lady who wanted to get a new computer
but couldn't figure out how to get her word processor files off her
old one. The appeal drew several hundred responses, every one of
them useless because I stupidly provided erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   I said the lady had her files on an old 286. No such luck. I
meant to say she had them on an old IBM XT. My apologies to all the
folks who took the time to offer solutions, and the many among them
who even offered their own equipment to accomplish the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   No thanks to the ones who wondered why I was so stupid that I
couldn't figure it out for myself.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I got a nice note from the lady. She has her new computer
now. All her files are on it, thanks to the nice young man who
helped her with it. He told me he sent it to a data recovery firm.
</P>
<P>
   Let this be a lesson to those of you _ and there are a lot of
you _ who use your computers for nothing but writing. A computer
can be utterly obsolete and still perform quite satisfactorily for
word processing. But don't let technology leave your storage system
in obsolesence. Like my nice lady, you'll have a lot of trouble, at
best, getting them transferred to a new computer if your old one
dies, or even sharing files with somebody who has a newer machine.

 &HT;    Non-Intel chip a subtle sign corners might have been cut
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a good reason _ as far as I'm concerned _ to
think twice about buying a computer with a non-Intel processor
chip.
</P>
<P>
   That reason has very little to do with whether the non-Intel
chip works as well or as fast as the Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   When I started messing with PCs, the choice was simple. You got
the chip that was available from Intel. Now there are chips from
AMD, Cyrix and others. If you read computer magazines, you'll find
almost monthly reviews of some of these non-Intel chips and the
results of so-called benchmark tests where the chip is tested for
speed against chips from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the non-Intel chips win in these benchmark tests,
sometimes Intel wins. In almost every case, the margin of victory
is so slim that you'd never notice the speed increase in real-life
computing.
</P>
<P>
   So speed, or lack of it, isn't a good reason to care about the
brand of the processor chip. The best reason to care about the
non-Intel chips is price. The usual rule of thumb is that the chip
(not the computer made using the chip) is usually about 20 percent
less expensive than an Intel chip of the same speed.
</P>
<P>
   So you are most likely to find these chips in computers designed
to compete based on price. If you thumb through a computer magazine
or walk the aisles of a computer store, you'll soon notice that
these chips are mostly found in low-cost machines.
</P>
<P>
   So far I've dealt with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But if we were at a party together and you asked me if you
should consider one of these PCs with a non-Intel chip, I'd say get
the real thing. I'd tell you first that, if I sat down at the
computer without knowing whether it had an Intel chip, it would be
unlikely that I could tell the difference. Most of your programs
would run fine on either machine and occasionally screw up on
either machine. Both machines would be fast and work OK.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what scares me about non-Intel chips. Since they are
mostly found in machines that are designed to sell at the lowest
possible price (and that's really the only reason a manufacturer
would use a non-Intel chip, since the Intel name is a well-known
brand that helps sell computers), I worry that the desire to sell
the lowest-price computer means compromises elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty easy, even for an amateur, to know what kind of
processor chip is inside the computer. But, when it comes to the
type and quality of components like disk drives, sound cards, video
cards, RAM (the memory chips) and, obviously, resistors and
capacitors ... most people don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense tells me that if I am trying to make a computer
that I can sell at a price below the competition, I'm going to look
for other ways besides the processor chip to lower my costs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that I am highly ethical and I do my best to get stuff
that works OK (and not every company is that ethical). I'll still
have to make some compromises. After all, the biggest and best
companies can get parts as cheap or cheaper than I can. So the only
way to save money is to go down a grade in quality.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, that won't keep the low-cost computer from
starting up fine when you hit the switch. But there truly is a
reason that some components cost more than others. With
electronics, that reason often is that the quality control is
higher and the long-term failure rate somewhat lower.
</P>
<P>
   So, and remember this is my opinion, think of the non-Intel chip
as a tiny warning flag that says: We built this computer using
parts from the lowest-priced vendor.

 &HT;    Computer advice sites more than ample
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What could be more sensible than to use your computer
and the Internet to get the advice you need to help fix your
computer?
</P>
<P>
   The Web is rich with sites like these _ some commercially
sponsored, a few that charge for the advice and many that are pure
works of love.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop today is Help2Go at www.help2go.com/index.htm.
You'll get tips on buying a computer and working on it, and there's
also a help section on using the Internet. One of the best features
is a topic area called ``Five Minute Guides.''
</P>
<P>
   True to the title, this is simple advice in abbreviated form.
But it may be all you need for some topics. For instance, if you're
a beginner and curious about the difference between a DVD and CD,
the five minutes' worth of information is probably all you need.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a search function here. It works, but you'll have
to be patient. A search, for instance, for USB (universal serial
bus) turned up several pages where the term was mentioned in
passing. But the third page suggested by the search engine was a
glossary of terms that offered a definition of USB.
</P>
<P>
   One negative on this page is the lack of a way to ask a specific
question. A lot of computer predicaments are unique, and more than
general help is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The next page is called the Advice Guy(at)Cyber Komfort. You'll
find it at mysiteinc.com
</P>
<P>
   /theadviceguy/. Cyber Komfort is in the business of selling
computers, and you'll find plenty of ads for that service on the
page. But this page does have an e-mail link that you can use to
ask computer questions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequent requests from both experienced and
novice users alike is for advice on buying a new computer. You'll
find some excellent reviews and advice at a page called PC Shopping
Advice at compreviews.miningco.com/msubsho.htm.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find some excellent articles here, including some from
Family PC and Computer Shopper. You'll also find links to other
sites on the Web that offer computer advice.
</P>
<P>
   The next page is anything but fancy and seems to be part of a
personal home page. But if you are new to computers, you'll profit
from the advice found on a page called Computer Advice at
showme.net/(tilde)fkeller/advice/.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending a lot of time explaining how things work,
the proprietor of this page just offers the sort of basic tips that
would help any newcomer to computing. If you don't care how things
work but just want to make sure that your computer does work over
the long haul, you'll profit from the tips on this page.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, there are literally hundreds of computer advice sites
on the Web. If you visited them all, you never have time to get in
trouble with your computer _ you'd be too busy reading.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are times when a general advice site won't help.
Some of the most valuable sites are those maintained by specific
software manufacturers (for instance, most Windows users will find
Microsoft's site at www.microsoft.com invaluable, and Macintosh
users will find plenty to like at www.apple.com).
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for sites maintained by almost every reputable
manufacturer of computers or computer accessories.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find everything from troubleshooting hints to updated
drivers for video cards and modems to ``bug fixes'' _ little
programs that correct a problem in a manufacturer's software.

 &HT;    Chasm between the `haves' and `have-nots' is widening
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We Americans generally assume that the next century will bring
us heaps of new high-tech tools, toys and gadgets. In the
Information Age, we'll be living the George Jetson lifestyle,
zooming around in our advanced vehicles and coming home to a host
of labor-saving devices.
</P>
<P>
   But millions, indeed billions, of people in other countries may
be living more like Fred Flintstone in the new century, using rocks
and other raw materials to pound out a bare existence. A recently
released United Nations report suggests that unless wealthy nations
do more to help poor ones catch up, the 21st century will see the
Earth split into two very different planets, one inhabited by a
minority enjoying new technologies, and another populated by
poverty-stricken, low-tech masses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course technological advances have always allowed some people
to lead much better lives than others. When Egyptian Queen
Cleopatra was lounging by the Nile, many cavemen were still wearing
skins and chasing wild animals for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology gap has never been so wide as today. For
example, 200 years ago, a wealthy American could sip fine wine,
ride in an elegant carriage and wear well-tailored clothes. Still,
he was no better off than his poorest neighbor in many ways: Both a
rich man and a beggar got their light from a flame and their warmth
from logs on a fire. The wealthiest families had no more protection
against smallpox than the poorest. The U.N. Development Program's
report on the ``haves'' and ``have-nots'' measured the enormity of
the gap today. One statistic told the story: The world's 200
richest people _ a group small enough to gather easily for dinner
in a hotel ballroom _ together have more money than the combined
income of the lowest 40 percent of the world's population, or about
2.4 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Among nations, Canada, Norway and the United States are the
richest. The poorest 22 countries are all in Africa, but poverty
also abounds in Asia and Latin America. The report says technology
and wealth clearly are linked. For example, in the wealthy
principality of Monaco in 1996, there were 99 telephone lines for
every 100 people. In poverty-plagued Cambodia, there was one phone
line per 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Such contrasts will increase because wealthy people can afford
to keep buying more advanced tools, while the poorest people still
can't get basic equipment for participation in the Information Age.
The report noted that the average American pays about one month's
wage for a personal computer; the average Bangladeshi would need
eight years of income to buy a computer. Then the Bangladeshi would
have to learn English to take full advantage of the Internet, where
80 percent of the sites are in English.
</P>
<P>
   To help poor countries, the U.N. report floated the idea of
having advanced countries impose upon themselves a tax of one U.S.
cent on every 100 lengthy e-mails sent by an individual. The U.N.
economists said such a tax would have raised about $70 billion in
1996 to help pay for wiring undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. politicians and Internet users raced to attack the
tax, and U.N. officials backed off.
</P>
<P>
   But while the e-mail tax was sent straight to the dead letter
office, no other serious plans for narrowing the technology gap are
circulating. So as the George Jetsons of the world prepare to zip
around faster and higher, the Stone Age families are slipping
further behind. Whether two such different worlds can share the
same planet will be one of the great questions for the next
century.

 &HT;    Apple turns the tables on PCs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer's once-crippling weakness has become
its strength.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness was, of course, Apple's Macs were not PCs. A year
ago, few people wanted a computer that didn't run Microsoft's
Windows operating system and all the software published for that
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Macs still aren't PCs, but now Apple has managed to turn that
distinction to its advantage. With the introduction of the iMac
last August, Apple's computers have once again become fashion
statements, a symbol that their owners are special and different.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of buyers are willing to pay a little extra for a
computer they believe is special. Mac users are paying more as
prices for computers in general are falling fast, hurting many PC
makers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some industry analysts are now saying Apple no
longer needs to convert PC users to its platform. The company can
prosper, they say, by just capturing a growing number of first-time
users with its iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the iMac phenomenon more evident than in Apple's
recently released third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Apple beat Wall Street's estimates that it would earn 64 cents a
share. Instead, the company reported net income of $114 million, or
69 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   What drove those results was the continuing surge in iMac sales.
Overall, sales of all Macs were up 40 percent from a year earlier _
twice the growth rate of the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Macs captured 11.5 percent of retail and mail-order sales
for computers during the first two months of this year, according
to market researcher PC Data. That figure is up from 6.3 percent a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the company's gross profit margin improved to 27.4
percent from 25.7 percent. The improvement was attributed to
falling prices for computer components.
</P>
<P>
   Such strong results are driving Apple's stock higher. It has
risen about 55 percent in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone views Apple's strong third-quarter results as
irrefutable evidence of a turnaround. Naysayers still see signs of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They point, for example, to Apple's third-quarter revenue. It
grew at a much slower pace than unit sales, up only 11 percent to
$1.6 billion, compared with $1.4 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures portray a company that is still down sharply from
its peak of $11 billion in sales annually in the mid-1990s. Yet,
for Apple, those record sales were not translating into profit. The
company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs has refashioned Apple
into a smaller company focused on three key markets: education,
home and desktop publishing. So far, it looks like a winning
strategy.

 &HT;    NPR still sluggish, but at least it's trying
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When we last left our hero, the Web-challenged
National Public Radio, we were both amused and confused by NPR's
sheer lack of Web marketing know-how. Also taken to task were
Amazon.com and other online retailers for seriously underestimating
NPR's audience.
</P>
<P>
   In May, when I wrote the column about NPR's minimal use of the
Web, none of the big three booksellers was doing much to promote or
even stock NPR titles, which was odd, given the upscale, literate
and computer-savvy audience of NPR listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners were cheered somewhat several weeks ago when NPR
announced a deal to offer its programming on America Online. Users
who go to AOL keyword NPR will be connected to the latest news from
NPR in audio or video slide show format.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it seemed that NPR was hopping on the Web bandwagon in
a big way. A presence on AOL, consistently ranked the top news
destination on the Web by Media Metrix, would be a giant step
forward toward giving NPR a greater online presence.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that NPR will be a great asset to AOL's
already-considerable news area. Now users who are tired of generic
news have the option of tuning in to NPR's unique perspective on
world and national events. It's also a great opportunity for NPR to
put its best foot forward in front of AOL's 20 million users.
</P>
<P>
   However, NPR may have been smart enough to do the deal, but
still not smart enough to figure out how to build out its brand in
the interactive world. It makes you kind of want to shake your head
the way ABC newsman Ted Koppel did at presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis the night before Ronald Reagan won his landslide
victory in 1988, and mutter, ``You just don't get it, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   The NPR area of AOL is just as bland and boring and completely
devoid of personality as the NPR Web site. AOL users can listen to
NPR broadcasts without downloading any special software. This is
good. Listeners can also e-mail comments to NPR for possible on-air
reading. This is also good.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, here is where all the good things end. There are too many
missed opportunities to count. However, the area isn't even a month
old and, hopefully, there's a lot to this area users haven't seen
yet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there is a link called ``transcripts,'' but all it
does is give you a phone number and an address to either call or
send away for tapes. Very reliable sources tell us that calling
this number to order tapes puts you into a voice mail system
reminiscent of Dante's seven circles of hell. Why NPR just doesn't
take advantage of AOL's infrastructure to let people order tapes
online is positively bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the message boards so listeners can e-mail such
airwave celebrities as Scott Simon, Nina Tottenberg or Terri Gross?
</P>
<P>
   It was encouraging to see a link called ``programs,'' but here
again, NPR drops the ball. Clicking any of the NPR programs listed
just gives you a written description _ a written description! _ of
the programs. At the very least there could have been a little
bitty sound clip of Gross plugging her wonderful show ``Fresh
Air.'' If there are issues involving rights and clearances that
keep NPR from putting more of its content online or making more of
it available online, please just tell us. We'll understand.
</P>
<P>
   However, users can link to the far more colorful Web sites for
member stations from Maine to California. Even the smallest site
for the smallest station in the smallest city lets users pledge
money, check out program schedules, volunteer, post messages and
provide feedback to the station. Makes you think, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the world waits for National Public Radio to
develop a Web strategy, Amazon and Borders were busy stocking up on
NPR-featured books and CDs. They were also busy building out
special areas for the items featured on NPR.
</P>
<P>
   Special mention goes to Borders.com, which also has an in-store
relationship with NPR. It went from a sad little NPR page that
didn't even have pictures of half the books to a pretty nice area
highlighted by some clever copy about how hard it is to keep track
of every book mentioned on NPR. However, the site gallantly offers
to try, and its selection is good. Amazon.com, which had a small
section devoted to NPR-featured materials, has added more stock to
its NPR area, which can be found in its ``As Featured in the
Media'' section.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, retailers don't need to be told twice when there's
money to be made on the Web. Hopefully, NPR will use its new home
on AOL to take advantage of the interactive as well as the audio
and text aspects of the Web and create something that will charm
longtime listeners and attract new ones.

 &HT;    Well-connected: Home networking concept booming
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A network computer crash is never a pretty thing.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on Richard Bodor's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My users cry, kick and hold their breath when the network is
down,'' he says. ``They say, `I don't like Daddy. He's not getting
a Father's Day present.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bodor has been networking the computers in his Alpharetta home
for seven years. That network gets extensive use by the five
computer-adept Bodors. Wife Kim uses it for real estate searches
and tracking stocks; Denise, 13, uses America Online Instant
Messenger to keep up with friends; Richard, 11, is the gamer; and
Amy, 8, is into ``activityware'' like ``Mr. Potatohead'' and
``Spiderman Animator.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the network is up and running smoothly, things can
still be, well, tricky on the Bodor network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son convinced me to set up a `Quake' (a game that can be
played over a network) server for the network, then ran crying to
his mother an hour later screaming, `Daddy is trying to blow me
up,''' says Bodor. ``He expected me to just stand there and let him
shoot me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a fine line between dad and sysop.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his job at Rockwell Automation outside Atlanta, where
Bodor is up to his elbows in hardware, he has been able to indulge
in what he calls a hobby. His five-machine home network consists of
some 448 megabytes of RAM and 18 gigabytes of hard drive space
running on Pentiums of all flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Bodor says that when he connected his home network to the
Internet, his kids' interest in computers increased tenfold. Since
then, the network has become an integral part of the Bodors' home
life.
</P>
<P>
   While he admits it might appear odd to walk into his house and
find the whole family logged in at machines in different rooms,
Bodor says the family still does things offline together, like go
to movies. And the home network has opened a new avenue of family
communication, especially between father and adolescent daughter:
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I could bring up things in an e-mail, like about her
friends or about boys, that I could never say face to face,'' he
says. ``When she tells me she's getting married, it'll be in an
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bodors' situation may be unique in that their network
has been around since 1992, they are an example of a market that
has the computer industry salivating. The home networking boom,
which began to build industry buzz only last year, is about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is just developing and starting to take off,''
said Thomas L. Funk, manager of strategic marketing for Compaq, but
speaking on behalf of the HomePNA. The Home Phoneline Networking
Association is a consortium of industry heavyweights formed last
summer to help develop standards for the technology allowing people
to use their existing telephone lines as a home network
infrastructure. Besides Compaq, other founding companies include
Microsoft, 3Com, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Lucent, AMD and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, generally there are about 15 to 20 million homes in
the United States that have multiple PCs,'' Funk said. ``Any home
that has multiple devices or is considering buying another computer
is a candidate (for home networking).''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with shrinking margins from PC sales, the computer
manufacturers see a way to recoup some of those losses: marketing
home networks so people will buy more than one computer. In fact,
computer companies large and small will gather in San Francisco
this week for Homenet '99, a two-day affair addressing this
emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a home network becomes more enticing as telecoms,
cable companies and Internet service providers merge and morph into
one-stop shops providing phone service, TV signals and Internet
access through a single big, fat data pipe into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Mike Wolf, networking industry analyst for the
high-tech market research firm Cahner's In-Stat Group, is that the
2 million home networks in the United States today will explode
into 13.8 million networked households by 2003, with end-use
revenues projected to be $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and Funk point to plummeting PC prices and access to
high-speed broadband technology as the main forces helping to drive
this new trend. Besides the wholehearted endorsement of the
computer industry, there are other factors at play as well _ like
the way people have so readily adapted to high technology and the
Internet and its staggering growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands what the Net is, and the concept of a
network isn't as foreign as it used to be,'' says Wolf.
``Manufacturers have masked the difficulty of the technology.
They've softened and candy-coated it with install wizards and
things like that to make it easier, so the end user won't have to
really understand how a TCP stack works.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he could probably offer a credible definition of a
TCP stack, Bob Vogel, who manages a 40-person network engineering
department for the satellite company Panamsat Corp., never really
had to deal with it. Even when he used software called Wingate, one
of several server software packages tailored to home networking, to
set up the three-machine Local Area Network running off a cable
modem in his Rockdale County home. The only thing required on his
end was for Vogel to install Wingate on the machine he designated
as a server and to copy a small program onto each of his other
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program sets itself up,'' he said. One thing Vogel plans
to change, though, is which machine he uses as the server. It's
currently on the machine used by his 15-year-old son, Eric, who is
deeply into network gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he reboots, the whole network freezes,'' Vogel says.
``He's one of these kids who actually blows out his machine and
reloads Windows every now and then. He's always downloading stuff
from the Internet to try out and rebooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a home network is not much more difficult than
installing Wingate. The network doesn't need to be anything more
than some machines using Windows 95 or better and each equipped
with a network interface card and some cable connecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people want to use a home network to share a single
Internet connection _ which can be done easily whether you use a
cable modem, ADSL or even a 56k dial-up modem _ some server
software is needed. (It acts as a traffic cop, making sure that the
different requests from each user's machine for access to the Net
don't collide and crash the whole shooting match.)
</P>
<P>
   If there will be more than two machines on the network, hardware
like a hub or router acts as a distribution point to the computers
on the LAN.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most difficult aspect of installing their networks
for Vogel and Bodor was running the cable. They each bought Cat5
cable, which consists of four twisted pairs of wire, as opposed to
standard telephone wire, which is two twisted pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with not much more than a drill, Vogel and Bodor ran wire
through closets, across the basement, around baseboards and out of
ceilings when they retrofitted their homes for a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not elegant,'' said Vogel. ``What I did was go from the
bottom floor down to the basement, and the builder had a PVC pipe
with a flue that went from the basement to the attic. If that
wasn't there, I don't know what I would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men said they wanted Cat5's capabilities to transmit data
at the blazingly fast speed of 100 megabytes per second. While that
may sound like the be-all and end-all in data speed, Cat6 cable _
which boasts a transmit rate of 250mbps _ is already on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel and Bodor recommend buying network hardware from the Web
for the best prices and the most current versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't skimp on the NICs (network cards) and hubs,'' says
Vogel, who also suggests online auctions as a source of good
hardware. Vogel paid $30 apiece for some ``slightly used''
name-brand 100BaseT network interface cards that retail for about
$100 directly from the manufacturer's resellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great deals, and they worked fine. (There's) no software or
documentation, but you can get the latest drivers and manuals
directly from the 3Com Web site,'' he said. ``Name-brand LAN
hardware is so simple. There is little risk of DOAs (equipment that
doesn't work when it arrives), so Web buying is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to go around the house drilling holes in the
floor. But, like any good computer technology story, there are
several ways to go when setting up a home network ... none of which
is compatible with any of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Funk's consortium would call Vogel's network ``structured
wiring.'' The HomePNA advocates technology using already existing
phone lines, making home network set-up that much easier. Other
options currently available include RF (radio frequency) networks
and ``powerline'' networks, which use existing electrical lines as
a network infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Although structured wiring-type networks are predominant today
among the 2 million homes In-Stat currently counts, more than half
of those 13.8 million networks in 2003 are expected to use
phone-line technology, according to Wolf's research.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology's development will follow the whims of the
consumers, says Funk.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, consumers are weighing their choices while assessing
the benefits of home networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the old days when there was one telephone
and everyone had to fight over it. There are lots of anecdotal
stories of schedules hung by the PC _ whoever has a school paper
due tomorrow gets to use the computer first,'' Funk said. ``(When)
the consumer can have multiple points in the house using an
Internet connection, there's no more fighting over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter which technology is used to realize those
multiple-access points, the impact on families _ and how families
communicate in the new millennium _ should be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, my son, wife and myself were all chatting with
grandpa at the same time,'' says Frank Romero, another home LAN
administrator who put a network into his Doraville home six months
ago when cable modem became available. ``He couldn't believe we
could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel offers another example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally one of the kids will write a paper for
homework,'' he says, ``and I can be downstairs, and Eric will say,
`Would you take a look at one of my homework papers?' And I can
call it up (on the network).''
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits will always carry a downside, like where,
exactly, is that line between dad and sysop drawn? Certainly the
home networking boom will bring its own set of intrafamilial
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the gateway out (to the Internet). But I respect their
privacy, I don't look at their e-mail,'' says Bodor, defining the
gray area between dad and netmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a user calling me (about network trouble) after 9
p.m., I got a problem.''

 &HT;    Start day with a wake-up call
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tired of waking to smarmy drive-time banter on your
clock radio? Miss the convenience of the hotel wake-up call? A new
Web site blends the two. And for now at least, it does it for free.
</P>
<P>
   Type your phone number and rise time into the form at www
</P>
<P>
   .mrwakeup.com, and a computer dials your home phone and delivers
a prerecorded wake-up call. The call tells you what time it is and
what the outside temperature is. You can also get a dose of daily
news or your horoscope or a motivational message along with your
wake-up call. You can choose from a handful of such choices when
you set it up.
</P>
<P>
   The service is mostly free, but you'll have to listen to a short
advertisement. Recent advertisers include Yahoo! and Starbucks. The
company that runs the service, New York-based iPing, might
eventually start charging a fee for the wake-up call. But if so,
the advertising would more than likely be limited or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Registered users can record a 4- or 10-second greeting to be
played back with the wake-up call. They also can type a message of
up to 125 characters to be read back by a computer-generated voice
that sounds about like what you would expect a machine to sound
like.
</P>
<P>
   The site and service are still in the testing phase, but are
available to anyone with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's Web site offers wide range of advice
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, America's largest home improvement warehouse, has
built up its Web site, adding advice and tips on building, fixing,
growing, decorating and installing things.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www.homedepot.com, divides its pointers into five
categories: fix it, build it, grow it, decorate it and install it.
Since most computers are not portable, the tips are presented in
such a way that makes them easy to print.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes calculators that help you decide, based
on the size of the room, how much wallpaper and paint you will need
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient Web users are costing businesses sales
</P>
<P>
   Do they sell Ritalin on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   People are willing to wait an average of eight seconds for a Web
page to download, according to a study by Zona Research. Anything
more, and people are likely to head off to another site.
</P>
<P>
   The study is mentioned in the July 12 edition of Info World
magazine. According to Zona, companies might be losing as much as
$4.3 billion to attention-span-challenged people on the Web. The
study found that a significant number of the estimated 44.1 million
people online in the United States use slower, 14.4k bps modems.
The potentially lost sales amount to about $73 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Faxes, voice mail can morph to e-mail
</P>
<P>
   The home office of the typical remote employee can get pretty
cluttered and pretty costly: a telephone, voice mail, a PC, a
monitor, a printer and a fax machine. What if you trim all that
convenience by a few machines?
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site offers a free service that lets you receive voice
mail and faxes in your e-mail in box.
</P>
<P>
   To get the service, go to www.messageclick.com. Once you
register, you will be issued a New York-based phone number you can
give to people who want to send faxes or leave voice mail. There is
no limit to the number of faxed pages the system can hold. Voice
messages are limited to two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the service is free. The company that runs the site,
Comfax.com, might start offering services for which it will charge,
but they will be optional. Messageclick.com also plans to start
offering a toll-free number later this year, but that will cost
extra.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for receiving a fax are included on the
messageclick.com site. You will need an audio program to hear voice
mail through e-mail messages. The messageclick.com site has links
to sites from which you can download free copies of audio software
as well as imaging software so you can view the faxes. Both the fax
and the voice mail come in the form of a file attached to your
e-mail message.

 &HT;    Frankie and Louie talk on screen saver
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Until recently, I never had much use for fancy screen
savers. I always picked the plain one from the selection Microsoft
offers with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But, acting upon the advice of someone on a mailing list to
which I subscribe, I found satisfaction at a Web site,
www.screensavershot.com.
</P>
<P>
   This is a vast repository of screen savers of every kind. Under
the Animals section, in the 24th selection, is the Frank and Louie
screen saver. Frank _ more properly Frankie, I think _ and Louie
are, of course, the Budweiser lizards. The screen saver features
all the dialogue from the commercials: ``Our audition was
flawless,'' ``This is the happiest day of my life, Frankie,'' etc.
</P>
<P>
   The lizards' lips don't sync too well with the audio, but what
the heck. Dragonflies flitter by, and occasionally one of the boys
nails one and gulps it down. I had it installed for a long time
before I realized that their turret-like eyes move to follow the
cursor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since it's largely static, this isn't a really
efficient screen saver, so after awhile, it goes to black. The
audio continues.

   Unfortunately, the dialogues of Louie and Frankie (''What have
you done?'') drive my wife crazy. Fortunately for our connubial
bliss, there are on-screen switches to turn off the audio, and even
eliminate the arrival of dragonflies, presumably for those
squeamish about lizards gobbling insects.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, even if you aren't enthralled by querulous lizards,
you will surely find something to delight you at this site. There
are hundreds of screen savers, all of them free for the download.
Everything from cars, trains and planes to cartoons and Playboy

   EASY WAY TO TRANSFER FILES
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it was about six weeks ago that I issued an appeal for
help regarding a very nice lady who wanted to get a new computer
but couldn't figure out how to get her word processor files off her
old one. The appeal drew several hundred responses, every one of
them useless because I stupidly provided erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   I said the lady had her files on an old 286. No such luck. I
meant to say she had them on an old IBM XT. My apologies to all the
folks who took the time to offer solutions, and the many among them
who even offered their own equipment to accomplish the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   No thanks to the ones who wondered why I was so stupid that I
couldn't figure it out for myself.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I got a nice note from the lady. She has her new computer
now. All her files are on it, thanks to the nice young man who
helped her with it. He told me he sent it to a data recovery firm.
</P>
<P>
   Let this be a lesson to those of you _ and there are a lot of
you _ who use your computers for nothing but writing. A computer
can be utterly obsolete and still perform quite satisfactorily for
word processing. But don't let technology leave your storage system
in obsolesence. Like my nice lady, you'll have a lot of trouble, at
best, getting them transferred to a new computer if your old one
dies, or even sharing files with somebody who has a newer machine.

 &HT;    Non-Intel chip a subtle sign corners might have been cut
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a good reason _ as far as I'm concerned _ to
think twice about buying a computer with a non-Intel processor
chip.
</P>
<P>
   That reason has very little to do with whether the non-Intel
chip works as well or as fast as the Intel chip.
</P>
<P>
   When I started messing with PCs, the choice was simple. You got
the chip that was available from Intel. Now there are chips from
AMD, Cyrix and others. If you read computer magazines, you'll find
almost monthly reviews of some of these non-Intel chips and the
results of so-called benchmark tests where the chip is tested for
speed against chips from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the non-Intel chips win in these benchmark tests,
sometimes Intel wins. In almost every case, the margin of victory
is so slim that you'd never notice the speed increase in real-life
computing.
</P>
<P>
   So speed, or lack of it, isn't a good reason to care about the
brand of the processor chip. The best reason to care about the
non-Intel chips is price. The usual rule of thumb is that the chip
(not the computer made using the chip) is usually about 20 percent
less expensive than an Intel chip of the same speed.
</P>
<P>
   So you are most likely to find these chips in computers designed
to compete based on price. If you thumb through a computer magazine
or walk the aisles of a computer store, you'll soon notice that
these chips are mostly found in low-cost machines.
</P>
<P>
   So far I've dealt with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But if we were at a party together and you asked me if you
should consider one of these PCs with a non-Intel chip, I'd say get
the real thing. I'd tell you first that, if I sat down at the
computer without knowing whether it had an Intel chip, it would be
unlikely that I could tell the difference. Most of your programs
would run fine on either machine and occasionally screw up on
either machine. Both machines would be fast and work OK.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what scares me about non-Intel chips. Since they are
mostly found in machines that are designed to sell at the lowest
possible price (and that's really the only reason a manufacturer
would use a non-Intel chip, since the Intel name is a well-known
brand that helps sell computers), I worry that the desire to sell
the lowest-price computer means compromises elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty easy, even for an amateur, to know what kind of
processor chip is inside the computer. But, when it comes to the
type and quality of components like disk drives, sound cards, video
cards, RAM (the memory chips) and, obviously, resistors and
capacitors ... most people don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense tells me that if I am trying to make a computer
that I can sell at a price below the competition, I'm going to look
for other ways besides the processor chip to lower my costs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that I am highly ethical and I do my best to get stuff
that works OK (and not every company is that ethical). I'll still
have to make some compromises. After all, the biggest and best
companies can get parts as cheap or cheaper than I can. So the only
way to save money is to go down a grade in quality.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, that won't keep the low-cost computer from
starting up fine when you hit the switch. But there truly is a
reason that some components cost more than others. With
electronics, that reason often is that the quality control is
higher and the long-term failure rate somewhat lower.
</P>
<P>
   So, and remember this is my opinion, think of the non-Intel chip
as a tiny warning flag that says: We built this computer using
parts from the lowest-priced vendor.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: Is it more economical to turn out the lights
every time you leave a room (lower electric bill) or is it better
to leave them on (light bulbs do not burn out as fast when not
turned on and off all the time)? _ Gail W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Off. Whether you have fluorescent or incandescent lighting,
you will use less electricity and save on your electric bill by
turning lights off, says Kathy Kirwin of Austin Energy. The savings
most likely will offset any cost associated with the wear and tear
on the bulb. Lights left on unnecessarily also add heat to a room.
Turn off the lights and save on your air-conditioning bill, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did Charismatic break his leg at Belmont? _ M.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Veterinary technician Danny Hays suspects the injury was
sustained at the start of the race, when horses dig their hooves
into the ground. Any slippage at the get-go could have produced
hazardous stress on a fragile lower leg. Q: Some say Bob Barker is
about 80 years old or more. I say he is 76 years old. Also, is he
married to Janice Pennington? _ Dorothy R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Good guess, but you have both gone over the actual Bob Barker
age. Mr. ``Price is Right'' will turn 76 on Dec. 12. A widower who
remains single, Barker was married to Dorothy Jo Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that the electricity coming into your house often
may not be at full capacity. It apparently can affect the
performance of appliances and perhaps even damage them. How can a
homeowner check, or better yet, have checked, whether he/she is
receiving the full capacity of the electric power to the house? The
ceiling fans in my house groan at times and not at others. After
checking each one for its proper oil level, I suspect the
electricity feeding them is at times not at full capacity. _ J.
James
</P>
<P>
   A: Call your electricity provider. Voltage problems with home
electric service are likely to show up in higher-demand appliances
or flickering lights rather than ceiling fans. A virtue of the
ceiling fan is its small power pull. Are you using fan controls
rather than dimmer switches? Fan motors are meant to start on high
speed. Dimmer switches actually work just the opposite, causing the
fan to work hard to move from low speed to high speed
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I learn how to read tarot cards? Instructions? Book?
Video? _ J.A.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Tarot cards are a fortunetelling aid showing ``possible
paths,'' says Book People's S. Sutterfield Winn, who oversees the
tarot card section. (Today's word is ``arcana,'' readers, meaning
``specialized knowledge unfamiliar to Joe Six-Pack.'') The deck
usually consists of minor arcana (56 suit cards) and major arcana
(22 pictorial symbol cards). Minor arcana cards often resemble
familiar playing cards such as kings, queens, etc. For a primer,
try ``Tarot Plain and Simple'' by Anthony Louis or ``Tarot Made
Easy'' by Nancy Garen. Now pass the tea leaves. Contact Jane Greig,
author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box 670, Austin TX 78767;
(512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512)

we cling to it unto eternity. By DAN LYNCH.

EVERY RIGHT HAS TO HAVE ITS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir William Blackstone, working away at his ``Commentaries on
the Laws of England'' in 1765, had to deal with a list of stated
rights passed by Parliament in 1689 in ``An Act Declaring the
Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of
the Crown.'' Just as Parliament settled on William and Mary of
Orange as king and queen, Blackstone settled on the list of powers
to which their subjects were entitled as ``the  &UR; bill of rights &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Like most members of America's Continental Congress in 1774,
Edward Rutledge, a delegate from South Carolina, read Blackstone.
According to notes taken by John Adams, Rutledge rose in
Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia on Sept. 28 to say, ``I came with
an Idea of getting a  &UR; Bill of Rights &LR; .'' He didn't get one.
</P>
<P>
   However, 14 years and one revolution later, Alexander Hamilton
wrote in Federalist Paper No. 84, ``The most considerable remaining
objections ((to the Constitution)) is that the plan of the
Convention contains no  &UR; bill of rights &LR; .'' Hamilton thought it was
unnecessary, but James Madison disagreed, and Thomas Jefferson
wrote that he favored ``the annexation of a  &UR; bill of rights &LR;  to the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison offered a dozen amendments; the states brushed aside two
dealing with apportionment and congressional pay and ratified 10;
though the list never had a formal title, the United States had
what became known as ``the  &UR; Bill of Rights &LR; ,'' capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to two centuries later. I invited Judge Samuel I. Rosenman,
one of FDR's great speech writers, to visit the Nixon speech
writers at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He told us how Roosevelt's writers had enlivened his 1944 State
of the Union message by inserting an  &UR; Economic Bill of Rights &LR;  (to
a job, to a decent home, to a good education, ``to adequate
protection from the economic fears of old age'').
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later, when I noticed one of the newer speech writers,
Lee Huebner, slaving over the world's dullest economic message, I
passed along the Rosenman tip: Do a preamble called an  &UR; economic
bill of rights &LR; . He did, and our turbid message with a ringing
label got pretty good coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The day before FDR's 1944 use of the  &UR; Economic Bill of Rights &LR; ,
Sen. Joel Bennett Clark of Missouri introduced legislation drafted
by Harry Colmery of the American Legion, who called it a  &UR; Bill of
Rights for G.I. Joe and G.I. Jane &LR; . ``The House sent the  &UR; G.I. Bill
of Rights &LR;  to the White House,'' reported The New York Times on
June 14, 1944, as millions became entitled to guarantees on home
mortgages and support for college education.
</P>
<P>
   Crime came next. In 1983, according to the National Center for
Victims of Crime, in Virginia, the International Association of
Chiefs of Police adopted a  &UR; Crime Victims' Bill of Rights &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Voters were victims, too, in the eyes of Max Macauley of
Sacramento, Calif., in 1988, and he proposed a  &UR; Voters' Bill of
Rights &LR; . Six years later, this label was picked up by a group of
Chicago professors who plumped for ``truthful, understandable
messages,'' and no last-minute tricks. The millionaire Ron Unz now
has that phrase going in California, where it means spending
limits, partial public financing, a ban on corporate gifts and fast
Web-site disclosure of fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the  &UR; Patients' Bill of Rights &LR; , now the
subject of lively debate and very likely to be a battleground in
the campaign of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As 1973 began, the American Hospital Association, in Chicago,
packaged a policy statement in the catchy phrase. Lawrence K.
Altman, the doctor reporting on medicine for The New York Times,
put it in his lead, which earned it a front-page headline:
`` &UR; Hospital Patients' &LR;  ` &UR; Bill of Rights &LR; ' Backed.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman explained, ``What the hospital association has done is to
collect the most commonly questioned situations and put them in one
document.'' Included were the right to respectful care,
confidentiality of records, a primary physician and notification of
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years later, Sens. Tom Daschle and Ted Kennedy went
to the White House to announce that ``by passing a  &UR; Patients' Bill
of Rights &LR;  _ national standards _ we can make sure that all
Americans have the same right to health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I hopped in a cab, read the  &UR; Taxi Passengers'
Bill of Rights &LR;  (to a clean cab and a respectful driver) and went
to the supermarket, where I was reassured by a  &UR; Consumers' Bill of
Rights &LR;  (to fresh produce and no hassling over returns). I am now
at work on a  &UR; Bill-of-Rights Writers' Bill of Rights &LR; . These
include ``the right to full coverage'' and ``entitlement to public
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Clara Bow Lives
</P>
<P>
   In the Roaring Twenties, after her smash performance on the
silent screen in the movie ``It,'' she was called ``the `It'
Girl.'' Clara Bow had it, and every flapper wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   In Bob Woodward's book about presidential hubris, ``Shadow,''
the reporter writes about the thoughts of Sydney Hoffmann, a lawyer
for Monica Lewinsky: ``She concluded it was highly possible that
Lewinsky had a form of Clara Bow syndrome, named after the famous
silent-film actress who couldn't say no.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic example of a  &UR; mondegreen &LR;  _ a mishearing, or
passed-along garble, of another's spoken communication. An example
is a child's rendition of the opening of the Pledge of Allegiance
as ``I led the pigeons to the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1922 (the year Clara was starring in ``Down to the Sea in
Ships''), an eminent French psychiatrist observed and reported a
syndrome in which a woman has a delusional belief that an older,
powerful, often celebrated man is in love with her. He called it
 &UR; psychose passionelle &LR; , which translates roughly as ``erotomanic
passion psychosis.''
</P>
<P>
   It is listed in Longman's Dictionary of Psychology and
Psychiatry, however, under the name of the French doctor who
identified the syndrome. His name was Clerambault.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The degree game
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I got an e-mail note from my 13-year-old niece a couple of
months ago saying she had built her own web site, and I was invited
to check it out. I did, and left a note congratulating her.
</P>
<P>
   I got a note from Miriam's 67-year-old grandfather soon after,
saying he had built a family web site, and I was invited to check
it out. I did, and left a note congratulating him. What terrific
things, I thought, kids and seniors are doing these days.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days ago I heard on the radio that one of our great
universities was offering a certificate for a course on building
web sites. In other words, people can now be properly certified for
doing what they already are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Universities ought to cut this out. It only adds to the notion
that you can only do things if you have the right credentials. By
that reasoning, Bill Gates, world's most famous college dropout, is
unqualified to be CEO of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   If we're looking for ways to encourage entry into a free job
market, we might look at the barriers colleges have raised by
insisting that only they can qualify the already qualified to
perform ordinary tasks. The poor, particularly, can't afford the
entry fees. Employers should make job performance the standard, not
another certificate.

please call The Star's Universal Desk at (816) 234-4720.
</P>
<P>
   WATKIN-MISSOURI (Kansas City, Mo.): On Tuesday another stretch
of the long-planned Bruce Watkins Drive will open and some urban
dwellers can hardly wait. They'll be able to zip south a lot
faster. But some black residents east of the roadway feel boxed in,
trapped and isolated. They fear slowly losing touch with the heart
of the city and worry about the beginning of a new era of urban
decay. Jeffrey Spivak. 45. Photos; graphic. Story will move in the
``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   RIVER-MISSOURI (Riverside, Mo.): A couple years ago the U.S.
Postal Service promised the tiny town of Riverside it could have
its very own zip code _ if it paid for a new post office.
</P>
<P>
   So the friendly folks of Riverside shelled out a couple million
to build the post office. But now the Postal Service says zip to a
new zip code and the friendly folks of Riverside are really PO'ed _
and that doesn't stand for Post Office. By BILL GRAHAM. 15 inches.
Story will move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   WEATHER-HOT-MISSOURI (Kansas City, Mo.): Weather remains hot in
Kansas City. We check hospitals and other places and ask why no one
is dying here, unlike Cincinnati where seven persons have died.
Also looking at people who are helping the elderly. By LEE HILL
KAVANAUGH. 15 inches. Photo. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-AMC-MISSOURI (Kansas City, Mo.): What does the future
hold for AMC? By Jennifer Mann. 40 inches. Story will move in the
``f'' category.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-NAC-MISSOURI (Kansas City, Mo.): National Association
of African American Chambers of Commerce holds a seminar in Kansas
City on funding for minority business. By Ted Sickinger, with
PHOTO. Story will move in the ``f'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-BUG-NATIONAL (undated): Stop worring about Y2K blackouts and
begin worrying about terrorism and looting -- cops are. Feds and
local cops are making plans to prevent bad guys from taking
advantage of the Y2K bug. BY FINN BULLERS. 25 inches. Story will
move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-SWEAT-KANSAS (undated): We're having a heat wave. And you
know what that means. Dripping, beading, drenching and vastly
under-appreciated sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, under-appreciated. Because while sweat may seem bothersome
on these sultry days _ sopping your shirt, wetting your brow,
dripping down your spine, soaking saddlebags under your arms _
truth is, without it every one of us would be melting like a
Salvador Dali pocket watch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if sweating doesn't do its job and your core body
temperature rises beyond 105 degrees Fahrenheit, you're talking
kidney dysfunction, muscle breakdown, disruption of brain
functions, even death. By ERIC ADLER. 780 words. NOT FOR RELEASE
UNTIL THURSDAY, JULY 29. Story will move in the ``l'' category.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-GRAINS-KANSAS (undated):If you're still eating all the
wrong foods, it'll only get harder for you to blame it on
ignorance. Nutritional information is a growth industry, and one
place where it's popping up with increasing frequency is the
grocery-store shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the U.S. Food and Drug Administration opted
to allow food manufacturers to make claims on certain products
about the healthful benefits of whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   Labels on foods that consist, by weight, of at least 51 percent
whole grains now may state the following: ``Diets rich in whole
grain foods and other plant foods, and low in total fat, saturated
fat and cholesterol, may help reduce the risk of heart disease and
certain cancers.'' By KAREN UHLENHUTH. 660 words. Story will move
in the ``l'' category.

   Special-interest tours are for travelers who realize that
there's more than one way to see the world. It might be flowers or
wine, architecture or music. But by focusing on a specific
activity, the best special interest tours can actually reveal an
entire culture in a unique way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these tours are led by professionals or academics.
Typically, they provide access to private homes and villas, or
offer guest lecturers or instructors.
</P>
<P>
   These tours are popular because enthusiasts, whether of art,
architecture or wine, like to travel with like-minded companions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of special-interest tour companies grows larger every
year, and their offerings increase as well. Here's a sampling of
what's available. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy,

   Special-interest tours are for travelers who realize that
there's more than one way to see the world. It might be flowers or
wine, architecture or music. But by focusing on a specific
activity, the best special interest tours can actually reveal an
entire culture in a unique way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these tours are led by professionals or academics.
Typically, they provide access to private homes and villas, or
offer guest lecturers or instructors.
</P>
<P>
   These tours are popular because enthusiasts, whether of art,
architecture or wine, like to travel with like-minded companions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of special-interest tour companies grows larger every
year, and their offerings increase as well. Here's a sampling of
what's available. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy,

TV'S NEW MAVERICKS ON CABLE ARE MAKING THE NETWORKS SWEAT
</HEADLINE>
 .MDNM/By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ As network executives plot strategy for the
fall television season, they do so with unsettling conclusions that
sound all too familiar: shrinking influence, audience erosion,
disappearing profits.
</P>
<P>
   This rather dire scenario was brought up the other day at the
annual summer TV press tour, during a panel promoting an original
film on the pay-cable channel Showtime. Normally at such events, a
reporter would be scolded for steering the discussion off the
project at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, panel moderator Jerry Offsay, Showtime's no-frills
programming president, broke into a broad grin (for him, at least).
Then he offered a lengthy explanation saying, in essence, that
cable channels have buried the networks by airing quality original
movies, and that they now are zeroing in on more network sacred
ground: weekly drama and comedy series.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement of this year's Emmy nominees supports
his point. ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's critically acclaimed series
about a mobster in suburbia, received 16 Emmy nominations, more
than any other show. And though the cable channels air far fewer
original series than the networks, it was a cable channel, HBO,
that received the second-highest number of Emmy bids. (NBC shows
got 82 bids, but HBO was second with 74.)
</P>
<P>
   Showtime's recent premiere of ``Beggars &AMP; Choosers,'' which
focuses on, of all things, the work and life of a network
entertainment president, is only the latest thorn in the networks'
increasingly weakening side.
</P>
<P>
   The series has yet to catch on like cult favorite ``Stargate
SG-1,'' based on the 1994 sci-fi movie; ``Linc's,'' a
politically-laced comedy set in a Washington, D.C., restaurant bar;
and ``Rude Awakenings,'' another sitcom about a boozing single
woman and her dysfunctional family, but give it time.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the very thing cable offers and networks usually don't.
</P>
<P>
   That along with subject matter. Although broadcast networks are
beholden to ratings and advertisers, cable channels merely cater to
subscribers. And when it comes to series, Showtime isn't even the
pace setter.
</P>
<P>
   That honor belongs to HBO, which is home base to critically
acclaimed series like ``Oz,'' the frighteningly realistic prison
drama conceived by Tom Fontana, co-creator of ``Homicide'';
``Arli$$,'' which zeros in on the life of a sports agent; ``Hoop
Life,'' a behind-the-scenes look at a professional basketball team;
``Sex and the City,'' a comedy exploring the dating and mating
habits of four single women. (It also received an Emmy nomination
as best comedy series.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``The Sopranos,'' the sharp-witted mob family
series that is so good it has a shot at a best-drama Emmy. Its
season finale this spring also attracted 10 million viewers, HBO
brags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Day Now,'' a drama about an interracial friendship set in
the Deep South, was ranked higher than ``ER'' on most critics' Top
10 lists this past season, and it's on Lifetime. The series,
starring Annie Potts and Larraine Toussaint, premiered along with
two other promising series, ``Oh Baby,'' about a single woman who
opts for artificial insemination, and ``Maggie,'' about a married
woman going through something of a midlife meltdown. (''Maggie'' is
the only series not asked back.)
</P>
<P>
   The USA Network has found success with action dramas featuring
strong female leads, from ``The Net'' to ``La Femme Nikita,'' while
even a smaller niche network like Comedy Central has done big-buck
business with the animated ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Network executives continue to dismiss cable's low penetration
(Lifetime gets a 1.7 rating and is watched in only 1.5 million
households, exactly one-sixth the number of the average fairly
successful broadcast network series). The nets prefer to point out
cable's reliance on recycled theatrical movies and network reruns.
</P>
<P>
   But the creative community points to cable's willingness to take
risks on unconventional programming and to allow writers and
directors to operate with minimal interference. For eight years,
Nancy Miller tried to sell ``Any Day Now'' to the networks, ``and
every year I got the same response,'' she says. ``This is great.
This is wonderful. But it's about girls. It's about civil rights.
It's too close to `I'll Fly Away.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But now that we're here I see the difference. We do a lot of
provocative things on this show that would have never made it past
the network safety net. Race, the legacy of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Star didn't even bother with the networks with ``Sex and
the City,'' which midway through its second season is cable's
highest-rated comedy series and often beats out its network
competition on Sunday nights in homes that subscribe to HBO.
Because his show is on paid cable, Star can push the sexual (it has
nudity) and social (the dialogue is rather explicit) envelopes much
further than he did on his network projects like ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the appeal of these shows, although they are also written
with a far more sophisticated sensibility, realizing viewers should
be neither sheltered through censorship nor led by the hand.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most highly praised series on television, period,
is ``The Sopranos,'' a well-written, sharply-acted series about a
mafioso who has primal anxieties and a mother from hell. The series
was turned down by Fox, which has gotten all sorts of grief about
the decision now. (CBS also passed.)
</P>
<P>
   But in defense of the networks, it wasn't the same show airing
now. Creator David Chase rewrote the script to take full advantage
of the freedom cable offers. Meanwhile, Chase is receiving offers
to bring the series to network TV after episodes air on HBO. (He's
turned them all down, so far.)
</P>
<P>
   Ask any observer when cable started to turn the corner on series
television, and they'd undoubtedly finger 1992 and ``The Larry
Sanders Show,'' with Garry Shandling playing a late-night talk show
host. But there were earlier rumblings. Perhaps you recall
Shandling's innovative ``It's Garry Shandling's Show'' for Showtime
in 1986. Three years later, Lifetime began running new episodes of
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' the critically acclaimed but
low-rated dramedy canceled by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives attribute cable's success to several
competitive advantages, like the ability to spend more money on
series because fewer of them are produced. But cable has also made
some out-and-out smart moves, like avoiding the September rush of
shows by introducing series in the summer when the networks are
hibernating.
</P>
<P>
   That Showtime's Offsay would pep up when discussing network
programming inventory shows that cable executives are sensing
they're moving in for the kill, particularly in a new season loaded
with predictable, lightweight dramas in the mold of NBC's hit
``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   That drama has spawned new look-alike series, such as ``Judging
Amy'' for CBS. With old age catching up with established shows like
``ER'' and ``NYPD Blue'' (''Homicide'' is gone), it does look as if
cable execs have cause for celebration.

   &UR; MEXICAN NIGHTMARES &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By M. Delal Baer &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) As Mexico City sinks beneath a wave of crime, the
provinces smolder and drug lords send corruption creeping through
the establishment, Mexico's rulers seem more interested in fighting
one another than their common enemies. For the country to survive
as a democracy, this will have to change _ and soon.

   (1,200 words) Colombia is worse off in many ways than it was a
decade ago. The country's violent forces _ left-wing insurgents and
right-wing militias _ have never been better armed and financed or
held more territory. Colombia's drug economy, with its pernicious
effects, is as pervasive as ever. And the government is running out
of options.

   (1,100 words) Nonvital, ``C-list'' crises _ such as Somalia,
Bosnia, Haiti and Kosovo _ continue to force their way to the top
of the U.S. agenda because they can command massive media
attention. Such crises raise moral issues that the American people
consistently list among their foreign-policy concerns. Policy
experts may deplore such sympathies, but they are a democratic
reality. Yet if the ``A-list,'' abstract, strategic issues are
ignored and turn out badly, they will have a far greater impact on
the lives of most Americans.

<P>
   &UR; MEXICAN NIGHTMARES &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By M. Delal Baer &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) As Mexico City sinks beneath a wave of crime, the
provinces smolder and drug lords send corruption creeping through
the establishment, Mexico's rulers seem more interested in fighting
one another than their common enemies. For the country to survive
as a democracy, this will have to change _ and soon.

   &UR; COLOMBIAN CRISES &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL SHIFTER &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,200 words) Colombia is worse off in many ways than it was a
decade ago. The country's violent forces _ left-wing insurgents and
right-wing militias _ have never been better armed and financed or
held more territory. Colombia's drug economy, with its pernicious
effects, is as pervasive as ever. And the government is running out
of options.

   &UR; WHY `ETHNIC CLEANSING'? &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   (1,200 words) The violence and fury with which Slobodan
Milosevic and his thugs carried on an ethnic cleansing campaign in
Kosovo and Bosnia boggles the modern imagination. At a time of
globalization and glittering technological triumphs, how _ and why
_ could people harbor such primitive hate and manifest it in such
savage acts?

   &UR; WHICH THREATS SHALL WE HEED? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Joseph S. Nye Jr. &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,100 words) Nonvital, ``C-list'' crises _ such as Somalia,
Bosnia, Haiti and Kosovo _ continue to force their way to the top
of the U.S. agenda because they can command massive media
attention. Such crises raise moral issues that the American people
consistently list among their foreign-policy concerns. Policy
experts may deplore such sympathies, but they are a democratic
reality. Yet if the ``A-list,'' abstract, strategic issues are
ignored and turn out badly, they will have a far greater impact on
the lives of most Americans.

<P>
   (1,500 words) The most striking feature of this year's defense
budget debate was that there was none. Hawks should find President
Clinton's proposed $112 billion increase in military spending over
the next six years cause for celebration. With combat readiness
near a 20-year low, morale suffering and weapons acquisition sorely
underfunded, the military could use the cash. Yet even hawks are
finding reason to be troubled.

<P>
   (1,300 words) Since adopting a controversial 1976 plan to
liberalize legal access to drugs, Holland _ in the words of senior
customs and police officers in the United Kingdom, France and
Belgium _ has become ``the drugs capital of Western Europe.'' Not
just of the soft drugs depenalized by the Dutch Parliament, but

   (1,000 words) The world is becoming increasingly polarized
between the rich and the poor. Poverty amid abundance is a growing
problem that poses grave dangers to the West and to the world. Yet
the United States has been particularly stingy with its aid budget
of late. In 1960, 4 percent of the U.S. budget went to development
and international affairs. Today these areas are allocated less
than 1 percent. Forty U.S. embassies, consulates and branch offices
have closed in the past six years. The United States now accounts
for just 13 percent of the industrial world's development
assistance.

HANDLING AN IRA INHERITANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My brother died and left me his IRA. I am in my mid-70s. Can
I leave this to a primary beneficiary of my own designation and not
have to withdraw any money?
</P>
<P>
   J.C., Lynn, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The rules for withdrawal depend on how the IRA was
established. There are two basic methods. One is that the person
inheriting the IRA can take withdrawals based on the new owner's
life expectancy. The second specifies that the IRA must be
liquidated within a five-year period. You must check with the IRA
trustee to determine what options you have.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the life expectancy method, you must begin the
withdrawals no later than Dec. 31 of the year following that of
your brother's death. If you use the five-year method, the account
must be depleted by Dec. 31 of the fifth year following that of
your brother's death.
</P>
<P>
   You could put the after-tax proceeds of the required withdrawals
in an account earmarked in your will to go to a specific person _
but it couldn't be an IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Vanguard Index 500 fund is priced at about $124 a share.
Vanguard Index Value is $24, and Vanguard Index Growth is $33. My
understanding is that the stocks in Index Value and Index Growth
are also in Index 500. Since Index 500 is so much more expensive,
doesn't it make more sense to purchase the lower-priced funds? Am I
missing something here?
</P>
<P>
   C.S., Portland, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Index 500 fund was launched at the end of August 1976,
while the two smaller funds were both begun in November 1992.
Therefore, Index 500 has had a lot longer to build up its share
value than the younger funds. But it doesn't make that fund more or
less ``expensive'' than the others.
</P>
<P>
   Using the general prices you cited, when you buy a single share
of Index 500, what you've bought is $124 worth of a portfolio
designed to track the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index. When you buy one
share of Index Value, you buy $22 worth of a portfolio that tracks
about two-thirds of those stocks. And a share of Index Growth buys
you $33 worth of the remaining one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, buying one share each of Index Value and Index Growth not
only would not give you the same value as one share of Index 500,
but your purchases would give you a different portfolio weighting _
on the growth side _ than you would have if you held $55 worth of
Index 500.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With ambulance sirens wailing, Maleeka arrived at
Children's Hospital, a newborn so tiny doctors could hold her
squirmy, 3-pound body cupped in one hand.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine that had swirled in her bloodstream caused sections
of her intestine to shrivel. At 2 months old, surgeons
reconstructed it, but feared she would die.
</P>
<P>
   She survived, a miracle girl with a label on her head: ``crack
baby.'' It was 1989 when that phrase sent shudders throughout
Boston and the nation. Doctors cringed at the thought of Maleeka's
miserable fate.
</P>
<P>
   Now 9, Maleeka is an outgoing, talkative girl who thrives on
attention, and writes and reads at grade level. A row of A's marks
her report card, except in math, which is a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can be anything she wants in the world,'' said her
adoptive mother, Barbara Webb of Harwich.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 years since the birth of the first generation of
crack babies, researchers have reached an unexpected and hopeful
conclusion: Crack-exposed babies did not grow up to become the
irreparably damaged children that everyone once feared. While most
of them need some help, you cannot, just by looking at them, tell
them apart from other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said these babies were damaged. That they would be
retarded and become wards of society,'' said Barry Lester, a
leading researcher on cocaine-exposed children, based in
Providence. ``Now we know that they do show differences, but the
differences are subtle and can be corrected with treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they believe the brains of some of these
children are smaller and less developed, with neurological glitches
that cause misfires in processing information. Most of the children
struggle to stay focused, take longer to understand complex
thoughts and solve math problems, and tend to get excited easily.
The average crack-exposed child has an IQ about 3 points lower than
the average child, studies show. But with special education
programs, researchers say these children can perform as well as
other children.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a decade ago when TV news began flashing
pictures of scrawny babies with glassy eyes who shook
uncontrollably and did not like being held. Pediatricians, nurses,
and social workers blamed the horrors on a new drug called crack _
a potent, highly addictive form of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, doctors realized they overlooked another possible
culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are classic symptoms of heroin withdrawal,'' said
Lester. ``At the time, people would find out the mother was using
cocaine, and they didn't look for signs of other drugs. They
thought cocaine was doing all the dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pregnant mothers who smoke crack also smoke cigarettes,
drink alcohol, and often do other drugs. In Maleeka's case, her
mother was so strung out on drugs, she told doctors she did not
know she was pregnant. She gave birth to Maleeka in her Dorchester
apartment, then dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem for many of the children: poverty,
malnutrition, lack of mental stimulation, neglect, and growing up
in dysfunctional homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable that these kids do as well as they do
considering all they are facing,'' Lester said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka is tall for her age, a bright-eyed girl with tremendous
energy, who admits, ``I love to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, she ran around her home, talking to her Furby
doll. Then she walked in front of a visitor, tapped a pair of chop
sticks on the table, and announced, ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' while
raising the sticks in front of an imaginary choir. As she waved the
sticks, her voice boomed: ``La. Lee. La. La.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a giggle, Maleeka revealed the scars hidden under her
T-shirt. ``Here are my railroad tracks,'' she exclaimed, pointing
to the incision and staple marks stretching across her abdomen. It
is a reminder of the surgery she had at 2 months old. Another scar
marks her gallbladder removal. Along her lower spine, a fleshy
mound reminds her of the recent removal of a cyst in between her
vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors don't know what caused it,'' said Webb, 42. ``I
find it hard to believe it's not connected to the cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite physical ailments and minor learning disabilities,
children like Maleeka do so well most people would never suspect
their mothers smoked crack.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fred, 5, who has a sly grin, is outgoing and friendly, but
easily distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to get him to play with blocks or do a puzzle, he
doesn't stay engaged. You have to work hard with him,'' Lester
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has trouble controlling his excitement, and gets emotional
easily. But his IQ on various tests is 98, two points shy of
average. And he speaks and understands concepts as well as his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Fred's mother smoked crack cocaine about four times a week in
the first trimester, but says she stopped because she worried that
continued use would cause harm. If anything, drug and alcohol use
causes the most damage in the first trimester, doctors say, when
the baby's central nervous system and major organs are forming.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lester said, Fred's mother continued to drink and smoke
cigarettes throughout her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Lester has known Fred since birth and thinks he will do fine
despite his minor handicaps. Fred's mother has done an about-face
and now reads with him, plays with him, and gives him the kind of
nurturing and stimulation he needs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good news, the effort continues to fully understand
cocaine's effects on the brain. Researchers theorize that the
brains of crack-exposed children are smaller based on studies that
show the diameter of their heads is about a centimeter smaller at
birth than those of children not exposed to crack. But no one has
published a study showing such children's brains are actually
smaller. Also, it is difficult for researchers to prove that crack
limits children's brain functions, basing the belief on the poorer
performance of crack babies.

 BOSTON: ... crack babies.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the studies are centered around laboratory animals.
Researchers inject or feed cocaine to pregnant mice, rats, or
rabbits, then study the size of the offspring's cranium, or test
how the offspring respond to noise and light.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Kosofsky, a researcher, studies cocaine-exposed mice at
the University of Massachusetts' Charlestown lab. The mice are
placed in a two-room maze where they are exposed to smells and
shocks. Normal mice run to the safe room; cocaine-exposed mice get
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're unable to block out extraneous, redundant
information,'' Kosofsky said. Also, the brains of cocaine-exposed
mice are as much as 12 percent smaller in volume.
</P>
<P>
   While Kosofsky knows crack-exposed babies are better off
developmentally than people once thought, he said many children
need to be taught how to handle stress and how to process
information. They need people to be patient with them, to figure
out ways to help them learn.
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka, because of her struggles with math, has a teacher who
taught her to draw circles on paper to visualize math problems.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, Barbara and Gary Webb, never give her a list of
things to do. ``If I tell her to go upstairs, brush her teeth then
bring me something, she'll say `That's too much!' '' Barbara Webb
said. ``I give direction in small chunks. If you know to do that,
it's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka has done well partly because her parents make sure she
is getting the help she needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day they brought her to us, she just sat on my lap
and clung to me,'' Barbara Webb said. At 2 1/2, she was not talking
much, wore braces on her legs, and could not walk. But the Webbs
got Maleeka speech and physical therapy and explained to her
teachers her special needs. She has also had tutors.
</P>
<P>
   And her schedule is filled with activities. She plays softball.
She practices gymnastics. She takes swimming lessons. And, at home,
her mother lavishes her with attention. But Maleeka is not spoiled.
When her parents ask her to do something, she might question why _
in her theatrical way _ but in the end she listens.
</P>
<P>
   Like any proud parent, Barbara Webb does not see anything
getting in her child's way: ``I see her going to college if she
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say not every crack-exposed child needs to be taken
away from their mother to make it. Whenever possible, they say,
both mother and child should be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Kosofsky said the issue has become politicized, with some people
labeling mothers as criminals instead of understanding that they
need treatment so they can care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Because crack, a synthesized, cheap form of cocaine, is used
more heavily by poor people, and because blacks and Latinos are
disproportionately represented among the poor, most of the women
who smoke crack during pregnancy are black and Latina.
</P>
<P>
   Hortensia Amaro, a psychologist and professor of social and
behavioral sciences at Boston University School of Public Health,
is determined to save the ``crack mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   She founded the MOMs Project in Roxbury and Entre Familia
(Within the Family) in Mattapan for addicted mothers. Most of the
women, she says, abuse drugs partly to escape the trauma of
childhood abuse. The mothers also tend to be high school dropouts,
and many have been homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent come in with a history of childhood abuse, a
history of mental illness like depression and anxiety disorders and
post-traumatic stress, from when they were abused,'' Amaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma created early on by the blaring headlines of crack
babies with countless medical disabilities continues when people
see children like Eddie Jussila, 10.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie's mother smoked crack and drank alcohol so often her
placenta never attached to the walls of her uterus, from where
nutrients and oxygen flow.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Eddie entered the world, his heart stopped.
Doctors revived him in utero, then plucked him from the womb, his
body dripping with placenta laced with crack cocaine. Born with
severe brain damage, Eddie spent most of the first two years of his
life at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He only recently developed muscles to hold up his head. The
cornea of his left eye drifts to the corner of the socket. Tiny
teeth jut from his thick gums, the result of never having chewed
food. A machine pumps 2 ounces of formula _ a pureed blend of beef,
peas, and peaches _ into him every hour.
</P>
<P>
   Though Eddie represents the far end of the spectrum, even he is
doing better than doctors had expected. He communicates basic
thoughts _ yes, no, hello _ with a handheld computer. And he can
walk for brief periods with a special walker resembling a tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   His legal guardians, Marianne and Bruce Jussila, have cared for
more than 20 drug-exposed children in 17 years. People look at
Eddie, said the South Harwich couple, and see him as a poster child
for crack babies. That hurts the children who do not show obvious
signs but still need special attention, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Children like Maleeka.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside her home the other day, Maleeka ran through the Crazy
Daisy sprinkler, her shoulder-length braids flopping. ``Mom! Mom!
Watch me!'' she screamed, cartwheeling through the spray.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, she ran inside, to show the A's she had
gotten on spelling tests and the smooth flow of her cursive
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka understands she was born with cocaine in her body,
Barbara Webb said. Sometimes, Maleeka gets angry thinking of her
mother who used drugs that ``hurt her brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb said she believes the cocaine is to blame for Maleeka's
struggle with math and analyzing information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `Maleeka, you're very lucky you can do all the
things you do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maleeka agrees. And if anyone asks her, she announces, with
theatrical flair, ``I think I'm 100 percent smart.''

POLICY MAKING DESCENDS INTO FARCE AS GOP PASSES TAX-CUT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dennis Hastert, occasional speaker of the House in
fact as well as title, was fighting to save his position. In that
context, details hardly mattered.
</P>
<P>
   So he was grabbing at thin air as the robotic House went through
the motions of deliberation and passed their tax-cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with me, guys, he babbled at his Republican troops. Vote
yes, and the elderly will have new freedom, the ability to earn
more money on the side in retirement without Social Security
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting issue, Democrat Sandy Levin of Michigan
countered, except that earned-income exclusion and Social Security
benefits were nowhere to be found in the turkey of a bill being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's purpose was to collect 219 votes for a tax-cut bill
that added up to roughly $800 billion in forgone revenue over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The components were important only to the extent that they
attracted votes. And there was the additional pitch that there was
no reason to fear that the measure under ``consideration'' would
become law. For that reason, it was no problem that only a handful
of members knew what was in it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does a dysfunctional House ``legislate.'' Thus does
national policy making descend into farce.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Stenholm, the veteran conservative Democrat from West
Texas, called the House's tax bill the most irresponsible piece of
legislation he had ever seen. And Stenholm had the standing to say
that. Back in 1981, he was a leading ``Boll Weevil,'' one of the
Southern Democrats who provided the key votes for the tax- and
budget-slashing monstrosities that sent the national debt through
the roof, driving up interest rates and squeezing the incomes of
working families for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the conservative Democrats (now called Blue
Dogs) couldn't even get floor consideration for their much smaller
alternative because it would have passed solidly and become the
possible basis for a bipartisan compromise that could have proved
irresistible to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even President-in-Waiting George Bush has smelled a rat in the
political maneuvering, triggering his resolve to avoid clear
identification with the GOP Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush first emerged from Austin in June, some of the first
words out of his mouth were an unqualified call for reductions in
marginal income-tax rates. But two weeks ago, as the House's
bizarre intent became more clear, he dropped what had been a
bedrock principle faster than a bad habit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's current position is essentially like Clinton's and the
congressional Democrats': First, Congress should ``preserve''
Social Security and Medicare; then it should take care of
supposedly ravenous military needs; then tax cutting is an
appropriate subject.
</P>
<P>
   That would preclude not only the House's bill, but the same-size
but differently structured turkey that came out of the Senate
Finance Committee. But Bush diplomatically avoided saying so.
</P>
<P>
   To the true believers of the right, however, Bush's apostasy was
dramatic and quickly became fodder for some of his
upstream-swimming opponents, notably flat taxer Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   To Forbes, the tax measures inching toward the president's
inhospitable desk are mere drops in the bucket. Supply siders of
the late 1990s are either still pushing flat-tax systems like
Forbes or advocating radical acts like the 30 percent across the
board rate cuts favored by floundering Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives also grumble, albeit lamely. The current
complaint is that the House measure only grazes the over-hyped
``marriage penalty,'' but they were bought off with Hastert
promises of unspecified add-ons later in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Totally missing are the less rich-biased proposals of people
like Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, who had urged
making Social Security taxes fully deductible against income taxes.
Also missing was a species once known as Moderato Republicano. It
has been replaced by today's moderate Republican, who frequently
expresses concern that other GOP stalwarts are ``extreme,'' but
then votes with them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, these summer soldiers were bought off, incredibly, by
a weird provision in the legislation that the House bill's rate
cuts (though not its equally large breaks for special interests)
would only take effect in years when national debt-reduction
targets are met. This unworkable garbage will be laughed out of the
occasionally responsible Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only those who think that cutting taxes is nuts when
spending cuts needed to keep the budget balanced can't be made, who
think it's especially nuts when the ``surpluses'' are all
conjectural, who think retirement programs should be made secure
first, who think debt reduction is more responsible, and who think
the inflationary consequences of tax-cutting in the midst of a boom
are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   They are now called Democrats.

THIS CLICHE COULD HAVE A SILVER LINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other day I pulled out a roll of paper towels and saw, in
pastel script, the following message: ``Love . . . like a
wildflower garden thrives and grows in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   It does? Why has no one told me this before?
</P>
<P>
   Some nameless designer chose to put that trite sentiment on a
paper towel. Why not some other cliche, such as ``Cleanliness is
next to godliness'' or ``It's always darkest before the (new,
improved) Dawn'' or ``If you can't stand the heat, get out of the
kitchen''?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time a paper towel spoke to me. I don't mind
if my paper products want to communicate, but why must they do it
in homilies and cliches?
</P>
<P>
   I recall a paper towel telling me: ``Every cloud has a silver
lining.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not necessarily. That's been my experience. But maybe the
paper towel knew better. I suppose the phrase might provide solace
or encouragement. I imagined some poor soul, beaten down by life,
reaching for a paper towel, maybe to sop up her tears, and reading,
``Every cloud has a silver lining.'' Would it give her new hope? Or
make her cry harder?
</P>
<P>
   My tea bags are also given to homilies, like this one: ``We
turn, not older with the years, but newer every day.'' The tea
manufacturer attributes that sermonette to Emily Dickinson,
although it sounds more like Hallmark to me.
</P>
<P>
   If paper towels or tea bags or any other household products have
anything to say, I'd prefer something witty, please. Jerry
Seinfeld: ``There is no such thing as fun for the whole family.''
Or Gypsy Rose Lee: ``She's descended from a long line her mother
listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   If they insist on cliches, they could try to apply them with a
sense of humor. Maybe I'll live long enough to pick up a roll of
toilet tissue and read, ``You can't take it with you'' or ``What
goes around, comes around.'' Cliches are useful, so much a part of
our conversation, that most of us don't even notice them until we
hear them abused, or we see them looking up at us from a paper
towel or hear them coming out of our own mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems that if it weren't for cliches and trite
phrases, all attempts at human communication would cease. Notice
that's ``attempts at communication,'' not communication, because
cliches have a dampening effect on the genuine exchange of
thoughts. Maybe that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   Death, more than most events, reduces us to cliches, homilies,
trite phrases. The magnitude of the event requires some comment.
Cliches eliminate the need to think, which can be useful when
you're faced with the unthinkable. Maybe every cloud does indeed
have a silver lining _ even cliches.
</P>
<P>
   But which cliche is the right cliche? Certainly not the one a
friend recalls hearing someone say at her mother-in-law's funeral:
``It's a blessing in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   (Some blessing. Some disguise.)
</P>
<P>
   Not ``I know exactly what you're going through.''
</P>
<P>
   (No, you don't.)
</P>
<P>
   Not ``It's fortunate she went so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   (Fortunate for whom?)
</P>
<P>
   Not that current favorite, ``At least you have closure.''
</P>
<P>
   (What, exactly, is ``closure?'' And how do you know when you've
got it?)
</P>
<P>
   Faced with death, there's an impulse to say something not just
comforting but profound. How many people are capable of profundity?
Maybe it's better to say a simple and sincere, ``I'm sorry'' and
leave the cliches to paper towel manufacturers.

HE'S THE DEAN OF PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tumble down a flight of stairs turned Mary Ellen Faysal's life
into a blinding veil of pain, a private agony that persisted for a
decade and caused her to contemplate suicide.
</P>
<P>
   After four operations failed to alleviate her severe back pain,
her doctor sewed a hockey-puck-sized pump into her abdomen that
delivered a steady drip of morphine to her spinal cord. But the
stabbing pain continued, and her doctor told her the pain was in
her head.
</P>
<P>
   `` `When we take a limb off someone, they have to learn to live
with it,' '' the 37-year-old former legal secretary recalls him
saying. `` `You too have to learn to live with it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Faysal kept searching for help _ and stopped when she met
Dr. Daniel B. Carr a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carr is the medical director of the New England Medical Center's
Pain Management Program and one of the country's leading
authorities on the treatment of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Where Faysal's previous doctors threw their hands up, Carr was
convinced more could be done. First, he tried adjusting the level
of her morphine dose and adding different medications. When she
developed side effects, he tried another drug.
</P>
<P>
   Her pain hasn't disappeared entirely, but for the first time in
10 years, Faysal says her life is bearable. She's exercising
regularly now and has lost the 100 pounds she gained during her
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now have hope,'' says Faysal. ``Dr. Carr always says if this
doesn't work, there's something else coming down the pike.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain relief _ once viewed as a backwater in medicine _ is
finally coming of age. Pain management clinics are becoming
fixtures at US hospitals. And Congress is debating legislation that
would give doctors broader ability to prescribe painkilling
narcotics. Contrary to popular belief, studies indicate that it is
relatively rare for patients without a history of drug or alcohol
abuse to become addicted to pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of pain control has come out of the closet,''
said Dr. Robert Mayer, director of the Center for Gastrointestinal
Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ``It's
become much more of an up front and center issue for the medical
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, pain treatment hasn't moved entirely out of the
dark ages. The physiology of pain remains one of the great medical
mysteries. And millions of Americans continue to experience
debilitating pain.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 13,625 cancer patients in nursing homes published
last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association found
that a quarter of all patients who reported daily pain received no
analgesics for relief.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have always been ready, physicians say, to
punish doctors who they believe overprescribe medication to fight
pain. But there are precious few cases where doctors have had to
pay the price for undertreating patients.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is ignorance. Though pain research has
advanced enormously in the past decades, clinical care has not kept
up. Few residency programs require courses in pain therapy or how
to relieve the suffering of the sick and dying.
</P>
<P>
   To try to fill this gap, Tufts University School of Medicine
will launch the nation's first masters degree program in pain
research, education, and policy this fall. The program will offer
courses in the mechanisms of pain, the pharmacology of pain
treatment, cultural and social implications of pain, ethics, and
regulatory policies. The program is for physicians, nurses,
dentists, pharmacists, hospice workers, and psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time pain was its own discipline,'' says Carr, the
co-director of the program. ``Like other medical disciplines, it
has the journals, it has the practitioners. There's a growing
critical mass of research about pain. With that kind of environment
we believe students could have a stellar education in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   A 42-year-old with a modulated voice, Carr has pain on the
brain. His office shelves are stacked with such titles as ``Animal
Pain'', ``The Culture of Pain,'' and the ``History of Pain.'' On
the wall hangs a poster with a photograph of the Dalai Lama with
the words: ``Never Give Up No Matter What is Going On.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr is also the former director of the American Pain Society
and the American Academy of Pain Medicine. At one of the Pain
Society's meetings, Carr's older brother, Jay Carr, the Boston
Globe's movie critic, was invited to show and critique snippets
from movies depicting pain, including the legendary dentist scene
from Marathon Man.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who describes himself as a bit obsessive about his work,
maintains a clinical practice, is the Saltonstall Professor of Pain
Research at Tufts, and in June co-authored one of a series of pain
articles in The Lancet, a major British medical journal, on the
mechanisms that turn acute pain to chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's own fascination with pain is more intellectual than
emotional. Both his parents died without experiencing chronic pain,
he says, and in his life he's only felt severe pain twice: once
when he pulled a ligament in his leg and a second time in medical
school when he had his wisdom teeth removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd given me prescription painkillers, but when I fell
asleep the cat knocked the pills behind the drawer. I woke up with
this really bad pain. But I couldn't find the pills. I found out
who was on call at the hospital and I was in a cab in two minutes.
It was a 9 out of 10 pain and I couldn't concentrate on anything
else except getting rid of that pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who recently returned from a conference in France on pain
from landmine injuries, becomes most animated when talking about
the history of pain and the strides doctors have made, mostly due
to the carnage of war.
</P>
<P>
   After serving on the beaches of Anzio, Italy during World War
II, Harvard anesthesiologist Henry Knowles Beecher observed that
wounded civilians reported feeling more pain than comparably
wounded soldiers. He theorized that emotions could exacerbate or
block pain, which Carr says led to Beecher's groundbreaking work in
the 1950s on the powerful pain-reducing effects of placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Another World II anesthesiologist, John Bonica, also saw a link
between pain and emotion. He proposed that doctors take a
multi-disciplined approach toward pain therapy, involving
orthopedists, psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and anesthesiologists.
In 1947, he opened a pain clinic at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other pain clinics around the country, the pain
management program at the New England Medical Center has embraced
Bonica's multi-disciplinary approach to pain therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The team includes experts in anesthesia, nursing, psychology,
physical therapy and _ perhaps most controversially _ acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acupuncture seems to activate the body's pain-killing
mechanisms,'' Carr says. He notes that the needles, placed through
the skin, apparently activate nerve pathways in the brain and
spinal cord that interfere with the sensation of pain, in part by
releasing endorphins, the body's own morphine-like compounds.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is a magnet for patients with a diverse set of woes:
there are people with chronic back pain, AIDS, and diabetes; there
are fender-bender victims, arthritis and shingles sufferers,
patients with cancer, and amputees.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much misery, the clinic is an oddly cheerful place.
Patients joke and gossip as they lift weights, perform stomach
crunches, and burn calories on treadmills and stationary bicycles _
all to the beat of the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic's regimen is demanding. Patients exercise three times
a week, two hours a day, meet weekly with a psycholgist and twice
in a group. ``Pain behavior'' _ whining, grimacing, back clutching
_ is discouraged by the clinic's physical therapist, Harriet
Wittink. She explains that many patients have ``learned'' these
behaviors, which often persist long after physical injuries have
healed.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Carbone says she couldn't sit or stand without
excruciating pain when she came to the clinic in February with back
pain. Now, with medication, exercise, and counseling, she's feeling
good enough to think about going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This truly has been the miracle I've been praying for,'' she
says.

   BOSTON _ On the cover of his latest CD, Boston Pops conductor
Keith Lockhart falls backward, spread-eagled and tuxedoed, into a
swimming pool. At this year's Fourth of July concert on the
Esplanade, Lockhart joined Seiji Ozawa _ both wearing Red Sox
jerseys and baseball caps _ in a display of stage aerobics that
would have done Aerosmith proud.
</P>
<P>
   The Pops season just ended in Boston, but a nine-venue summer
tour looms. Meanwhile, Lockhart's likeness is seemingly everywhere:
on postcards, coffee mugs, city buses, television shows, CD racks,
and concert stages from Nantucket to Atlanta. That sampling alone
is ample proof that the 40-year-old conductor can market the Pops,
and himself, as energetically as he leads the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot get someone who's easier to promote or more willing
to be promoted than Keith is. And in classical music, that's
unusual,'' says marketing director Kim Noltemy of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, the Pops' parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the BSO acknowledge, however, that not everyone
is taken with Lockhart's youth and style. Some have questioned his
emphasis on popular music at the expense of more serious pieces, a
formula every modern Pops leader has tinkered with.
</P>
<P>
   The Sammy Glick analogy, about the self-absorbed, get-ahead
protagonist of the novel ``What Makes Sammy Run?'', also comes up,
suggesting that the Lockhart era is at once a work in progress and
generational testing ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always tensions within orchestras when it comes to
playing Pops repertoires,'' says BSO managing director Mark Volpe.
``One thing that often comes out is resentment from older
musicians.'' Lockhart tasted success rather quickly, Volpe adds.
``Managing that level of success is hard. But those issues are not
confined to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Noltemy says that there is ``a line you wouldn't want to cross''
between showmanship and silliness, and she contends that
tastefulness is carefully monitored by BSO officials.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe says he received about a hundred e-mail messages following
the Esplanade concert, 95 percent approving, the rest protesting
that Lockhart's and Ozawa's stage antics were a bit, well,
undignified.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had been conducting Mozart's `Requiem,' I might
agree,'' says Volpe. ``It's frankly easier to sell one personality
than a whole orchestra's. Do we promote our conductors too much?
Sometimes, but I watch for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart has been a multimedia darling since taking over the
Pops post in 1995. Profiled on network news shows and in People
magazine, he has even done a Christmas special with Donny and Marie
Osmond and starred in an American Airlines ad.
</P>
<P>
   No longer among Boston's most eligible bachelors (Lockhart is
married to BSO violinist Lucia Lin), he nevertheless projects an
image of youthfulness and sex appeal that contrasts noticeably with
that of his predecessor, ``Star Wars'' composer John Williams.
Although wildly popular with Pops audiences, Williams tended to
regard personality-driven marketing efforts as a force he could do
without.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, Lockhart's tenure has been a rousing success,
more than justifying the BSO's hopes when it lured him here to join
a tradition built most conspicuously by Arthur Fiedler and expanded
upon by Williams, who also faced criticism early on from BSO
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two percent of this season's Pops seats were sold, say
BSO officials, compared to 85 percent in 1994, the year between
Williams's reign and Lockhart's. The number of concerts is also up,
from 99 in Lockhart's first year to 132 in 1999. Tourists make up
10 percent to 15 percent of the concert audience, a 5 percent rise
since Lockhart came and one more indicator of his marketability.
Another? His conductor's chair is backed by a $5 million endowment,
a first for the Pops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pops also make money for the BSO, eating up roughly 22
percent of its $56 million operating budget while accounting for 34
percent of the BSO's earned income.
</P>
<P>
   While to most Bostonians the Pops' commercial viability may seem
as immutable as the Freedom Trail, financial success is not a
given, according to Ty Johnson, executive producer of the Symphonic
Pops Consortium in Washington. He cites only two other cities that
have Pops groups on a par with Boston's _ Cincinnati and Los
Angeles _ and says Lockhart is ``in a league of his own'' as a
national figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got energy, he's charismatic, and he has an incredible
sense of musicianship,'' says Johnson. ``Without those, you might
be seeing more raised eyebrows over the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, this year's Esplanade concert earned a 35 local
share for WCVB-TV (Ch. 5), compared to a 32 share last year. (The
concert also was broadcast nationally on cable's A&AMP;E channel.)
Public broadcasting's ``Evening at Pops'' series, now in its 30th
season, also is going strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evening at Pops'' executive producer Bill Cosel says the
show's ratings have remained consistent despite the departure of
Fiedler and Williams, both marquee names at the box office and on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur not only conducted the Pops but marketed it
aggressively,'' Cosel says. ``John was the first Pops conductor to
be a composer, too. But their personalities were very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur was a physically arresting person, a natural cutup.
When John came on board, he made it quite clear that he wasn't
comfortable with that kind of public cartoon image.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also is holding his own in the recording field. Fiedler
made nearly 80 albums with the Pops, and Williams made 30 others.
Lockhart's fifth, ``A Splash of Pops,'' sold nearly 6,000 copies in
its first week of release. ``Runnin' Wild,'' the first
Lockhart-Pops recording, has sold some 200,000 copies since its
1996 debut, helped perhaps by its mildly risque cover photo of
Lockhart in shorts and running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rosenfield, a senior executive with BMG Music, admits
pushing Lockhart to capitalize on his own handsome looks and sense
of play. The first CD cover, says Rosenfield, ``sent a signal to
musicians and the record industry that Keith was willing to put
himself out there as a fun guy. If it had tanked, you would have
seen more sober covers after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lockhart posed in a kilt for ``The Celtic Album,'' a
Grammy-nominated CD released in 1998, although he did balk at the
``Braveheart'' makeup job Rosenfield had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my limits,'' Rosenfield says with a laugh. ``Keith is
very aware of going too far. He'll say to me, `You're kidding,
right?' But those CD covers literally pop off the rack, and our job
after all is to sell records.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart jokes that he drew the line at wearing a Speedo
swimsuit for the ``Splash of Pops'' CD cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up, yeah,'' he quips. ``Also, let the record show that
our Esplanade antics were completely spontaneous. I had intended to
share the podium with Seiji, but I didn't know it was going to turn
into a square dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone recently from Salt Lake City, where he leads
the Utah Symphony Orchestra when not conducting the Boston Pops,
Lockhart points out that older classical music lovers need little
excuse to cluck their tongues when they see stage antics or CD
covers that strike them as irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a sense of ownership with the Pops,'' says
Lockhart. ``That translates to some saying, `I can't believe you
have so desecrated the legacy of Arthur Fiedler,' or thinking we're
being too jingoistic when we play `Stars and Stripes Forever.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of years I took the criticism to heart, but
then you figure out not everyone's going to love you anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this change is systemic, notes Lockhart, as opera stars
cross over into pop music, not always successfully, and politicians
promote Mozart recordings as a tool to increase infants' brain
power.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given Lockhart's boyish enthusiasm, the performances
he has felt the least comfortable with have been the Pops'
children's concerts, an area both he and the BSO's Volpe say needs
more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, says Lockhart, the BSO has been ``fairly careful
about putting me in incongruous settings designed to call attention
purely to me. Maybe if I were more like Fiedler, I'd drive more
firetrucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he would raise more eyebrows. On the album cover for
``Boston Tea Party,'' a 1958 Pops recording of standards like ``The
Merry Wives of Windsor'' and ``Hernando's Hideaway,'' Fielder was
photographed in a suburban living room, surrounded by a quartet of
attractive young women in cocktail dresses. One is smoking a
cigarette and smiling seductively. Another is pouring Fiedler a cup
of tea, held above his lap. ``Coffee, tea or me?'' read the liner
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish kilts and running shorts seem somewhat tame in that
Freudian subcontext. Says Lockhart, ``In all honesty, I've never
been that career-savvy. People ask how I'm `positioning myself'
when I record a type of music or pose for an album cover.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``People who ask that are highly confused.''

ATOMIC POP: THE GREAT EQUALIZER, SAYS CHUCK D 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Word has it that there's a revolution
going on at Atomic Pop, an Internet start-up company here. Staffers
will tell you they are working 50, 60, or even 70 hours a week to
overthrow a repressive system. They will tell you they're rewriting
history. They will tell you, quite seriously, that they are out to
change the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the casual Atomic Pop offices hardly look like a hotbed of
revolution; there are no outward signs of impending struggle. If
there is a coup being plotted here, it's a virtual one,
orchestrated by ponytailed programmers and idealistic executives
who embrace technology with a sort of religious fervor. Atomic Pop,
which bills itself as ``the 21st Century Music Company,'' is trying
to create a new business model for the recording industry by
aggressively using the Internet to market, promote, sell, and
distribute pop music. In May, the rap group Public Enemy released
its new album, ``There's a Poison Goin' On,'' exclusively on
atomicpop.com, the first time an album by a major act was available
for digital download before it hit the stores.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is a 21st-century music company? Why is it
making record company executives nervous? And how exactly is it
going to change the world?
</P>
<P>
   Even those who spend their days and nights here don't want to be
pinned down precisely; the operation, which was launched in
February, is evolving as it goes along. Right now, Atomic Pop is
part independent record label (with Public Enemy and Ice-T as the
brand-name artists), part on-line retailer, part e-zine, part
Internet radio station, part video-game arsenal. Founder and former
record company executive Al Teller describes the Web site as ``a
self-contained music universe''; others call it a ``music lifestyle
destination site,'' the on-line equivalent of ``the coolest
street'' in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As for Chuck D of Public Enemy, he sees the operation as the
great equalizer of the music business; the Internet, he says, will
free artists from the constraints of the oligopolistic recording
industry. A longtime industry critic, he walked out of his contract
with Def Jam Records before signing with Atomic Pop. ``If you ask
me what I'm doing, I'm at a loss for words,'' he says during an
interview in a nearly empty room that serves as Atomic Pop's
makeshift studio. ``I'm playing football on the baseball field. I'm
tackling the center fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   A poster in the studio shows a comic book hero wearing gloves
and goggles and holding a freshly minted CD that looks radioactive.
``Few Rules. No Limits,'' it says. If there is a mantra for this
revolution, that's it.
</P>
<P>
   And the rules of the recording industry are changing radically.
Until recently, the major record labels _ Sony, Warner, BMG, EMI,
and Universal _ failed to recognize that technology would
dramatically alter their industry, spurring the biggest change
since vinyl evolved to the CD. Top executives, caught up in the
daily grind, ``had their heads in the sand,'' Teller says.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed with an innovation called MP3, a format that
enables consumers to download and listen to near-CD-quality
recordings on their home computers. Any artist, be it a garage
rocker or an icon like David Bowie, can distribute music on line,
bypassing radio stations and record stores and communicating
directly with fans. The format is wildly popular on college
campuses, and it's spreading to the general public.  &UR; Today &LR; ,
``MP3'' is one of the most frequently requested terms on Internet
search engines, second only to the word ``sex.'' Now, that's
revolutionary. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Anti-piracy action &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America came to grips with
the phenomenon late last year. Alarmed by the potential for music
piracy, it announced plans to develop security standards for
downloadable music; those standards were unveiled this month. In
the meantime, new companies outside the traditional music business
seem to be launching every day, eager to become the definitive
source for on-line music. And Atomic Pop is forging ahead before
the standards are fully adopted, even though Teller supports the
association's initiative. ``We're not going to wait,'' he says.
``If we're going to strike out, I'd rather do it swinging than with
the bat never leaving my shoulder.'' He'll be aiming for the end
zone, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Teller may be positioning himself as an outsider, but he isn't
some high-tech wizard invading the entrenched music business.
Former president of CBS Records and head of MCA Music Group, he has
been a part of the industry he's now trying to redefine. Back in
1993, he wrote an editorial in Billboard urging his colleagues to
support on-line distribution and warning them to adapt to new
technology or risk extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The industry didn't listen. Now upstarts like emusic.com and
MP3.com are challenging the status quo, offering downloadable music
by unsigned artists. Granted, most of the MP3 music out there
belongs in the digital garage. ``That's being polite,'' Teller says
of that estimation. ``You hit a lot of rocks before you get a
nugget. Don't get me wrong: I think every artist should have the
right to be exposed regardless of how little talent they have. If
an artist gets exposure, that's terrific. I just think the average
consumer appreciates some guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop aims to provide that guidance on its Web site. The
business plan involves combining an aggressive Internet presence
with traditional off-line artist development. ``Downloading a song
isn't a marketing plan; it's not a career,'' says Teller.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Enemy album, for example, was released on line for
two months before debuting in retail stores last week. Atomic Pop
also offered a downloadable single for free, which is hardly a
first; artists like the Beastie Boys and Bowie have all used the
Net as a promotional tool. The difference here is the artist
contract. Public Enemy, not Atomic Pop, owns the masters to its
music, and the rap group is also receiving bigger royalties than it
would get from a major label. ``It's like night and day on two
different planets,'' Chuck D says of his contract. ``Def Jam was
nighttime on Mars, and this is daytime on Aruba.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D is the self-appointed prophet of the digital age, and
his contract with Atomic Pop increases the fledgling company's
credibility. He talked to a dozen on-line companies but chose
Atomic Pop because it ``has the perfect blend of Music 101 savvy
and technology and vision.'' That formula will bring artists closer
to their fans and break down barriers in the insular entertainment
business, the rapper argues. ``By 2002, I see a million artists and
5,000 record labels,'' he says.

THE LIFE OF THE GREATEST TV WRITER WHO EVER LIVED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DENNIS POTTER 
A Biography 
By Humphrey Carpenter. St. Martin's Press. 672 pp. Illustrated.
$40. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phillip Marlow is lying between sheets in a hospital bed in the
first episode of Dennis Potter's television masterpiece, ``The
Singing Detective.'' A pulp novelist, named for another pulp
novelist, Marlow suffers from psoriasis so crippling that every
part of his body pulsates with unendurable agony. He escapes in his
imagination, but that isn't enough. Excruciating as it is, his pain
keeps him alert enough to fend off the cliches and homilies that
attack him daily in his antiseptic quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All solutions and no clues. That's what the dumb-heads want,''
says Marlow. ``I'd rather it was the other way around. All clues.
No solutions. That's the way things are.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely the artistry of Humphrey Carpenter's
definitive biography of Dennis Potter, a Briton and the greatest
television writer who ever lived, a man who believed in the medium
and despised those who abuse it daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been writing for television for almost 13 years,''
Potter said in a paper delivered before the 1977 Edinburgh
Television Festival, ``and my experiences lead me to suggest that
if one were pressed to define the purpose of the great bulk of
television, and television drama, then one would be forced to
answer: its purpose is to pass the time, and in doing so to make
sure the viewer . . . is not sufficiently bored or offended or
puzzled to opt for the alternative yet strictly similar way of
passing the time offered by each of the other channels.'' He's
right, of course. But, once in a great while, television surprises
us. And one of the medium's biggest surprises was Dennis Potter.
</P>
<P>
   His two finest miniseries _ ``Pennies from Heaven'' (1976) with
Bob Hoskins and Cheryl Campbell, and ``The Singing Detective''
(1986) with Michael Gambon _ redefined a medium that had become as
fat and slothful as Oblomov. Through lip-synched music of the
1930s, Potter mixed pop songs, religious conviction, sexual
openness, and personal tragedy in ``Pennies from Heaven.'' Using a
similar technique, he drove deep into the bedridden, pain-ridden
ravings of a detective novelist named Marlow in ``The Singing
Detective.'' Both series pushed the medium to its limits.
</P>
<P>
   In Carpenter's justifiably long and detailed biography, Potter
is dragged from behind the curtain to center stage. What emerges is
a life filled with pain, tragedy, and doom, made palatable by
intelligence and humor and art. Carpenter, whose previous
biographies include examinations of Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden, C. S.
Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Benjamin Britten, is impressed with
Potter's accomplishments. But he's no sycophant. This biography is
authorized but it's not a fan's notes.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who never met Potter, seems an ideal biographer. His
diligent curiosity, combined with a scholar's toughness and an
artist's sensitivity, creates a complex portrait of a difficult
man. He is able to distinguish between the public moments when
Potter said things for effect and those private times, when, like
his Marlow, he was overtaken by self-loathing and grief.
Carpenter's great accomplishment is that he never allows his
respect for Potter's work to cloud his vision of the writer's more
distasteful character traits.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fair amount of sensationalism here (and also hundreds
of footnotes, a definitive bibliography, and a useful index). There
are documented stories of Potter's visits with prostitutes, though
they're not in the least titillating. These encounters can be
viewed as excursions into his complicated, obsessive relationships
with women.
</P>
<P>
   Potter had moments of mysogony and misanthropy, kindness and
compassion, egomania and insecurity. He was cynical and ascerbic.
In short, he displayed the mercurial contradictions that are found
in many of his characters.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cold Lazarus,'' a semi-autobiographical piece about a dying
writer, the protagonist, Daniel Feeld, utters these last words:
``No biography.'' Carpenter is respectful enough of his subject to
lead his prologue with this quotation. Carpenter even uncovered
this revealing quote from Potter's review of Michael Holroyd's
biography of Lytton Strachey in The Times of London _ ``Biography
is the most brutish of all the arts. It shifts about uncomfortably
in the strangely uncertain middle ground between deliberate
assassination and helpless boot-licking _ two activities which are
in themselves frequently interchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Carpenter falls into neither camp. He and Potter
share a clear-eyed, unsentimental respect for the truth. If that
truth involves grotesque humiliations in the form of barium enemas
for Marlow's singing detective, or the disembodied head of a writer
in ``Cold Lazarus,'' so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter traces Potter's sense of isolation to his childhood,
growing up shy and frightened in Forest of Dean in the late 1930s
and early '40s. Sexually abused by an uncle when he was 10, Potter
transformed the episode into art. He recalls the soothing effects
of the pop music of the time as the dreamy tunes allowed the child
to momentarily escape from the deep psychological and physical pain
that marked his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Dennis Potter, his fingers crippled and his skin scaly
from psoriatic arthropathy, sat in a black chair in a BBC studio.
Facing death, a bottle of liquid morphine by his side, the
cancer-riddled Potter agreed to discuss his work with interviewer
Melvyn Bragg, knowing full well that his life had dwindled to a
matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost a relief to find out that it can't be treated,''
Potter tells Bragg, referring to his rampant tumors, just a few
weeks before the tumors won. ``In a perverse sort of way I'm almost
serene. Life can only be defined in the present tense.'' In Dennis
Potter's work, and in Humphrey Carpenter's fine biography, the
present tense becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Many biographers don't allow their subjects' personalities any
breathing room. While Carpenter's style can be a bit too dry at
times, he does allow Potter his irascible complexity. This Potter
isn't someone you might sidle up to at a bar for a pint. He's a
self-centered, self-righteous character who berated many of his
directors when they requested changes and got on his high horse
when he was challenged. Still he created works of scintillating
majesty for a medium not accustomed to such rich offerings.

MEDIA'S EXCESSIVE COVERAGE OF KENNEDY DEATH CHEAPENED STORY
</HEADLINE>
 
(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``e'' entertainment
category) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a legitimate story: Famous person, scion of one of
America's best-known families, disappears while flying a small
plane with his wife and sister-in-law on board. They're missing,
but rescuers hold out hope that he might be alive. Then he's
presumed dead, and days later, those fears are confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But the legitimacy seemed to all but disappear in media coverage
of the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette, replaced by hero worship,
myth-making, and self-indulgence. Highly paid, well-trained
journalists were talking about a curse and calling Kennedy a
prince.
</P>
<P>
   ABC news anchor Connie Chung asked the Rev. Billy Graham, ``Do
you think that John Kennedy Jr. is in heaven with his father right
now?'' and Graham had to gracefully decline to speculate on
something only God could know. ``Women's Wear Daily'' lamented
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's death as ``the loss of an American
princess.''
</P>
<P>
   One syndicated newsmagazine aired Lauren Bessette's ``last
words'' _ an answering-machine message.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of excess came on Saturday morning, when ABC had
scheduled coverage of the British Open golf tournament. Instead, a
news anchor was reporting that an important person's plane had
disappeared. It took a few moments to determine that the person was
Kennedy and that he was accompanied by the Bessette sisters. This
was news and was worthy of breaking into regular programming with a
special report. Other networks did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, this would've merited a few minutes of
coverage, followed by a return to regularly scheduled programming,
with additional reports as warranted. But in this age of 24-hour
news and obsession with celebrities, it called for every aspect of
Kennedy's life to be rehashed.
</P>
<P>
   You can't entirely blame the TV networks for sticking with this
story; last weekend's Nielsen ratings showed an unusual jump in
midsummer viewership, attributable to coverage of the Kennedy
tragedy, and that was before it was confirmed that he and his
passengers were dead. But 24-hour coverage means that there are a
lot of holes to fill, and some of the coverage bordered on the
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters weren't alone. Newspapers and magazines tripped
over themselves analyzing the ``Kennedy curse''; ``U.S. News and
World Report'' discarded 2 million copies of last week's edition to
do a cover story on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington Post,'' in a dual-byline story, ruminated on
how the crash might not have happened had Kennedy simply waited a
couple of days to have a cast removed from a broken ankle. If he
had left the cast on, the story speculated, he would have been
forced to enlist the services of a more experienced co-pilot,
better-suited to navigate in the murky conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The online magazine ``Slate,'' in a story critical of ``curse''
reporting, provided an example of just how far the media had gone,
citing a ``Jerusalem Post'' report about how the Kennedys
``undoubtedly'' bear a risk-taking gene that led them to take
chances. ``Slate'' also referred to a piece in the Roman
publication ``La Repubblica'' speculating that Kennedy crashed his
plane because he knew in his heart that he wasn't a Kennedy, and
that violent death would make him one.
</P>
<P>
   Fate was a theme echoed often during the coverage. Reporters
couldn't help linking Kennedy's watery death to his Uncle Ted's
infamous auto accident at Chappaquiddick, especially because it
happened almost exactly 30 years ago to the day.
</P>
<P>
   One report speculated about how America's fate might have
changed had Robert Kennedy not been assassinated and been elected
president in 1968. The report said that fewer U.S. troops would
have died in Vietnam and Democrats would have dominated the White
House. In addition to the quantum leap made by such reporting, what
did the death of Robert Kennedy have to do John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
death?
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy women weren't immune from the hype, even when they
tried to be. Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, John Jr.'s sister, was
the subject of dozens of stories about how she valued her privacy.
Days after the crash, The Associated Press moved a story with the
headline, ``Caroline Kennedy takes bike ride as divers report
finding brother's body.''
</P>
<P>
   It included this line: ``She did not speak. (She and her
husband) returned about 25 minutes later.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   What were we supposed to learn from this? ``The Kansas City
Star'' reported about how well the Kennedy women have managed,
citing the success of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (Maryland's
lieutenant governor) and documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy. It
included this illuminating quote from Laurence Leamer, author of
``The Kennedy Women'': ``What impresses me is that they make their
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy gave celebrities and journalists an opportunity to
be self-indulgent. One could probably forgive NBC's Maria Shriver
for being interviewed _ she was Kennedy's cousin, after all _ and
could probably even forgive ABC's Diane Sawyer for being so shaken
that she requested time off from ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   But on CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' Mike Wallace interviewed CNN
correspondent (and ``60 Minutes'' contributor) Christiane Amanpour
because she and Kennedy had been friends since they went to nearby
schools in Rhode Island. And ``Entertainment Tonight'' interviewed
singer-actress Brandy about Kennedy's death, because she had
appeared with him on ``The Tonight Show'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists also pursued anyone with a Kennedy connection, no
matter how far a stretch. ``The New York Times'' interviewed people
in Kennedy's neighborhood, including a deli owner who disclosed
that Kennedy ate breakfast there (hot oatmeal and a latte) at least
once a week, and sometimes came back for a spaghetti dinner. One TV
report featured a woman whose husband's plane had crashed in the
same area as Kennedy's decades ago. ``Dateline NBC'' interviewed
Caroline Kennedy's third-grade catechism teacher.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there were the aviation experts, who discussed
the danger of flying small planes in poor visibility, which is
something most viewers already knew.
</P>
<P>
   There was the woman on CNN who had written an unofficial
biography of Kennedy and said that he died because he was a kind
and chivalrous man, and that he flew in the bad weather in an
attempt to keep a promise to Lauren Bessette that he would return
her to Martha's Vineyard that night. Nobody ever verified that this
was the reason Kennedy made the trip at night, but it was food for
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Network demand for ``authorities'' to speak on camera was so
intense that most volunteers spoke on every network. Carl Sferraza
Anthony and Douglas Brinkley, contributors to Kennedy's magazine
``George,'' covered the morning-show circuit. (Brinkley was dropped
from ``George's'' masthead after signing an exclusivity deal with
NBC.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 24-hour approach to covering this story was
self-defeating. In an attempt to pay tribute to a man who, in
truth, was famous largely due to his last name and his family's
history, the media cheapened the story with endless reporting that
made it look as if it were milking the story. Had there been some
restraint, some attempt to report only what was worthy of
reporting, the story would have felt less tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best sign of desperation came from a CNN booker, who
reportedly begged a ``Washington Post'' reporter who once spoke to
Kennedy to go on the air. ``You have no idea how difficult it is to
fill 72 hours of live coverage,'' the ``San Francisco Chronicle''
quoted the booker as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now we do.

IMMIGRANTS SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ABROAD TO SUPPORT FAMILIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rafael leads a Spartan lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican national, who works as a roofer, says he doesn't
spend money on beer or weekend amusements in Fort Worth, Texas.
Instead, he follows a strict routine: Every payday, he wires money
to his wife in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his financial discipline tallied $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am making these savings because my goal is to return,'' said
Rafael, who came to the United States illegally to find work. ``The
goal depends on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of immigrants from Latin America, documented and
undocumented, appear to share Rafael's discipline. Economists say
they send billions of dollars to their homelands each year from
work performed in the United States, leaving a financial imprint on
both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The modest $50, $100 and $300 wire transactions form a valuable
source of income to struggling economies in El Salvador, Guatemala
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Mexico receive about $4 billion to $6 billion a
year from workers in the United States, up from about $2.5 billion
in 1990. The money primarily is used to feed, clothe and house
families, but sometimes it finances ambitious projects in rural
towns, such as roads and waterlines.
</P>
<P>
   In El Salvador, where coffee, cotton and sugar were once the
leading exports, Salvadorans working in the United States are now
the source of more money _ $665.3 million in the first six months
of this year, according to the nation's central bank. In 1990,
remittances were $322 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Salvadorans stopped sending money back home, we would have
a crisis in Central America,'' said Luis Plascencia, associate
director of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the increasing stream of cash crossing the
border leaves less money available for investments in immigrant
communities, according to a recent Rivera Policy Institute report.
``As is true when U.S. corporations invest or relocate offshore,
this negatively affects local economies even as it benefits the
national economy,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. immigration policy say the cash flow also makes
the receiving countries dependent on an unpredictable source of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the business of U.S. immigration to install an
underground economy for a foreign nation,'' said John Keeley,
spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform based
in Washington, D.C. ``What these countries need desperately is not
the continual flight of their young and able bodies. These
economies are never going to grow or stabilize when you have this
type of out-flight.''
</P>
<P>
   But some immigrant workers say their sweat is helping to build
economies in the United States and in their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to help our community here and there,'' said
Francisco Javier Narvaez of Dallas, who came from Mexico as an
undocumented worker and now has a ``green card'' that gives him
permission to live and work in the United States. ``Only the love I
have for my homeland keeps me doing this. I remember the situation
I lived in, and I don't want my family to suffer the same.''
</P>
<P>
   To save money from paychecks so they can send it home, workers
often share crowded apartments or houses with relatives or other
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   To share the rent, Alejandro, 37, an undocumented immigrant from
Santo Tomas, Mexico, lived with five men in Fort Worth earlier this
year. He cleaned floors at a grocery store at night and took
English classes. ``I want to go home,'' he said. ``The plan is to
return to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Navarrete, president of the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber,
said immigrants contribute to their communities, even as they send
money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrant-based groups work to help one another with needs
such as funeral costs and creating community centers. Workers such
as Rafael also fill labor shortages in North Texas, helping to keep
the regional economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the nature of their work, they are leaving long-term
assets,'' Navarrete said. ``There's no such thing as a free lunch.
The money that is being forwarded has been earned for either
providing a service or product.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, Navarrete said, U.S. immigrants from around
the world have used some of their money to ease the economic burden
of families back home. Some have become American legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the greatest fortunes in this country have been
created by immigrants who were doing the same thing a hundred years
ago,'' he said. ``You never know who will become the new Andrew
Carnegie or the next Rockefellers.''

WAR'S TOLL ON KOSOVAR MEN ALTERS WIDOWS' ROLE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADASH, Yugoslavia _ When a mortar shell felled Adem Hoti in
the mountains of Kosovo, his family didn't just lose a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Hoti, typical for a Kosovar head of household, had been the sole
support for an extended family of 15.
</P>
<P>
   While Hoti had worked, the women of the family, keeping with
Muslim ethnic Albanian tradition in rural areas, stayed inside the
house and yard _ literally shielded from the world by a high stucco
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hoti's widow, Bedrite, huddles with her in-laws, her
children, and her siblings, wondering how the family will survive
without its breadwinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for us widows,'' said Bedrite Hoti, 29,
wiping away tears. ``We don't know what to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo villages, the role of women is restricted, sometimes
severely so. The wall around ethnic Albanian houses is a tradition,
meant to keep outsiders from being tempted by the family's female
members, themselves clad modestly in long skirts, sweaters, and
kerchiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian women in the cities lead a more Western way of
life, working in shops and dressing in modern fashions. But in the
villages, the society is clannish and indisputably dominated by
males.
</P>
<P>
   Women do not work outside the home, or for money. In some
extremely traditional families, the women are not allowed to speak
to outsiders: The men of the family speak for them, and make all
family decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Some women are virtually imprisoned in one section of the house,
preparing food for the extended family and doing household chores
while the men venture into the outside world. Families of 14 or
more children are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman typically moves in with her new husband's family,
and does not remarry if her husband dies young. In some cases, the
deceased man's brother will take on the responsibility of caring
for his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   But what is there to do, Kosovo's widows wonder, when so very
many men have died?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the women are saying is, how are we going to survive
without our husbands?'' said Rona Blackhood of the Irish aid group
Concern.
</P>
<P>
   Blackhood, who has been working with women who are war survivors
in Kosovo, said the death of so many heads of households has
overwhelmed some villages. In Ljubenic, a Western Kosovo village
that international investigators believe holds the biggest mass
grave of the conflict, with 350 corpses, about three-fourths of
families lost their primary wage earner, Blackhood said.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the war is still unknown, but early
estimates put the minimum number at 10,000 _ and because men,
especially fighting-age men, were the primary targets, the war left
a lot of women without husbands and brothers to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval is so dramatic that aid workers and sociologists
say it's possible that the war will force a change in the role of
women in Kosovo, much as World War II changed the roles of women in
America. Women were needed to work in factories during World War
II, ushering in a new era of women working outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Hoti family, a young woman in the clan has
already decided to take the unusual step of being a primary wage
earner.
</P>
<P>
   But Ganimete Hoti's offer is not without an extraordinary
sacrifice: just 24 years old, Ganimete told her sister-in-law that
she would never marry, instead finding work as a secretary or
chambermaid in the provincial capital of Pristina to provide for
her dead brother's family.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is a remarkable one; not only is it almost unheard of
for a village woman to hold an outside job, but Ganimete's own
future is also imperiled. In rural villages, a woman's social
status and place in the community are determined by whom she
marries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for me,'' said the young woman's mother,
60-year-old Shefkije Hoti. ``She has to do this, only to feed us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her _ she doesn't have to take away her whole life,''
Bedrite Hoti said. ``I can take care of my children,'' she said,
though she added she was not prepared to take on a job. ``It was a
difficult decision, but I don't know what else we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pull of the Muslim village tradition is powerful, and
may even become more so as homeless, traumatized Kosovars look for
an enduring institution to give them strength, said Migela
Nikolchina, head of the gender studies department at Budapest's
Central European University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be so courageous in predicting a future'' change
for woman, she said. ``What I see is a great resilience of
traditional mores. I can't predict optimistic results,'' Nikolchina
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, Kosovo never had a women's movement,
she added. The communists gave lip service to the idea of gender
equality, but because the impetus did not come from the women
themselves, the concept did not stick, Nikolchina added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could help'' open opportunities for women ``if they are
forced to work now,'' Nikolchina said. ``But it will take a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ethnic Albanian families have transferred the role of
family head to the oldest male _ even if he is only a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Jashar Hoti, 18, a distant relative of the Hoti clan, has
suddenly found himself responsible for a struggling family farm.
``It's very hard when your father dies,'' he said. ``I'm the head
of the family now, and I'm too young.''

FORT WORTH, Texas: next Rockefellers.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Juan, 26, an undocumented worker who puts in long days at a Fort
Worth distribution center and lives humbly, has sent home about
$7,000 since he came to the United States nine months ago. He said
he plans to start a special events company in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make money. I am ambitious,'' said Juan, who left
Mexico before he could finish a degree in business administration.
``I want to be independent from my family, start a business and
finish school.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Alvarez, a Salvadoran immigrant who left his homeland in
1983, said he has sent money home to his family for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You help however you can,'' said Alvarez, who is now a legal
U.S. resident who makes $500 a week waiting tables in Dallas. ``If
I hadn't come to this country, my mother would have already died.
The conditions were very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he sends money home, he has saved enough to buy a bus
and a house in El Salvador. Alvarez, one of 80,000 to 100,000
Salvadorans who live in the Fort Worth-Dallas Metroplex, hopes to
save enough to start a bus company in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   It's relatively easy for immigrants, documented and
undocumented, to send money home. Often, they use the U.S. Postal
Service or money transfer companies. Those who are wary of wiring
money may use van lines to transport money packets, or they rely on
friends who promise to deliver cash in person.
</P>
<P>
   Juan, who said he hopes to save $20,000, has sent money home by
mail and money order and through wire transfer services such as
Tex-Mex Transfers and Western Union. Sending U.S. dollars to an
account in Mexico through a bank has proved most effective, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I lost a package with a $450 money order and clothes,''
he said. ``It was a strange case. I got a copy of the money order,
which was cashed in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the total amount of cash sent from the United
States by immigrants because most transactions are undocumented.
But researchers say the amount of cash flowing to five Latin
American countries has increased dramatically the past two decades
as immigration, legal and illegal, has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   The amount more than quintupled, from $700 million in 1980 to $4
billion in 1990, according to Rivera Policy Institute research.
Remittances to Colombia, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and
Guatemala were less than $100 million in 1980. A decade later,
those countries were receiving more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has accelerated in recent years as new waves of
immigrants come to this country. After Hurricane Mitch, thousands
of Hondurans left Central America to find work here so they could
send money home.
</P>
<P>
   When one family member, usually the father, comes to the United
States, the U.S. money often provides the primary source of income
for relatives left behind.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case for 27-year-old Guadalupe. Her husband sent $300
each month to Mexico to help pay for meat, vegetables, milk and
other household needs for their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enough for everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Guadalupe slipped across the border and joined her
husband in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there, I was alone,'' she said. ``We only talked every
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   After couples and their children come to the United States, some
families send money home to help parents or other relatives who
remain in the old country.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ortiz Solis and his wife, Maria, of Ocampo, Mexico, have 15
children, eight of whom live in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.
The couple, who are retired farmers, live off the income sent home
by their children in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids work too much up there (in Dallas) ... and they're too
far away, but I suppose they're better off there than here,'' said
Maria Alvarado Ortiz, 72.
</P>
<P>
   One son, Tereso Ortiz, who works in a pipe manufacturing
company, has become a U.S. citizen. The remaining siblings in the
United States are working legally.
</P>
<P>
   Ocampo residents get $10 million to $40 million a year from
workers in the United States, making the workers the largest source
of income in the agricultural area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town was transformed because of the money we send from
here,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people sending money to Ocampo work in Fort
Worth-Dallas, anthropologist Ian Mast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conceptualize this town as a suburb of Dallas,'' said Mast,
a Ph.D. student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and a
Fulbright scholar who has been researching immigration patterns in
Ocampo for six months. ``The only difference is that people can't
come back home every evening, because it's too far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Family necessity is not the only reason that some immigrants
send money to their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Groups are sometimes formed to take on more ambitious projects
aimed at improving the quality of life for communities. At that
level, immigrants are pivotal in rebuilding their hometowns by
cleaning up a panteon, or cemetery, or by funding construction of
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants in North Texas with ties to Palomas in the Mexican
state of San Luis Potosi want to build a 1.9-mile road and buy an
ambulance for the community.
</P>
<P>
   The group already has helped bring waterlines to the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's living again,'' Narvaez said. ``Water is life.''

MEDIA'S EXCESSIVE COVERAGE OF KENNEDY DEATH CHEAPENED STORY
</HEADLINE>
 
(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``k'' commentary
category) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a legitimate story: Famous person, scion of one of
America's best-known families, disappears while flying a small
plane with his wife and sister-in-law on board. They're missing,
but rescuers hold out hope that he might be alive. Then he's
presumed dead, and days later, those fears are confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But the legitimacy seemed to all but disappear in media coverage
of the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette, replaced by hero worship,
myth-making, and self-indulgence. Highly paid, well-trained
journalists were talking about a curse and calling Kennedy a
prince.
</P>
<P>
   ABC news anchor Connie Chung asked the Rev. Billy Graham, ``Do
you think that John Kennedy Jr. is in heaven with his father right
now?'' and Graham had to gracefully decline to speculate on
something only God could know. ``Women's Wear Daily'' lamented
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's death as ``the loss of an American
princess.''
</P>
<P>
   One syndicated newsmagazine aired Lauren Bessette's ``last
words'' _ an answering-machine message.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of excess came on Saturday morning, when ABC had
scheduled coverage of the British Open golf tournament. Instead, a
news anchor was reporting that an important person's plane had
disappeared. It took a few moments to determine that the person was
Kennedy and that he was accompanied by the Bessette sisters. This
was news and was worthy of breaking into regular programming with a
special report. Other networks did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, this would've merited a few minutes of
coverage, followed by a return to regularly scheduled programming,
with additional reports as warranted. But in this age of 24-hour
news and obsession with celebrities, it called for every aspect of
Kennedy's life to be rehashed.
</P>
<P>
   You can't entirely blame the TV networks for sticking with this
story; last weekend's Nielsen ratings showed an unusual jump in
midsummer viewership, attributable to coverage of the Kennedy
tragedy, and that was before it was confirmed that he and his
passengers were dead. But 24-hour coverage means that there are a
lot of holes to fill, and some of the coverage bordered on the
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters weren't alone. Newspapers and magazines tripped
over themselves analyzing the ``Kennedy curse''; ``U.S. News and
World Report'' discarded 2 million copies of last week's edition to
do a cover story on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington Post,'' in a dual-byline story, ruminated on
how the crash might not have happened had Kennedy simply waited a
couple of days to have a cast removed from a broken ankle. If he
had left the cast on, the story speculated, he would have been
forced to enlist the services of a more experienced co-pilot,
better-suited to navigate in the murky conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The online magazine ``Slate,'' in a story critical of ``curse''
reporting, provided an example of just how far the media had gone,
citing a ``Jerusalem Post'' report about how the Kennedys
``undoubtedly'' bear a risk-taking gene that led them to take
chances. ``Slate'' also referred to a piece in the Roman
publication ``La Repubblica'' speculating that Kennedy crashed his
plane because he knew in his heart that he wasn't a Kennedy, and
that violent death would make him one.
</P>
<P>
   Fate was a theme echoed often during the coverage. Reporters
couldn't help linking Kennedy's watery death to his Uncle Ted's
infamous auto accident at Chappaquiddick, especially because it
happened almost exactly 30 years ago to the day.
</P>
<P>
   One report speculated about how America's fate might have
changed had Robert Kennedy not been assassinated and been elected
president in 1968. The report said that fewer U.S. troops would
have died in Vietnam and Democrats would have dominated the White
House. In addition to the quantum leap made by such reporting, what
did the death of Robert Kennedy have to do John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
death?
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy women weren't immune from the hype, even when they
tried to be. Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, John Jr.'s sister, was
the subject of dozens of stories about how she valued her privacy.
Days after the crash, The Associated Press moved a story with the
headline, ``Caroline Kennedy takes bike ride as divers report
finding brother's body.''
</P>
<P>
   It included this line: ``She did not speak. (She and her
husband) returned about 25 minutes later.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   What were we supposed to learn from this? ``The Kansas City
Star'' reported about how well the Kennedy women have managed,
citing the success of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend (Maryland's
lieutenant governor) and documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy. It
included this illuminating quote from Laurence Leamer, author of
``The Kennedy Women'': ``What impresses me is that they make their
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy gave celebrities and journalists an opportunity to
be self-indulgent. One could probably forgive NBC's Maria Shriver
for being interviewed _ she was Kennedy's cousin, after all _ and
could probably even forgive ABC's Diane Sawyer for being so shaken
that she requested time off from ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   But on CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' Mike Wallace interviewed CNN
correspondent (and ``60 Minutes'' contributor) Christiane Amanpour
because she and Kennedy had been friends since they went to nearby
schools in Rhode Island. And ``Entertainment Tonight'' interviewed
singer-actress Brandy about Kennedy's death, because she had
appeared with him on ``The Tonight Show'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists also pursued anyone with a Kennedy connection, no
matter how far a stretch. ``The New York Times'' interviewed people
in Kennedy's neighborhood, including a deli owner who disclosed
that Kennedy ate breakfast there (hot oatmeal and a latte) at least
once a week, and sometimes came back for a spaghetti dinner. One TV
report featured a woman whose husband's plane had crashed in the
same area as Kennedy's decades ago. ``Dateline NBC'' interviewed
Caroline Kennedy's third-grade catechism teacher.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there were the aviation experts, who discussed
the danger of flying small planes in poor visibility, which is
something most viewers already knew.
</P>
<P>
   There was the woman on CNN who had written an unofficial
biography of Kennedy and said that he died because he was a kind
and chivalrous man, and that he flew in the bad weather in an
attempt to keep a promise to Lauren Bessette that he would return
her to Martha's Vineyard that night. Nobody ever verified that this
was the reason Kennedy made the trip at night, but it was food for
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Network demand for ``authorities'' to speak on camera was so
intense that most volunteers spoke on every network. Carl Sferraza
Anthony and Douglas Brinkley, contributors to Kennedy's magazine
``George,'' covered the morning-show circuit. (Brinkley was dropped
from ``George's'' masthead after signing an exclusivity deal with
NBC.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 24-hour approach to covering this story was
self-defeating. In an attempt to pay tribute to a man who, in
truth, was famous largely due to his last name and his family's
history, the media cheapened the story with endless reporting that
made it look as if it were milking the story. Had there been some
restraint, some attempt to report only what was worthy of
reporting, the story would have felt less tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best sign of desperation came from a CNN booker, who
reportedly begged a ``Washington Post'' reporter who once spoke to
Kennedy to go on the air. ``You have no idea how difficult it is to
fill 72 hours of live coverage,'' the ``San Francisco Chronicle''
quoted the booker as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now we do.

FUND-RAISING IN THE UNITED STATES PAVES ROADS IN MEXICO

<P>
   Adrian Hernandez's work in the United States has literally paved
the way for the future of his small hometown in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that San Juan de Guadalupe was shrinking, Hernandez
led a fund-raising effort on both sides of the border to build a
road to the town.
</P>
<P>
   A grassroots network of volunteers from the Fort Worth-Dallas
Metroplex, San Antonio, Houston and Oklahoma and from Durango,
Torreon, Ciudad Juarez and Monterrey in Mexico amassed about
$250,000 in three years by selling tamales, gorditas and beverages
at youth baseball games, he said. They also had dances to collect
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with government money, the funds meant that a roadway
more than 50 miles long opened in July 1998. It is called El
Despertar, or ``The Awaken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we united was because our community was about to
disappear,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Family ties keep Hernandez, who once was an undocumented worker
and is now a legal U.S. resident, commuting between Dallas and San
Juan de Guadalupe. His wife and 10 children still live in the
Mexican town, where he has been sending money from the United
States since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   San Juan de Guadalupe is in north central Mexico, south of
Torreon. It is in Durango state near the Coahuila border. Since
1990, the town's population has declined to about 5,000 from about
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The only way into town was a dirt road, Hernandez said, and he
figured that better access could turn things around. After being
turned away by officials in Durango, Hernandez persuaded officials
in Coahuila to take on most of the project. But Hernandez said he
was told he would have to bring thousands of dollars to the table.
</P>
<P>
   When Coahuila finished a 43-mile stretch of the road, Hernandez
turned to the head of the government to get the remaining 8.7 miles
built in Durango. He asked Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo for
help.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to San Juan de Guadalupe is no longer a rough ride
through brush, and it now takes about two hours instead of eight to
drive there from Torreon. New merchants and fruit vendors have come
to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel happy and peaceful, because we did something no one
else wanted to do,'' Hernandez said. ``When we started the project,
the rich people in our town laughed at us. Today, they tell me they
respect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Adame Avala, a member of the town's citizen advisory group,
said the road is an example of how a community can unite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a first step,'' he said. ``We need to take more steps for
the town to advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, people are working to bring a manufacturing plant to town.
Adame said the town has land for the project but no investors.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he plans to return to San Juan de Guadalupe when
he retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my town,'' he said. ``When I'm old, I hope I can be in
my town.''

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS VIE WITH VARIED SPENDING TACTICS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain recently became one of the
biggest spenders _ and gamblers _ in the New Hampshire presidential
primary. While some Republicans are hoarding their cash or spending
it on next month's Iowa straw vote, he mailed 50,000 biographical
videos to New Hampshire residents.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, by contrast, has not done a single mass mailing
in New Hampshire or set up a telephone bank. And Lamar Alexander,
with only $90,000 cash on hand, has put most of his money in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   These contrasting strategies, revealed in spending reports and
interviews, provide a summer snapshot of how the Republican
presidential field is jockeying for position in a pack led by Texas
Governor George W. Bush. While it is difficult to judge the
long-term impact of these tactics, McCain's gamble seems to be
paying off in the short term, at least in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire poll released 10 days ago showed McCain in
second place with 13 percent of those surveyed, compared with
Bush's 47 percent. Notably, McCain has passed Steve Forbes, who has
spent $8.3 million in the state _ including $2.7 million on
advertisements _ but is only at 2 percent in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has been grinding it out, doing the right things,
mailing the videos and making the phone calls,'' said Dick Bennett
of the American Research Group in Manchester, N.H., which conducted
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's drop in the poll to 7 percent from 15 percent in June
might be due partly to her decision against sending out mass
mailings or setting up a phone bank. But a Dole spokesman said the
former American Red Cross president is wise to wait before spending
too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``One strategy is to spend early, peak early,'' Dole spokesman
Ari Fleischer said, referring to McCain. ``People are free to make
that mistake if they choose. But Elizabeth Dole's strategy is to
get a strong bounce off of Iowa and be poised to do well in New
Hampshire. It's better to have a crescendo timed to peak in
February than a staccato burst in the summer when no one is paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's beneath-the-radar tactic highlights a series of
strategic decisions facing all campaigns, such as whether to spend
early or late, and whether to focus more on the first-caucus state
of Iowa than the first-primary state of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Bush's dominance in the polls and in raising money,
three factors are driving the campaign at this stage:
</P>
<P>
   --The compressed primary schedule means the nomination could be
decided by early March, just weeks after the Iowa caucus and New
Hampshire primary, putting a premium on strong showings in the
early states.
</P>
<P>
   --The decision by Bush and Forbes to forgo matching federal
funds, and thus avoid spending limits, means they will have an
enormous financial advantage. The other candidates have to abide by
an overall spending cap of $33 million for the primaries, not
including certain fund-raising and legal expenses. Bush has already
raised $37 million and expects to have $60 million or more by early
next year, while Forbes has said he will spend whatever is needed
from his own funds.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush and Forbes also don't have to abide by federal limits on
how much a candidate can spend in each state during the primary
campaign. The limit is $1.3 million in Iowa and $660,000 in New
Hampshire. While there are plenty of loopholes for covering the
costs of postage, salaries, fund-raising, and other items, many
candidates are wary of spending money early for fear they will have
limited cash in the crucial last two weeks before a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state caps create an inequitable situation,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, which advocates an overhaul
of the campaign finance system. ``Those caps treat New Hampshire
and Iowa as small states when the primary process treats them as
national events, so they are not realistic if people are going to
spend months and months campaigning there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Forbes enjoy an abundance of campaign funds, they
have seemingly opposite strategies about how to spend the money.
Bush, riding a wave of publicity about his front-runner status,
spent only $38,000 on advertising during the first six months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, has shelled out $2.7 million for radio and
television advertising during that time, much of it in Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As for Forbes's showing of 2 percent in the New Hampshire poll,
the Forbes campaign said its internal surveys put him at 6 percent.
Moreover, Appel said, Forbes will be stronger in the coming months
because, unlike most other candidates, he will have enough money to
compete against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's strong lead has led to speculation that Forbes
would resort to repeating his 1996 tactic, unleashing a negative
advertising campaign against front-runner Bob Dole at the height of
the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign video explains the life of the former Vietnam
prisoner of war, telling how he was shot down and held captive for
more than five years. The video also has garnered some controversy
because the scene of a pilot parachuting to the ground is stock
Pentagon footage and is not McCain, as some viewers initially
believed.
</P>
<P>
   With the video costing $1.10 apiece to produce and mail, the
Arizona Republican spent more $50,000 on the New Hampshire effort.
But McCain's spending report shows he spent only $19,000 in New
Hampshire in the first six months of 1999. A McCain aide explained
that only the postage and some production costs qualified as New
Hampshire expenses, with the rest absorbed by other spending
categories. For example, McCain asked for a contribution with each
tape, which qualified the mailing as a fund-raising expense. That
means 50 percent of the cost of the mailing did not count toward
the New Hampshire cap.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview, said he decided to spend money earlier
than most candidates, because he needed to boost his name
identification.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also made a calculated decision against participating in
the Aug. 14 Iowa straw poll, where candidates such as Bush and
Forbes are spending heavily. McCain said he hasn't written off
Iowa, but he knows a poor showing in the straw poll would seriously
harm his campaign.

IMMIGRANTS SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ABROAD TO SUPPORT FAMILIES

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rafael leads a Spartan lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican national, who works as a roofer, says he doesn't
spend money on beer or weekend amusements in Fort Worth, Texas.
Instead, he follows a strict routine: Every payday, he wires money
to his wife in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his financial discipline tallied $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am making these savings because my goal is to return,'' said
Rafael, who came to the United States illegally to find work. ``The
goal depends on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of immigrants from Latin America, documented and
undocumented, appear to share Rafael's discipline. Economists say
they send billions of dollars to their homelands each year from
work performed in the United States, leaving a financial imprint on
both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The modest $50, $100 and $300 wire transactions form a valuable
source of income to struggling economies in El Salvador, Guatemala
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Mexico receive about $4 billion to $6 billion a
year from workers in the United States, up from about $2.5 billion
in 1990. The money primarily is used to feed, clothe and house
families, but sometimes it finances ambitious projects in rural
towns, such as roads and waterlines.
</P>
<P>
   In El Salvador, where coffee, cotton and sugar were once the
leading exports, Salvadorans working in the United States are now
the source of more money _ $665.3 million in the first six months
of this year, according to the nation's central bank. In 1990,
remittances were $322 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Salvadorans stopped sending money back home, we would have
a crisis in Central America,'' said Luis Plascencia, associate
director of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the increasing stream of cash crossing the
border leaves less money available for investments in immigrant
communities, according to a recent Rivera Policy Institute report.
``As is true when U.S. corporations invest or relocate offshore,
this negatively affects local economies even as it benefits the
national economy,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. immigration policy say the cash flow also makes
the receiving countries dependent on an unpredictable source of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the business of U.S. immigration to install an
underground economy for a foreign nation,'' said John Keeley,
spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform based
in Washington, D.C. ``What these countries need desperately is not
the continual flight of their young and able bodies. These
economies are never going to grow or stabilize when you have this
type of out-flight.''
</P>
<P>
   But some immigrant workers say their sweat is helping to build
economies in the United States and in their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to help our community here and there,'' said
Francisco Javier Narvaez of Dallas, who came from Mexico as an
undocumented worker and now has a ``green card'' that gives him
permission to live and work in the United States. ``Only the love I
have for my homeland keeps me doing this. I remember the situation
I lived in, and I don't want my family to suffer the same.''
</P>
<P>
   To save money from paychecks so they can send it home, workers
often share crowded apartments or houses with relatives or other
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   To share the rent, Alejandro, 37, an undocumented immigrant from
Santo Tomas, Mexico, lived with five men in Fort Worth earlier this
year. He cleaned floors at a grocery store at night and took
English classes. ``I want to go home,'' he said. ``The plan is to
return to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Navarrete, president of the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber,
said immigrants contribute to their communities, even as they send
money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrant-based groups work to help one another with needs
such as funeral costs and creating community centers. Workers such
as Rafael also fill labor shortages in North Texas, helping to keep
the regional economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the nature of their work, they are leaving long-term
assets,'' Navarrete said. ``There's no such thing as a free lunch.
The money that is being forwarded has been earned for either
providing a service or product.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, Navarrete said, U.S. immigrants from around
the world have used some of their money to ease the economic burden
of families back home. Some have become American legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the greatest fortunes in this country have been
created by immigrants who were doing the same thing a hundred years
ago,'' he said. ``You never know who will become the new Andrew
Carnegie or the next Rockefellers.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Juan, 26, an undocumented worker who puts in long days at a Fort
Worth distribution center and lives humbly, has sent home about
$7,000 since he came to the United States nine months ago. He said
he plans to start a special events company in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make money. I am ambitious,'' said Juan, who left
Mexico before he could finish a degree in business administration.
``I want to be independent from my family, start a business and
finish school.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Alvarez, a Salvadoran immigrant who left his homeland in
1983, said he has sent money home to his family for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You help however you can,'' said Alvarez, who is now a legal
U.S. resident who makes $500 a week waiting tables in Dallas. ``If
I hadn't come to this country, my mother would have already died.
The conditions were very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he sends money home, he has saved enough to buy a bus
and a house in El Salvador. Alvarez, one of 80,000 to 100,000
Salvadorans who live in the Fort Worth-Dallas Metroplex, hopes to
save enough to start a bus company in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   It's relatively easy for immigrants, documented and
undocumented, to send money home. Often, they use the U.S. Postal
Service or money transfer companies. Those who are wary of wiring
money may use van lines to transport money packets, or they rely on
friends who promise to deliver cash in person.
</P>
<P>
   Juan, who said he hopes to save $20,000, has sent money home by
mail and money order and through wire transfer services such as
Tex-Mex Transfers and Western Union. Sending U.S. dollars to an
account in Mexico through a bank has proved most effective, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I lost a package with a $450 money order and clothes,''
he said. ``It was a strange case. I got a copy of the money order,
which was cashed in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the total amount of cash sent from the United
States by immigrants because most transactions are undocumented.
But researchers say the amount of cash flowing to five Latin
American countries has increased dramatically the past two decades
as immigration, legal and illegal, has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   The amount more than quintupled, from $700 million in 1980 to $4
billion in 1990, according to Rivera Policy Institute research.
Remittances to Colombia, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and
Guatemala were less than $100 million in 1980. A decade later,
those countries were receiving more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has accelerated in recent years as new waves of
immigrants come to this country. After Hurricane Mitch, thousands
of Hondurans left Central America to find work here so they could
send money home.
</P>
<P>
   When one family member, usually the father, comes to the United
States, the U.S. money often provides the primary source of income
for relatives left behind.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case for 27-year-old Guadalupe. Her husband sent $300
each month to Mexico to help pay for meat, vegetables, milk and
other household needs for their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had enough for everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Guadalupe slipped across the border and joined her
husband in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there, I was alone,'' she said. ``We only talked every
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   After couples and their children come to the United States, some
families send money home to help parents or other relatives who
remain in the old country.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ortiz Solis and his wife, Maria, of Ocampo, Mexico, have 15
children, eight of whom live in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.
The couple, who are retired farmers, live off the income sent home
by their children in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids work too much up there (in Dallas) ... and they're too
far away, but I suppose they're better off there than here,'' said
Maria Alvarado Ortiz, 72.
</P>
<P>
   One son, Tereso Ortiz, who works in a pipe manufacturing
company, has become a U.S. citizen. The remaining siblings in the
United States are working legally.
</P>
<P>
   Ocampo residents get $10 million to $40 million a year from
workers in the United States, making the workers the largest source
of income in the agricultural area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town was transformed because of the money we send from
here,'' Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people sending money to Ocampo work in Fort
Worth-Dallas, anthropologist Ian Mast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I conceptualize this town as a suburb of Dallas,'' said Mast,
a Ph.D. student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and a
Fulbright scholar who has been researching immigration patterns in
Ocampo for six months. ``The only difference is that people can't
come back home every evening, because it's too far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Family necessity is not the only reason that some immigrants
send money to their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Groups are sometimes formed to take on more ambitious projects
aimed at improving the quality of life for communities. At that
level, immigrants are pivotal in rebuilding their hometowns by
cleaning up a panteon, or cemetery, or by funding construction of
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants in North Texas with ties to Palomas in the Mexican
state of San Luis Potosi want to build a 1.9-mile road and buy an
ambulance for the community.
</P>
<P>
   The group already has helped bring waterlines to the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's living again,'' Narvaez said. ``Water is life.''

A PICTURE IS WORTH 1,000 TEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally, I refrain from writing about the lives and deaths of
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I'm not interested or sympathetic. It's simply
that their deaths receive so much media attention anyway. Everyone,
but everyone, is talking about it, so I think, ``That's enough.
I'll sit this one out.'' Perhaps I should continue in that
tradition, but there's something about little John-John Kennedy
that moves me to write.
</P>
<P>
   I do not remember President Kennedy. I know who he was and I
know much about what he accomplished. However, when he was
assassinated, I was still drinking from a baby bottle and learning
to speak. Like others of my generation, I was taught to revere and
respect his legacy. I followed those directives without much
question or scrutiny simply out of obedience to my mother, the
historian of our family and a Kennedy admirer.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, I haven't given much thought to the Kennedys. I am
sorry for the series of tragic misfortunes that have visited their
lives. I am sorry when anyone loses a loved one. I know how that
feels. However, the Kennedys of Massachusetts and I do not cross
paths on a regular basis. In fact, I've never met any of them.
</P>
<P>
   So why am I joining the nation in mourning the loss of John F.
Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and his sister-in-law Lauren?
</P>
<P>
   Well, beyond the obvious reasons, my connection to this
particular Kennedy is based on a single picture. It is not the
picture of him on the cover of People magazine that labeled him as
one of the most beautiful people in the world. Nor am I recalling
the picture of him peeking from beneath the president's desk in the
Oval Office, although that was a gem. Yes, I was touched by the
picture of him comforting his sister at his mother's funeral a few
years ago, but I had forgotten that one until it was revived for
his obituary.
</P>
<P>
   The picture I am recalling, the picture that stirs my maternal
instinct, every time I see it, is the one of 3-year-old John Jr.
saluting the funeral procession as his father's coffin passes by. I
see so much more in that picture now than I ever have before.
</P>
<P>
   I see the uncomfortably erect posture and steel faces of John's
uncle and mother standing behind him. I see the pain in the eyes of
Jackie Kennedy as she stares straight ahead so regal and dignified.
I see that all the other shadows are blending and touching while
John's shadow lies alone on the spotless asphalt, parallel but
separate.
</P>
<P>
   I see every mother, every brother, and every son who has
suffered through the grief death brings.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Jr's bodyguard, the little boy had learned to
salute properly only moments before while the family was still
inside the church attending the ceremony. Dan Farrell, the
photographer, says he was watching the family closely when Jackie
Kennedy leaned over and told her son to salute. The first time, he
didn't salute but when she told him again, he whipped that right
hand up to his brow in a wonderful imitation of a soldier's display
of honor to a superior.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I thought he saluted spontaneously because in
Farrell's picture, his mother is not even looking at him. However,
on viewing the video of the incident, it is obvious that she
instructed him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   I guess this is the point at which our lives intersect despite
all the differences between us. John Jr., at that tender age,
probably didn't understand everything that was going on. Like me,
he would learn more about his father from reading his memoirs and
history books than he would from his interaction with the
president. Like me, he has lived in a better world because of the
legacy of his father. And like me, at a tender young age, he
honored and respected the memory of his father _ simply because his
mother told him to.
</P>
<P>
   John, Carolyn, Lauren, rest in peace.

A PATRIARCH SOOTHES _ AND BEARS _ THE PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of the news has focused on the search and funeral at
sea for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette, and her
sister, Lauren, the news cameras have also caught passing shots
that told us as much about Senator Edward M. Kennedy as any
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   There were the quick, almost intrusive, glimpses of the senator
visiting his niece Caroline's home; playing basketball with her and
the children; leading the family in prayer at the Kennedy compound;
on the burial ship with his son and nephew, overseeing the
preparations and the ceremony; and leading the family's return to
the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Other scenes, described but not on camera, also revealed much
about Kennedy: his telephone conversations with President Clinton,
the Coast Guard and other involved agencies, and the way he stayed
close to, and on top of, the entire operation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, it has been Senator Kennedy who has guided the
family through the tragedies that befell the sons of his brothers _
the deaths of Robert's children, David and Michael, and now the
death of JFK's son, his wife, and sister-in law.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's critics have claimed he is of immoral character. The
image has been fed by his role in the tragic death of staffer Mary
Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and, to a lesser extent, his alleged
behavior with his nephew William Kennedy Smith at the Palm Beach
villa where the younger Smith was accused of rape. (He was later
acquitted.)
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this, the senator has served as partriach of the
Kennedy family, the surrogate father of the children of his two
slain brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Kennedy critics might suggest that as the only male left in
the family of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, it was his job, his
responsibility, to do so. There may be some truth in that, but few
can discount the unique difficulty of that role in the Kennedy
family, where tragedy visits regularly and delivering eulogies has
come to seem all too commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kennedy's own life came close to a tragic ending when his
plane crashed during his first reelection campaign. Fortunately, he
survived, although with a broken back. Then came his son, Edward
Jr.'s cancer, which resulted in the amputation of his leg. While
these may be major traumas in anyone's life, they become almost
secondary to the tragedies that define the Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his critics might say (with some justification) about
Kennedy's moral compass over the years, he has proved to be the
rudder that has kept the Kennedy family's course steady.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser man might have seen his career in public service end
after Chappaquiddick. Some critics might even argue (again, with
some justification) that if he were not a Kennedy, he might have
ended up in jail instead of later being reelected to the US Senate.
But the majority who returned Kennedy to the Senate during that
tragic period did so because they believed he still had the
influence and ability to effectively represent them.
</P>
<P>
   As history has shown, they were right. And he was effective not
only for his state but for the nation. Even after he lost his bid
to be the Democratic nominee for president, Kennedy did not leave
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went back to the Senate to continue to fight for
civil rights as well as the rights of workers, patients, and senior
citizens. His efforts earned him praise from his supporters as an
effective legislator, and criticism from his detractors as a
tax-spending liberal. But even some of his harshest Senate critics
acknowledge how hard he works and how effective he is.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the nation and the world saw Edward Kennedy the
Patriach and Edward Kennedy the Senator merge into an American icon
that today receives much more respect, praise, and sympathy than
before.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences and sympathy came from some of the Senate's most
staunch Republicans, including Strom Thurmond, Orrin Hatch, and
Trent Lott, as well as from his Democratic colleagues in Congress.
Both friends and critics are aware of the grief that Kennedy
inflicted upon himself in his earlier years. And they know he has
moved beyond the low points of his life, rising to help guide his
family through its own tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the younger Kennedys, some of them holding elective
office and others destined to, will continue the Kennedy legacy, if
not the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But when they look back through years of sadness to the tragic
death of John F. Kennedy Jr., they will know that the family legacy
has steadfastly endured because of the grace, dignity, and strength
of the family patriach, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.

ATTACK ON FATHERHOOD A POLITICAL SCREED MASQUERADING AS SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Deconstructing the Essential Father'' is the title of an
article by two psychologists _ Louise Silverstein and Carl Auerbach
_ who set out to show that fathers are not terribly important to
the well-being of their children and that traditional marriages are
no better than any other family arrangement. It isn't an especially
impressive article. Its prose is dry, its arguments are shallow,
its conclusions are disproved by a mass of scientific evidence, and
its political bias is blatant _ the authors end by calling for a
``large-scale'' expansion of welfare and electing more women to
government.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about this article is where it appeared. It
leads the June 1999 issue of American Psychologist, the official
journal of the American Psychological Association. Every member of
the APA receives American Psychologist, which means that the
nation's foremost professional association of psychologists has
given this attack on fatherhood and marriage not only its
imprimatur, but extraordinary visibility. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not for its science. Silverstein and Auerbach make it
clear that their purpose is not to report on the results of a
dispassionate inquiry. It is to rebut the conclusions of
``neoconservative'' social scientists whose research demonstrates
that the absence of fathers in the lives of so many American
children has led to a wide array of serious social problems. The
word ``neoconservative'' appears repeatedly, and it isn't meant as
a compliment. That would be fine if the authors were writing for
The Nation or Mother Jones. But scientists writing for professional
journals don't ordinarily attach pejorative political labels to
other scientists or their work.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also don't ordinarily admit that they have allowed
their politics to color their research and are using their research
to promote their politics. These authors do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acknowledge that our reading of the scientific literature
supports our political agenda,'' they write. ``Our goal is to
generate public policy . . . that supports the legitimacy of
diverse family structures, rather than policy that privileges the
two-parent, heterosexual, married family.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus openly flying their colors, they trot out one shopworn
claim after another. When it comes to children's welfare, ``it is
economics, not marriage, that matters.'' Fathers do not make ``a
unique and essential contribution to child development.'' There are
``potential costs'' to having a father in the home: He might blow
the household budget by ``gambling, purchasing alcohol, cigarettes,
or other nonessential commodities.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Silverstein and Auerbach assert, ``we do not find
any empirical support that marriage enhances fathering or that
marriage civilizes men and protects children.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement appalls Wade Horn, a much-published psychologist
and president of the National Fatherhood Initiative. ``No empirical
support? There is a whole (scientific) literature attesting to the
importance of fathers and marriage.'' Married fathers spend far
more time with their children, on average, than those who aren't
married. Decades of research on the effects of marriage show that
men tend to drink less, use drugs less, carouse less, and work
harder when they become husbands. As for protecting children,
countless studies have found that children do better when they grow
up in a two-parent married household than in any other setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their statement _ `we do not find any empirical support' _ can
only be true,'' Horn says, ``if they've never read the
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage in America has never been weaker. In a report earlier
this month, the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University
found that the marriage rate has fallen 43 percent since 1960. The
divorce rate is near its all-time high. More than 50 percent of
teenage girls now think that having children out of wedlock can be
a ``worthwhile lifestyle.'' One outcome of these wrenching social
shifts is that 22 million children _ 40 percent of America's kids _
live apart from their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences are not good. Intact two-parent families are
rarely perfect, of course. But they generally provide a far safer
environment for children than the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Boys who grow up away from their fathers are twice as likely to
end up in prison. A girl raised by an unmarried or divorced mother
_ even a white girl from a prosperous background _ is five times
more likely to become a teen mother than a girl who grows up with
both biological parents. Teens from single-parent or stepparent
homes are more likely to possess drugs, own a weapon, or assault
someone at school than teens from intact families. Young children
living with both biological parents are at a much lower risk of
physical or sexual abuse than children in other living
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social science research is almost never conclusive,''
sociologist David Popenoe, a noted expert on families, has written.
``There are always methodological difficulties and stones left
unturned. Yet in three decades of work as a social scientist, I
know of few other bodies of data in which the weight of evidence is
so decisively on one side of the issue: on the whole, for children,
two-parent families are preferable to single-parent and
stepfamilies.''
</P>
<P>
   What Silverstein and Auerbach have written is not science. It is
the opposite: a political screed that ignores what science has
proven. Why would the American Psychological Association would
promote something so shoddy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position on that,'' says the spokesperson at the APA, ``is
basically no comment.''

HOW DOES CANCER SPREAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How does cancer spread?
</P>
<P>
   P.S., Mattapan, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Last week, Robert Weinberg of MIT's Whitehead Institute in
Cambridge, Mass. described cancer as ``a disease of cells
proliferating out of control.'' Cells lose control over their
growth when something mutates the genes that regulate normal
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy cells make copies of themselves only when told to do so
by molecules called growth factors that latch onto receptors on the
outside of the cells' membrane. The ``grow'' signal is transmitted
down into the cell and through a series of proteins that adjust the
signal before getting to the DNA in the cell nucleus. Those
critical proteins are manufactured by genes. Some, with names like
ras and myc, turn the signal up, calling for more growth. They're
called oncogenes. Some, like the p53 gene, turn the signal down,
suppressing growth. They're called tumor suppressor genes.
</P>
<P>
   If oncogenes and suppressor genes are damaged, the proteins they
make won't work correctly. Ras and myc will spur too much growth;
p53 won't slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a car with the accelerator stuck to the floor,''
Weinberg explains.
</P>
<P>
   But those changes alone aren't enough to cause cancer. Still
more cellular controls need to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least four to six genes have to be mutated for cancer to
start,'' he says. ``We're not sure precisely how many.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA carries genes that make proteins to correct any damage the
DNA might suffer. When those genes are damaged, DNA can't correct
mutations and they become permanent, passing from cell to cell each
time one reproduces itself.
</P>
<P>
   But cells have lots of other ways to tell when something isn't
right. Usually when that happens, they ``commit suicide,'' a
process called apoptosis (pronounced a-pa-TOE-sis). Bad for the
cell, but good for the overall organism. In cancer cells, the genes
that control apoptosis (p53 is one of them) are also damaged. The
defective cell and its offspring survive, living on to pick up the
rest of the mutations necessary for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One of those additional mutations allows the cell to become
``immortal,'' so it and its offspring can reproduce forever.
</P>
<P>
   Normal cells have a built-in life expectancy, controlled by
little sections of DNA called telomeres (TEE-low-meers).
</P>
<P>
   Think of them like the plastic tips on the ends of shoelaces
that keep the laces from unraveling. Each time a normal cell makes
a copy of itself, the telomeres get a little shorter. After 50 or
60 growth cycles, the telomeres are gone, the DNA unravels, and the
cell can't make copies of itself anymore. Cancer cells trick the
DNA into making a protein, telomerase, that keeps the telomeres
from shrinking. That lets the cell make copies of itself forever.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer needs one more trick to survive. When those first
mutations to these critical genes accumulate in a single cell, a
process that can take decades, a tumor starts to grow. But when the
tumor gets big enough it will starve to death unless it can make
blood vessels grow to feed it. Cancer cells develop the abnormal
ability to secrete growth factors that make blood vessels grow
throughout the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Still more mutations are necessary before the tumor can spread.
Each organ or type of tissue in the body is contained in a special
membrane, a kind of sac. Cancer cells learn how to dissolve their
way through those membranes and through the walls of blood or lymph
vessels so they can travel around the body.
</P>
<P>
   Most normal cells can't survive unless they stick together _
literally. They have chemicals on their membranes that let them
adhere to one another. If they detach from other cells, it triggers
apoptosis. Cancer cells learn how to break that adhesion, without
causing apoptosis, so clumps of cells can separate from the tumor
and survive on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these processes are well understood. Scientists know
just how certain oncogenes and suppressor genes are damaged. They
know what their defective proteins look like, and how they behave
in the cell. That will quickly lead to new ways of finding cancer
earlier, when it's more treatable. And Weinberg adds: ``Ten years
ago we didn't know how cancer starts. Now we know, which gives us a
number of attractive new targets for fighting it.''

SYNCHRONIZE YOUR WATCHES FOR A TRUE `MILLENNIUM BABY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You think you're the proud parents of the first ``millennium
baby,'' but the hospital's clock could be fast, or it could be
slow, and another infant has rightful claim to the title.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Y2K problem of another sort, uncovered by two London
pediatricians who surveyed the accuracy of hospital clocks, and
reported their findings in a letter to the editor in the July 24
issue of the British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Validation of the `first baby' requires an accurate clock in
the labour room, but this may not always be the case,'' write Drs.
Jonathan Round and Nigel Kennea.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they found one battery-operated clock at a large
teaching hospital to be 4 minutes and 12 seconds slow, while
another battery-powered clock was 2 minutes and 25 seconds fast.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even more complicated for couples expecting
millennium babies is the worldwide disagreement over when and where
the next millennium begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the first to celebrate the new millennium?'' said Robin
Catchpole, senior astronomer at The Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
outside of London, which is the world's official keeper of what's
called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Universal Time.
</P>
<P>
   Purists argue the millennium doesn't begin until after the
stroke of midnight on January 1, 2001, GMT, along the Greenwich
Meridian Line, or 0 degrees longitude, which cuts right through The
Royal Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwich Meridian was agreed upon at an 1884 international
conference as the point where worldwide time begins, and which all
other time zones reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a man of Greenwich, I of course believe that the
millennium only begins in the first instant of January 1, 2001,''
Catchpole quipped.
</P>
<P>
   He and other observatory employees will be on hand in Greenwich
on January 1, 2000, for what's being billed on the Greenwich 2000
Internet site as the beginning of the ``official world millennium
party,'' even as a footnote on the Web page says ``P.S. The
millennium starts in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the party, the government of Great Britain is
building the ``world's biggest dome'' on the Greenwich Meridian
Line at a cost of 750 million pounds, or $1.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the purists, officials from Pacific islands just west of
the International Date Line, such as Fiji and New Zealand, say the
dawn of the new millennium begins on their shores after the stroke
of midnight on January 1, 2000, local time (which is 12 hours ahead
of GMT).
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, one group of islands, known as Kiribati, formerly the
Gilbert Islands, actually moved the International Date Line to the
east, so all of its islands will be among the first to see the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   One California couple hoping for a millennium baby had plans to
fly out to Kiribati to deliver their infant by caesarean section at
12:00:01 a.m. on January 1, 2000, local time. But they apparently
got worried about the birth becoming a worldwide media spectacle
and cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   If they've rescheduled at a California hospital, they should
heed the warning in the British Medical Journal and make sure the
hospital's clock is perfectly synchronized with Pacific Standard
Time (which is eight hours behind GMT).
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Observatory's Catchpole has this suggestion for
hospital officials: Buy one of the high-tech, highly accurate
clocks now available, with radio receiver and Global Positioning
Satellite capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even take into account leap seconds,'' Catchpole said.

   WASHINGTON _ Dennis Hastert, occasional speaker of the House in
fact as well as title, was fighting to save his position. In that
context, details hardly mattered.
</P>
<P>
   So he was grabbing at thin air as the robotic House went through
the motions of deliberation and passed their tax-cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with me, guys, he babbled at his Republican troops. Vote
yes, and the elderly will have new freedom, the ability to earn
more money on the side in retirement without Social Security
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting issue, Democrat Sandy Levin of Michigan
countered, except that earned-income exclusion and Social Security
benefits were nowhere to be found in the turkey of a bill being
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's purpose was to collect 219 votes for a tax-cut bill
that added up to roughly $800 billion in forgone revenue over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The components were important only to the extent that they
attracted votes. And there was the additional pitch that there was
no reason to fear that the measure under ``consideration'' would
become law. For that reason, it was no problem that only a handful
of members knew what was in it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does a dysfunctional House ``legislate.'' Thus does
national policy making descend into farce.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Stenholm, the veteran conservative Democrat from West
Texas, called the House's tax bill the most irresponsible piece of
legislation he had ever seen. And Stenholm had the standing to say
that. Back in 1981, he was a leading ``Boll Weevil,'' one of the
Southern Democrats who provided the key votes for the tax- and
budget-slashing monstrosities that sent the national debt through
the roof, driving up interest rates and squeezing the incomes of
working families for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the conservative Democrats (now called Blue
Dogs) couldn't even get floor consideration for their much smaller
alternative because it would have passed solidly and become the
possible basis for a bipartisan compromise that could have proved
irresistible to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even President-in-Waiting George Bush has smelled a rat in the
political maneuvering, triggering his resolve to avoid clear
identification with the GOP Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush first emerged from Austin in June, some of the first
words out of his mouth were an unqualified call for reductions in
marginal income-tax rates. But two weeks ago, as the House's
bizarre intent became more clear, he dropped what had been a
bedrock principle faster than a bad habit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's current position is essentially like Clinton's and the
congressional Democrats': First, Congress should ``preserve''
Social Security and Medicare; then it should take care of
supposedly ravenous military needs; then tax cutting is an
appropriate subject.
</P>
<P>
   That would preclude not only the House's bill, but the same-size
but differently structured turkey that came out of the Senate
Finance Committee. But Bush diplomatically avoided saying so.
</P>
<P>
   To the true believers of the right, however, Bush's apostasy was
dramatic and quickly became fodder for some of his
upstream-swimming opponents, notably flat taxer Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   To Forbes, the tax measures inching toward the president's
inhospitable desk are mere drops in the bucket. Supply siders of
the late 1990s are either still pushing flat-tax systems like
Forbes or advocating radical acts like the 30 percent across the
board rate cuts favored by floundering Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives also grumble, albeit lamely. The current
complaint is that the House measure only grazes the over-hyped
``marriage penalty,'' but they were bought off with Hastert
promises of unspecified add-ons later in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Totally missing are the less rich-biased proposals of people
like Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, who had urged
making Social Security taxes fully deductible against income taxes.
Also missing was a species once known as Moderato Republicano. It
has been replaced by today's moderate Republican, who frequently
expresses concern that other GOP stalwarts are ``extreme,'' but
then votes with them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, these summer soldiers were bought off, incredibly, by
a weird provision in the legislation that the House bill's rate
cuts (though not its equally large breaks for special interests)
would only take effect in years when national debt-reduction
targets are met. This unworkable garbage will be laughed out of the
occasionally responsible Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only those who think that cutting taxes is nuts when
spending cuts needed to keep the budget balanced can't be made, who
think it's especially nuts when the ``surpluses'' are all
conjectural, who think retirement programs should be made secure
first, who think debt reduction is more responsible, and who think
the inflationary consequences of tax-cutting in the midst of a boom
are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   They are now called Democrats.

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS VIE WITH VARIED SPENDING TACTICS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain recently became one of the
biggest spenders _ and gamblers _ in the New Hampshire presidential
primary. While some Republicans are hoarding their cash or spending
it on next month's Iowa straw vote, he mailed 50,000 biographical
videos to New Hampshire residents.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, by contrast, has not done a single mass mailing
in New Hampshire or set up a telephone bank. And Lamar Alexander,
with only $90,000 cash on hand, has put most of his money in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   These contrasting strategies, revealed in spending reports and
interviews, provide a summer snapshot of how the Republican
presidential field is jockeying for position in a pack led by Texas
Governor George W. Bush. While it is difficult to judge the
long-term impact of these tactics, McCain's gamble seems to be
paying off in the short term, at least in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire poll released 10 days ago showed McCain in
second place with 13 percent of those surveyed, compared with
Bush's 47 percent. Notably, McCain has passed Steve Forbes, who has
spent $8.3 million in the state _ including $2.7 million on
advertisements _ but is only at 2 percent in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has been grinding it out, doing the right things,
mailing the videos and making the phone calls,'' said Dick Bennett
of the American Research Group in Manchester, N.H., which conducted
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's drop in the poll to 7 percent from 15 percent in June
might be due partly to her decision against sending out mass
mailings or setting up a phone bank. But a Dole spokesman said the
former American Red Cross president is wise to wait before spending
too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``One strategy is to spend early, peak early,'' Dole spokesman
Ari Fleischer said, referring to McCain. ``People are free to make
that mistake if they choose. But Elizabeth Dole's strategy is to
get a strong bounce off of Iowa and be poised to do well in New
Hampshire. It's better to have a crescendo timed to peak in
February than a staccato burst in the summer when no one is paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's beneath-the-radar tactic highlights a series of
strategic decisions facing all campaigns, such as whether to spend
early or late, and whether to focus more on the first-caucus state
of Iowa than the first-primary state of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Bush's dominance in the polls and in raising money,
three factors are driving the campaign at this stage:
</P>
<P>
   --The compressed primary schedule means the nomination could be
decided by early March, just weeks after the Iowa caucus and New
Hampshire primary, putting a premium on strong showings in the
early states.
</P>
<P>
   --The decision by Bush and Forbes to forgo matching federal
funds, and thus avoid spending limits, means they will have an
enormous financial advantage. The other candidates have to abide by
an overall spending cap of $33 million for the primaries, not
including certain fund-raising and legal expenses. Bush has already
raised $37 million and expects to have $60 million or more by early
next year, while Forbes has said he will spend whatever is needed
from his own funds.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush and Forbes also don't have to abide by federal limits on
how much a candidate can spend in each state during the primary
campaign. The limit is $1.3 million in Iowa and $660,000 in New
Hampshire. While there are plenty of loopholes for covering the
costs of postage, salaries, fund-raising, and other items, many
candidates are wary of spending money early for fear they will have
limited cash in the crucial last two weeks before a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state caps create an inequitable situation,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, which advocates an overhaul
of the campaign finance system. ``Those caps treat New Hampshire
and Iowa as small states when the primary process treats them as
national events, so they are not realistic if people are going to
spend months and months campaigning there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and Forbes enjoy an abundance of campaign funds, they
have seemingly opposite strategies about how to spend the money.
Bush, riding a wave of publicity about his front-runner status,
spent only $38,000 on advertising during the first six months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, has shelled out $2.7 million for radio and
television advertising during that time, much of it in Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As for Forbes's showing of 2 percent in the New Hampshire poll,
the Forbes campaign said its internal surveys put him at 6 percent.
Moreover, Appel said, Forbes will be stronger in the coming months
because, unlike most other candidates, he will have enough money to
compete against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's strong lead has led to speculation that Forbes
would resort to repeating his 1996 tactic, unleashing a negative
advertising campaign against front-runner Bob Dole at the height of
the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign video explains the life of the former Vietnam
prisoner of war, telling how he was shot down and held captive for
more than five years. The video also has garnered some controversy
because the scene of a pilot parachuting to the ground is stock
Pentagon footage and is not McCain, as some viewers initially
believed.
</P>
<P>
   With the video costing $1.10 apiece to produce and mail, the
Arizona Republican spent more $50,000 on the New Hampshire effort.
But McCain's spending report shows he spent only $19,000 in New
Hampshire in the first six months of 1999. A McCain aide explained
that only the postage and some production costs qualified as New
Hampshire expenses, with the rest absorbed by other spending
categories. For example, McCain asked for a contribution with each
tape, which qualified the mailing as a fund-raising expense. That
means 50 percent of the cost of the mailing did not count toward
the New Hampshire cap.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview, said he decided to spend money earlier
than most candidates, because he needed to boost his name
identification.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also made a calculated decision against participating in
the Aug. 14 Iowa straw poll, where candidates such as Bush and
Forbes are spending heavily. McCain said he hasn't written off
Iowa, but he knows a poor showing in the straw poll would seriously
harm his campaign.

<P>
   Biological anthropologist Michele Goldsmith remembers a day last
year as she and four trackers trailed a group of mountain gorillas
through the dense vegetation of the Bwindi-Impenetrable National
Park in Uganda. Some of the gorillas seemed cautious, probably
still wary of humans since four members were killed by poachers in
1995. One gorilla, a ``black back'' or immature male, continually
protected the rear flank, hanging back from the group and menacing
the research team. Goldsmith, of Tufts University, calls this
gorilla ``Eritiginez,'' the word for stubborn in Ruchiga, the local
language.
</P>
<P>
   Several times he charged, with teeth flashing, and the dark
hairs of his dense, dark coat bristling and rising up on end to
make him appear even larger. ``He really shook us up,'' says
Goldsmith, the seemingly unflappable scientist. ``The trackers even
held their walking sticks up as spears.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the human primates retreated and no one was hurt.
Despite experiences like this, Goldsmith does not fear gorillas,
but she is afraid that political turmoil _ which resulted in the
deaths of eight Western tourists last March and has disrupted
research in the Virungas in the last several years _ will make this
kind of study as endangered as the gorillas themselves. And
combined with shrinking habitats and poaching, certain gorilla
groups could be lost before their cultures and behaviors are ever
really known.
</P>
<P>
   Political factors influence scientific studies across Africa.
Delia and Mark Owens, for example, authors of ``Cry of the
Kalahari'' had to abandon their work studying lions in Botswana
when the government denied their research permit in 1985. The
Ownenses attributed this to their criticism of wildlife policies.
And violence in various forms has touched many camps including
those of renowned chimp observer Jane Goodall in Tanzania and Dian
Fossey, the gorilla expert who was murdered in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedies like these may not only hamper research but also
tourism; this can have a profoundly negative effect on animal
populations. That's because poachers tend to stay away from areas
that are crowded with people. Without the presence of tourists and
others, the poachers can become more brazen.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith hopes her work, as well as that of other researchers,
may help protect a population the world knows little about.
</P>
<P>
   Modern science is just beginning to grasp the immense variation
_ both genetic and behavioral _ among the world's remaining
gorillas. Allegedly, a rose is a rose is a rose. But for sure, a
gorilla is not a gorilla is not a gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   When most people think of wild gorillas, they conjure up a
picture of Dian Fossey and her study group, immortalized in her
book and later the movie, starring Sigourney Weaver, ``Gorillas in
the Mist.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientific literature is dominated by observations from this
small group of about 320 members of the mountain gorilla subspecies
in the Virunga Volcano region along the borders of Democratic
Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), Rwanda, and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we know about gorillas comes from this very small
population, where they live above 10,000 feet,'' Goldsmith says.
``It is the only population that does so.''
</P>
<P>
   That means all the assumptions we have about gorillas _ that
they don't climb trees, for example _ come from a tiny population
that may live quite differently from all the other gorillas of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There are two distinct populations of mountain gorillas, the
well-known ones in the Virungas that Fossey studied and the group
that Goldsmith studies _ 290 animals approximately 25 miles away in
Bwindi. This is the only place in the world tourists can glimpse
mountain gorillas; there are none in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mountain gorillas, there are about 12,000 eastern
lowland gorillas, and maybe as many as 140,000 Western lowland
gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith is studying gorillas of two different subspecies _ the
Bwindi group of mountain gorillas and groups of western lowlands in
the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith, an assistant professor at Tufts University School of
Medicine specializing in great ape behavioral ecology, is just
beginning to unravel a few of the many intriguing gorilla puzzles:
how do environmental factors influence gorilla behavior? What are
the behavioral differences among gorillas of the same subspecies,
but differing environments? And what effect is tourism having on
these sensitive animals? Just how different can gorillas be from
one another?
</P>
<P>
   The high-altitude Virunga gorillas lead what's known as a
``salad-bowl'' existence, munching away all day at the vegetation
around them. ``They can get up in the morning and just reach out
and eat their food,'' Goldsmith says. Thus, they live in relatively
large groups and don't have to travel far each day.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Goldsmith has been spending time in the field _
first observing western lowland gorillas in the Central African
Republic and later mountain gorillas in Bwindi. Both groups live at
lower elevations than the Virunga population and they have access
to something the Virunga gorillas don't have _ fruit. And that
changes the picture.
</P>
<P>
   At times, ``the western lowlands travel five times further each
day than the mountain gorillas,'' sometimes in search of fruit. And
the Bwindi mountain gorillas and western lowland gorillas do
something shocking _ they climb trees. They are much more arboreal
than the Virunga gorillas, though they are not always successful.
Goldsmith has seen them fall from trees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mountain gorillas in Bwindi, who were used to
human beings in the form of tourists, were now spending time
outside park borders, enjoying the cultivated life in private
fields filled with crops.
</P>
<P>
   All three groups were accustomed to tourists and lived at the
edges of the park, Goldsmith says. They were known previously to
sometimes leave the park. But now, they are doing that more and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When gorillas lose their fear of humans,'' Goldsmith says,
``there's nothing to keep them inside park boundaries.''
Interactions between primate species _ humans and gorillas _ can
have consequences. Defensive gorillas have sent locals to the
hospital with bites and bruises, and through contact with human
feces, gorillas may become ill.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith was interested in the fact that Bwindi mountain
gorillas come into contact with chimpanzees and the Virunga
mountain gorillas do not. But now, in Bwindi, she found ``the
gorillas were not living in the forest with the chimps and fruit.
They were living on people's property, in their fields, without
chimps, and without fruit. So I couldn't collect the information I
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of a month and a half of observing one of these groups,
Goldsmith saw them spend only a single night inside the park. ``But
this posed an even more interesting question,'' Goldsmith says. How
was this new lifestyle affecting behavior? For one thing, these
park-crashing, crop-raiding gorillas don't have to travel very far
in search of food and their day and night nest sites are fairly
close. Their groups may, in fact, be more cohesive as a result. But
it's too early to tell. Goldsmith does less observation, and more
hands-on work, than most people might think. Actually, she gets her
hands quite dirty. Like many great field biologists, Goldsmith
finds a goldmine in droppings. ``I do spend more time with dung
than with gorillas,'' she says unabashedly. She collects it, bags
it, weighs it wet, washes it, sorts leaf from fruit from bug
fragments, dries it, weighs it dry, and then keeps it all for
research.
</P>
<P>
   Nest sites and food dropped along trails tell their own stories,
too. They are all pieces of a just-begun mosaic of great ape life _
work that Goldsmith is determined to continue. She has lived
through cerebral malaria, falling tree limbs, marauding elephants
in camp, and the sounds of rebel artillery in the distance. The
murderous incident in the Bwindi tourist camp was also a bit of a
close call _ Goldsmith had left the area just six weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the initial shock over the violence _ ``It made me think
about studying dolphins,'' she says _ Goldsmith is forging ahead
with long-standing plans to return to Africa this winter, first to
the Central African Republic and then to Bwindi, where tourists
have already begun to return. ``I guess what keeps me going,'' she
says, ``is my intense thirst for scientific inquiry. I love being a
scientist. And I love puzzles.'' And, she says, she has developed a
``strong attachment'' to mountain gorillas. ``There are only 600 in
the world and they cannot save themselves.''

ANCIENT PRACTICE FINDS A NEW-AGE HOME IN VERMONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Vt. _ Paul Sevigny has been a lot of things in his
time, including a World War II glider pilot, a career US Air Force
officer, a race car driver, a teacher, a judge, and a state
representative.
</P>
<P>
   But up here in the green and hilly corner of their state that
Vermonters call the Northeast Kingdom, he is probably best known as
a dowser or diviner. Or, what some traditionalists still call a
water witch. That is, someone who can find water _ and maybe other
thing besides _ using a rod, stick, or pendulum as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   A spare, dignified man with a clipped white moustache and
military bearing, the 79-year-old Sevigny is an elder statesman of
an esoteric folk practice once confined to a few rural pockets.
Today, however, around the country dowsing is experiencing a
premillennial surge in popularity, one that is altering its image.
</P>
<P>
   The old guys in bib overalls who waved a cleft stick to show
farmers where to drill new wells are fading into yesterday. The
future of dowsing appears to belong to yuppies who shop at L.L.
Bean and use their dowsing rods to search for just about everything
_ from inner peace to better organic tomatoes _ except water.
``About all the oldtime dowsers are gone except me,'' Sevigny says.
``But the kids are getting into it, and there are a lot of women
dowsers now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Using only a metal dowsing rod and his intuition, Sevigny claims
to have found nearly 4,000 well sites and also located 150 strayed
pets, a couple of lost diamond rings, and several missing persons.
Sceptics, who include most scientists who have studied dowsing,
attribute such successes to chance, luck, or shrewd guesses. ``A
lot of people think dowsing is kind of kooky,'' Sevigny admits,
``but all you do is concentrate; it's an extra-sensory-perception
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The act of dowsing is as simple as the results are mysterious.
The dowser usually holds a rod or pendulum in hand and walks slowly
forward, until the rod moves sharply down or to the side or the
pendulum starts spinning _ all supposed indicators that water or an
object being sought has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced dowsers like Sevigny claim they can also tell the
quantity of water and what depth it's at, as well as where it is,
and can locate it through dowsing maps as well as by walking over
the ground. Some also claim to be able to ask mental questions and
get answers, such as the location of a missing person, from the
movements of divining rods and pendulums.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a dowser helped friends of a missing woman,
Melissa Gosule, discover her bicycle and some clothing near a town
beach in Halifax, Mass. Last week, authorities found Gosule's body
in another location and made an arrest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Danville, a small town just to the west of St. Johnsbury, is
home to the American Society of Dowsers, founded here in 1961. The
heart of Vermont's most-rural region, this is a place where dowsers
still seem to be almost as common as retired dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started at a foliage festival with one dowser giving a
demonstration of how to find water,'' recalls Sevigny, a Danville
native and past president of the dowsing society. ``The next year
50 dowsers showed up, and the year after that 70 dowsers came, and
they decided to start a society.'
</P>
<P>
   Today, the society has 83 chapters and 5,000 members across
North America. The annual convention usually attracts around 1,000
dowsers from this country, Canada, Mexico, and abroad. The first
meetings of the society were held on Danville's small town green,
but because they now draw such large crowds, and include lectures
and workshops, the venue has moved to the campus of Lyndon State
College in nearby Lyndonville.
</P>
<P>
   This year's convention, Aug. 5-8, has as its theme ``Dowse today
for a better tomorrow.'' It will be preceded by two days of
workshops on dowsing techniques such as use of the L-rod, the most
popular dowser's tool. But the convention program also includes
lectures on such arcane topics as energy therapy, runes, shamanism,
labyrinth design, and perception development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new members are getting us into a lot of New Age things
that us old dowsers don't really believe in,'' says Sevigny,
somewhat ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dowsing has gone beyond looking for water,'' acknowledges
Maxine Shapiro of Newton, the secretary of the society's 100-member
Boston chapter.'' I don't want to sound weird,'' says Shapiro, a
licensed acupuncturist, ``but with dowsing you get into the
metaphysics of energy. It's a way of accessing information that has
a logic of its own _ we just don't have a paradigm for it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   She has never dowsed for water, Shapiro says. Instead, she uses
a dowsing rod to ask questions about ``life decisions'' and to help
create harmonious home spaces. She recently attended a dowsers
convention in California, and plans to go to the national one in
Danville. ``Dowsers show up with their rods, pendulums, and now
even crystals, and it's a lot of fun,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Sevigny sees it, dowsing is more about old-fashioned
neighborliness and community service than New Age mysticism. He
says it's just another one of the many things he volunteers to do,
like mowing the town green, leading the Fourth of July parade, or
helping to raise money for a new school ball field. ``I don't
charge for dowsing, and I've never made a penny from it,'' he
insists.
</P>
<P>
   When grateful people do send him a donation, Sevigny says he
contributes it to local causes such as the Danville Rescue Squad,
the 4-H Club, the Boy Scouts, Vermont Planned Parenthood, and the
nonprofit dowsing society. ``Over the last 33 years the donations
have added up to $126,335,'' he says, proudly. He keeps scrupulous
records of these contributions and has four thick scrapbooks of
newspaper clippings, testimonials, and dowsing memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   One item that Sevigny particularly treasures is a contract,
which he says is the first legally binding agreement between a
water dowser and the state of Vermont. ``It only took me a few
minutes to find water, but they insisted I sign a contract,'' he
recalls, ``although they wouldn't call me a dowser, I had to be a
`water consultant.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like the society's convention, its bookstore _ stocked with
dowsers' supplies as well as books _ outgrew Danville some years
ago. It is now located on Railroad Street, the main shopping street
of St. Johnsbury. There are many books on dowsing, naturally, with
titles like ``Taming the Wild Pendulum,'' ``Who Were Those Rods I
Saw You With Last Night?,'' and ``So Your Mate Is a Dowser _ Let's
Talk!'' But also on the shelves are books about metaphysics, earth
energy, spirituality, and wellness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old-timers dowsed because they couldn't afford the
machinery to dig for the water they needed to survive, but that
generation is mostly gone,'' says Lynn O'Leary, assistant store
manager. ``Now we have to relate to young people, and dowsing is
getting New Age. There are even people who dowse their food before
they eat _ the old-time dowsers certainly wouldn't approve of
that!''
</P>
<P>
   The store sells T-shirts, hats, coffee cups, and jewelry
decorated with the society's cleft-stick logo and cheery motto
``Indago Felix,'' which roughly translates as ``Happy Hunting.''
The best-selling items, however are dowsing tools: L and Y-shaped
rods, pendulums, and bobbers _ rods with a coiled wire and weighted
tip at one end.
</P>
<P>
   While dowsing is commonplace in the Northeast Kingdom, there is
also no shortage of people who are sceptical about the often
extravagent claims made for it by dowsers. ``This is a pretty easy
state to be a dowser in. You'd have trouble digging a hole almost
anywhere in Vermont and not hit water,'' says Howard Reed Jr.,
senior curator of the Fairbanks Museum in St. Johnsbury.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which has a large natural history collection and a
planetarium, also runs science programs for the local school
system. ``Dowsing isn't in the curriculum,'' Reed says dryly.
</P>
<P>
   However, a local dowser like Sevigny is always among those
giving demonstrations during the two-day crafts festival that the
museum sponsors every September. ``There's no scientific proof that
dowsing works, but we're comfortable with dowsing for water as a
craft,'' says Reed. ``That's still very much a part of the
traditions of the Northeast Kingdom.''

VISITORS COME FOR APPLES, HELPING OF NEW ENGLAND ATMOSPHERE

   JULIAN, Calif. _ Maybe it's because America has such deep roots
in New England. Maybe it's because there is so much sameness to
life here in California, the land of endless summer.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, people on this coast seem to have an
abiding curiosity about aspects of existence in the northern
Atlantic states: A changing of the seasons, a turning of the
foliage. Seeing your breath during an early morning walk, the
dormant forest floor crunching under foot. A blaze in the wood
stove _ in a dwelling that was built before 1950. A warming sip of
apple cider pressed just hours ago.
</P>
<P>
   For this, New Englander wanna-bes in California make regular
pilgrimages to Boston and Bangor, Manchester and Montpelier.
</P>
<P>
   And when they can't pull off such a trek, they go to Julian.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tiny community in the mountains east of San Diego. At
4,200 feet elevation, it enjoys a relatively cool climate. At 300
or so permanent residents, it also enjoys relative serenity.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that some towns turn back the clock. This one
does that, but it also rotates the time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Julian offers a few hundred feet of downtown, featuring such
businesses as Jack's Grocery, Julian Hardware &AMP; Mercantile, and
Norm's Service _ they're not for atmosphere; they're actual working
enterprises. Walk four blocks in any direction and you run out of
Julian.
</P>
<P>
   The town has a cemetery on a hill, accessed by steep steps _
this walkway used to be the only way to haul coffins up to the
plots. It has a church with a prominent white steeple, a library
with a cupola. The trees on the surrounding hillsides may not
explode into bright hues of red and orange, but the oaks will at
least produce some yellow for you.
</P>
<P>
   There are also apples. They thrive in this climate, and can be
found in just about every form imaginable: apple orchards, apple
pies, apple butter, apple cider, applesauce. Even Dutch apple
bread, prepared at Dudley's Bakery in nearby Santa Ysabel _ with
fresh slices processed at a Julian farm.
</P>
<P>
   These have proven popular with travelers for some time, and the
phenomenon shows no sign of abating. Julian's chamber of commerce
maintains listings of lodging options that run from hotels to
bed-and-breakfast inns to cottages and cabins. It currently logs 57
such operations _ about one for every six permanent residents in
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Julian and its surrounding hills present a quiet, cool urban
escape in summer, a cozy mountain retreat _ without the commotion
of a ski area _ in winter.
</P>
<P>
   But it's in autumn that it puts on its best face, such that any
plans for a visit during that season had best be made by the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends in October, said innkeeper Nan Kimball, ``People who
love to stand in line for movies get to stand in line for pie. I
call it the town that pie built.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Julian was founded just after the Civil War by some
ex-Confederates who weren't thrilled with the condition Georgia was
in after Sherman left. The settlement flourished with the discovery
of gold in 1870, and then did so again 100 years later when baby
boomers discovered its pie and placidity.
</P>
<P>
   The apple season runs from about mid-September to early
December, although this year the start of the harvest could be
delayed because of a goofy spring (there was snow in June).
</P>
<P>
   When it arrives, tourists create an absolute frenzy in Julian.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hall, who tends apple groves on five acres at Apple Lane
Orchard, sends the bulk of his crop to two Julian bakeries,
including Mom's Pies. (Yes, there really is a place here called
Mom's Pies _ and the food is pretty good.)
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of the season,'' Hall said, ``Mom's will bake
1,000 pies a day or more. In a weekend in October, they will sell
every pie.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other activities related to the harvest, though not as
many as there used to be. Growers once let visitors climb ladders
and pick the fresh apples they wanted to buy, but the soaring cost
of liability insurance has pretty much wiped out that recreation.
</P>
<P>
   It's still worth a visit to an orchard, though. At Apple Lane,
youngsters marvel as the fruit is mechanically sorted, polished,
graded, separated, sized and boxed.
</P>
<P>
   In another room, a machine cores, peels and slices apples.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, still another machine presses fresh cider. ``Thursdays
are cider days. You can watch us make it and jug it,'' said Hall.
``But we usually start early, and the short runs are done by
noon.''
</P>
<P>
   The stuff is brewed with all the care of a Napa winemaker.
Tinker slightly with the mix of apple varieties and you get a
slightly different taste.
</P>
<P>
   Cider can be found at establishments all around town, and at
roadside fruit stands, but here's an advisory: If it's pasteurized,
it was mass-manufactured somewhere else; the genuine Julian article
is simply juice in a jug, such that you have to drink it within a
few weeks or it will turn into booze.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, the sprinkling of tiny orchards in the
area can't possibly keep up with the demand for all of this. In
recent years, following a Southern California trend, many groves
have been sacrificed to the building demand.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it's difficult to get a reading as to what ratio
Julian's apples constitute in Julian's products, particularly the
pie. At times in the fall, it runs high. In the off-season, it is
zero, and the valleys of central Utah scurry to fill the seemingly
insatiable demand.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors to Julian _ at any time of the year _ might take a
few minutes to wander the quaint streets, run a hand over a
Pendleton wool blanket in the mercantile store, gag on the
overpowering scents of the candle shop, fork down a piece of peach
apple crumb pie at Julian Pie Co. ... and wonder aloud, ``Is that
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely the point. There is very little to do here,
which is probably why so many urban refugees seek out those inns
and cottages with such regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Julian, there is gentle recreation. Down the hill a few
miles to the east is the vast wonderland of Anza-Borrego Desert
State Park. Directly south is another state park, bucolic Cuyamaca
Rancho, which offers numerous hiking opportunities, plus a small
lake for fishing and quiet boating. A short drive away are the
Laguna Mountains, and on weekends in the summer, the astronomers
manning the Mount Laguna Observatory will allow ticket-holding
visitors to look through one of the telescopes. (Details in
accompanying box.)
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Julian's popularity has been so extreme in recent years
that it has even spawned an intriguing concept: alternative Julian.
</P>
<P>
   To complement the bed-and-breakfast inns found in town, several
cabins and cottages have been opened for guests in the surrounding
hill country.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit in June, for example, I stumbled upon the Big Cat
Cabin in Pine Hills, which lies five miles southwest of Julian _
and a world away. One of two cabins operated by Chuck and Nan
Kimball, who also run the Artists' Loft B&AMP;B, it stands on six acres
that are thickly wooded with oak and pine.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin _ named for a cougar that resides just down the hill _
dates to 1929, and its legacy is faithfully respected: Smooth,
gnarled tree limbs used as door handles. Original hardwood floors.
Open rafters. An enormous stone fireplace, plus a woodburning stove
and a pristine Wedgewood gas range. A redwood-walled shower. A
porch that faces the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   There is an impressive collection of old books, a CD player and
discs that run to Chopin, Borodin, Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin site is on a knob, with a commanding view to the
southwest _ Point Loma can be seen when there is no marine layer.
And the cool ocean breezes reach this far; the bedroom, in fact, is
designed to capture them _ it's a former screened-in porch.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen area is fully appointed, which is a fortuitous
thing. When it comes to fine dining, Julian remains a dessert shop
in desperate need of a decent restaurant. Only guests of the
upscale Orchard Hill Country Inn are graced with the presence of an
accomplished chef, and he only works Wednesdays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   The deer obviously like the setting. A fawn wandered past the
cabin door one morning, oblivious to the inhabitants preparing
breakfast within.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost noon.
</P>
<P>
   Humorist P.J. O'Rourke, noting New Englanders' compulsion to
rise early, writes that after moving to New Hampshire, he used to
sleep in his clothes so that he wouldn't be embarrassed ``when
someone rang the doorbell at 5 a.m. to see if I'd like help
stacking cordwood. ... Getting up early means going to bed early,
and it worries people if you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to be concerned about that here. Julian and its
surrounding hills may be deeply dipped in New England flavor, but
they haven't lost their ties to California rhythm. &UR;  &QL;

LEASE OR LOAN: DRIVERS' CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After driving his Chevrolet Suburban for 13 years, Ara Dedekian
has conceded that it's time for a new car.
</P>
<P>
   For him the question of buy or lease is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   He's the type of car owner who ``buys something and keeps it
forever,'' Dedekian says _ someone who likes owning his car and
wants to run it into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But for Nanci Leitch and Brian Remer, a married couple with a
4-year-old daughter, leasing is the answer to their changing car
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As your lifestyle changes, you have different car needs,''
Leitch says. ``It is easy with a lease to change from the sporty
car that you had when you were single to a sports utility vehicle
when you need one of those with a family. . . . Now I'm going
through my mid-life crisis and really want a Volkswagen Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many business reasons to consider leasing, but more
and more frequently, leasing has become a popular alternative to
buying for personal driving.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates warn those considering leasing to read the
fine print.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do your homework and see what the best rates
are,'' said Robert Ellis, director of operations for the Center for
the Study of Services _ a nonprofit affiliate of the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leitch and Remer, many consumers are most interested in
driving a brand-new car that meets their immediate needs. They want
to get the most car for the money. And they would rather invest the
difference between lease payments and usually-higher monthly
purchase payments into more profitable arenas _ not cars with
rapidly depreciating values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some research ahead of time and found it is not really
a good idea to own something that is going to depreciate,'' Leitch
said. ``We're certainly putting the money into other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Leasing a car is the automotive equivalent of renting an
apartment rather than buying a condominium. It involves paying a
monthly rate for the use of a car, usually for two or three years.
These payments are usually significantly less than the monthly
payments on a loan taken out to buy the car. But at the end of the
lease the driver has not accumulated any ownership or equity in the
car _ so back to the dealer it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young professionals who don't have a lot of ready cash,
but have good credit, leasing means immediate satisfaction,'' said
Stephen Saunders, inventory manager at Cambridge Chevrolet Honda
Geo. Leases let consumers ``drive the high-line cars they could
never afford,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Automobile Dealers Association the
average cost of a new car in 1997, the most recent year tallied,
was $22,650.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said that consumers in Boston are ``conservative'' and
wary of leasing because ``people hear a lot of war stories and get
scared.'' Consumers may hear that they will be hit with high
penalties for damage to the car or that dealers will sneak
additional charges into the deal, Saunders said. But he insists
such statements are false.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Winquist, leasing manager at Sentry South Lincoln Mercury,
adds that leasing is especially advantageous for those who want a
luxury car. ``You are able to drive more vehicle for the same
(monthly) payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Winquist also pointed out that manufacturer warranties cover
almost all ordinary maintenance costs on leased cars other than
routine operating expenses such as oil changes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a person leasing a $23,000 Ford Explorer for three
years (and driving no more than 36,000 miles) would pay
approximately $355 a month with a $4,500 down payment, adding up to
$17,280.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the same car with the same down payment and a three-year
financing at 0.9 percent _ a rate currently being quoted by Ford
dealers and the Ford Motor Co. _ would mean monthly payments of
about $585 a month, or $25,560.
</P>
<P>
   That's $8,280 more than leasing for three years _ money that if
it were invested in a money market fund returning 4 percent
interest, would earn a little more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saunders says leasing may be a cheaper way of getting
into a nicer car, consumer advocates warn it is not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a consumer who typically buys a new car every two to
three years and doesn't drive the car a lot of miles, then you're a
candidate for leasing,'' says Ellis, the spokesman for the Center
for the Study of Services. ``But anybody who is going to put a lot
of miles on the car is really putting themselves in jeopardy by
leasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lease agreements include predetermined annual mileage limits,
typically 12,000 or 15,000 miles a year. But terms can be expanded
to up to 20,000 miles. Leasing companies charge drivers 10 to 20
cents for every mile driven beyond the limit, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantial miles over the average could cost leasers
thousands of dollars,'' Ellis warned. ``But there are ways to
mitigate that _ by paying for extra miles upfront or negotiating a
low rate _ but still paying a significant amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that buying an automobile is probably better for
those who don't want to deal with the hassle of shopping for a new
car every few years, who want to drive their cars for more than
three years, or who drive more than 15,000 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical closed-end lease, consumers return the car when the
contract expires and walk away. Leasers are responsible for excess
mileage charges and any damage to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Leases usually include an option to purchase the car, but this
is usually an unattractive proposition because when renegotiated
the new financing payments tend to be higher than the previous
lease payments, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lease customers must also be careful of monthly payment rates
that look too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission warns that lease deals are not
always as good as they first sound. Often there is an inception
payment that is due before you can drive away. This may include a
security deposit, an acquisition fee, first month's payment, taxes,
and title fees. It could also include a down payment on the lease
itself, which would reduce monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   These additional terms can be negotiated, Ellis said. For
instance, it is much easier to negotiate a lease with no down
payment than it is to buy the car without a down payment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lower down payment, or no down payment at all, often
attracts younger customers to lease rather than buy, said Robert
DeMarzo, a certified financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people find just (making) the minimum down payment is
attractive,'' DeMarzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Making an initial down payment or earning trade-in credit from a
previously owned car can reduce monthly lease payments _ just as
occurs when buying a car.
</P>
<P>
   Although low monthly payments may seem like a dream during the
term of the lease, some first-time leasers, like Sal Cardinal,
experience ``lease shock'' as the contract ends.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal traded in his old car two years ago and leased a car
because it was ``new and cheap.'' When the lease expired, Cardinal
tried to negotiate another lease. But because he had no trade-in,
the monthly payments on a second lease were higher than he could
handle. Now he's looking at used cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars are so expensive now that sometimes you can't get a nice
car unless you lease,'' Cardinal said. ``Leasing is good because it
gets you into a nicer car.'' But, he said, ``I am going to buy now,
because I want to have something at the end.''

zero, and the valleys of central Utah scurry to fill the seemingly
insatiable demand.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors to Julian _ at any time of the year _ might take a
few minutes to wander the quaint streets, run a hand over a
Pendleton wool blanket in the mercantile store, gag on the
overpowering scents of the candle shop, fork down a piece of peach
apple crumb pie at Julian Pie Co. ... and wonder aloud, ``Is that
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely the point. There is very little to do here,
which is probably why so many urban refugees seek out those inns
and cottages with such regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Julian, there is gentle recreation. Down the hill a few
miles to the east is the vast wonderland of Anza-Borrego Desert
State Park. Directly south is another state park, bucolic Cuyamaca
Rancho, which offers numerous hiking opportunities, plus a small
lake for fishing and quiet boating. A short drive away are the
Laguna Mountains, and on weekends in the summer, the astronomers
manning the Mount Laguna Observatory will allow ticket-holding
visitors to look through one of the telescopes. (Details in
accompanying box.)
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Julian's popularity has been so extreme in recent years
that it has even spawned an intriguing concept: alternative Julian.
</P>
<P>
   To complement the bed-and-breakfast inns found in town, several
cabins and cottages have been opened for guests in the surrounding
hill country.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit in June, for example, I stumbled upon the Big Cat
Cabin in Pine Hills, which lies five miles southwest of Julian _
and a world away. One of two cabins operated by Chuck and Nan
Kimball, who also run the Artists' Loft B&AMP;B, it stands on six acres
that are thickly wooded with oak and pine.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin _ named for a cougar that resides just down the hill _
dates to 1929, and its legacy is faithfully respected: Smooth,
gnarled tree limbs used as door handles. Original hardwood floors.
Open rafters. An enormous stone fireplace, plus a woodburning stove
and a pristine Wedgewood gas range. A redwood-walled shower. A
porch that faces the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   There is an impressive collection of old books, a CD player and
discs that run to Chopin, Borodin, Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin site is on a knob, with a commanding view to the
southwest _ Point Loma can be seen when there is no marine layer.
And the cool ocean breezes reach this far; the bedroom, in fact, is
designed to capture them _ it's a former screened-in porch.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen area is fully appointed, which is a fortuitous
thing. When it comes to fine dining, Julian remains a dessert shop
in desperate need of a decent restaurant. Only guests of the
upscale Orchard Hill Country Inn are graced with the presence of an
accomplished chef, and he only works Wednesdays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   The deer obviously like the setting. A fawn wandered past the
cabin door one morning, oblivious to the inhabitants preparing
breakfast within.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost noon.
</P>
<P>
   Humorist P.J. O'Rourke, noting New Englanders' compulsion to
rise early, writes that after moving to New Hampshire, he used to
sleep in his clothes so that he wouldn't be embarrassed ``when
someone rang the doorbell at 5 a.m. to see if I'd like help
stacking cordwood. ... Getting up early means going to bed early,
and it worries people if you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to be concerned about that here. Julian and its
surrounding hills may be deeply dipped in New England flavor, but
they haven't lost their ties to California rhythm. &UR;  &QL;

A KENNEDY DYNASTY COMES TO AN END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into the Atlantic, the
crash did more than take the lives of the three aboard the doomed
flight. It also dashed any serious notion of the Kennedys as a
continuing political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Kennedys will continue to fill gossip columns and
tabloid pages. And, sadly, unless the Kennedy men finally rethink
the risk-taking and recklessness they have learned as part of
Kennedy lore, there will be other accidents and injuries and
deaths, other grim vigils and solemn family funerals.
</P>
<P>
   But JFK Jr.'s death ends the notion, long an American idee fixe,
of a new Kennedy male rising to high national office. That's a
torch that won't be passed to the generation of Kennedys born in
this half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last Kennedy as we have known this dynasty,''
declares David Horowitz, coauthor of ``The Kennedys: An American
Drama.'' ``He was the only one with the really golden promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no other fourth generation Kennedy commands the same
popular height in the public imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was sui generis,'' said Richard Reeves, author of
``President Kennedy: Profile of Power.'' ``There is no comparable
figure among the Kennedys.''
</P>
<P>
   Even longtime family friends agree the dynastic idea has
perished along with the late president's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody else,'' rues one. ``The hope that there was a
Kennedy male who could someday run for president again was really
only John.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, that hope was only a glimmer. At 38, Kennedy was
more notable for his ancestry than his accomplishments, more famous
for his looks than his thoughts. Still, he had a certain charm that
played well and a self-effacing, regular-guy humility that eludes
some of his less prominent cousins, whose troubled lives have
rendered them paler epigones of the second-generation Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   The political professionals had judged his appeal real enough
that US Senator Robert Torricelli, chairman of the Democratic
Senate Campaign Committee, had approached him about running for the
US Senate. And there's general agreement he would have been a
formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For all last week's talk about the Kennedy dynasty, a few simple
points put the sprawling family in proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   --With the exception of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who won his
job in 1962, Kennedy brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of
housing and urban development, is far more powerful than any of the
supposedly politically potent clan.
</P>
<P>
   --The third generation Kennedy with the best hope of ascending
to a reasonably important office is Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, 48,
the lieutenant governor of Maryland, who hopes to wage a
gubernatorial campaign in 2002. But even if she were to eventually
rise higher than the governor's office, Kathleen would have to
fight to change the definition of Kennedy dynasty leader, which is
unrelentingly male.
</P>
<P>
   --The last Kennedy to try to move up politically _ Joe Kennedy,
here in Massachusetts _ pulled out of the 1998 governor's race amid
controversy, and has since dropped out of politics altogether.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert F. Kennedy Jr. _ considered the third generation's
probable star until his 1984 conviction for heroin possession _
decided against a campaign in 2000 for the Senate seat being
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York.
</P>
<P>
   --US Representative Patrick Kennedy , a Rhode Island Democrat
and son of Senator Kennedy, also opted against a Senate bid in
2000, choosing not to run for the seat being vacated by John
Chafee. Instead, he will bank on the hope that the Democrats can
retake the House, making US Representative Richard Gephardt speaker
and putting him in line for a leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   That course, like Robert's environmentalism, is worthy work. But
neither is the kind of bold move that renews a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   No, if there's a real political dynasty in contemporary America,
it is sired by former US Senator Prescott Bush, a contemporary of
John F. Kennedy's in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 11 years, the Bush family has produced a president,
George Herbert Walker Bush, and governors of two of the country's
largest states, Jeb Bush in Florida and George W. Bush in Texas.
Further, George W. has a very real chance of being the country's
next president.
</P>
<P>
   And what progress have the Kennedys made in the same period?
</P>
<P>
   One lieutenant governor and two congressmen, one of whom has
since left public life. And one state legislator, Mark Shriver, a
member of the Maryland House of Delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given their visibility, they definitely have not produced the
level of success that other dynasties have,'' says Lou DiNatale,
director of the Center for State and Local Policy at the McCormack
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   A look back 13 years shows just how much family fortunes have
faded. In 1986 _ when Joe Kennedy first ran for Congress,
malapropping nostalgically about the days ``when my family was in
power'' as though the Kennedys had been a hereditary monarchy _
talk abounded about the third generation coming confidently into
its own and fulfilling the family legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he seem presidential?'' was the question breathless
national reporters asked as they arrived in Boston to cover the
race. With a victory under their belts, Kennedy's staff certainly
seemed to think so. Watching Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign,
they talked of Joe someday running for the White House from the US
House.
</P>
<P>
   Even in early 1997, with Joe a formidable front-runner for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, it was reasonably plausible to
talk of the third generation as a future force.
</P>
<P>
   Queried back then about his own possible plans for 1998, Michael
Kennedy, who had managed Uncle Ted's Senate reelection campaign in
1994, consciously took on the role Robert Kennedy had played for
John. His immediate goal, Michael said, was to get his brother
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the State House. First
Joe became embroiled in a controversy over his verbal bullying of
ex-wife Sheila Rauch Kennedy in his attempt to have their marriage
annulled.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Globe broke the story that Michael Kennedy had carried
on a sexual liaison with a teenage baby-sitter, a scandal that
singed Joe after he offered murky accounts about when he had
learned of the affair and what he had done to end it.
</P>
<P>
   With candor rare for the Kennedy clan, JFK Jr. called his
cousins ``poster boys for bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with dismal polling numbers, Kennedy bailed out of the
governor's race in August 1997. ``You have to be realistic about
the fact that people are very angry at members of my family and me
in particular,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Kennedy circle, there's some wistful talk that the
former congressman, who is back running Citizens Energy but has
told associates he misses ``being in the mix,'' will try again in
2002. Still, family friends doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly think time has passed Joe by,'' laments one family
intimate. ``He had his shot. I don't think he knows it yet, but the
window has closed.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if Joe does run in 2002, his aura of invincibility is
gone, stripped away by his fumbling performance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be plausible, but he would clearly not be
prohibitive,'' said another family friend. ``He clearly would have
serious opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Victoria Reggie Kennedy is now seen as more likely
than Joe as a senatorial successor to her husband _ should he ever
retire, that is. With Ted, a hearty 67, running for reelection in
2000, there's no sign of that.
</P>
<P>
   And as for national prospects? Well, to put it politely, ``Does
he seem presidential?'' is a question no one asks anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And so that leaves Kathleen Kennedy Townsend as the distant hope
for the family's fading fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new face of the Kennedys in politics may not be male,''
says Geri Denterlein, a consultant at McDermott/O'Neill who worked
to buff up Citizens Energy Corp.'s image during the most recent
Kennedy scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the Kennedy circle offer this hope: Kathleen's name
and gender might make her a good vice presidential pick,
particularly if she wins the governorship in 2002 and proves
herself an able governor.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps. Still, that's a `might be'' cantilevered out from
a `maybe' set atop an `if.' That is, a prospect whose very
remoteness gives the lie to the idea that the Kennedys remain a
dynastic political force in American politics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   IF YOU GO &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Julian is about a 150-mile drive from downtown Los
Angeles. To avoid the chronic congestion of the I-5 _ particularly
on weekends _ the best course is to travel east on any of three
freeways (10, 60, 91) to the I-15 south. At Escondido, in northern
San Diego County, head east on Highway 78. The route is pleasant
(particularly beyond Ramona), passing horse ranches, citrus and
avocado groves, and such establishments as the San Pasqual Store,
which has a sign out front that actually says ``Beer &AMP; Antiques.''
Julian is 40 miles from I-15.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The Chamber of Commerce maintains a referral service at
(888) 765-0373. Another referral option is the Julian Bed &AMP;
Breakfast Guild: (888) 765-4333. The Big Cat Cabin in Pine Hills
rents for $140 on weekdays, $165 for weekends, holidays and
one-night stays. The neighboring Cabin at Strawberry Hill, equally
pleasant, is priced at $120 and $145 on the same basis. Both are
maintained by the proprietors of the Artists' Loft B&AMP;B, which has
two rooms. Phone: (760) 765-0765. Web: www.artistsloft.com.
Julian's Orchard Hill Country Inn has drawn raves in several
publications. It offers lodge rooms for $160 to 170, cottage units
for $210 to 265.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Fine-dining options are appallingly slim. The Julian
Grille, a steak-and-chop house, is about as good as it gets. Avoid
Romano's, which somehow has found a way to foul up pasta and pizza.
Guests at Orchard Hill can get a nice dinner on Wednesdays and
Saturdays, but it's not open to outsiders. For pie, San Diego
regulars seem to favor the Julian Pie Co. or Mom's Pies. Whole pies
run $10, a slice about $2.
</P>
<P>
   APPLE ACTIVITIES: You can watch the machines polish, sort, peel,
slice and press apples at Apple Lane Orchard, just east of town on
Highway 78. To get there, you drive on a gravel road through a
small grove of Jonathan, Winesap, Granny Smith and other varieties.
In season, they sell newly picked apples in bags, freshly bottled
cider and even honey from their own bees. Phone: (760) 765-2645.
</P>
<P>
   STARGAZING: It's a federal-government operation, so it isn't
made easy, but it's worth the trouble. Mount Laguna Observatory
tickets are handed out free on a first-come, first-served basis at
a U.S. Forest Service ranger station 20 miles southeast of Julian
via Highway 79 and Sunrise Highway (S1). The station is open from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, noon to 5 p.m. on Saturday. The
stargazing is conducted weekends just after sundown. But you can't
pull this off in one trip _ you have to pay a visit during the day
for the ticket, then return at night to look through the telescope.
Make sure you also pick up a forest-use pass, which is $5 daily.
The ranger station does not maintain a phone line for public
access. The station in nearby Alpine does, and might be of some
help: (619) 445-6235.
</P>

on Julian events and lodging. Phone: (760) 765-1857. Web:

PATH OF ZIONIST ZEAL LEADS TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bonnie Lipton has been in Washington, D.C., all week preparing
the speech she will make Tuesday when she becomes the 22d president
of Hadassah, the country's largest women's organization and a
leading Jewish and Zionist force globally.
</P>
<P>
   Modestly and with dedication, the Pittsfield, Mass. woman long
ago set upon a path that would propel her into the ranks of Jewish
leadership _ always with an eye toward her beloved Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Since her first visit to Israel in 1975 to witness Hadassah
rededicate its hospital on Jerusalem's Mount Scopus, ``there was
never any question that I was going to direct all my energies to
Hadassah. This is a way of life for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she prepares to guide the organization, founded in 1912 by a
rabbi's daughter to bring health care to Palestine, Lipton knows
where her energies must now lie: She wants to find ways to attract
younger women, to modernize an organization many young people
associate with their mothers and grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   And she must untie another knot: Given Israel's relative
security and prosperity now, many younger Jews may not feel the
urgency of Zionism _ her group's fundamental mission _ that older
Jews recall from living through a violent and tumultuous century.
Zionism is a movement founded in 1879 to establish and keep a
Jewish homeland in what was Palestine, now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lipton wants to raise the image of volunteerism into
something more ``respectable,'' vibrant, and gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah has 306,000 members, up from 300,000 in 1995 but down
from 350,000 in the 1980s, said spokeswoman Roberta Elliott.
Comedian Sandra Bernhard is a member, as are several congresswomen.
</P>
<P>
   But more than half the membership is older than 61, and 20
percent is over 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with being in your mother's or
grandmother's organization,'' Lipton said. ``We have been around
almost 88 years. There is tradition, there is history. A path has
been carved by members and great leaders. It is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hadassah, young women join study groups to learn more about
Zionism, Judaism, US politics, and Israel. But the organization's
greatest effort lies with something Lipton says brings every Jewish
woman back to her roots: seeing Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is central to the Jewish people,'' said Susan Offit,
37, a member of the Boston-area Hadassah chapter for 12 years.
``This is for Jewish women my age. They are smart, they care about
Israel and the US, they care about each other. Hadassah is not
about older women; it's about Jewish women.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 5,000 Boston-area members, 2,000 are under age 45 and are
active in 14 different groups. They include lawyers, mothers with
toddlers, social workers, and singles.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a busy and public devotion to Judaism and Israel,
Lipton did not count on the recent personal tests of her character.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, 1998, Alan Lipton, whom she married almost 40 years
ago, had a serious skiing accident at Jiminy Peak in Western
Massachusetts. Five months earlier, Lipton had been told she had
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lipton, 59, survived but sustained severe brain damage. He
lives in a nursing home in his native Pittsfield, where the family
still has a home, unable to take care of himself or remember much.
</P>
<P>
   About her illness, she would only say that she was treated for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Lipton, also 59, travels four hours to Pittsfield from
her Manhattan office every weekend to be with her husband. The
couple has two daughters, ages 30 and 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband's fate is in God's hands,'' she said simply, in a
recent interview from Washington. ``He told me, `My heart is with
you,' and he said he is proud of me. But I don't know how much he
understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipton was born and raised in a Jewish neighborhood of Chicago
to liberal parents and orthodox grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   As did many Jewish parents of that generation, her elders spoke
Yiddish but never passed it on to her. She met her husband at
Purdue University in Indiana in the late 1950s, where she studied
English, Spanish, and history.
</P>
<P>
   Soul mates from the start, the couple were Jewish activists. She
succeeded him as president of three Jewish organizations, including
the Hillel Foundation, a university campus group. And together,
they presided over the school's United Jewish Appeal, which raises
money for Jewish causes.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1960. His mother gave her a $100 lifetime
membership to Hadassah _ which costs $250 now. Lipton became active
in the group when she moved with her husband in 1971 to Pittsfield,
where his family ran a steel and used-machinery business. She
became the Pittsfield chapter president in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Lipton has been one of the group's leading fund-raisers _
helping to bring in more than $100 million last year. She had been
chairman of the Hadassah Medical Organization.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its four-day annual convention this week, Hadassah
plans to give Hillary Rodham Clinton an award for her work with
children and families.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah, Hebrew for Esther, was founded in New York by
Henrietta Szold, the daughter of a Baltimore rabbi. The group did
its work in Palestine _ founding hospitals, bringing quinine to
sick workers in the mosquito-ridden Huleh Valley, and providing
pasteurized milk as part of a program called called Tipat Halav
(``a drop of milk'' in Hebrew) for babies. Szold died in Palestine
in 1948 just before the state was founded that year.
</P>
<P>
   Szold wanted to name the group after a Jewish heroine who had
done something important for her people, so it was named after
Queen Esther, who saved the Jews in Persia.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah's original work in health care has brought it a long
way. It now runs two hospitals, in Jerusalem and Ein Kerem, which
include a two-year-old pediatric and maternity pavilion, a new gene
therapy center, and a burn center.
</P>
<P>
   The group also helped establish and now codirects a medical
school at Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   Lipton hopes these vivid signs of the group's work will persuade
more younger women to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our projects are Zionism in action,'' she said. ``We are still
directly responsible for having an impact on the quality of life in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes Zionism as relevant today as it was when Henrietta
Szold started out,'' she said.

   TAKE-BOS  
 SANTA MONICA, Calif.: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those are idealistic forecasts, but you're not going to get any
precise numbers out of Atomic Pop and similar ventures. Teller
won't say how many copies of the Public Enemy album were downloaded
for purchase on line. The firm is privately funded, but honchos
won't say by whom and for how much.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the Cambridge-based research firm Forrester Research
predict that downloadable music will represent $1.1 billion of the
$15 billion recording industry by 2003. But observers aren't sure
that a revolution is imminent. ``The Net has yet to prove itself as
radically changing the economics of the music industry,'' says
Forrester senior analyst Mark Hardie. ``Atomic Pop is
forward-thinking, but I'm not sure it's the rising star in the
solar system of record companies.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Constant change &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a feeling of urgency around Atomic Pop
headquarters; energy infuses the place, and staffers seem as if
they're constantly on the verge of discovering the cure for
whatever ails the recording industry. ``We rethink our position on
a minute-to-minute basis,'' says Kristin Lieb, vice president of
business development. ``It's very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be in an industry that is changing faster than it
takes a slow-speed modem to download the Public Enemy CD. ``Hardly
a day goes by without some announcement,'' says Teller. In the last
two weeks alone, Sony and Time Warner purchased Internet music
retailer CDNow, combining it with their jointly owned music club
Columbia Records. Both EMI and Virgin Entertainment announced plans
to use in-store kiosks for digital distribution, and the pioneering
MP3.com went public last week, raising $7 billion in one day.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of leveling the playing field and empowering
artists, on-line music companies are cutting deals and issuing
initial public offerings, just like all the other Internet
start-ups. Is the revolution really about the one tangible thing
that has driven the traditional music industry all along _ that
thing called money? Do some Atomic Pop staffers have stock in the
company? ``Hell yes!'' exclaims Lieb, before adding, ``I don't
think our aim is to be acquired by some big monster of a company
that wants to make us boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, contend that the digital revolution is
entirely driven by money _ and that it's a risky business. Prophets
abound, but profits are absent, at least so far. ``Just because
some nerd in the basement has a better mousetrap, they think
they're going to put Time Warner out of business and steal Madonna:
Well, show me,'' says Mike Dreese, CEO and co-founder of Boston's
Newbury Comics. He says his company brought in only $500,000 on its
Web site, the same price it cost to develop. ``The Internet has yet
to break an artist. There are no gold records. Everyone is rushing
down this digital creek without a paddle,'' Dreese says.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to the folks at Atomic Pop, who are convinced
they have not only a better mousetrap, but a better mouse as well.
They call it a ``targeted music lifestyle destination'' that will
attract the young music-buying public. ``We're going after the
really oddball person, who watches kung fu movies, digs trash '70s
films, is into heavy metal and rap and reggae, and enjoys reading
comic books,'' says creative director Jim Evans. ``I'm targeting a
bizarre core and hoping to attact a larger pop-culture audience
without being too weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Serina Mayer, managing director of on-line operations, has a
slightly different take on the same concept. ``It's the equivalent
of walking down the coolest street of SoHo that has the best
bookstore, a music store with stuff you can't find anywhere else,
that great restaurant on the corner, and the movie house that shows
limited-release films,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the abstract, it sounds pretty fascinating, a multimedia
version of early on-line communities like the Well. But can such
virtual villages flourish at a time when the Internet is turning
into a giant shopping mall? ``The difference here is that in this
shopping mall anybody can set up a table,'' says Chuck D. ``In a
regular shopping mall, if you set up a table they'd get security
and kick your ass out. That's what the industry is trying to do.
But the thing about the Internet is that it's multinational, it's
interactive, and it's all over the world. The industry can't
sanction the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that ventures like Atomic Pop will transform the
planet, but change is inevitable. One thing is clear: Both
consumers and artists will have more options than ever before, even
if there aren't 5,000 record labels. ``I don't think this is the
end of the majors, but it is the start of a lot of small innovative
companies,'' says Hilary Rosen, president of the recording industry
association. ``Ultimately, consumers will determine the winners,
but I don't think the winners will be decided for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the folks at Atomic Pop plot their course.
They've signed seven artists to date _ hardly groundbreaking but,
then again, the company has been around for only five months.
``There is no question that sooner or later an artist will break on
line,'' says Teller. ``If something becomes a phenomenon on the
Net, it can spread around the world quite easily, like a benign
virus. It could be a tidal wave.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Teller talks about a revolution, he knows what
happens to radical movements. ``Today's revolutionaries are
tomorrow's establishment,'' he admits. For now, however, the folks
at Atomic Pop live by their mantra: Few rules. No limits.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Last weekend you could see Ross
Perot, live on C-Span from the small Reform Party convention in
Dearborn, Mich., still recycling stale criticism of the political
process and sounding as warm and fuzzy as a snare-drum staccato.
Fortunately, it was his swan song. He lost party control to
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's team, which wisely plans to field
someone else for president next year. By MARIANNE MEANS.

A SUMMER OF MORALITY TALES? 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America has its favorite M&AMP;M. It's called Movies &AMP; Morality. It
is playing _ if that's the word _ at a multiplex near you.
Hollywood is inadvertently doing its best to disarm critics by
unfurling a record number of films marked by stupefying degrees of
dullness or triviality, or both. Who can seriously argue that the
foundations of the Republic are being shattered by such would-be
taboo-busters and hot-button-pushers as ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
``American Pie,'' and ``South Park''? Certainly not anyone who has
seen the films, which have grossed millions and grossed out at
least thousands, in the case of the last two, and anesthetized
thousands more, in the case of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics of post-Littleton Hollywood are taking aim, an
easier thing to do than ever, given that nothing significant has
happened on the gun-control front, or is likely to. Movies have
always been an easier target than the National Rifle Association,
especially in a culture born of violence, expanded through
systematized violence toward indigenous peoples, cozy with the idea
of gun-barrel diplomacy long before movies were invented. The
take-the-spotlight-off-guns-and-shine-it-on-movies argument might
be rephrased as: Guns don't kill people, movies kill people. So
clamp down on movies and don't worry about guns. Never mind that
more than 60,000 people have been killed by firearms in the United
States since 1997, more than the US death total in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, according to the Chicago Tribune, there were 10,744
murders by firearms in the United States. People in other countries
mostly see the same violent movies we do. But in New Zealand there
were two gun murders in 1996. In Japan, 15. In Britain, 30. In
Canada, 106. In Germany, 213. And so on. The Tribune article
concludes that the numbers are directly proportional to the level
of gun regulation. Makes sense, unless you prefer to believe that
we are not all brothers and sisters under the skin, that human DNA
is subject to nationalism. The figures underline the irony of the
plot motor in ``South Park,'' which has outraged American parents
declaring war on Canada when a Colorado town's elementary and
preschool youngsters start talking dirty after seeing a Canadian
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' _ the
double-entendre-laden title somehow got by the ratings board _ has
been hailed in some quarters for what one critic called its
``inspired comic rudeness.'' My own enthusiasm for ``South Park''
was considerably more muted. I laughed at some of its envelope
pushing, but I found its selling point _ kids talking dirty while
pursuing the usual parent-bashing stereotyping of authority figures
as hypocritical, puritanical fools _ became boringly juvenile and
as blatantly manipulative as the usual Hollywood factory products
the film's enthusiastic critics regularly scorn on principle.
``South Park'' is nothing but rejiggered ``Ubu Roi.'' It puts the
id back in kid.
</P>
<P>
   Like most films aimed at younger ticket buyers, it sets up a
situation of authority figures trying to keep the lid on while kids
try to keep it off. I'm more for than against it because it's less
objectionable than any governmental controlling mechanism would be.
I write this knowing that a number of parents are going to cringe
at the language in ``South Park'' and will not be comfortable
watching it with their kids, especially pre-teens. I also can't get
too worked up about artists' rights in this context. Art exists to
push the envelope, to make us confront aspects of being human, to
express a deeply held personal view, whatever that view may be. By
this definition, most Hollywood films are not art.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood films are big, expensive manufactured objects sent out
into the world to make money. They do contribute to a pervasive
coarsening of life. ``South Park'' easily falls into this category.
Granted, it doesn't have the budget of ``Armageddon.'' Still, it's
a mercantile object, designed to drag a sagging TV show around the
track a few more times by injecting it with material that can't be
shown on the small screen. Which would be OK if it passed the test
of comedy, which is to make us laugh. But I spent as much time
wondering if ``South Park'' wasn't at least as much about baiting
the ratings board as about anything else. I found it more cynical
than liberating.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``South Park'' is alone in this depressing summer, in
which most of the energies on most of the screens seem to be
chasing the gross-out bonanza of last summer's ``There's Something
About Mary.'' The Farrelly brothers' film worked because it was
offset by the sunny sweetness of Cameron Diaz's Mary. If ever a
film could do with fewer flatulence and toilet jokes, it's ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' But again, it's redeemed as much
by the sweetness that comes through in Mike Myers alongside the
zaniness of his Austin and Dr. Evil's alter ego, Mini-Me. The trick
this summer obviously is to find some way to make the poop, or the
pee, or (to borrow a phrase from a filmmaker we'll get to in a
moment) the precious bodily fluids palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler doesn't bring it off in ``Big Daddy,'' currently
courting immortality with its urinating-on-a-wall scene. Partly
it's because he placates audiences with sentimentality, partly
because the sentimentality doesn't work. It's hard to reconcile the
I'm-the-boss-here look in his eyes with what's supposed to be the
shleppiness of the loser he's playing. And shleppiness is the
avenue for the bid for sympathy made by ``American Pie,'' this
summer's apparent front-runner in the precious-bodily-fluids
sweepstakes. Its will to dumbness is relentless, but it takes the
sting out of the two-dimensionality of its story about four high
school buddies who turn their desire to lose their virginity by
prom night into a competition.
</P>
<P>
   The four guys are orchestrated types, but they're brothers in
shleppiness, awkward, anxious, and vulnerable underneath their
locker-room bravado and big talk that doesn't fool anyone. They and
the script would get tedious pretty fast if it weren't for a couple
of pleasant surprises. For one thing, a few of the young women are
depicted as sexually autonomous, even though it's funny that the
one woman who frankly and openly enjoys sex isn't American. She's
an exchange student from Eastern Europe who's hustled back home on
a plane _ the slut! _ when she acts out what the guys would love to
but are too scared and inept to. The usual absence of parents and
other adult authority figures is diligently observed, except for
one boy's dad _ here's where ``American Pie'' pushes the envelope _
who isn't a complete fool to be totally despised. &QL;

`CITY' OPENS NEW VISTAS FOR MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Exactly 20 years ago, Steven Bochco broke
some ground on television by creating ``Paris,'' a drama that _
though short-lived _ stood out for its nuanced depiction of a black
police captain played by James Earl Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the TV industry is under a hail of criticism for
offering an overwhelmingly white slate of new shows, Bochco is
stepping into the breach again with ``City of Angels,'' a medical
drama whose mostly black cast includes Vivica A. Fox, Blair
Underwood, and Michael Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``City of Angels'' was developed long before the NAACP
protests, and though Bochco stressed Sunday that the show's focus
will not be on race relations but on the struggles of inner-city
doctors and nurses, he acknowledged he is ``very conscious of the
significance of the show'' in the current context.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the show succeeds, there will be many shows that follow,''
Bochco said during an interview session at the semiannual meeting
of the Television Critics Association. But if ``City of Angels''
flops, Bochco predicted that it could become ``more difficult, in
an economically driven industry,'' for networks to build shows
around minority protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   The co-executive producer, Paris Barclay, who is black, said the
underlying problem is that most of those creating shows and calling
the shots at the networks are ``white males . . . who live in
Malibu, Brentwood, or Bel Air. They don't know a lot of black
people and aren't interested in writing about them.'' Barclay, a
1979 Harvard graduate who won an Emmy for directing the ``Lost
Israel'' episode of ``NYPD Blue,'' contended television could offer
a more diverse picture to viewers simply by relying on a ``broader
range of usual suspects'' when hiring writers or casting actors.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample evidence that many minority actors in Hollywood
are chafing at their limited opportunities and thirsting for a
chance to prove themselves: Bochco said that when he and Barclay
were casting ``City of Angels,'' up to 10 qualified candidates
auditioned for each part.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this extraordinary talent pool underutilized in our
business,'' said Bochco. ``I was so struck by the gifted people who
were clamoring to do the tiniest roles.''
</P>
<P>
   As the diversity issue remained on the front burner Sunday, CBS
Television president Leslie Moonves told TV critics he is scheduled
to meet within the next month with NAACP president Kweisi Mfume. It
was Mfume who two weeks ago accused the networks of a ``virtual
whitewash'' because none of the 26 new programs slated for the fall
lineup (including six from CBS) featured minorities in what the
NAACP considers leading roles. ``City of Angels,'' an obvious
exception, is not scheduled to premiere on CBS until January, along
with two other midseason shows.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said he agrees with ``the position that the racial
composition of prime time needs to reflect the population as a
whole.'' But he strongly defended CBS's overall record, noting that
some of the network's biggest stars include Bill Cosby, Della
Reese, Arsenio Hall, and Sammo Hung. Of 19 prime-time entertainment
series on CBS, Moonves said, 12 feature minorities in significant
roles, and a Latino character has just been added to the new
``Family Law.'' (Moonves also announced that popular Latino singer
Ricky Martin will star in a musical special in November.) As for
the absence of minority leads in the new shows, Moonves said
several programs starring minority actors were developed but none
made it on the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When ``City of Angels'' premieres, it will mark a return to a
regular role on series television for Michael Warren, who also
appeared on ``Paris'' but is best known as officer Bobby Hill on
Bochco's ``Hill Street Blues.'' Warren said Sunday that his
experience working with Bochco had long ago convinced him that ``if
anybody could make a show where it presented quote-unquote
minorities as human beings, it was Steven.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco made clear he intends to do just that. As the story of
``City of Angels'' unfolds, he said, ``the color of the characters
is very quickly going to recede in importance.'' That would appear
to suit Underwood (formerly of ``L.A. Law''), who maintained Sunday
that ``the reason a lot of black-themed dramas have not worked in
the past . . . is they've been too specific to the black experience
every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bochco is clearly aware that the ground has
shifted and the stakes have risen for ``City of Angels'' because of
the current spotlight on diversity. ``Issues of race will
inevitably leak through the fabric of this show,'' he said.

FIRE IN THE SKY: THE TWA FLIGHT 800 INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE 
The FBI Investigation of TWA Flight 800 
Random House. 368 pp. Illustrated. $26.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island three
years ago caused unimaginable heartache for thousands of people on
both sides of the Atlantic and spawned enough conspiracy theories
to keep paranoid conversations going late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747-100 went down on July 17, 1996, shortly after
taking off from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport
bound for Paris. Investigators have determined that the center fuel
tank _ with vapors heated from air-conditioning packs running
underneath the tank as the plane sat for three hours on the tarmac
in New York _ exploded, killing all 230 people on board. But they
do not know what caused the vapors in the nearly empty tank to
ignite. It remains one of aviation's great unsolved mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for the solution in Pat Milton's ``In the Blink
of an Eye'' will be disappointed. In fact, anyone looking for
anything other than praise for James Kallstrom, the special agent
in charge of the FBI's New York office and who led the criminal
investigation into the accident, should take a pass on the book,
subtitled appropriately enough, ``The FBI Investigation of TWA
Flight 800.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Milton admits in her foreword that the book has no
answers. In fact, it does not even ``propose a theory of why Flight
800 exploded in the sky off Long Island.'' Instead, it tells, in
meticulous detail but too often in redundant fashion (at least four
times in the first 100 pages we are told that the investigation was
either the largest in FBI history, the most complex in FBI history,
or both) how the FBI went about trying to prove negatives: that
neither friendly fire nor an act of terrorism caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   There are two serious flaws in the book, neither of which are
entirely Milton's fault. First, it is written as a police thriller,
but there is no moment of good vanquishing evil, of clever law
enforcement officials finding a way to nab the bad guy. One longs
for the type of ingenuity and bravado of FBI agents in other
investigations mentioned by Milton.
</P>
<P>
   When writing about agent Joe Cantamessa, for example, strolling
through the press camp at East Moriches, N.Y., in an effort to find
out how the media was able to so quickly learn body counts (they
were using scanners to monitor cell phone calls) she writes: ``His
smooth talk and nothing-is-impossible attitude had enabled him to
place a tiny microphone in Mafia boss Paul Castellano's television
set while bodyguards stood nearby. Posing as a television repairman
to fix a set made fuzzy by Kallstrom and his crew, Cantamessa
invited the two thugs to look over his shoulder `so you don't think
I'm pulling anything funny here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the massive loss of life and the initial reports that a
missile or bomb probably brought down the plane were so traumatic
to the nation that the basic details of the crash (and even some of
the conspiracy theories) are well known to many Americans. As a
result, there are few surprises in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the book, such as Kallstrom's relationship with the
family of a young boy _ one of 16 teenagers from Montoursville,
Pa., on the flight _ who dreamed of becoming an FBI agent, are
well-written and moving. Milton also does a very good job writing
about the reaction of members of the investigation team upon seeing
the reconstructed jet and its interior. But Milton, a veteran
Associated Press reporter based in New York who covered the crash,
goes too far in describing some of the victims' bodies. The detail
is neither moving nor relevant, but simply disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   For the conspiracy theorist, the book may put to rest the
assertion that a US military accident turned the jumbo jet into a
fireball. After numerous requests to the Pentagon, agents got a
list of all military assets in the area. Their positions were
verified by radar and satellite images. In the case of the USS
Normandy, for example, which was 181 miles away from Flight 800,
agents got the serial numbers of all weapons loaded on the ship on
July 16 and then boarded the ship and saw all the weapons on board,
and matched the serial numbers, even though the Normandy was out of
range to hit the airplane. The book recounts similar painstaking
efforts to determine if a bomb or a missile was responsible, and if
any passenger or Kennedy Airport worker could have caused the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking for a good whodunit, there is little
satisfaction, unfortunately, in reading again and again that
evidence of one sort or another (or the lack of it in the form of
pitting or petalling of the aluminum skin of the aircraft, which
would indicate a bomb or missile) resulted in suspects being
dropped and theories being abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Milton's lauding of Kallstrom is so effusive that it borders on
hero worship. It not only strains credulity but also diminishes the
man's considerable accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the night of the crash, when National Security Council
officials were huddled in Washington determining how best to
respond to what seemed like a certain act of terrorism, and the FBI
in New York was the lead investigative agency. Should not the
apparent threat to America, the loss of 230 innocent lives, be
motivation enough for professionals charged with finding out what
brought down the plane? Not for Milton, who writes: ``By the time
Kallstrom strode in, the Command Post was up and running. Some
twenty-five agents were already at their stations. The boss's
presence charged the room; you could see the difference in the way
the agents seemed to come to attention as he entered. Kallstrom was
a bear of a man brimming with fierce energy, whose sparkling green
eyes invariably flashed the message: We'll win, I promise.'' In
another part of the book, Milton states, ``Kallstrom was one of the
few in the bureau with a thorough understanding of computer
technology,'' a statement that defies logic, and, if true,
indicates serious trouble for the war on crime.
</P>
<P>
   The book does a good job of capturing Kallstrom's indefatigable
attempt to find the answer, and his battle with the National
Transportation Safety Board to reconstruct the entire plane in
order to be able to look for a telltale sign of a missile or bomb.
The NTSB was initially against the idea because they believed the
cause to be mechanical and that reconstructing the plane would be
too costly and labor intensive.
</P>
<P>
   The book is factually inaccurate in many small points, which may
be a minor irritation for some, and a reason for others to put it
aside. For example, it says: ``One 747-100, exactly like Flight
800, had been converted for use as Air Force One to carry the
president.'' The Air Force has two Boeing 747s for presidential
transport, and both are 200B series models, which have more power
and range than the 100 series.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most startling, since the book spends much time
discussing terrorism and aviation, is Milton's assertion that ``the
Libyan terrorists who downed Pan Am Flight 103 had chosen the front
cargo hold.'' That would be a nifty trick indeed, considering that
the baggage that contained the bomb was checked in Malta on a
different airline, and then transferred to Pan Am in Frankfurt for
Flight 103. And when that flight got to London, there was another
change of planes.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the book seems more like the official FBI version of the
accident and its investigation, blessed with the imprimatur of an
objective journalist. But Milton threw her objectivity to the wind.
After all, one of the main beneficiaries of the tragedy was the FBI
itself, which saw its budget increased, the number of agents swell,
and its powers grow, all as a result of the perceived terrorist
threat in the wake of the Flight 800. Milton considered that fact
worthy of one sentence.

CONTESTED SENATE PRIMARY MAY LEAVE NEW YORK GOP BLOODIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The announcement by Rep. Rick Lazio that he will
run for New York's opening U.S. Senate seat heightens the
possibility of a bloody Republican primary next year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made in a letter sent to the state's 62
Republican Party and 54 Conservative Party county leaders, signals
that the four-term Long Island congressman is prepared to take on
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the GOP nomination. Such a
primary would split the Republican vote and make an easy victory
for the likely Democratic nominee, First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, recent polls have shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made my decision _ I will be a candidate for the U.S.
Senate,'' Lazio, 41, wrote in his letter last week, copies of which
were also was sent to state GOP Chairman Bill Powers and state
Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long. ``This was not a decision I
made lightly ... it's clear to me that New Yorkers want a senator
who cares about them and their problems, not someone who is
interested in a stepping stone to higher office.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an apparent dig at both Giuliani and Clinton, both of
whom are said to be interested in other elected positions _
including the presidency _ in the future. Neither Giuliani nor
Clinton has officially entered the race for the seat being vacated
by retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, but both have
launched ``exploratory campaigns'' and have kicked off fund-raising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio will officially enter the race the week of Aug. 16,
according to his letter.
</P>
<P>
   National and state Republicans continue to discourage a primary
for the Senate, particularly in the face of Clinton's
all-but-official candidacy _ a historic run for a sitting first
lady. Political observers believe a contest between Lazio and
Giuliani is actually the result of an interparty power struggle
between the mayor and Republican Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The two have shared, at best, a tense relationship since
Giuliani endorsed then-Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo over Pataki's
successful gubernatorial bid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But in one highly speculative scenario, some observers believe
Giuliani would back out of running for the Senate against Lazio, a
Pataki protegee, and instead run for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has officially resisted favoring any of its
potential candidates until they formally announce their intentions
to run. A third Republican hopeful, U.S. Rep. Peter King, is also
considering running for Senate, and has said his chances of
entering the race stand at 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   The election _ particularly if high-profile candidates like
Clinton and Giuliani decide to run _ could cost the candidates as
much as $40 million, observers have said. With 16 months to go
before the general election, Lazio has so far raised $3.2 million,
according to his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani continues his campaigning with a fund-raising trip to
Arkansas on Tuesday, while Clinton will resume her upstate
``listening tour'' on Thursday in Elmira. She will also travel to
Bath and Ithaca over her three-day travels, according to her
campaign aides.

 UNDATED: ... totally despised.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the reasons ``American Pie'' is finding such favor, I
suspect, is that it's so unthreatening beneath its surface
unruliness, so reassuringly old-fashioned. It's a rite-of- passage
film that differs only from the old ``Andy Hardy'' films in that it
takes place in a time of greater openness and frankness about
bodily functions. Even its bid for pop-culture deathlessness, the
sex-with-an-apple-pie scene, isn't the breakthrough that some of
its easy-to-impress devotees claim. As the New York Observer
pointed out last week, a generation ago it was raw liver in
``Portnoy's Complaint.'' Plus ca change, etc. The thing about raw
liver or apple pie, one supposes, is that while the conversational
level may never sparkle, you don't have to look your best.
</P>
<P>
   While it is often observed that violence is as American as apple
pie, we now may be trembling on the brink of a millennium when sex
may be, too. If, that is, Stanley Kubrick's unintended valedictory,
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' doesn't shut sex down entirely for a while.
While I can't claim anything like expertise on the subject of
orgies, I can say I've attended wakes that were sexier than the
glum orgy into which Tom Cruise's character is plunged in a fit of
self-induced ego bolstering in ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' It's unfair (but
who said life was fair?) to freight with an undue weight of
expectation what Kubrick thought was going to be only his next
film. But not only does ``Eyes Wide Shut'' fail to seem anything
like a climax to Kubrick's career, it's an outright disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about Kubrick's work was that it was
spectacularly uneven. This is a compliment. It means he didn't just
try to keep making the same film. What's surprising about ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' isn't that it unsparingly exposes the limits of the
acting abilities of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (that was to be
expected), but that it seems so out of touch with the times. To
some degree this was inevitable, given the film's source in a
novella by Arthur Schnitzler, the fin-de-siecle Viennese who wrote
it in part to rationalize and think positively of his own
womanizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is surprisingly sexist. The men go off and
have sex. The women either stay home and dream about it, like the
frustrated wife Kidman plays, or go out and play the game as the
men do, and die for it, while the guys walk away unscathed. Worse,
the film oscillates between tinny hysteria and lugubrious lethargy.
There's no sexual energy, no sexual impulse, perhaps inevitable in
retrospect when you consider that sex is the most ungovernable
impulse and Kubrick was the most controlling of filmmakers. To sit
through ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and reflect that Kubrick thought he had
a dangerous film here is what's saddest. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Primal ``Project'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The summer's biggest sense of danger, as it happens, is coming
from its smallest, least expensive film. ``The Blair Witch
Project'' is the latest example of film's ability to renew itself.
With minimal resources, it tells us we're watching footage shot by
three filmmakers who disappeared in the woods when they went to get
the story on a mythical witch. Borrowing pages from Lang and
Hitchcock and Jacques Tourneur, it scares us not with buckets of
gore and special effects, but with dread. It makes us afraid of
what we don't see, but seems lurking nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the film makes us its collaborators in a time when
most other films distance us by throwing at us stuff we know is
contrived. When horror movies, especially the ones starring
teenagers, were about to dissolve in irony and self-referential
artifice, ``The Blair Witch Project'' yanks us back to the genre's
primal beginnings. It makes most of what passes for hot stuff in
Hollywood seem jaded and laughable. For example, because it's
closest at hand, the overblown reaction to the so-called sex in
``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   To get an NC-17 rating changed to an R, Kubrick had to come up
with what amounted to 65 seconds of, in effect, digital fig leaves.
Kubrick inserted computerized caped figures to mask background sex
acts in the orgy scene. Given the deadliness of the scene and the
film, it hardly mattered. Ultimately, it's not ``Eyes Wide Shut''
that is making this a summer where the films are cruder than the
ratings system. Clearly, the system we have doesn't give people
enough information in a time when filmmakers are growing ever more
adept at blurring the line between R and PG-13. Why did ``American
Pie'' get an R while the no-less-crude ``Austin Powers'' got a
PG-13? Search me.
</P>
<P>
   It's not getting any easier for parents to do their traditional
job of setting limits. One thing that might help is adding to
ratings a variety of numbers, say 12 or 16 or 17, not just 13. But
then someone 12 years old may be more mature than someone 16.
Perhaps the R rating, so vague as to be useless, could be replaced
by V (for violence) or L (for language) or S (for sex), or any
combination of those. It would give parents more to work with in a
day when policing movies has grown more difficult, too.
</P>
<P>
   When I was young and underage, it was easy enough to find an
adult to buy me tickets to movies I wasn't allowed to see. Today
it's even easier, given multiplexes. Kids can buy a ticket to one
movie, then, once inside, see another. How many kids buying tickets
to, say, ``Tarzan,'' actually see ``Tarzan''? The pressure to have
movie theater owners police kids won't work, especially when the
policing comes down to ushers scarcely older than the kids they're
supposed to be policing. Asking theaters to police moviegoing is
like asking the NRA to regulate guns. Besides, while movies may
contribute (just how much is debatable) to an overall
desensitizing, they aren't the cause. Ask me the cause of the
devaluing of human life, and I'd reply ``Runaway materialism.'' But
that's another column.

MUSIC LINKS THE ATOMIC POP MEMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Like entrepreneurs at other Internet
start-ups, the folks who work at Atomic Pop, or the ``21st Century
Music Company,'' combine a renegade spirit with the good old
capitalist desire to make piles of money. The difference is that
everyone has a genuine passion for music: The programmers show up
with guitars slung over their shoulders. ``There's a culture
here,'' says Serina Mayer, managing director of on-line operations.
``We are like-minded individuals who are really passionate about
changing the way the industry works.''
</P>
<P>
   These aren't your typical computer geeks who rhapsodize about
poems written in Perl, a programming language. Take creative
designer Jim Evans. The lanky artist has never really lived by
anybody else's rules in his long, eclectic career in the music
business. He has drawn underground comics, designed album jackets
and rock posters, produced interactive press kits, and created Web
sites for such acts as the Beastie Boys and the Tibetan Freedom
Concert. At 51, he surfs in the summer and snowboards in the
winter; he plays in a band and collects robots all year round. He
not only designs the Web site; he's also a member of its target
audience, age notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Web site is a lot like a circus,'' says Evans, who considers
himself a perpetual teenager. ``It's all about attracting
attention. You see the attractions and you hear the rides. You
smell popcorn and cotton candy and suddenly you're hungry. The Web
is the same way: It's very impulsive.''
</P>
<P>
   He aims to translate that feeling of sensory overload to the
site, which offers a myriad of options for the most casual
browsers. A radio station broadcasts four channels, including one
that offers a ``sonic feast'' to accompany ``the sun setting on a
dying century.'' There are sections devoted to articles and
reviews, as well as on-line comics. There's a store where folks can
buy music, gizmos, and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Evans's piece de resistance is a modification for the popular
video game Quake II. It's called Atomic Pop Panic, and its message
is hardly subtle. In the game, a sound engineer named Dr. Atomic
must save the world from invading aliens who are posing as
entertainment executives. The aliens, called Hit Men, are turning
people into zombies by planting subliminal messages in radio
broadcasts. ``Submit to our will. Buy our records. Become our
slaves,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what the company was about, and it's important to
have a metaphor,'' Evans says.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor reflects Atomic Pop's corporate culture, as well as
its mythology. The industry plays the evil enemy, while Atomic Pop
gets to be the superhero. The folks around here won't tell you that
in so many words, but they clearly believe it. And so does Chuck D,
the socially conscious rapper who once subscribed to the motto
``Don't believe the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most refreshing environment I've ever witnessed as
far as the music industry is concerned,'' says Chuck D, who
lambastes the industry in controversial tracks on his new album.
``It's like, hey, let's do this together. Let's make a statement.
Let's change the business. Super-corporations want to turn people
into zombies and robots.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D has never shied away from controversy, and he's Atomic
Pop's most public defender. His stamp of approval persuaded rapper
Ice-T to sign with Atomic Pop. Ice-T, who self-censored his album
``Body Count'' after Time Warner was pressured by protests about
the song ``Cop Killer,'' sees the Internet as the ultimate forum
for free speech. ``They go through your lyrics, and it curbs your
creativity,'' he says of the major labels. ``You just feel the
tension having to go through that bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   His upcoming album, ``Seven Deadly Sins,'' will be distributed
uncensored by Atomic Pop, although sample songs on line include the
same parental-discretion labels that his albums carry in
traditional retail outlets. That's an Internet first, but Ice-T,
who isn't really a hot button these days, doesn't mind. ``That's
cool. I don't want anyone to get scared,'' he says. ``Ice-T is
still knocking out firsts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice-T blends right into the culture of like-minded individuals
at Atomic Pop. Modesty isn't in the corporate vocabulary, and
ambition is a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think in terms of the world we can help build and what the
impact is going to be on society,'' says Mayer. ``In the on-line
world, there is no gender. There are no boundaries. There is no
time. It doesn't matter if you're male, female, black, white,
Asian, or 6 feet tall. It's an open space.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of gung-ho idealism you're likely to hear in the
Atomic Pop offices. But every culture has its iconoclast. ``You're
not going to find salvation in the computer, and you have to be
careful,'' Evans says. ``I don't even want to think about where
this technology is going to lead humanity. It's a dark future.''
Now, that sounds like a mission for Dr. Atomic.

NEW YORK'S DAKOTA SET PACE FOR APARTMENT LIVING IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We might think of apartment buildings as
something that evolved in the 20th century, but structures built
exclusively as apartment houses have been around for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In large cities like Paris, New York City or ancient Rome, with
dense populations, communal living became a way of life for a great
deal of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Because of space limitations, creating more than one living
space per building made sense. Ancient Romans built multistory
apartment blocks, called an insula. These existed at least as early
as the third century B.C., according to ``The Ancient City: Life in
Classical Athens &AMP; Rome,'' by Peter Connolly and Hazel Dodge
(McGraw-Hill). Some blocks, which have been found to echo today's
traditional house design, were designed for wealthy occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, many of these apartment structures were often cheaply
constructed and poorly built, making them very dangerous for their
inhabitants,'' said Doug Bucher, architectural preservationist,
author and architect with John G. Waite Associates in Albany. ``The
structure was very much like what we consider an apartment house
today in that they were often three to five stories high. Sometimes
the first floor was used as commercial space. The owner of the
bakery might live upstairs above the shop with renters in the
floors above that.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of high-rise apartment blocks lived on through
18th-century Europe, where they became very common in Paris and
Vienna. Only the wealthy could afford town houses, and the rule
was, the richer the owner, the wider and taller the town house.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Napoleonic Era of the 19th century it became very
unfashionable to live in an apartment building,'' Bucher said.
``Back then the blocks were divided horizontally by social class.''
</P>
<P>
   The ground floor was commercial space, the mezzanine was used
for either the owner or servants. The next level, called the
pianonoble, was considered the main floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main floor was often adorned with big windows and iron
balconies,'' Bucher said. ``Then as you went higher, the floors
grew lesser in importance, till you reached the garret.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where the lower class, including students and struggling
artists, lived.
</P>
<P>
   With no elevators, residents walked up dark staircases to reach
their living quarters, which were extremely hot in summer and
freezing in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment house wasn't developed in this country until the
mid-19th century, in New York City and Boston. Before that, early
American inns brought together groups of unrelated people in one
building for shorter lengths of time.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the apartment house was brought to America in the
1850s by Richard Morris Hunt, the architect of New York's Tribune
Tower (an unprecedented 11 stories at the time) and the first
American to graduate from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt's first apartment building was constructed on West 10th
Street in Manhattan in 1857, according to Bucher. It contained
apartments and large studio space for artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having prestigious artists, such as Frederick Church, Winslow
Homer and John LaFarge, living in these grand studio spaces made it
immediately acceptable to live in an apartment,'' Bucher said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1860s, Hunt was commissioned by Stuyvesant
Rutherfurd to convert a row of town houses on 18th Street near
Irving Place into ``French flats,'' as they were called in Paris.
Despite being poorly laid out, the Stuyvesant was an immediate
success, according to author Stephen Birmingham in his 1979 book,
``Life at the Dakota'' (Syracuse University Press), a history of
one of this country's earliest and largest apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural historians consider the Stuyvesant to be the first
real apartment building for the middle class. Hunt experimented
with new ideas of living in a city as building costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1880s and '90s, large imposing hotels had also been built
for the wealthy class, such as the million-dollar St. Nicholas,
which boasted the unheard-of luxury of central hot-air heating,
according to Birmingham's book. The Metropolitan Hotel was equally
costly and sumptuous and contained 100 suites of family apartments,
which could be leased as permanent residences.
</P>
<P>
   From 1884 to 1887, the Dakota was built by the newly rich
millionaire Edward Clark, of the Singer sewing partnership and
fortune, as one of the first grand apartment buildings. It was said
that the massive apartment building, at 72nd Street and what is now
Central Park West, was as far removed from the mainstream in 1884
as the Dakota Territory. Clark found it humorous and the name
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakota was a trailblazer, for before it was built, affluent
New Yorkers thought it was lower class to live in an apartment,
Birmingham said in a telephone interview from his home in
Cincinnati. ``If you were respectable, you lived in a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some well-known tenants of the Dakota have
included Boris Karloff, Zachery Scott, Leonard Bernstein and John
Lennon, whose widow, Yoko Ono, still lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's an historic landmark, the Dakota can't be changed
on the outside,'' Birmingham said. ``But the inside has been
changed every-which-way over the years, as suites were combined to
make larger quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   As had long been the case in Europe, the best apartments were on
the ground, or ``principal'' floor, wrote Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   But the invention of the elevator not only allowed buildings to
become taller, but took the drudgery out of having to walk to the
higher floors, which often provided the best views and cleaner air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it became easier to get to the top floor, it became
fashionable to live there,'' Bucher said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! ``The Dinner Game'' Deft, frothy transfer to film of a hit
French stage farce about a contemptuous Parisian who invites a
lowly civil servant to dinner, where he plans to roast the poor
slob. Instead, he finds his own life starts flying apart when the
mild-mannered stooge, without ever seeming to work at it, turns out
to be the loosest of loose cannons. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !! 1/2 ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' This satire of smalltown beauty
pageants has nice black comedy instincts, even if it doesn't quite
know what to do with its stereotypes once it brings them on.
Kirsten Dunst's trailer park hopeful, Ellen Barkin as her besotted
but loving mother, Allison Janney as their earthy neighbor, Denise
Richards as the rich girl favored to win the competition and
Kirstie Alley as her domineering mom all have their moments though.
(PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``The Haunting'' Lame remake of the 1963 film based on
Shirley Jackson's novel about three unstable insomniacs who don't
realize they've signed on for an experiment in terror in a New
England robber baron's gloomy old mansion. The special effects
completely overwhelm Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili
Taylor, but never convincingly. Your house is probably scarier.
(PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Inspector Gadget'' Entertaining kids' movie, lively yet
safely innocuous, based on the animated TV series about a lowly
security guard left for dead by a bad guy, and rebuilt as a bionic
cop, with all sorts of handy attachments, by a murdered scientist's
brainy daughter. Matthew Broderick is sympathetic and likable as
the robocop, Joely Fisher contributes scatty charm as his savior
and Rupert Everett sneers stylishly as the villain who hasn't got a
chance against them. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! ``Lovers on the Bridge'' Not so much a great film, but a great
folly that wins us over, at least at the outset, by the
extravagance of Leos Carax's romantic gesturing. His film about two
outsiders, Denis Lavant's vagabond and Juliette Binoche's painter
fleeing her bourgeois family but going blind, has a great moment
when they steal a police launch and water-ski on the Seine during
Paris' bicentennial fireworks party. But this film, shot in 1991
and getting a belated release after having built a cult following,
gets bogged down in tedium and sentimentality. (R)

NEW YORK TAKING MORE SERIOUS LOOK AT TEEN DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Responding to the high rate of teen-age driving
accidents, safety advocates and state legislators in New York are
considering plans to change the licensing process and raise the
minimum legal age to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals underscore what insurance companies have long
known _ that teen drivers are far more likely than any other
category of motorist to die in an automobile crash. Driving
accidents, according to the National Center for Health Statistics,
are the leading cause of death among teen-agers, totaling 5,248, or
nearly 36 percent, of the 14,663 youths ages 15 to 19 who died in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although teens hold only 5 percent of the driver's licenses in
the United States, they represent 14 percent of the driving
fatalities. In New York, where teens account for 4 percent of the
licensed drivers, they represent more than 12 percent of all
driving fatalities, according to national data for 1997, the most
recent year available.
</P>
<P>
   As drivers grow older, the odds of fatality in nearly all
situations that could reflect inexperience or irresponsibility _
speeding, drunken driving and nighttime driving _ fall steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Some say all this points to a need to give young drivers more
experience before giving them full driving privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely the riskiest category,'' said Marta
Genovese, chairwoman of the legislative committee of the Automobile
Association of America's New York chapter. ``It's immaturity and
experience, this kind of sense of invincibility that the young
have, combined with their lack of training.''
</P>
<P>
   Young drivers don't necessarily disagree. Standing nervously in
front of New York Department of Motor Vehicles office in Albany as
she awaited a test for her junior license, 17-year-old Valerie Munn
of Albany said she worries about getting on the road with some
other young drivers, particularly boys, who tend to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people out there are stupid drivers,'' she said. ``I
wonder how they got their license.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem, Genovese said, is a lack of
behind-the-wheel experience. Since 1975, the AAA found, high school
driver education classes have declined by half. The classes are the
victim, Genovese said, of budget constraints and the finding that
graduates of the programs did not appear to have better records
than those who didn't take the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, driving conditions have changed, she noted. Young
drivers today face more congested roads and are more likely to come
up against a minivan or a sport utility vehicle in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same world we were learning to drive in 20 years
ago,'' Genovese said.
</P>
<P>
   And the regulations on granting licenses are also changing.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 states, including California, Florida, New Jersey
and Massachusetts, have instituted stricter ``graduated licensing''
requirements _ making teens wait longer between each step of the
process from permit to license.
</P>
<P>
   New York is considering similar reforms, noting that the changes
elsewhere have achieved results. In a recent report, the state
Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Florida, for example, saw a
9 percent drop from 1995-97 after implementing a graduated
licensing program, while Oregon achieved a 16 percent reduction in
crashes for young male drivers, the highest-risk category.
</P>
<P>
   Other states saw reductions in teen crashes of around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, 16-year-olds who pass a written test are allowed to
get a learner's permit, which allows the teen to drive when
accompanied by another licensed driver. Any time after obtaining
the permit, a driver can take a road test to get a junior license,
which allows driving between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where young drivers can now graduate from a junior to senior
license as early as age 17 if they successfully complete a school
driver's education course, proposed legislation would have them
wait until they are 17 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, youngsters with learner's permits would have to be
supervised by a parent or a licensed driver over 21 with written
parental consent. Teens would also have to produce certification
from their parents that they received 30 hours of driving
experience before obtaining a license.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the bill, said John DiVito, an aide to state Sen. Owen
Johnson of Babylon, is that teens ``are dramatically
overrepresented in accidents and crashes and fatalities. Most kids
go out on their 16th birthday and get a learner's permit and go out
the next week and get a junior license. That's not nearly enough
time to learn how to drive a car.''

   There are several proposals in the Assembly, but a bill by
Deborah Glick of Manhattan, appears to be the most favored. In
addition to the six-month waiting periods, supervisory conditions
and minimum training hours Gov. George Pataki and the Senate
propose, Glick's bill would extend the waiting periods an
additional six months if the holder of a learner's permit or junior
license commits a serious traffic violation _ speeding 15 mph over
the posted limit, driving erratically, tailgating, and other
actions that could lead to an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Glick said that with the bill being discussed among the two
houses and DMV staff, she was still holding out hope for a vote on
it this year. Reaction so far, she said, appears positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've gotten from people is, `When is this going to
happen?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Legislature languishing over a budget impasse,
DiVito and others say it may be at least a year before the bill
moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still appear to be a number of people in Albany that do
not recognize the gravity of the problem,'' said Genovse of the
AAA.

   The Sound Era in film began on Oct. 6, 1927, when ``The Jazz
Singer'' opened. The Sound Era in film books began on Aug. 13,
1962, when Francois Truffaut and Helen Scott began the six days of
interviews with Alfred Hitchcock that resulted in Truffaut's
``Hitchcock'' (Touchstone, $20). Something there is in moviegoers
that likes talk _ between covers as well as on screen. A smattering
of examples gives an idea of how extensive the genre is. There are
the three ``Backstory'' volumes of interviews with screenwriters
that Patrick McGilligan has edited for the University of California
Press. The University Press of Mississippi has its ``Conversations
with Filmmakers'' series. John Kobal's delightful ``People Will
Talk'' is out of print, but Peter Bogdanovich has turned the
film-interview genre into a cottage industry, with ``Who the Devil
Made It,'' ``John Ford,'' and ``This Is Orson Welles.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the genre is Truffaut on Hitchcock. Film books are
necessarily labors of love. How else explain an author undertaking
the awkward task of translation required to put images into words?
Perhaps no other book about the movies has been quite so lovestruck
as Truffaut's, a work suffused with love of movies, love of
Hitchcock, and most of all, of course, love of Hitchcock movies.
And who better to interview a great director than another? Truffaut
was well aware his greatness was of a lesser magnitude, and one of
his book's many charms is the deference, unto worshipfulness,
author displays toward subject. This can make for a certain loopy
imbalance in the dialogue. The relationship is less acolyte and
priest than acolyte and pope.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this very reverence on Truffaut's part surely accounts
for why Hitchcock (a notoriously unforthcoming man) is so
expansive. Talking about technique, let alone talking about
technique with an admiring peer, he relaxes and reveals as nowhere
else. One can almost feel his glee as he describes how he got that
serving of milk to look so sinister in ``Suspicion'' (``I put a
light right inside the glass'') or how the cropdusting sequence in
``North by Northwest'' came to be (the classic movie scene of
someone about to be murdered is always dark and claustral, so
Hitchcock decided to put Cary Grant in a horizonless field at
midday). Best of all is the moment when they're discussing the
success of ``Psycho'' at the box office, and Hitchock declares with
equal parts pride and avuncularity, ``And that's what I'd like you
to do _ a picture that would gross millions of dollars throughout
the world!''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine de Baecque and Serge Toubiana's ``Truffaut: A
Biography'' (Knopf, $30) gives a behind-the-scenes look at this
summit meeting of cinema. During his days as a critic, Truffaut had
interviewed Hitchcock several times in Paris. ``Whenever I see ice
cubes in a glass of whiskey I think of you,'' Hitchcock had told
him once, a remark Truffaut cherished. He wrote a long letter
proposing the book to Hitchcock, noting, ``If, overnight, the
cinema had to do without its soundtrack and become once again a
silent art . . . everyone would realize at last that (you are) the
greatest film director in the world.'' Is it any wonder Hitchcock
instantly cabled his assent? Some 40 hours of interviews were taped
at Hitchcock's office-bungalow at Universal Studios in Los Angeles,
with Scott translating Truffaut's questions into English and
Hitchcock's replies into French. That unwieldiness carried over
into the publishing process, and it would be another four years
before the ``Hitchbook,'' as Truffaut called it, appeared in print.
A genre was born.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorite among film-interview books is Joseph McBride's
``Hawks on Hawks'' (University of California Press, $15.95).
Hollywood has known no finer storyteller onscreen than Howard
Hawks; and on the evidence here, he didn't do too badly in person,
either. There is, for a particularly splendid example, this account
of a car trip in the company of Clark Gable and William Faulkner.
``We were coming through Palm Springs, and the talk was about
writing. Gable asked Faulkner who the good writers were. And
Faulkner said, `Thomas Mann, Willa Cather, John Dos Passos, Ernest
Hemingway, and myself.' Gable looked at him and said, `Oh, do you
write, Mr. Faulkner?' And Faulkner said, `Yeah. What do you do, Mr.
Gable?' I don't think Gable ever read a book, and I don't think
Faulkner ever went to see a movie. So they might have been on the
level.'' The exchange is priceless _ whether embellished or not _
but what's so Hawksian is that ``on the level'' coda and the way
it's simultaneously casual, knowing, and unexpected. Not that Hawks
himself was much for being on the level. One reason his stories
read so well is that the man was an inveterate liar, as Todd
McCarthy makes all too plain in ``Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of
Hollywood'' (Grove/Atlantic, $35). True, playing fast and loose is
an occupational hazard of storytellers _ and filmmakers, who get to
tell their stories with movie stars and millions of dollars, are
unusually prone to this failing. But in dissembling, as in
directing, Hawks would seem in a class of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to the genre, Jeff Young's ``Kazan: The
Master Director Discusses His Films. Interviews with Elia Kazan''
(Newmarket Press, $32.95), operates under a unique disadvantage.
Young, himself a budding film director, approached his idol, Kazan,
in 1971 to see if he'd be willing to discuss craft. Somewhat to
Young's surprise, Kazan agreed. They talked off and on for the next
18 months, and Young got some first-rate stuff. ``If you're going
to talk to me about life, talk to me about life,'' Kazan announces.
``Don't talk to me about technique.'' It's a statement that
describes everything that's good, and much of what's bad, in his
films. Even better, he manages to define his practice of filmmaking
in all of six words: ``Directing is turning psychology into
behavior.'' From Brando and Vivien Leigh having at it in
``Streetcar'' to Brando and Rod Steiger in the backseat of that
famous taxi in ``On the Waterfront'' to James Dean atop a freight
train curled up in a fetal position in ``East of Eden,'' it's all
there in that sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan talked on one condition: that Young do nothing with the
interviews until the publication of Kazan's autobiography. Bad
enough (for Young) that that turned out to be 15 years down the
road, in 1988. But Young's book itself was such a coup de theatre
he had to wait another decade so Kazan's book wouldn't seem totally
upstaged. That is to say _ and there is no nuanced or indirect way
of putting this; only flat-footed assertion will do _ ``Elia Kazan:
A Life'' (Da Capo, $19.95) is one of the most amazing books I, for
one, have ever read. Utterly gripping, blazingly alive,
astoundingly acute, even more astoundingly obtuse, it is as
remarkable and strenuous an exercise in American autobiography as
has been written since (dare I type the name?) Henry Adams's. Art,
politics, sex, death, guilt, absolution, betrayal, not to mention
Brando, Dean, Marilyn Monroe, House Un-American Activities
Committee _ you name it _ they're all here, at great, and
engrossingly excessive, length. This is, if you will, the ultimate
film-interview book, with Kazan playing the roles of both
interlocutor and respondent. Neither has ever been performed more
memorably.

THERE'S LIFE AFTER DEATH FOR PATSY CLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The popularity of Patsy Cline, the torch-and-twang-voiced
singer, remains high 36 years after her death. Coming in
mid-September from Mercury Records is a CD of Cline singing duets
with the likes of Willie Nelson, Glen Campbell, Waylon Jennings and
Crystal Gayle.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't from-the-archives songs, either, but newly (and
morbidly) made ones. Producers extracted Cline's voice from old
recordings, added orchestration and matched Cline's singing with
that of her still-living partners. This isn't just a stunt;
instead, it's the first of three whole CDs' worth of dead-Patsy
duets.
</P>
<P>
   We agree with pop critic Neil Strauss of The New York Times, who
said such recordings should get their own section in the music
store: ``Rock-and-Roll Over in Your Grave.''

   Into the Indulgences and Too Much Money files goes a new product
called Scotch Rocks. Basically, it's really expensive ice cubes.
Water from the Glenlivet Spring in the Scottish Highlands is sealed
into trays. Pop 'em in the freezer for a few hours and, voila, a
way to make your 16-year-old scotch even more costly.
</P>
<P>
   According to promotional material, ``Scotch Rocks are
particularly relevant today given the dynamic growth of bottled
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   The cubes, ``because of (their spring's) renown for physical and
spiritual purity ... will therefore maintain the integrity of
mineral, branch and bottled waters, juices, green teas, smoothies
and a multitude of other beverages.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, hogwash, it's just snob appeal. The cubes, now available
only by phone, cost $7 for a box of 40, divided into 10, four-cube
trays. They are available from De Medici Imports at 914-651-4400.

   Men control the remote. They don't want to know what's on, the
joke goes; they want to know what else is on. Everybody knows that.
A survey in Consumer Reports in 1992 found that 98 percent of wives
had had tiffs with remote-hogging hubbies.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, nearly as many women as men control the
clicker. So says James Willi, president of Audience Research &AMP;
Development LLC, of Dallas, a leading television consulting firm.
Some women wrested the devices from their men, says Willi, but more
women are watching separate TVs. And a full half of women 18-24 say
they are as happy channel-surfing as they are watching one program,
a figure three times higher than that reported by women over age
50.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect: More TV sales, fewer people watching the tube
together. Just so ya know.

<P>
   Summer is the time for travel, and a $125 ticket will take one
(or two or three, if they like to look over shoulders) to England,
Scotland, France, India, Russia. . . . Let's start with Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   We are in Edinburgh, the City of Enlightenment, in the year
2020. The United Kingdom has long since broken up into warring
city-states, and Plato's Republic is best served by the Athens of
the North, which has achieved stability and peace, at the cost of
banning popular music, television, and private cars, and bending
the wills of all citizens to serving the tourist trade. (If this
sounds like the beginning of a satire, of course it is.) Nothing is
to disturb this steady state, but then a serial killer appears to
have returned, and the Council of City Guardians must call upon a
man they thought represented the old days of chaos, Quintilian
Dalrymple, who doesn't look right or think right and who is
therefore just what is needed to solve a crime. In ``Body Politic''
(St. Martin's Press, $22.95), Paul Johnston takes this inviting set
of premises and runs far and deep with them. The writing is
first-rate, and Johnston fully deserves the John Creasey Award for
best first crime novel of the year, which he won for the English
edition of his book.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnston looks forward, Ruth Dudley Edwards looks back by
simply standing still, for she satirizes the British Establishment
with rare venom, showing how nothing changes in the Foreign Office,
men's clubs, the clergy, the civil service, or Oxbridge colleges.
Or at least this is what she has done in her earlier books. Now, in
``Publish and Be Murdered'' (Poisoned Pen Press, $12.95), she takes
on ``The Economist,'' here hardly disguised as ``The Wrangler''
(despite a disclaimer that the one bears no resemblance to the
other, and if you believe that, this isn't your kind of fiction).
The Baroness Jack Troutbeck, who is a she, joins up again with
Robert Amiss, ``fundamentally a liberal,'' but a civil servant for
all that, to sort out a murder, an Australian takeover bid for
Britain's most prestigious magazine, and whether blackmail or
murder is the most heinous crime. The novel is very funny, very
British, and very good.
</P>
<P>
   I feel ambivalent about Michelle Spring's ``Nights in White
Satin'' (Ballantine, $23), which appears to find all Cambridge men
vile and all Cambridge women above average, but who tells a good
story through the eyes of Laura Principal, whose fourth
investigation this is. Katie Arkwright disappears after the St.
Bartholomew's College ball; hypocritical college administrators, in
the midst of a fund drive, want her found but above all want her
found quietly. There are tiresome touches of romance, the solution
is telegraphed a bit early; still, Cambridge the town is nicely
shown, even when it isn't nice, and the author, who lives in
Cambridge, shows an affection for that often handsome city that she
never shows for her character.
</P>
<P>
   And thus forward to the former Empire, in this case India, in H.
R. F. Keating's most recent Inspector Ghote novel, ``Bribery,
Corruption Also'' (St. Martin's Press, $23.95). Over the years
Keating has toned down his Hobson-zjobson Indian diction and
strengthened his plots, and Ghote has become a formidable Inspector
with the Bombay Police. Here he is in Calcutta with his wife,
Protima, who has inherited a fondly remembered home that has been
seen abandoned to squatters and decay. Someone wants them to go
back to Bombay and forget about the house, perhaps so that it can
be torn down and the wetlands it adjoins can be developed. All
makes sense to Ghote when he takes himself off to view the world's
oldest and largest banyan tree, in the Botanical Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   If corruption is the mark of Calcutta, as Ghote concludes, a
kind of moral avarice marks the Marais, the old Jewish quarter of
Paris, in Cara Black's ``Murder in the Marais'' (Soho Press, $22).
One would not know this is a first novel, so deftly does the author
handle this intricate tale of old hates, new Nazis, and subtle
racism in 1993 Paris. The detective, Aimes Leduc, is half-French,
half-American, and though her specialty is computer security, she
proves to be very good at relating wartime France to the
near-present.
</P>
<P>
   World War II is also the locus of David L. Robbins's ``War of
the Rate'' (Bantam, $23.95), which pits two snipers, each highly
trained, one German, one Russian, against each other at the battle
of Stalingrad. Robbins has done his research on the battle quite
well, and he integrates his cat-and-mouse game into scenes that
remind one of Theodore Plevier's minor classic, ``Stalingrad,'' as
a German soldier dies every seven seconds for weeks on end. I am
traveling to Russia this summer, but after reading this book, I
will make no effort to stand on the banks of the Volga River this
year.

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The historic New York Capitol building in Albany,
that ornate law factory atop State Street hill, is the birthplace
of roughly 750 statutes every year. Some turn out to be mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But once we put something dopey on the books in New York, we
cling to it unto eternity. Mark Rekucki found that out the hard
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a general contractor,'' he said. ``I started in business
in 1986 ... I do commercial work primarily, office buildings,
dental offices and that type of thing. ... I average, dollar
amount, about a million dollars a year, which equates to maybe two
office buildings a year.''
</P>
<P>
   He operates M.J. Rekucki Construction Inc. in the Albany suburb
of Clifton Park. He specializes in jobs of 3,000 to 4,000 square
feet. He hires some seasonal help, but mostly he employs
subcontractors for chores like masonry and electrical work.
</P>
<P>
   Rekucki had a project last year, a small medical building. He
hired a roofing subcontractor who had an employee working on a
10-foot-high portico roof over the entrance. A safety scaffold was
in place on one side.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Rekucki said, ``one of his roofers, for whatever reason,
starts to work on the side of the roof where there isn't any
scaffold. He falls off ... He fractures a heel, breaks a couple of
ribs, breaks some bones in his hand ...
</P>
<P>
   ``So we get sued by this guy. And he also sues the medical group
that hired me to do the building. He sues me for $8 million ...
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I find out that somebody in the New York
Legislature, years ago, passed a law that says that guys who work
in the construction field are in a dangerous situation, and Workers
Comp isn't enough. We've got to compensate these guys somehow in
case they get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this a home run. If anybody gets hurt from a fall,
regardless of the actions of the worker, it's automatic money. It's
not even a negotiable issue. It's not if you're going to get paid,
it's how much.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the settlement totaled $150,000, on top of what
the roofer got from Workers Compensation. Rekucki had done nothing
wrong, but a guy covered by Workers Compensation can't sue his
employer, so the general contractor and the building owners were
the only targets the worker had available. The roofer was
represented by a law firm that specializes in cases like this.
</P>
<P>
   What really got to Rekucki, though, was discovering during
depositions in the case against him that the roofer had been
smoking dope on his way to the job that morning. The guy admitted
it. In short, this roofer apparently had been stoned when he moved
to the side where no safety scaffolding was in place.
</P>
<P>
   But, because of a century-old law that remains on the books in
this state long after other states have done away with such laws, a
stoned or drunken construction worker who takes a tumble in New
York is still entitled to compensation from a guy like Rekucki,
whose only sin had been to hire the company that had employed the
worker who fell while he was drug-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   You hear stories like this, and you wonder why we cling so
ferociously to such nutty laws in New York. You wonder, too, why
anybody would operate a construction business in this state.
</P>
<P>
   For Rekucki, the answer is simple: he loves to build. Over the
winter, though, another guy fell off the roof of another building
he was erecting. Rekucki got the papers just a few days ago. He's
getting sued again, same law firm, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   And if this guy was stoned, too?
</P>
<P>
   Well, isn't that just too bad?
</P>

rather than his presidential campaign. Such perks will help Gore
offset the sizable cash disadvantage he has to Gov. George W. Bush

   PRIEST-MOLEST _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In February, two
Nashville dectectives flew to West Palm Beach and went to a neat
pink bungalow in Flamingo Park.. There they met Frank Richards and
interviewed him for three hours. He told them how in the '80s he
had been a Catholic priest and high school principal in Nashville.
He also told them how he and a priest colleague sexually molested
dozens of boys during a decade of abuse in their Tennessee diocese.
Richards' colleague has been sentenced to 25 years in state prison
for his offenses; Richards, though admitting molesting at least 25
boys, has never been charged or sued, but paid an out-of-court
settlement to three of his victims. The statute of limitations has
expired on all his known offenses. State officials and diocese
acknowledge Richards slipped through their cracks. Both men were
forced out of the priesthood a dozen years ago. Today Richards is
an employee of the state of Florida, working for the Palm Beach
County Health Department. His division regulates day-care centers.

HOUSE PASSES ITS OWN ABOMINABLE JUVENILE CRIME BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm)

 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, the U.S. House passed H.R. 1501, the Juvenile
Justice Reform Act of 1999. The bill contains an amendment authored
by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, that strips children in jails of
protections against physical or sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that Congress has shown its nasty side
in regard to children. Last year the Senate passed a bill that
would have allowed young teenagers to be jailed with adults _
despite the overwhelming evidence that when young people are
confined in the same facility with adults, they are beaten and
raped, sometimes killed, and too often commit suicide under such
conditions. Fortunately, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender
Act, S.10, never became law.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest abomination called a reform, section 110
eliminates any consent decree ``that provides for remedies relating
to prison conditions'' and was entered into before the Prison
Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) was passed in 1995. PLRA was passed to
make it difficult for inmates or relatives to sue a prison system
for violations of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, in a consent decree involving incarcerated children,
parents sue a county or state in order to stop the jailing of teens
with adults or to end some mistreatment of imprisoned teens. The
county or state agrees to no longer jail children with adults or
agrees to end some ill-conceived method of dealing with children in
jails _ without admitting wrongdoing. A consent decree is like a
contract between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Center of Juvenile and Criminal Justice provides a striking
example of a consent decree that would be wiped out by H.R. 1501.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Horn's 15-year-old son Robbie was held in Oldham County
jail in LaGrange, Ky., for a minor infraction. He took off his
shirt, wrapped one sleeve around his neck and the other around the
bars of his cell and hanged himself. Rita Horn sued the county for
jailing juveniles with adults. Records show that nearly 1,400
children were held in the county jail in a four-year period _ most
for minor offenses. As a result of the lawsuit, in 1985, the Oldham
County officials signed a consent decree in which they agreed to
never again hold children in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   If DeLay has his way, Oldham County can start jailing juveniles
with adults once more. With the sad predictable results.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 20 news release, Mark Soler, president of the Youth
Law Center in Washington, D.C., commented: ``The DeLay provisions
would immediately wipe out protections in scores of counties around
America where children have been abused and mistreated in adult
jails and juvenile facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of abuses curtailed or ended by these consent decrees
stagger the imagination: Children in juvenile detention in
Philadelphia were regularly beaten with paddles and chains. Unruly
children in juvenile detention in Hannibal, Mo., were strapped to
boards and leaned against a wall _ sometimes upside down. Children
in state institutions in Arizona were stripped naked, hands and
feet tied to the four corners of bed frames and kept in solitary
confinement for days at a time. In Oklahoma, children in one state
juvenile correctional institution were handcuffed, hogtied and
beaten in the dungeon-like ``punishment unit.''
</P>
<P>
   If DeLay has his way, all these obscene practices can begin once
again.
</P>
<P>
   The DeLay amendment, however, raises a significant legal
question. Can a law passed by Congress override consent decrees or
agreements worked out between counties or states and those
individuals who sued? Can a federal law declare null and void a
state's agreement over how a state facility will be run? It's
doubtful. And if the DeLay amendment becomes part of the law, it
will lead to more litigation over this constitutional issue.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic that the GOP flies the banner of local control, yet
this amendment, authored by a Republican representative, would
completely destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   In response to DeLay's amendment to the House juvenile justice
bill, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., offered an amendment to the
Senate's Commerce and Judiciary Appropriations bill that would
protect children from abuse in all the nation's jails and
correctional facilities.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry, the Children's Defense Fund and 13 other organizations
sent a letter to the U.S. Senate in support of Wellstone's
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The letter states, in part: ``The U.S. Department of Justice
issued a report earlier this year documenting widespread inhumane
and abusive conditions for children with mental illness in jails
and juvenile facilities. The report cited cases of extreme physical
abuse and neglect, including lengthy periods of isolation and the
use of tear gas as chemical restraints. ... The Wellstone amendment
would allow federal courts to protect children, especially those
with mental illness, from danger and mistreatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Wellstone amendment was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill now goes to a House-Senate conference committee
along with another version of a juvenile crime bill which the
Senate passed (S. 254).
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill dismantles the federal mandate to study and
attempt to correct the problem of disproportionate minority
confinement (DMC). In every state of the union, teens of color are
treated more severely by law enforcement and prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Recent news stories in the Baltimore Sun document that in
Maryland mentally ill delinquents are treated differently,
depending upon race.
</P>
<P>
   White teens who are mentally ill and have committed crimes are
placed in residential centers that specialize in treating mental
illness. Teens of other races who have committed similar offenses
and have similar mental problems are locked up in juvenile jails or
state training schools and given tranquilizers or psychotropic
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun also reported that last year's crime figures show that
one out of every three white delinquents is sentenced to
confinement in a treatment center, while one of six black
delinquents goes to a treatment center. In Baltimore, only one out
of nine black delinquents was sentenced to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, according to the
Baltimore Sun, has ordered officials of the appropriate agencies to
find out why a much higher percentage of black mentally ill
juvenile delinquents than their white counterparts are sentenced to
jail instead of treatment. ``Race,'' she is quoted as saying,
``must never play a role in placement or providing treatment to
juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but unless the DMC mandate is kept alive, the racist
policies will continue _ blindly.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the House and Senate in conference committee
will decide which provisions of the two juvenile crime bills will
be kept and which shucked in order to fashion the legislation that
will then be taken to a vote in both houses. They have only to
think ``equal before the law'' and feel compassion for children who
have taken the wrong path.
</P>
<P>
   And they will shuck right.

GET READY FOR ANOTHER JUDICIAL `CRAPSHOOT' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some Texas Republican leaders were doubtlessly
relieved when Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Steve
Mansfield, whose election in 1994 was widely considered an
``oops,'' decided last week not to seek a second term.
</P>
<P>
   If renominated, he may have been a weak link in next year's GOP
candidate lineup. Then, maybe not, given the electoral roll that
Texas Republicans have been enjoying of late.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't have been the first time, after all, that Mansfield
didn't live up _ or down _ to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he was an unknown Houston lawyer with little
experience in criminal law, and during his campaign he was accused
of lying about his resume. But thanks to straight-ticket Republican
voting, he unseated a veteran Democratic judge.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, who later accepted a reprimand from the State Bar for
his campaign lies, isn't the only person with questionable
credentials to ever be elected to a judgeship in Texas. Far from
it.
</P>
<P>
   His election to the state's highest criminal court,
nevertheless, led some would-be judicial reformers to console
themselves with the hope that the unflattering publicity would
finally prompt the Legislature to scrap the partisan election
system for state judges.
</P>
<P>
   But the Legislature isn't easily embarrassed, and efforts to
overhaul the judicial selection process with a system of
gubernatorial appointments haven't even come close since Mansfield
took office.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the opposition has come from the major political
parties. Democratic officials didn't want to change the elective
system when their party had a lock on statewide offices, not even
after Donald B. Yarbrough, a Democratic attorney from Houston, was
elected to the Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Yarbrough, who used his politically familiar name to upset a
much more qualified candidate in 1976, was forced to resign after
he became the target of a criminal investigation. After he left the
court, he was convicted of lying to a grand jury investigating
allegations that he plotted to have a banker killed. He eventually
was imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican officials don't want to remove any elective
offices, now that their party holds all of the offices elected
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion surveys indicate that most Texans also want to
elect their judges, even though the vast majority of voters in
urban areas, who are faced with long election ballots, have never
heard of most of their judicial choices and don't have the faintest
clue about their qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Criminal Appeals plays an important role in
balancing the constitutional rights of convicts against the public
safety, but it usually avoids the radar screen of everybody but
trial judges, prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates for that court receive little in campaign
contributions and cannot afford the expensive television
commercials necessary to develop crucial name identification.
</P>
<P>
   They also don't receive much news coverage, and, when they do,
most voters don't pay much attention to it. There were news reports
about Mansfield's questionable resume during his 1994 campaign, but
they didn't slow the Republican tide that swept him into office.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield actually has earned a reputation as a hard worker on
the court and has kept his promise to be a victims' advocate,
siding usually with prosecutors and against defendants on appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he couldn't avoid more controversy. Last fall, he
was cited by University of Texas police for criminal trespass after
he allegedly tried to scalp his complimentary tickets to a
University of Texas-Texas A&AMP;M football game.
</P>
<P>
   Although that case is still pending, the State Commission on
Judicial Conduct publicly reprimanded him over it.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said he chose not to run for re-election because he
didn't want to suffer through the inevitable battering by opponents
over his past controversies.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Greenwell, a Corpus Christi lawyer, already had announced he
would run for Mansfield's seat in next March's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several other candidates also will likely jump into the
race, and most will file as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some will campaign hard and actively seek newspaper and
interest-group endorsements. Others won't, hoping, instead, that
their names will sound familiar or pleasing to voters or that they
will, by the luck of the draw, get listed first on the primary
ballots in the major metropolitan counties, a position that usually
attracts more votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates will be qualified. Others may not be.
</P>
<P>
   As one veteran state judge warned, the scramble for Mansfield's
seat in all likelihood will be a ``crapshoot.''

THESE VIDEO CARDS ARE CERTIFIED WINNERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most cases, the capability of today's high-end computer
hardware far outstrips the ability of software to tame it. There's
one big exception, though, and that's 3D games.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who plays state-of-the-art games _ whether they're
action-packed first-person shooters, reflex-challenging real-time
strategy titles or hyper-realistic flight simulators _ is going to
want a video card that's at least a couple of steps ahead of the
programs being run.
</P>
<P>
   In a continuing series of columns on state-of-the-art video
cards, I've found two that are guaranteed winners. You can't go
wrong with either one of these.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rage Fury, $150, ATI Technologies: If you've bought an
off-the-shelf computer from a retailer over the past two years,
chances are very good it's got an ATI graphics adapter in it. The
older Rage Pro has been, well, all the rage with computer makers
because it delivers decent performance at a low price.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Rage Pro is far from being a high-end speed demon. It
was long ago eclipsed by cards that use graphics chips from nVidia,
S3 and 3dfx. In an attempt to reclaim the high end, ATI developed
and earlier this year released a series of cards based on its Rage
128 chipset.
</P>
<P>
   The Rage Fury is the AGP-bus model aimed at gamers. It comes
with 32 megabytes of fast video memory and the ability to connect
to a TV set in two ways _ with S-Video and composite video. It also
has a built-in DVD decoder, though it doesn't come with the
software needed to take advantage of this feature. An included
coupon lets you send off for this at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   The card can handle resolutions of up to 1,920-by-1,200 pixels,
and refresh rates as high 200 hertz. It also can use full 32-bit
color _ or 16.7 million colors _ at that maximum resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Modern graphics cards such as the Rage Fury all can handle the
standard 2D graphics used by traditional Windows applications with
incredible speed. Whether this is a high-performing 2D card is not
even a question _ if you're a mainstream Windows user, you'll love
it.
</P>
<P>
   The question is its 3D performance, and here it's no slouch. The
Rage Fury uses a 128-bit graphics engine, which refers to the
amount of information it can handle at once. It also has a clock
speed of 100 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   The look of 3D in both Microsoft's Direct3D and SGI's OpenGL 3D
schemes are excellent in 32-bit color, which is the Rage Fury's
strength. Although the colors are a bit saturated, particularly in
OpenGL, the look of the card was still gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   I tested this card's speed using the July 16 release of Quake
III Arena Test for Windows. This is the graphics and networking
test of id Software's upcoming Quake III Arena multiplayer game.
It's generally considered to be the software that most challenges
graphics cards at the moment, and it comes with a built-in way to
test the performance of cards. In the original release of Q3ATest,
as it's called, this so-called ``timedemo'' feature was broken. It
was fixed in the July 16 release.
</P>
<P>
   The computer I used was a Dell Dimension with a 500-Mhz Pentium
III chips and 250 megabytes of system memory.
</P>
<P>
   Q3ATest lets you tweak the graphics settings for either improved
speed or better visual quality. I tried four different settings,
ranging from the visually slick settings I use when I play the game
to a setting that emphasizes speed over beauty. The results are
measured in frames per second, or fps.
</P>
<P>
   In my favorite settings _ at a resolution of 1,024-by-768,
32-bit textures and 32-bit color _ the Rage Fury gave me 14.7 fps
in the Q3ATest timedemo. Moving to high-quality settings _
800-by-600, with 32-bit colors and textures _ I got 21.6 fps. At
normal settings _ 640-by-480, 32-bit colors and compressed textures
_ I got 35.4 fps. And at the fastest settings _ 640-by-480, 16-bit
colors and compressed textures _ I got 54.3 fps.
</P>
<P>
   The Rage Fury comes with demo versions of the games Half-Life
and Expendable, and a full version of Moto-Racer 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ 3D Blaster Riva TNT2 Ultra, $230, Creative Labs: Of the
graphics cards I've tried so far, this one is my favorite. It's
fast, it has a beautiful 3D look, its drivers are stable, and it
has most of the features computer enthusiasts will want.
</P>
<P>
   But it has two big negatives _ it comes with no bundled games,
and it's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In May, I reviewed a test card from nVidia that used the Riva
TNT2 chipset and loved it. The TNT2 Ultra is essentially the same
chipset, but set at a higher clock speed.
</P>
<P>
   The AGP-bus card I tested came with 32 MB of fast video memory
and the capability to connect to a TV set using S-Video. It also
has 128-bit processing and runs at a clock speed of 150 Mhz, with
memory speed of 183 Mhz, which makes it lightning-fast. The card
also comes with a software utility that lets you increase these
speeds, called overclocking.
</P>
<P>
   It can handle resolutions up to 1,920-by-1,200, and refresh
rates up to 200 Hz. It also can handle 32-bit color at its maximum
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, I was a die-hard fan of the ``look'' of 3dfx's video
chipsets, particularly when it came to OpenGL and that company's
own Glide 3D scheme. But after experiencing the STB Velocity 4400
card _ which uses nVidia's original Riva TNT chip _ I was an
instant convert.
</P>
<P>
   The 3D images produced by nVidia's chips are nothing short of
jaw-dropping, and for the most part you don't sacrifice speed when
running at intensive color depths or detailed textures.
</P>
<P>
   It easily outran the Rage Fury except in one of the categories
in the Q3ATest _ the fastest setting. There, the ATI card whipped
upon the Creative Labs product by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Using my favorite settings, the TNT2 Ultra-based achieved 21.6
fps. At the high-quality settings, it came in at 33 fps. For the
normal setting, I got 36.8 fps. And at the fastest setting, the
card hit 49.3 fps.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who's serious about 3D gaming, I would not hesitate
to recommend this card _ if you've got the bucks. But given the
price, it lacks some features that more mainstream users might
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Rage Fury, it will not do hardware-based DVD
decoding, though it will work with software-based DVD decoders. It
also does not have a composite video connection.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're just getting started in 3D gaming and don't have
any titles to try out, you'll miss not having at least some demos
in the box.

 (EDITOR'S SUMMARY: KING HASSAN II IS MOURNED BY THE WEST AS A
PEACEMAKER, BUT IN MOROCCO IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY...)  
  
 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When A Middle East dictator faithfully follows U.S. policy in
the region, you can be sure that he will be mourned in death as a
``peacemaker,'' a ``moderate,'' a ``friend of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was for Hassan II, Commander of the Faithful, as the
world's leaders set off for Rabat Saturday to express their sorrow
at the demise of the longest-serving Arab monarch.
</P>
<P>
   No mention, of course, of the decades of imprisonment without
trial for his political opponents, of the secret mountain prisons,
of the ``disappearances,'' of the occupation of the Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   For was this not the man who helped set up the Egyptian-Israeli
peace treaty, the Oslo agreement, the Jordanian peace treaty, who
produced an Islamic call against ``terrorism?''
</P>
<P>
   However much he received in cash from the CIA _ and the Arab
world still speaks of this with both anger and envy _ King Hassan
was on ``our'' side.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was a tendency towards the end to regard the
monarch _ whose country is closer to London than it is to Jerusalem
_ as a kind of honorary European: chain-smoking, eloquent, anxious
to clean up that little problem of human rights, happy to
participate in our local festivals as he did only a few days ago at
the Bastille with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   He once told King Juan Carlos of Spain: ``When I ascended the
throne, people said I wouldn't last more than six months.'' And the
people were almost right. His own air force tried to shoot him
down.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1971, army officers angry at Hassan's abandonment of
thousands of square kilometers of his country in an Algerian border
war, organized a coup and 2,000 men overran the king's birthday
party, killing almost 100 guests.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was ruthless. Enemies ``disappeared'' forever. There were
no political prisoners, he said, only ``traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroccans, he once wrote, ``need a popular monarch that governs.
That is why the king governs in Morocco. The people would not
understand if the king did not govern.''
</P>
<P>
   He was pragmatic to the point of cynicism. Confronted by a
tired, beleaguered Yassir Arafat in 1994, the king _ in the words
of the Egyptian journalist Mohamed Heikel _ counselled the PLO
leader to continue his negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people (the Israelis) are very powerful,'' Hassan said.
``Consider what they have done for you. In 24 hours they have
changed your image from terrorist to peacemaker, enabling you to go
to the White House, to dine at the State Department, to have lunch
at the World Bank, to enter 10 Downing Street.''
</P>
<P>
   King Hassan's relations with Israel will remain the most
controversial _ and fascinating _ aspect of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   He protected his own Moroccan Jewish community, welcomed
Moroccan Jews with Israeli passports to return to the country of
their birth, secretly hosted half the prime ministers of Israel _
Golda Meir arriving dressed in men's clothes and Yitzhak Rabin in
shades and, apparently, a false moustache. When Arab states closer
to Israel complained, Hassan simply ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   And in an odd way, this made him all the more popular in the
Arab world, an insouciance that almost looked like freedom and
certainly was not devoid of self-criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1993 book ``Memory of a King,'' he admitted that 60
percent of his decisions had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was an eloquent man _ ``one of the few you would actually
go to listen to more out of pleasure than loyalty,'' as one
Palestinian put it tartly.
</P>
<P>
   Well-versed in the Koran _ he inherited the title ``Commander of
the Faithful'' from his father King Mohamed V _ his oratory was
spontaneous. So was his anger.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International's reports are littered with incidents of
torture and ill-treatment by Morocco's security police. In 1997,
120 political opponents calling for a boycott of municipal
elections were arrested, including the mother of a seven-month-old
child.
</P>
<P>
   He dealt ruthlessly with ``Islamist'' militants when they killed
westerners in his country, threatening to spill Algeria's blood
over the frontier into the clean, secular, increasingly wealthy
tourist center that Morocco was becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was never squeamish when it came to signing death
warrants and never afraid, in later life, to pardon the condemned.
</P>
<P>
   For, like so many aging dictators, he grew gentler with age. By
the early 1990s, he was releasing left-wing opponents and
rebellious army officers who had been locked up, in some cases, for
decades. More than 800 political prisoners were freed and 195 death
sentences commuted.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, in the wicked list of human-rights abuses that
runs from the Atlantic to the Gulf, Morocco is _ by comparison _ a
mild offender. Which made it all the easier for our leaders to
praise his name in Rabat Sunday when they attended his burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yours has always been a voice of reason and tolerance,'' U.S.
Bill President Clinton gushed to the king in 1995. He no doubt said
the same in Rabat Sunday when he met Hassan's successor, Sidi
Mohamed. Our king is dead. Long live our king. &QL;

HITTING THE JACKPOT AT A MEXICAN SPA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico _ I like to daydream about how I someday will
spend my lottery millions. So many things, so much money. What to
do first and where will I hide out while pondering the options?
</P>
<P>
   The answers came earlier this year during a trip to Mexico _ I
will pamper myself at a spa. After sampling a few spas in January,
I now know the first step on the road to millions is a vacation
with revitalizing facials, massages, exfoliation and salt rubs.
I'll luxuriate in the gardens of Hacienda Cocoyoc, paddle my toes
in Lake Tequesquintengo after a massage at Villa Bejar or smell the
flowers of Hosteria Las Quintas while I wait for my next spa
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a millionaire to indulge in Mexico's
spas. Many packages offered are very affordable, with some
inclusive of lodging, airport transfers and meals. While patrons
might find the occasional celebrity hiding out in a terry cloth
robe, more likely you'll be rubbing elbows with people from all
parts of the United States, Europe, Japan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Spa clients are getting younger and more mainstream, according
to Sheryl Sciro, president of media for Spa Finders, the world's
largest spa reservation service and publisher of the Spa Finder
magazine. Twenty-five percent are younger than 35, and 12 percent
are older than 65. The average age of a spa client, according to
Spa Finder research, is 44.
</P>
<P>
   The average income for a spa client has dropped. In 1992, less
than 8 percent earned under $50,000. Today, 20 percent of spa goers
earn less than $50,000. The number of men going to spas has more
than doubled since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So indulge in these Mexican spas:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOSTERIA LAS QUINTAS
</P>
<P>
   Las Quintas is a quiet oasis of calm amid the hustle and bustle.
The cool tiles, flowering gardens and manicured lawns paint a
picture of serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Courtly and courteous, white-haired Orlando Hidalgo greets
guests at the five-star, 60-room Hosteria Las Quintas in Cuernavaca
(the City of Eternal Spring). His son, also Orlando, is the owner
of the spa, but the duties of meeting and greeting new guests to
the hotel fall to the father. He explains the system of the spa _
everything is assigned points from spa treatments to tours with one
point equaling $1.20 (U.S.) for the spa treatments and $1 per point
for tours.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cuba, the senior Hidalgo was in the restaurant
business for 45 years in the United States before retiring. He
knows that his guests expect a certain level of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't leave guests hanging,'' Hidalgo says, explaining that
an airport greeter meets arrivals in Mexico City and takes them to
the Pullman de Morelas bus that serves Cuernavaca. At the bus
terminal, guests are met by another representative of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our guests are not here to lose weight,'' he says.
``They are here to be pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous guests have included actress Shari Belafonte and opera
singer Jessye Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat them (the famous) just the same as everybody,''
Hidalgo says. At Las Quintas, which represents the high end of spas
in Mexico, a feeling of luxury permeates every aspect. Meals and
accommodations are included in most packages, but gratuities (daily
charges of $8 for servers, $4 for maids) are extra.
</P>
<P>
   Packages range from a two-night stress relief program at $559
(single), to a seven-night Healthy Lifestyle Week, up to $2,119
(single).
</P>
<P>
   I had time to indulge in a deep cleansing, 60-minute facial (30
points) that left me, according to a fellow travel writer, ``with
the skin of a baby.'' Other spa treatments range from hydrotherapy
and loofah scrubs to Swedish massage, seaweed wraps and mineral
baths. There are doctors on call for complete physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants have both regular and spa menus, special diets
can be accommodated and there is room service.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers bloom year-round in the 80,000-square-feet of gardens,
which are dotted with statues. As he spoke about the facilities
over lunch in the garden, Hidalgo Sr. explains the differences that
put Las Quintas in the upper echelon of Mexico's spas. ``We were
the first to introduce eco-tours. We're different than every other
spa,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While visitors go to the spas for the spa treatments, as
tourists they want to see and experience Mexico. Las Quintas'
guided tours are via air-conditioned sport utility vehicles, with
boxed lunches. Sites visited include the pyramids of Tepoztlan; Las
Etacas, a crystal river with natural springs; the archaeological
site at Xochicalco; a city tour of Cuernavaca; the silver city of
Taxco; the lagoons of Zempoala; the caverns of Cacahumilpa; and the
Thousand Waterfalls of Granada. Points assessed for these trips
range from 40 to 75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VILLA BEJAR
</P>
<P>
   Joyce and Judith (who asked that their last names be omitted) of
New York City found Villa Bejar through Spa Finder magazine. They
liked the price, $900 each for a full week, including meals and
airport transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't touch a spa in the U.S. for that,'' Judith said.
</P>
<P>
   While the women had praise for the spa, on the shore of Lake
Tequesquintengo, they found the food lacking, the wine list
mediocre and apparently had some trouble finding their airport
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   With her year-round tan and short spiky hair, Judith was the
picture of glowing health. The Manhattan businesswoman said she
likes a spa vacation to feel revitalized. She admitted her surprise
that none of the spa attendants spoke English.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Villa Bejar had Xenia Orlandi, the spa coordinator to
serve as translator for the New York duo during their visit. At age
21, Orlandi seemed young, for the job, but very capable with her
knowledge of hotel management, which she has studied in
Switzerland. Her languages included Spanish, Italian, English and
some French.

 (EDITOR'S SUMMARY: KING HASSAN II IS MOURNED BY THE WEST AS A
PEACEMAKER, BUT IN MOROCCO IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY...)  
  
 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When A Middle East dictator faithfully follows U.S. policy in
the region, you can be sure that he will be mourned in death as a
``peacemaker,'' a ``moderate,'' a ``friend of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was for Hassan II, Commander of the Faithful, as the
world's leaders set off for Rabat Saturday to express their sorrow
at the demise of the longest-serving Arab monarch.
</P>
<P>
   No mention, of course, of the decades of imprisonment without
trial for his political opponents, of the secret mountain prisons,
of the ``disappearances,'' of the occupation of the Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   For was this not the man who helped set up the Egyptian-Israeli
peace treaty, the Oslo agreement, the Jordanian peace treaty, who
produced an Islamic call against ``terrorism?''
</P>
<P>
   However much he received in cash from the CIA _ and the Arab
world still speaks of this with both anger and envy _ King Hassan
was on ``our'' side.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was a tendency towards the end to regard the
monarch _ whose country is closer to London than it is to Jerusalem
_ as a kind of honorary European: chain-smoking, eloquent, anxious
to clean up that little problem of human rights, happy to
participate in our local festivals as he did only a few days ago at
the Bastille with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   He once told King Juan Carlos of Spain: ``When I ascended the
throne, people said I wouldn't last more than six months.'' And the
people were almost right. His own air force tried to shoot him
down.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1971, army officers angry at Hassan's abandonment of
thousands of square kilometers of his country in an Algerian border
war, organized a coup and 2,000 men overran the king's birthday
party, killing almost 100 guests.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was ruthless. Enemies ``disappeared'' forever. There were
no political prisoners, he said, only ``traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroccans, he once wrote, ``need a popular monarch that governs.
That is why the king governs in Morocco. The people would not
understand if the king did not govern.''
</P>
<P>
   He was pragmatic to the point of cynicism. Confronted by a
tired, beleaguered Yassir Arafat in 1994, the king _ in the words
of the Egyptian journalist Mohamed Heikel _ counselled the PLO
leader to continue his negotiations with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people (the Israelis) are very powerful,'' Hassan said.
``Consider what they have done for you. In 24 hours they have
changed your image from terrorist to peacemaker, enabling you to go
to the White House, to dine at the State Department, to have lunch
at the World Bank, to enter 10 Downing Street.''
</P>
<P>
   King Hassan's relations with Israel will remain the most
controversial _ and fascinating _ aspect of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   He protected his own Moroccan Jewish community, welcomed
Moroccan Jews with Israeli passports to return to the country of
their birth, secretly hosted half the prime ministers of Israel _
Golda Meir arriving dressed in men's clothes and Yitzhak Rabin in
shades and, apparently, a false moustache. When Arab states closer
to Israel complained, Hassan simply ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   And in an odd way, this made him all the more popular in the
Arab world, an insouciance that almost looked like freedom and
certainly was not devoid of self-criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1993 book ``Memory of a King,'' he admitted that 60
percent of his decisions had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was an eloquent man _ ``one of the few you would actually
go to listen to more out of pleasure than loyalty,'' as one
Palestinian put it tartly.
</P>
<P>
   Well-versed in the Koran _ he inherited the title ``Commander of
the Faithful'' from his father King Mohamed V _ his oratory was
spontaneous. So was his anger.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International's reports are littered with incidents of
torture and ill-treatment by Morocco's security police. In 1997,
120 political opponents calling for a boycott of municipal
elections were arrested, including the mother of a seven-month-old
child.
</P>
<P>
   He dealt ruthlessly with ``Islamist'' militants when they killed
westerners in his country, threatening to spill Algeria's blood
over the frontier into the clean, secular, increasingly wealthy
tourist center that Morocco was becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was never squeamish when it came to signing death
warrants and never afraid, in later life, to pardon the condemned.
</P>
<P>
   For, like so many aging dictators, he grew gentler with age. By
the early 1990s, he was releasing left-wing opponents and
rebellious army officers who had been locked up, in some cases, for
decades. More than 800 political prisoners were freed and 195 death
sentences commuted.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, in the wicked list of human-rights abuses that
runs from the Atlantic to the Gulf, Morocco is _ by comparison _ a
mild offender. Which made it all the easier for our leaders to
praise his name in Rabat Sunday when they attended his burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yours has always been a voice of reason and tolerance,'' U.S.
Bill President Clinton gushed to the king in 1995. He no doubt said
the same in Rabat Sunday when he met Hassan's successor, Sidi
Mohamed. Our king is dead. Long live our king. &QL;

 CUERNAVACA, Mexico: x x x and some French.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Villa Bejar I experienced my first full massage. They call it
a corporal massage; I'd call it a little slice of heaven albeit
with some embarrassment on my part when I discovered Victor, a
young, attractive masseur.
</P>
<P>
   What was I expecting, a large, woman with strong hands? Yes, I
was.
</P>
<P>
   Victor was very good at his job, but he must have noticed that I
was nervous and perhaps less pliable than most people who lie face
down on a table covered only in a towel.
</P>
<P>
   Victor didn't speak English, and my Spanish is too lame to
exchange more than cursory pleasantries. I like to think that he
appreciated my silence as he concentrated on his work _ me. He
pounded, palpitated and rubbed tense muscles into relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Villa Bejar's spa facilities, like all the spas we visited on
this trip sponsored by Mexico Government Tourism, was very clean
and modern. The hotel's lakeside location was enchanting, and the
Moorish design _ straight out of an ``Arabian Nights'' film _ is
intriguing. During our visit in January the smell of sulfur from
the lake was unpleasant. Owner Maricela Morales de Anton explained
that at certain times of the year the lake gives off the sulfur
odor.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Tequesquintengo, 40 minutes south of Cuernavaca off the
highway to Acapulco, is a popular destination among locals for
swimming and water-skiing. The calm waters of the late are fed from
springs, long popular for therapeutic bathing. The history of the
lake, however, is clouded by disaster. In the 1820s, workers
unhappy with the conditions vowed to quit working for the Hacienda
Vista Hermosa.
</P>
<P>
   The hacienda's owner threatened the townspeople and change the
course of the river, which, over the course of about 30 years
covered the town and created Lake Tequesquintengo.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the spa, Villa Bejar boasts a disco boat, two
pools (one with swim-up bar) and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The spa treatments run the gamut, with packages ranging from a
two-night/three-day ``anti-stress and detoxification'' package to
14-night/15-day ``reductive &AMP; anti-cellulite'' package.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for spa treatments, based on 9.35 pesos to the dollar,
include: $26 massage with honey, 40 minutes; $22 cleansing facial,
30 minutes; $16 back and neck 30-minute massage; $19 herbal wrap,
30 minutes; $10 manicure; $17 for hair coloring (short cut); and
$16 perm (short hair).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COCOYOC HACIENDA
</P>
<P>
   The cool, green setting of Cocoyoc Hacienda (the place of
coyotes) with its golf course and vine-covered aqueduct is a
comfortable contrast to the lakeside spa/hotel. The hotel, which
began business in 1968, is a restored 16th-century Dominican
monastery and sugar plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Located about 25 minutes from Cuernavaca and an hour's drive
from Mexico City, the hotel has 300 rooms and suites with private
pools, 22 acres of manicured gardens, waterfalls, fountains, a
chapel, art gallery, two golf courses, three swimming pools,
lighted tennis courts, horseback riding, a disco, restaurants, bars
and convention meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel began offering spa services in 1986, and opened its
spa in 1995. It offers 64 treatments including seven massages;
facials, seaweed, paraffin and herbal wraps; loofah scrubs; salt
glow; thalassotherapy; reductive treatments; capillary and scalp
treatments; and hydrotherapy. There also is a workout center,
aquarobics, Tai Chi and aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   Packages include spa/golf and spa/beauty services; or you can
choose from an a la carte menu of services.
</P>
<P>
   I was swept into the relaxing world of spas by two attendants,
Barbara and Patricia. The treatment began with a bath in a
specially equipped hydromassage tub with ``sub aquatic massage.''
</P>
<P>
   From there it was a hop over to a loofah scrub with exfoliant
gels and brushes to remove the other layer of dead skin and
stimulate the circulation.
</P>
<P>
   With Barbara's help, I wobbled over to the wet area for the
steam bath, sauna, pressure shower, Swiss shower and regular
shower, designed to ``stimulate thermoregulatory and immunological
activities of the body, as it improves peripheral circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment package, even at a la carte prices, runs less than
$60, plus tips for the spa attendants. Tips are extra at spas in
Mexico and range from $2 to $5 (U.S.) per spa treatment, per
person; or 10 percent above the package price. (Compare this to the
expected $20 tip at spas on the East and West Coast of the United
States). Spa packages range from one to seven days, priced from
$230 to $1,035 with tips and taxes extra.
</P>
<P>
   I was struck by the beauty and serenity on the grounds of
Cocoyoc. As a hacienda, it flourished until the revolution; by the
early 1920s the land was divided among the peasants and only 168
acres of the original land grant remained.
</P>
<P>
   Paulino Rivera Torres bought the hacienda in 1957, with the
dream of making it into a hotel. The Rivera family still owns the
hotel and spa, which combines the modern amenities that travelers
have come to enjoy with the history and elegance of the past.

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has embarked on another orgy of head-chopping,
decapitating a total of 55 people so far this year _ almost double
the executions carried out in 1998 _ including two women who were
beheaded in public for allegedly trafficking in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Hawa Faruk and Aisha Saada Kassem had their heads cut off with
swords _ after their scarves were torn from their heads by their
executioners _ in Riyadh and Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
   Both women were Nigerian; Ms. Faruk was decapitated on May 28
and Ms. Kassem was executed before a large crowd outside a Jeddah
mosque just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, there have been no words of condemnation in the
West, let alone in the United States, whose troops continue to be
based in the Kingdom and whose oil investments in Saudi Arabia
render even the slightest criticism impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ like the other 53 male victims _ were tried in
semi-secret courts.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually large number of beheadings this year were carried
out on foreigners: they included 10 Pakistanis for drug offenses,
five Nigerians (four for alleged drug offenses, one for armed
robbery), three Indians (two for drug-related crimes, one for
rape), two Afghans, two Indonesians and a Syrian.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Saudis announced each decapitation with a short
paragraph in the government-controlled press. Aisha Kassem's
execution _ ``with a sabre,'' it was gruesomely announced _ took
place after she was convicted of ``smuggling cocaine hidden in her
intestines.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to five years ago, women were executed in Saudi prisons,
sometimes by firing squad, but since 1996, the Saudis have beheaded
women in public, often after Friday prayers and in front of
hundreds of men.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they executed three women _ Zahra Issa Ali and Bana
Mohamed Adam, both Nigerians accused of drug trafficking, and
Soleha Anam Kadiran, an Indonesian convicted of murdering a Saudi
woman.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, a Saudi woman, Dhafira bin Said bin Mohamed
al-Salim, was beheaded for killing her husband and two Indonesian
women were decapitated for alleged drugs trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Saudi mother and daughter were executed together _
their scarves again torn from their heads before they had their
heads chopped off, one after the other, by the Dhahran executioner
with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   The worst year for executions in Saudi Arabia was 1995 when 192
condemned, seven of them women, went beneath the sword. There were
96 beheadings in 1996, 122 the following year and 29 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International regularly condemns Saudi Arabia for its
executions and for the mockery of a trial which most of the victims
receive. The hearings, according to Amnesty, do not accord with the
basic norms of international law and are often heard in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Saudi Arabia have said that women convicted of drugs
offenses are sometimes rape victims who are judicially murdered to
prevent them identifying their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Executioners usually clean their sword by wiping off the blood
on the white clothes of their newly-dead victim.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia regularly justifies these bloody scenes by quoting
from Koranic law, by reminding foreigners of Saudi tradition and by
insisting upon the integrity and humanity of its courts.
</P>
<P>
   In one case last year, a Saudi executioner had raised his sword
over a condemned man's head when the father of the boy he was
accused of murdering stepped forward to pardon the prisoner. The
executioner lowered his sword and his would-be victim swooned to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But death sentences are rarely commuted _ unless, of course, the
prisoner happens to be a British nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Death by the blade is something all Saudis know of but few wish
to discuss. But last week, I spoke to a man who had once flown over
the Saudi desert with the old King Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost dark and the king wanted to show me a village,''
he said. ``I didn't know why but when we got overhead, it was just
a deserted place with a few stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the king said to me: `The people of this village used
to rob the caravans to Mecca and I warned them to stop. They didn't
listen to me, so I warned them again. Again, they didn't listen. So
I sent my guards to the village and they cut off the heads of every
man, woman and child. And they waited for villagers to return from
far away. And they cut off their heads too. And there was no more
robbery. If you are going to rule, you must use your power and be
firm.'''
</P>
<P>
   If other Muslim nations, however, think they can regard
themselves as squeaky-clean in the execution stakes, here are a few
statistics to suggest otherwise: Iraq has so far this year executed
208 people, Kuwait six, Yemen 17, Iran 69, United Arab Emirates
two.
</P>
<P>
   Just over four years ago, the Emirates executed an 18-year old
Sri Lankan girl on her birthday _ despite her denials that she had
killed the baby she was looking after in an Arab home.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the United States has executed 59 people by
lethal injection and electric chair. &QL;

basic norms of international law and are often heard in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Saudi Arabia have said that women convicted of drugs
offenses are sometimes rape victims who are judicially murdered to
prevent them identifying their assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Executioners usually clean their sword by wiping off the blood
on the white clothes of their newly-dead victim.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia regularly justifies these bloody scenes by quoting
from Koranic law, by reminding foreigners of Saudi tradition and by
insisting upon the integrity and humanity of its courts.
</P>
<P>
   In one case last year, a Saudi executioner had raised his sword
over a condemned man's head when the father of the boy he was
accused of murdering stepped forward to pardon the prisoner. The
executioner lowered his sword and his would-be victim swooned to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But death sentences are rarely commuted _ unless, of course, the
prisoner happens to be a British nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Death by the blade is something all Saudis know of but few wish
to discuss. But last week, I spoke to a man who had once flown over
the Saudi desert with the old King Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost dark and the king wanted to show me a village,''
he said. ``I didn't know why but when we got overhead, it was just
a deserted place with a few stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the king said to me: `The people of this village used
to rob the caravans to Mecca and I warned them to stop. They didn't
listen to me, so I warned them again. Again, they didn't listen. So
I sent my guards to the village and they cut off the heads of every
man, woman and child. And they waited for villagers to return from
far away. And they cut off their heads too. And there was no more
robbery. If you are going to rule, you must use your power and be
firm.'''
</P>
<P>
   If other Muslim nations, however, think they can regard
themselves as squeaky-clean in the execution stakes, here are a few
statistics to suggest otherwise: Iraq has so far this year executed
208 people, Kuwait six, Yemen 17, Iran 69, United Arab Emirates
two.
</P>
<P>
   Just over four years ago, the Emirates executed an 18-year old
Sri Lankan girl on her birthday _ despite her denials that she had
killed the baby she was looking after in an Arab home.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the United States has executed 59 people by
lethal injection and electric chair. &QL;

HITTING THE JACKPOT AT A MEXICAN SPA

<P>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico _ I like to daydream about how I someday will
spend my lottery millions. So many things, so much money. What to
do first and where will I hide out while pondering the options?
</P>
<P>
   The answers came earlier this year during a trip to Mexico _ I
will pamper myself at a spa. After sampling a few spas in January,
I now know the first step on the road to millions is a vacation
with revitalizing facials, massages, exfoliation and salt rubs.
I'll luxuriate in the gardens of Hacienda Cocoyoc, paddle my toes
in Lake Tequesquintengo after a massage at Villa Bejar or smell the
flowers of Hosteria Las Quintas while I wait for my next spa
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to be a millionaire to indulge in Mexico's
spas. Many packages offered are very affordable, with some
inclusive of lodging, airport transfers and meals. While patrons
might find the occasional celebrity hiding out in a terry cloth
robe, more likely you'll be rubbing elbows with people from all
parts of the United States, Europe, Japan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Spa clients are getting younger and more mainstream, according
to Sheryl Sciro, president of media for Spa Finders, the world's
largest spa reservation service and publisher of the Spa Finder
magazine. Twenty-five percent are younger than 35, and 12 percent
are older than 65. The average age of a spa client, according to
Spa Finder research, is 44.
</P>
<P>
   The average income for a spa client has dropped. In 1992, less
than 8 percent earned under $50,000. Today, 20 percent of spa goers
earn less than $50,000. The number of men going to spas has more
than doubled since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So indulge in these Mexican spas:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOSTERIA LAS QUINTAS
</P>
<P>
   Las Quintas is a quiet oasis of calm amid the hustle and bustle.
The cool tiles, flowering gardens and manicured lawns paint a
picture of serenity.
</P>
<P>
   Courtly and courteous, white-haired Orlando Hidalgo greets
guests at the five-star, 60-room Hosteria Las Quintas in Cuernavaca
(the City of Eternal Spring). His son, also Orlando, is the owner
of the spa, but the duties of meeting and greeting new guests to
the hotel fall to the father. He explains the system of the spa _
everything is assigned points from spa treatments to tours with one
point equaling $1.20 (U.S.) for the spa treatments and $1 per point
for tours.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cuba, the senior Hidalgo was in the restaurant
business for 45 years in the United States before retiring. He
knows that his guests expect a certain level of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't leave guests hanging,'' Hidalgo says, explaining that
an airport greeter meets arrivals in Mexico City and takes them to
the Pullman de Morelas bus that serves Cuernavaca. At the bus
terminal, guests are met by another representative of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our guests are not here to lose weight,'' he says.
``They are here to be pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   Famous guests have included actress Shari Belafonte and opera
singer Jessye Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat them (the famous) just the same as everybody,''
Hidalgo says. At Las Quintas, which represents the high end of spas
in Mexico, a feeling of luxury permeates every aspect. Meals and
accommodations are included in most packages, but gratuities (daily
charges of $8 for servers, $4 for maids) are extra.
</P>
<P>
   Packages range from a two-night stress relief program at $559
(single), to a seven-night Healthy Lifestyle Week, up to $2,119
(single).
</P>
<P>
   I had time to indulge in a deep cleansing, 60-minute facial (30
points) that left me, according to a fellow travel writer, ``with
the skin of a baby.'' Other spa treatments range from hydrotherapy
and loofah scrubs to Swedish massage, seaweed wraps and mineral
baths. There are doctors on call for complete physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants have both regular and spa menus, special diets
can be accommodated and there is room service.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers bloom year-round in the 80,000-square-feet of gardens,
which are dotted with statues. As he spoke about the facilities
over lunch in the garden, Hidalgo Sr. explains the differences that
put Las Quintas in the upper echelon of Mexico's spas. ``We were
the first to introduce eco-tours. We're different than every other
spa,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While visitors go to the spas for the spa treatments, as
tourists they want to see and experience Mexico. Las Quintas'
guided tours are via air-conditioned sport utility vehicles, with
boxed lunches. Sites visited include the pyramids of Tepoztlan; Las
Etacas, a crystal river with natural springs; the archaeological
site at Xochicalco; a city tour of Cuernavaca; the silver city of
Taxco; the lagoons of Zempoala; the caverns of Cacahumilpa; and the
Thousand Waterfalls of Granada. Points assessed for these trips
range from 40 to 75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VILLA BEJAR
</P>
<P>
   Joyce and Judith (who asked that their last names be omitted) of
New York City found Villa Bejar through Spa Finder magazine. They
liked the price, $900 each for a full week, including meals and
airport transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't touch a spa in the U.S. for that,'' Judith said.
</P>
<P>
   While the women had praise for the spa, on the shore of Lake
Tequesquintengo, they found the food lacking, the wine list
mediocre and apparently had some trouble finding their airport
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   With her year-round tan and short spiky hair, Judith was the
picture of glowing health. The Manhattan businesswoman said she
likes a spa vacation to feel revitalized. She admitted her surprise
that none of the spa attendants spoke English.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Villa Bejar had Xenia Orlandi, the spa coordinator to
serve as translator for the New York duo during their visit. At age
21, Orlandi seemed young, for the job, but very capable with her
knowledge of hotel management, which she has studied in
Switzerland. Her languages included Spanish, Italian, English and
some French.

<P>
   Diplomats can recognize a duck when they see one: if it looks,
acts and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. So why can't they
recognize the Taliban?
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the Taliban have been looking, acting
and quacking like the government of Afghanistan, yet only three
countries _ all Muslim _ recognize them as such.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan badly needs a recognizable government. Like many
another country, it is an artificial affair, a cartographical
concept matched on the ground not by a harmonious nation but by
peoples who have fought each other for generations, and been fought
over by outsiders for just as long.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes seen as a buffer state, it has proved better at
providing shocks than at absorbing them. It has certainly not
provided stability of government. Yet, under the Taliban, something
like a stable government seems to have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are still challenged by opposition groups, their
grip on the 90 percent of the country that they now control is
hardly in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After the setback to peace talks in Uzbekistan this week, the
opposition is left with the choice of resuming, in due course, the
search for a power-sharing agreement or of seeking contentment in
an extended sulk. It has little prospect of gaining power through
victory on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the West not give diplomatic recognition to
Afghanistan's rulers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that the Taliban are a bunch of Islamic zealots
who treat their own people, especially their women, with scant
regard for modern liberal norms, and would dearly love to see
others treated in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries in their neighborhood, notably Russia, India
and Iran, regard them with the utmost suspicion. The United States
regards them with horror.
</P>
<P>
   They give sanctuary to militants _ some would say terrorists _
including Osama bin Laden, who is accused by America of
masterminding the blowing up of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Taliban are ducks, they are undeniably ugly ducks.
Moreover, some would argue that, whatever the old rules of
diplomacy, times have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, ex-dictators like Augusto Pinochet find themselves
arrested on medical trips to London, NATO goes to war to stop
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and the world is trying to set up an
international criminal court. Morality is now the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban may be no more wicked than the Soviet Union was;
they may be no more destabilizing than China; they may treat women
no worse than the Saudis do; but sooner or later new rules must be
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time. Yet diplomatic recognition need not be the
enemy of morality. Countries recognize each other not because they
like or approve of their counterparts' politics, but because they
must deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries have plenty to discuss with Afghanistan:
drugs, human rights and terrorism, for a start. By all means seek
to win concessions in return for diplomatic recognition, but do not
imagine that all the benefits of having the Taliban accepted in
world counsels lie with them.
</P>
<P>
   It is very much in the interests of all sorts of outsiders to
see the rulers of Afghanistan crack down on the export of both
drugs and terror. And those who preach morality should want to see
the better treatment of Afghan citizens too.
</P>
<P>
   The motto for the West should be recognize and pressurize.
Isolation, after all, does not necessarily breed moderation.
Conversation, by contrast, may. &QL;

<P>
   Are Slavs and democracy destined not to mix?
</P>
<P>
   From the harsh plains of northern Europe down to the bloody
Balkans, from the Black Sea across ten time zones to Siberia's
Pacific coast, Slavs have had but feeble and fleeting experiences
of gentle or just government, let alone democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of communism a decade ago, hopes of freedom rose,
then faded. Two chunks of Slavdom, in particular, have most
patently disappointed: the Slavic core of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus; and the southern Slavs, centered on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is wrong to presume that Slavs can never be democrats.
Corrupt, incompetent and brutal as many of Europe's post-communist
governments have been, political and economic freedoms, albeit
often of the roughest kind, have burst forth in many places that
had seen none before.
</P>
<P>
   Russian elections at various levels have been a remarkable and
cheering novelty. The young, tough, clever and energetic have
unleashed their creative energies.
</P>
<P>
   And those Slavs who have had stronger and longer historic links
with the West _ Poles and Czechs, to name just some _ are indeed
creating juster, as well as richer, societies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Serbs have been making mayhem in the Balkans,
other southern Slavs (Macedonians, Bulgars and Slovenes, among
them) have been striving valiantly to nurture their new
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that many Belarussians and Ukrainians, as
well as Russians, should hanker after the undemocratic but
comforting order of the past. The change has been traumatic and,
for millions of the poor and weak, for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is still deeply confused. Belarus, a small country of
questionable identity, has fallen under the thrall of a demagogue,
Alexander Lukashenka. Ukraine, with a population of 51 million and
vast economic potential, is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   If the people of those three countries, resenting the West's
seeming arrogance, wish to bond together again and turn their faces
inwards, that is their right.
</P>
<P>
   Though he may be thinking anew, Lukashenka has long sought to
link Belarus to Russia again. With an election for Ukraine's
presidency due in October, several leading candidates want their
country to join up with Russia too. If that happens, the West
cannot object.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a wrong turn _ for the Slavs as much as for the
West. A bigger, yet still unreformed, Russia would be tempted to be
just that much more mischievous and menacing to its small neighbors
than it is already.
</P>
<P>
   Malign as Lukashenka is to his own people, Belarus on its own
would scarcely frighten Poles or Lithuanians in the way an expanded
Russia, with Belarus as its western flank, inevitably would.
</P>
<P>
   The West must keep its doors open to all those Slavs who may
aspire to join its economic and political clubs, especially the
European Union, so long as the prospective members meet the entry
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine, strategically, is the key. Despite the failure of its
economy and the sourness of its politics, it has done well to
persuade the Russians that they should, by treaty, accept its
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia, it should be said, has done well to recognize that
the disputed Crimean peninsula is sovereign Ukrainian territory,
Russian pride having been salved with special rights for its Black
Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus, though less important geopolitically than Ukraine,
should have the same chance to reach out to the West, especially if
its leader's mooted change of heart is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The West should do what it can to help and encourage the muzzled
Belarussian opposition. It should lift as many obstacles as
possible to free trade for both Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should Russia be cold-shouldered. Throwing money at it is
not the answer. But the idea that Russians, any more than other
Slavs, are allergic to democracy is as absurd as the myth of their
special soulfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Europe will never be truly free until settled democracy extends
all the way to the Urals. The West must prod, persuade and
persevere. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ For those who consider America a healthily
meritocratic country, with a less healthy penchant for political
correctness, the past week has been something of a revelation.
</P>

death of a likeable, intelligent young man who was still best known

   Since the aircraft flown by John F. Kennedy Jr., with his wife
and sister-in-law as passengers, disappeared somewhere off Martha's

<P>
   There have been exceptions _ notably the New York Times, which

   News anchors, the town criers of the age, have quoted tearfully

</P>
<P>
   For the Kennedys, a family for whom Luke 12:48 (``For unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required'') has
become more than a motto, this will be another ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline, John Kennedy's sister, has now lost both parents,
three siblings (another brother in infancy, a sister stillborn),
two uncles _ both died young and violently _ and numerous cousins.
For the Bessettes, the experience may well be even more gruelling.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a hurricane of words and pictures? The question is
worth asking because it goes to the heart of many of the debates
about modern celebrity: most notably, the question of whether the
media are merely sating an unquenchable thirst, or are
force-feeding a reluctant public.
</P>
<P>
   Few would deny that the deaths deserved wide attention. Only the
hardest heart could fail to be moved by the drama of young lives
cut short, particularly given the Kennedys' place in modern
American history. &QL;

<P>
   Kennedy (who was on People's cover 15 times) has been a national

Kennedy's death happened at the peak of what might be called a slow

</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Kosovo ended, we have had practically no hard
news,'' admits a senior editor at one American news magazine,
pointing to the recent splurge of covers on topics such as health,
Latin pop music and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   This challenge has been even harder for the squadron of
news-and-pundits television channels such as CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
and CNBC. The long-drawn-out search for Kennedy's aircraft (finally
found on July 20) could have been made for their format.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of a modest backlash. Local talk-radio
hosts, such as Tom Leykis in Los Angeles, have begun to complain
about spending so much time on someone who achieved so relatively
little _ and also about the fact that much more may have been spent
on finding Kennedy's aircraft than on many others.
</P>
<P>
   Another provocateur, Mark Steyn, writing in Britain's Daily
Telegraph, notes that local affiliates in places like Burlington,
Vt., have shown limited interest in a man who could be summed up as
the ``glossy editor of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, he argues, a generational gap between the
Camelot-obsessed elderly editors at the main networks and their
younger, savvier contemporaries at local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University
and the author of a forthcoming book on celebrity (``What Price
Fame?'' to be published next year by Harvard University Press),
also subscribes to the view that the coverage has been excessive,
and out of contact with the broad mass of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's death, he argues, will come to be seen as ``just
another installment in the Kennedy family novel'' rather than a
totemic event like his father's death or that of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the princess's death, the most often-cited comparison,
reinforces the suspicion that the media frenzy around Kennedy has
been at least partly supply-driven. To begin with, she was much
more famous than he was _ around ten times, by one crude measure.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Lexis-Nexis search of newspapers finds 3,414 mentions of
the princess in the 90 days before she died, against only 357 for
Kennedy (even if it is limited to American papers, the ratio is
around 5:1). And she was on People's cover 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, the most memorable aspects of Diana's death _
London covered in flowers, the thunderous acclamation for her
brother's speech _ were unscripted events, often it seemed in
defiance of a cynical media. The mass hysteria about her death had,
in marketing jargon, a bottom-up quality. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ For those who consider America a healthily

correctness, the past week has been something of a revelation.

<P>
   The airwaves and newsstands have been dominated by the tragic
death of a likeable, intelligent young man who was still best known

   They waddle slowly through the shopping malls; drive with
exaggerated care on the freeways; fumble with their change at the
checkout tills.
</P>
<P>
   In America's impatient culture, where competition is everything
and the richest man (counting his Microsoft billions just east of
Seattle) is only 43, it is easy to deride the elderly as
preordained losers, to be lectured at rather than listened to.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde pointed out more than a century ago, ``In
America, the young are always ready to give to those who are older
than themselves the full benefit of their inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that the concerns of the old are the obsessions of
the political establishment?
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years the policy debate has been dominated not
by education, or race, or the environment, or gun control _ all of
them worthy enough topics for most Americans _ but by the future of
Medicare and Social Security, the two entitlement programs for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Is this because American politicians have charitable feelings
that other Americans lack? Or because, pace Wilde, they respect the
aged even as they themselves strive so hard to appear unchangingly
young?
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, the reason lies elsewhere: in the simple fact that
the old vote more readily than the young.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 federal elections, for example, just under half of
the electorate aged 25-44 voted, accounting for 39 percent of the
turnout. By contrast, 64 percent of voters aged 45-64 voted and 67
percent of those aged 65 or over; together they accounted for 53
percent of the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you win the votes of the old and those who
can see old age fast approaching, you win the election _ a formula
that becomes ever more convincing as Americans live longer and as
the baby-boomers move past the menopause.
</P>
<P>
   One youngish Democratic strategist bluntly explains: ``If
they're going to pander to me by coming out to vote, I'm going to
pander to them.'' Translate that into policy, and it means
emphasizing things like Social Security and downplaying tax cuts
(after all, the retired don't pay much tax).
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Democrats can present themselves as the party of
the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced Social Security
specifically to abolish poverty among the old.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republicans are ready to jeopardize the
retirement safety net with wild schemes of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   How well this Democratic plan will work in next year's elections
remains to be seen. After all, in last year's midterm elections
elderly whites _ though not blacks _ tended to vote Republican,
apparently in protest at President Bill Clinton's antics with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case it must surely be a mistake (typical of the
young) to characterize the old as being all alike. Democrats like
to describe as typical the 70-year-old widow, able to get by for
the moment but terrified by the prospect of unaffordable nursing
care and prescription drugs (which are the fastest growing area of
spending by the old).
</P>
<P>
   The Republican riposte usually features the retired shopkeeper,
made wealthy by the stock market boom and hoping not to be
clobbered by capital-gains tax, or the arthritic farmer, anxious
that his descendants will not be impoverished by inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican images are selective snapshots of
a reality in which the median net worth of households headed by
Americans aged 65 or over is around double the national average _
but in which a tenth of such households are also living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. It is surely pleasant for all the old, so often
ignored by their children (32 million Americans aged 65 and over
live alone), to feel wanted, even if only by politicians and
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle, however, is their reluctance to enjoy being old, to
admit to being ``grey warriors'' even as the politicians pay homage
to grey power.
</P>
<P>
   The old are not ``old,'' they are ``senior citizens''; their
persuasive lobby group, the AARP, calls itself an association of
``retired persons'' (which may be reasonable enough since its
membership begins at the age of 50); their retirement ghettos in
Florida and Arizona are ``gated communities,'' some of which offer
``assisted living'' for those who have become physically or
mentally ``challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense this reluctance is doubtless universal. It seems
unlikely, for example, that the Japanese, even as they preach that
age, wisdom and power all go together, actually appreciate seeing
the effects of gravity on their aging bodies. And no one,
regardless of race or culture, can be happy as muscles and memory
begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Americans are surely unique in their determination not
to grow old gracefully. Last year, for example, they paid for
almost 2.8 million cosmetic procedures, from ``tummy tucks'' to
hair transplants, which were designed either to adjust reality or
to stave off the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, almost a quarter were done to the bodies of baby
boomers and their siblings in their 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Is such suffering endured in a good cause? In the sense that the
more competition the better, maybe so. Let the old, if they feel so
inclined, strive against the young for everyone's economic benefit.
But let them not feel they have to be so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans are asked to define the age at which ``old''
begins, those who are aged 18-24 answer 58 _ but those aged 65 or
over answer 75.
</P>
<P>
   With luck that shift of definition is positive, evidence that
today's new ``seniors'' are enjoying the rejuvenating effects of
Viagra, HRT and the rest of the pharmacopoeia pressed on them at
every commercial break in the TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a less happy explanation. Even though the
advance of medicine is slowing the aging process and extending
life-expectancy, some 63 percent of American adults would,
according to an AARP survey, prefer not to live to 100.
</P>
<P>
   The leading reason for their reluctance is a fear of being in
poor health, but the second reason _ cited by 38 percent of the
poll _ is the fear of not having enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Add those feelings of insecurity to the demographic arithmetic
(the number of 65-and-overs will almost double in the next 30
years), and no wonder Democrats and Republicans alike have decided
to use the budget surplus to ``save Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, if in electoral terms age comes so clearly before
beauty? If the young object, they can always go and vote. &QL;

<P>
   They waddle slowly through the shopping malls; drive with
exaggerated care on the freeways; fumble with their change at the
checkout tills.
</P>
<P>
   In America's impatient culture, where competition is everything
and the richest man (counting his Microsoft billions just east of
Seattle) is only 43, it is easy to deride the elderly as
preordained losers, to be lectured at rather than listened to.
</P>
<P>
   As Oscar Wilde pointed out more than a century ago, ``In
America, the young are always ready to give to those who are older
than themselves the full benefit of their inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that the concerns of the old are the obsessions of
the political establishment?
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years the policy debate has been dominated not
by education, or race, or the environment, or gun control _ all of
them worthy enough topics for most Americans _ but by the future of
Medicare and Social Security, the two entitlement programs for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Is this because American politicians have charitable feelings
that other Americans lack? Or because, pace Wilde, they respect the
aged even as they themselves strive so hard to appear unchangingly
young?
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, the reason lies elsewhere: in the simple fact that
the old vote more readily than the young.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 federal elections, for example, just under half of
the electorate aged 25-44 voted, accounting for 39 percent of the
turnout. By contrast, 64 percent of voters aged 45-64 voted and 67
percent of those aged 65 or over; together they accounted for 53
percent of the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you win the votes of the old and those who
can see old age fast approaching, you win the election _ a formula
that becomes ever more convincing as Americans live longer and as
the baby-boomers move past the menopause.
</P>
<P>
   One youngish Democratic strategist bluntly explains: ``If
they're going to pander to me by coming out to vote, I'm going to
pander to them.'' Translate that into policy, and it means
emphasizing things like Social Security and downplaying tax cuts
(after all, the retired don't pay much tax).
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Democrats can present themselves as the party of
the New Deal, when Franklin Roosevelt introduced Social Security
specifically to abolish poverty among the old.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Republicans are ready to jeopardize the
retirement safety net with wild schemes of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   How well this Democratic plan will work in next year's elections
remains to be seen. After all, in last year's midterm elections
elderly whites _ though not blacks _ tended to vote Republican,
apparently in protest at President Bill Clinton's antics with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case it must surely be a mistake (typical of the
young) to characterize the old as being all alike. Democrats like
to describe as typical the 70-year-old widow, able to get by for
the moment but terrified by the prospect of unaffordable nursing
care and prescription drugs (which are the fastest growing area of
spending by the old).

<P>
   On a recent Saturday morning, cyclists gathered on an island in
the Mississippi River near St. Paul, Minnesota, to embark on the
fourth annual ``Tour de Sprawl,'' a bike tour sponsored by the
Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them held picket signs, but the stunning blue sky and a
soft breeze seemed to soften their protest. Not to say there's none
to be had.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul ranked eighth on the
Sierra Club's 1998 blacklist of sprawling cities of 1 million or
more. According to the club's figures, growth there is covering 64
acres a day.
</P>
<P>
   People spend almost three times as long in traffic jams today as
they did in 1982, and the miles of congested freeway are predicted
to double by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all this is clear enough. Because cities at the
edge of metropolitan areas, in Minnesota as elsewhere, are bent on
building a solid tax base, many choose to plan only for big,
expensive houses on big sites.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, communities of huge houses and tiny saplings are
springing up around a golf course or a man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has caused a boom in construction; in 1998, housing
permits in the Twin Cities shot up by 20 percent over the year
before. But most of this building was going on many miles from the
city centers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the older northern and western suburbs of
Minneapolis, schools have closed at an alarming rate as people flee
ever outward. From 1970 to 1990, 78 schools opened in the outer
suburbs, while 162 closed in the central city and the inner
suburban ring.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers there have to travel to the favored suburbs to
work, thus spending more time on the roads and more of their income
on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Some take ``reverse commutes'' on buses that shuttle workers
from the less-favored spots to the wealthier upstart communities.
These vehicles are sometimes known as ``Soweto buses,'' implying
that workers can work in the leafy suburbs, but aren't fit to live
there.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of groups are struggling to get sprawl under control. The
biggest is the Metropolitan Council, based in St. Paul, a regional
organization that supervises transport, sewerage, housing and
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The council wants houses closer together, with an average of
7,500 square feet of land _ no more _ for every new house built. It
would also like to see housing for the rich, not-so-rich and poor
mixed together and, not least, a centralized, efficient sewerage
system.
</P>
<P>
   These aims were mere dreams until two years ago, when some of
the older suburbs joined forces to wrest control of sewerage and
transport financing from the state government.
</P>
<P>
   That put more than $650 million of state money under the
Metropolitan Council's direct supervision, and made it one of the
largest regional-government bodies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The council's new power allows it to withhold money for sewerage
and transport from new developments in the seven-county
metropolitan area if these do not comply with its planning
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But growth is happening fastest in at least four far-flung
counties that are not under the council's direct domain. There, the
council can do no more than plead with city officials to put limits
on growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also carrying out a survey, jointly with Minnesota
Planning, into metropolitan land use, which hopes to knit together
city, county and state organizations to save farmland and open
space and to revitalize the urban core by creating clear boundaries
between city and country.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the council is Ted Mondale, the son of former
Vice-President Walter Mondale. The head of Minnesota Planning is
Dean Barkley of the Reform Party, best known until now for helping
to engineer Governor Jesse Ventura's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will also consider how the state can plan housing
developments around the projected light-rail system. The first
line, a 12-mile stretch from the Mall of America in Bloomington to
downtown Minneapolis, will open in 2003. Later, spokes will extend
from Minneapolis outward into the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope that the system will carry workers cheaply to
their jobs, encourage growth along the railway lines and keep
people from staking claims in distant communities.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the $446 million cost is expected to come from federal
coffers by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, too, has some proposals up his sleeve, not least
because sprawl is affecting him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura grew up in central Minneapolis, but has since settled
down on a 32-acre ranch in Maple Grove on the northwestern edge of
urban development.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy hovers over Maple Grove. In 1995, the Metropolitan
Council required over half of all new housing units there to be
``affordable'' (i.e., for those on low and middling incomes) but,
by 1997, only a fifth of new developments met the test.
</P>
<P>
   One developer brought a civil-rights suit against the city, and
a city manager was fired for trying to push for more housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The city then ended a reverse-commute program suggested by the
council. Only pressure from an affiliate of the Catholic
archdiocese persuaded the city to approve a paltry 19 units of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, huge new (non-affordable) housing developments are
spreading over the cornfields near Ventura's ranch. Rankled by what
he sees from his own back yard, the governor has strongly supported
commuter and light rail transport systems and endorsed, in June,
ten principles for development put forward by Minnesota's Smart
Growth Network.
</P>
<P>
   These included encouraging development in places already
equipped with roads and sewers, rather than in empty country;
providing a mixture of land uses, which might bring with it a
variety of housing and jobs; and promoting ``the revitalization of
existing urban and rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ventura has his opponents. Republicans in the state
legislature are suspicious of all these maneuvers and the
left-leaning groups that back them.
</P>
<P>
   They have succeeded in shutting down a fairly new advisory
council on community-based planning, and hope to keep their
opponents from ``densifying'' the outer-ring suburbs which,
increasingly, make up their core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   They do not deny the need for some planning, but are fearful of
what they see as social engineering. Let people live where they
like, they say. Do not force them into planned communities inspired
by some New Urbanist hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   As for the governor, a few local politicians wonder aloud why he
is willing to deny others the right to build on multiple-acre plots
while he enjoys his own. &QL;

mixed together and, not least, a centralized, efficient sewerage
system.
</P>
<P>
   These aims were mere dreams until two years ago, when some of
the older suburbs joined forces to wrest control of sewerage and
transport financing from the state government.
</P>
<P>
   That put more than $650 million of state money under the
Metropolitan Council's direct supervision, and made it one of the
largest regional-government bodies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The council's new power allows it to withhold money for sewerage
and transport from new developments in the seven-county
metropolitan area if these do not comply with its planning
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But growth is happening fastest in at least four far-flung
counties that are not under the council's direct domain. There, the
council can do no more than plead with city officials to put limits
on growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also carrying out a survey, jointly with Minnesota
Planning, into metropolitan land use, which hopes to knit together
city, county and state organizations to save farmland and open
space and to revitalize the urban core by creating clear boundaries
between city and country.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the council is Ted Mondale, the son of former
Vice-President Walter Mondale. The head of Minnesota Planning is
Dean Barkley of the Reform Party, best known until now for helping
to engineer Governor Jesse Ventura's rise to power.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will also consider how the state can plan housing
developments around the projected light-rail system. The first
line, a 12-mile stretch from the Mall of America in Bloomington to
downtown Minneapolis, will open in 2003. Later, spokes will extend
from Minneapolis outward into the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope that the system will carry workers cheaply to
their jobs, encourage growth along the railway lines and keep
people from staking claims in distant communities.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the $446 million cost is expected to come from federal
coffers by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, too, has some proposals up his sleeve, not least
because sprawl is affecting him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura grew up in central Minneapolis, but has since settled
down on a 32-acre ranch in Maple Grove on the northwestern edge of
urban development.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy hovers over Maple Grove. In 1995, the Metropolitan
Council required over half of all new housing units there to be
``affordable'' (i.e., for those on low and middling incomes) but,
by 1997, only a fifth of new developments met the test.
</P>
<P>
   One developer brought a civil-rights suit against the city, and
a city manager was fired for trying to push for more housing for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The city then ended a reverse-commute program suggested by the
council. Only pressure from an affiliate of the Catholic
archdiocese persuaded the city to approve a paltry 19 units of
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, huge new (non-affordable) housing developments are
spreading over the cornfields near Ventura's ranch. Rankled by what
he sees from his own back yard, the governor has strongly supported
commuter and light rail transport systems and endorsed, in June,
ten principles for development put forward by Minnesota's Smart
Growth Network.
</P>
<P>
   These included encouraging development in places already
equipped with roads and sewers, rather than in empty country;
providing a mixture of land uses, which might bring with it a
variety of housing and jobs; and promoting ``the revitalization of
existing urban and rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ventura has his opponents. Republicans in the state
legislature are suspicious of all these maneuvers and the
left-leaning groups that back them.
</P>
<P>
   They have succeeded in shutting down a fairly new advisory
council on community-based planning, and hope to keep their
opponents from ``densifying'' the outer-ring suburbs which,
increasingly, make up their core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   They do not deny the need for some planning, but are fearful of
what they see as social engineering. Let people live where they
like, they say. Do not force them into planned communities inspired
by some New Urbanist hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   As for the governor, a few local politicians wonder aloud why he
is willing to deny others the right to build on multiple-acre plots
while he enjoys his own. &QL;

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. _ America's vacation season is off to a
strong start. With gasoline prices blissfully low, airline
companies fighting over fares and a general sense of economic
well-being, everything looks rosy.
</P>
<P>
   So why do Americans still seem to have such difficulty enjoying
their vacations?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cindy Aron, a history professor at the University
of Virginia, the answer lies in the past. Despite a dramatic
increase in leisure time since the mid-19th century, Americans are
simply hooked on their jobs. After all, neither they, nor their
country, got ahead by being idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans engaged in a love-hate battle with their vacations _
both wanting to take them and fearing the consequences,'' writes
Aron in ``Working at Play: A History of Vacations in the United
States'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Relaxing did not come easily to American men and women who
continued to use their leisure in the performance of various sorts
of work _ religious work, intellectual work, therapeutic work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure and labor remained complicated and troubling
categories, in some ways polar opposites, in other ways closely
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century this friction continues,
regardless of station or income.
</P>
<P>
   Media moguls hunt for deals at Herbert Allen's invitation-only
investment conference in the Rocky Mountain resort of Sun Valley,
Idaho. Companies of firemen from the Washington suburbs crowd into
rented accommodation on the Atlantic beaches of Delaware, where the
talk is of the station house rather than the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Aron is immune. While working on her book, she took
along her portable computer to her family's annual retreat, a
waterfront house in New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   As she herself laments, ``Technology has made it too easy to
carry our work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Except to the very wealthy, who visited fashionable mountain
spas to escape the heat and disease of the cities, rest and
relaxation were mysteries to most Americans in the 1800s. A pause
from one's labors seemed to betray the Protestant ethic on which
the United States was founded.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1850s, as the word ``vacation'' first wormed its way
into the American lexicon, even spiritual leaders began to suggest
that leisure and relaxation could lead to God.
</P>
<P>
   From this, in short order, sprang the camp meetings: inexpensive
family getaways with a religious flavor, popular with blacks and
whites alike, in tiny communities that would become resorts in
their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a century ago, Rehoboth Beach, Del., was best known as
the site of an annual Methodist meeting. Now it is nicknamed ``the
Nation's Summer Capitol'' because of its popularity with Washington
power-brokers.
</P>
<P>
   One other vacation spot with roots in the 19th century clings to
its origins as a place of intellectual refreshment. At Chautauqua,
in upstate New York, members of the burgeoning middle class used to
attend concerts and talks on the social ills of the day; sometimes
they would study Greek, Latin and Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 years later, Chautauqua still blends the
educational and recreational.
</P>
<P>
   It was at vacation spots that society's norms were tested and
changed. In the 19th century's posh resorts of the South and New
England, mixed-sex amusements included more than nightly
fancy-dress balls.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a ``Venus Libitina'' emerging from the brine at
Virginia's Old Point Comfort, J.R.V. Daniels, a lawyer from
Richmond, huffed that ``society must throw her out.''
</P>
<P>
   But before long newspapers were feasting on similar antics of
the rich and celebrated, much as they feed today on the doings of
the glitterati who descend on the Hamptons of New York's Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Europeans increasingly consider vacations a right,
Americans still largely view leisure time as a privilege. Employers
are not required by law to provide vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Aron's research reveals that the company-sponsored summer break,
with pay, is a 20th-century phenomenon which, curiously, was
extended to most workers only during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The economic downturn cut into vacation spending, but it had
almost fully recovered by the mid-1930s. This was to hasten what
Aron describes as ``cross-class sharing of vacation experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Although racial and religious segregation was the rule, blacks
and Jews created resorts that were similar to those open only to
white Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Bluffs, a black vacation area on Martha's Vineyard, thrives
to this day, although the Jewish resorts in New York's Catskill
mountains have virtually disappeared, victims of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is the pragmatic American approach to
vacations. The message to vacationers since the 19th century, Aron
writes, has been ``Take a vacation, relax and enjoy yourself; but
be wary of idleness and try to make your vacation a useful,
productive endeavor.''

MCCHORD AIRCREWS EAGERLY AWAIT STATE-OF-THE-ART C-17S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCHORD AIR FORCE BASE _ Maj. Steve Tank and Capt. Chris Marohl
were flying at 3,000 feet over Charleston, S.C., when a major
in-flight emergency suddenly threatened their new C-17 Globemaster
III aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The master caution on their instrument panel lit up and a
disembodied female voice called out, ``Warning _ manifold
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Air Force Reserve pilots focused on a cockpit warning
light locating the problem in the forced-air system in the right
wing, but by that time the on-board computer had already identified
the problem and closed the necessary valves to isolate the failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, hold it a moment,'' said Dewey Owens, the lead pilot
instructor. He touched the screen on a computer mounted behind the
cockpit seats and the flat coastal landscape of South Carolina
moving past outside the aircraft vanished, replaced instantly by a
different scene _ a thick gray layer of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots relaxed as a door at the rear of the cockpit
opened, revealing not the C-17's cavernous cargo bay, but a
50-foot-tall windowless room painted a dazzling white that contains
the C-17 flight simulator in which they were training.
</P>
<P>
   After years of preparation, McChord Air Force Base near Tacoma,
Wash., will enter a new era Friday when Air Mobility Command
officials formally welcome the first pair of C-17s assigned to the
62nd Airlift Wing and its partners in the reserve 446th Airlift
Wing here. Air Mobility Commander Gen. Tony Robertson is scheduled
to preside at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But all across McChord, the men and women who will fly and
maintain the new aircraft have not waited for the official ceremony
to begin their transition. Pilots Tank and Marohl are two of
hundreds of McChord personnel deeply involved in training to move
from the older C-141B Starlifter to the C-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``This airplane is built from 40 years of lessons learned in the
airlift community,'' said Lou Matz, a former C-141B pilot who is
now the site manager of the C-17 training facility at McChord
operated under contract by Boeing Aerospace Operations.
</P>
<P>
   Just 6 feet longer and with a wingspan only 10 feet wider than
the plane it is replacing, the C-17 can carry twice the cargo _
170,900 pounds. It can operate with a full load on an unpaved
runway of only 3,000 feet _ half that needed by the C141B.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the computer revolution, the C-17 requires only a
crew of three _ pilot, co-pilot and cargo loadmaster _ compared
with the crew of five to seven needed on the C-141B, Matz said.
</P>
<P>
   Aircrew members training for the new aircraft have already taken
flight in the simulator and in borrowed C-17s. Ground crews and
maintenance technicians have been training on ``guest'' C-17s
temporarily operating here, and dozens of others have gone to other
bases for instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the state-of-the-art C-17 flight simulator at
McChord went online and the first cadre of what will be hundreds of
flight crew students are using the facility, Matz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome plane, just incredible,'' said Maj. Rick
Mercado, a veteran KC-135 aerial tanker pilot who is learning to
fly the C-17. Like the others, he is plowing through 85
computer-based lessons on the aircraft and its systems required
along with the flight simulator time and actual training flights.
After progressing through co-pilot and pilot courses, Mercado will
take an instructor class to become a C-17 trainer himself.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the C-17, coming amid a $131 million construction
program that began in 1997 and won't be complete until 2004, is
transforming the Pierce County air base to one of only two
installations in the country operating the C-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the airplane of choice'' for future military
operations requiring the rapid dispatch of troops and supplies
overseas, said Col. Rick Pilling, the C-17 project officer at
McChord. ``Our tempo of operations here will remain high with this
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   McChord will receive seven of the aircraft by the end of this
year and reach its planned inventory of 48 by late 2002. The wing
is simultaneously phasing out the 1960s-era C-141B Starlifters that
have been a fixture here since the Vietnam War. The other
operational C-17 wing is at Charleston, and a handful of C-17s are
assigned to Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma for training.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the base has been transformed since 1997 with its
massive construction program to build the administrative, training
and maintenance buildings required for the C-17.
</P>
<P>
   There are 25 construction projects including upgrades to the
aircraft fuel supply system and repair hangar conversions to
accommodate the larger C-17, squadron operations and maintenance
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will appreciate this plane in another way,'' said
Pilling, the C-17 project manager. ``It's much quieter.''

LEASE OR LOAN: DRIVERS' CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After driving his Chevrolet Suburban for 13 years, Ara Dedekian
has conceded that it's time for a new car.
</P>
<P>
   For him the question of buy or lease is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   He's the type of car owner who ``buys something and keeps it
forever,'' Dedekian says _ someone who likes owning his car and
wants to run it into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But for Nanci Leitch and Brian Remer, a married couple with a
4-year-old daughter, leasing is the answer to their changing car
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As your lifestyle changes, you have different car needs,''
Leitch says. ``It is easy with a lease to change from the sporty
car that you had when you were single to a sports utility vehicle
when you need one of those with a family. . . . Now I'm going
through my mid-life crisis and really want a Volkswagen Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many business reasons to consider leasing, but more
and more frequently, leasing has become a popular alternative to
buying for personal driving.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates warn those considering leasing to read the
fine print.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do your homework and see what the best rates
are,'' said Robert Ellis, director of operations for the Center for
the Study of Services _ a nonprofit affiliate of the Consumer
Federation of America in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leitch and Remer, many consumers are most interested in
driving a brand-new car that meets their immediate needs. They want
to get the most car for the money. And they would rather invest the
difference between lease payments and usually-higher monthly
purchase payments into more profitable arenas _ not cars with
rapidly depreciating values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some research ahead of time and found it is not really
a good idea to own something that is going to depreciate,'' Leitch
said. ``We're certainly putting the money into other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Leasing a car is the automotive equivalent of renting an
apartment rather than buying a condominium. It involves paying a
monthly rate for the use of a car, usually for two or three years.
These payments are usually significantly less than the monthly
payments on a loan taken out to buy the car. But at the end of the
lease the driver has not accumulated any ownership or equity in the
car _ so back to the dealer it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young professionals who don't have a lot of ready cash,
but have good credit, leasing means immediate satisfaction,'' said
Stephen Saunders, inventory manager at Cambridge Chevrolet Honda
Geo. Leases let consumers ``drive the high-line cars they could
never afford,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Automobile Dealers Association the
average cost of a new car in 1997, the most recent year tallied,
was $22,650.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said that consumers in Boston are ``conservative'' and
wary of leasing because ``people hear a lot of war stories and get
scared.'' Consumers may hear that they will be hit with high
penalties for damage to the car or that dealers will sneak
additional charges into the deal, Saunders said. But he insists
such statements are false.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Winquist, leasing manager at Sentry South Lincoln Mercury,
adds that leasing is especially advantageous for those who want a
luxury car. ``You are able to drive more vehicle for the same
(monthly) payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Winquist also pointed out that manufacturer warranties cover
almost all ordinary maintenance costs on leased cars other than
routine operating expenses such as oil changes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a person leasing a $23,000 Ford Explorer for three
years (and driving no more than 36,000 miles) would pay
approximately $355 a month with a $4,500 down payment, adding up to
$17,280.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the same car with the same down payment and a three-year
financing at 0.9 percent _ a rate currently being quoted by Ford
dealers and the Ford Motor Co. _ would mean monthly payments of
about $585 a month, or $25,560.
</P>
<P>
   That's $8,280 more than leasing for three years _ money that if
it were invested in a money market fund returning 4 percent
interest, would earn a little more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saunders says leasing may be a cheaper way of getting
into a nicer car, consumer advocates warn it is not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a consumer who typically buys a new car every two to
three years and doesn't drive the car a lot of miles, then you're a
candidate for leasing,'' says Ellis, the spokesman for the Center
for the Study of Services. ``But anybody who is going to put a lot
of miles on the car is really putting themselves in jeopardy by
leasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lease agreements include predetermined annual mileage limits,
typically 12,000 or 15,000 miles a year. But terms can be expanded
to up to 20,000 miles. Leasing companies charge drivers 10 to 20
cents for every mile driven beyond the limit, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantial miles over the average could cost leasers
thousands of dollars,'' Ellis warned. ``But there are ways to
mitigate that _ by paying for extra miles upfront or negotiating a
low rate _ but still paying a significant amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that buying an automobile is probably better for
those who don't want to deal with the hassle of shopping for a new
car every few years, who want to drive their cars for more than
three years, or who drive more than 15,000 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical closed-end lease, consumers return the car when the
contract expires and walk away. Leasers are responsible for excess
mileage charges and any damage to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Leases usually include an option to purchase the car, but this
is usually an unattractive proposition because when renegotiated
the new financing payments tend to be higher than the previous
lease payments, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lease customers must also be careful of monthly payment rates
that look too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission warns that lease deals are not
always as good as they first sound. Often there is an inception
payment that is due before you can drive away. This may include a
security deposit, an acquisition fee, first month's payment, taxes,
and title fees. It could also include a down payment on the lease
itself, which would reduce monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   These additional terms can be negotiated, Ellis said. For
instance, it is much easier to negotiate a lease with no down
payment than it is to buy the car without a down payment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lower down payment, or no down payment at all, often
attracts younger customers to lease rather than buy, said Robert
DeMarzo, a certified financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people find just (making) the minimum down payment is
attractive,'' DeMarzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Making an initial down payment or earning trade-in credit from a
previously owned car can reduce monthly lease payments _ just as
occurs when buying a car.
</P>
<P>
   Although low monthly payments may seem like a dream during the
term of the lease, some first-time leasers, like Sal Cardinal,
experience ``lease shock'' as the contract ends.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal traded in his old car two years ago and leased a car
because it was ``new and cheap.'' When the lease expired, Cardinal
tried to negotiate another lease. But because he had no trade-in,
the monthly payments on a second lease were higher than he could
handle. Now he's looking at used cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars are so expensive now that sometimes you can't get a nice
car unless you lease,'' Cardinal said. ``Leasing is good because it
gets you into a nicer car.'' But, he said, ``I am going to buy now,
because I want to have something at the end.''

   Respect. Admiration. Tribute. A king dies in the Middle East and
history is rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan II, it now turns out, ``opened his country to democracy''
(BBC TV). ``He did not put his head on the pillow at night without
being assured of Morocco's safety...he wanted a Morocco where
justice prevailed'' (Moroccan TV). ``The man who modernized this
north African nation and was praised by world leaders for building
bridges between Arab nations and the rest of the world''
(Associated Press). ``The Middle East has lost one of its greatest
peacemakers'' (U.S. President Bill Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   So goodbye to the king who imprisoned his opponents for two
decades without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the man who ``disappeared'' his most ruthless rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the king whose principal opponent, Ben Barka, was
mysteriously kidnapped in Paris by the Moroccan secret service _
and possibly the French secret service as well _ and never seen
again.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the king who seized the Spanish Sahara and doomed
hundreds of his soldiers to rot in prison camps for more than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye to the king who lost a border war with Algeria along
with thousands of kilometers of territory.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television contained everything in paragraph one,
nothing in paragraph two. And so history was airbrushed away Sunday
to leave Hassan II, Commander of the Faithful, in the grave with
the world remembering only his help in the cold peace between Egypt
and Israel, his assistance in the deeply flawed Oslo
Palestinian-Israeli accord, his late-in-the-day democratization and
release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Only a lone French television channel commented cruelly that
Morocco's largest source of income came from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs? The scourge of Western society so often condemned by
Clinton? Nine years ago, Gilles Perrault wrote a book that
redefined King Hassan's relationship with France. The French, he
said, had covered up Morocco's drug trafficking and human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Perrault's book was called ``Our Friend the King'' and was, of
course, immediately banned in Morocco. The book talked about Barka,
whose ``disappearance'' has never been explained.
</P>
<P>
   So we were left with the whitewash and the pictures. The
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, wept. The crowds fainted in the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez al-Assad of Syria stayed away. He did not want
to meet the new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, reporters
claimed. No one mentioned Assad's suspicions that King Hassan may
have supported, in 1983, a possible coup against him.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was not a bad man as Middle East leaders go. He did not
bend to threats. He protected his Jewish community and maintained
those secret links with Israel when the ``Zionist entity'' was an
unmentionable state after the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   He was rich (partly courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency,
so Arab diplomats have always believed). But he was also humble;
much eloquence, a true student of the Koran, far too many
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   No serious criticism of the monarchy was allowed in Morocco, of
course. And our television boys went along with that Sunday. &QL;

<P>
   Belly dancing has its place in dimly lit clubs, thick with
incense and the beat of drums. But it is certainly not what you
expect to find in an urban gym. In fact, though, you can. Both
Equinox and New York Health and Racquet Club in New York have
started belly dancing programs, tailoring the dance into a
legitimate workout.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Judy Taylor, the director of public relations for
Equinox Fitness Clubs, ``Any kind of ethnic dance is catching on
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange confluence, and one that ever-insatiable gym
goers are responding to enthusiastically. Curious, I signed up,
too.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Equinox. When I arrived, the lights in the workout
room were dimmed and there was pipe and drum music bouncing off the
hard wood floor and mirrored walls.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Levy-Koffer, a fit woman with large almond-shaped eyes
and a great deal of wavy brown hair, came toward me waving a bright
green piece of fabric. ``Tie this around your waist,'' she
instructed. I did as she said, making a sarong out of it over my
gym shorts.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 10 people in the class. All women. Most of them
were wearing tight shorts and half shirts. Their sarongs were all
flag colors _ red, blue, yellow, green _ too. Ms. Levy-Koffer wore
a printed one with a loose chain dangling across her waist.
</P>
<P>
   We began slowly, rolling our heads, moving our shoulders in
circles, and then our upper bodies, touching our ankles and
sweeping our torsos up to standing position and around to our toes
again.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levy-Koffer stopped for a minute to show us a few
fundamental belly dancing moves. She stood before us with her left
arm raised, her left leg bent slightly and her right leg forward,
also bent but with just her toes touching the ground. ``You must
tuck in your belly,'' she said. It felt like posture class taken to
the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   In this position, though, the right hip is naturally positioned
upward. From it, Ms. Levy-Koffer flung her hip upward further to
the right and down, in a motion as crisp and quick as the snap of
two fingers. ``You must use your legs,'' she said. We followed,
stiffly and slowly. She smiled, a look of pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``More quickly,'' she said, repeating the motion. We mimicked
her for a minute or two, sweeping our hips from side to side. Then,
she moved her waist in a figure eight, a motion so smooth that it
looked like ribbon undulating in the wind. Her arms flowed along.
Again, we followed along, stiffly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we are ready now? Don't get scared,'' she said. ``Feel the
motion in your soul. This is your body.''
</P>
<P>
   My soul, I'm afraid, did not know my body was supposed to ever
move this way. But I had company. The music sped up and Ms.
Levy-Koffer did, too. The chain around her waist jingled to the
music as her body shook and glided. I would have been just as happy
to stop what I was doing and just watch her.
</P>
<P>
   We did ``the bird,'' moving our hips as we waved our arms
fluidly like the wings of a bird. We did ``the snake,'' joining our
hands above our heads and moving our heads with our necks, from
left to right.
</P>
<P>
   Just as she had warned, you must use your legs as much as you
use your stomach muscles. It is the leg muscles that enable you to
make more crisp, powerful movements. When watching a belly dancer,
you often don't notice this because the legs are hidden by the
sarong.
</P>
<P>
   Belly dancing, said Stella Grey, a belly dancer who is an
instructor at New York Health and Racquet Club, is believed to have
originated in what is now northern India. It spread throughout
eastern Europe and into northern Africa 700 years ago, she said,
mixing with indigenous dance forms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levy-Koffer was born in Morocco and was raised in Israel,
both cultures that revere the art of belly dancing. She learned
many styles, and does not stick to any one during the one-hour
workout classes.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the class wasn't at all what I expected. It felt a
little gimmicky, a flashy way to keep fickle gym goers amused. A
second class was more satisfying. I realized I was learning to move
my body in ways I never knew it could. And it was refreshing to
work my stomach muscles without doing sit-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The workout is good for coordination, endurance, balance and
toning. I think of belly dancing as a counterpoint to a higher
energy workout like running.
</P>
<P>
   The second time around I went to a different Equinox gym. The
class was more experienced so Ms. Levy-Koffer taught less and
paused less. We did longer, faster repetitions, flinging the hips
not only left to right, but forward and back.
</P>
<P>
   She was tougher, too. ``Cut, cut!'' she shouted to the beat as
we moved left to right. ``It's not disco; I want you to feel your
belly a little,'' she said. We also learned to shimmy, which
requires you to shake your body, letting the muscles in your butt
and upper legs flap loosely. ``Think tush, tush, tush,'' she said.
The class reluctantly shimmied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levy-Koffer approached the only male, a thin man in black
cycling shorts, in the class. ``What's happening here?'' she asked,
watching him jiggle stiffly from side to side. ``I have no tush,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most belly dancers do, though, and they are not stick thin. They
have thick torsos, dense with muscle and flesh. Rounded bodies
shake better and certainly appear to roll and swing more fluidly.
More than that, in some belly dancing cultures, that body shape is
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belly dancing is not going to flatten your abs,'' said Ms.
Grey. ``The undulations that are so characteristic are not going to
get your stomach concave. They build your lower abs so you can push
out as much as you pull in.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, here I was, far from the culture of belly dancing,
surrounded by people striving to be fit and thin. It was a lovely
contradiction. One that may become more common.
</P>
<P>
   Belly dancing is a new phenomenon at health clubs. Most classes
are taught at dance studios. Expect more of an aerobic workout at
health clubs and more technique at dance studios.

FOX'S `ACTION' SPEAKS LOUDER WITH BLEEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ The networks are under fire for failing to
look like America, in all its multiethnic majesty, but television
certainly is increasingly avid about sounding like America.
</P>
<P>
   Especially to ears attuned to the delicate language of college
dormitories and hard-hat construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is out front in the gallop toward laxer standards for
language and sexual candor. It has hired Doug Herzog, who brought
``South Park'' to Comedy Central on cable, as its top programmer.
Herzog didn't come to Fox to acquire manners. He came to kick the
corners of what's allowable on broadcast TV.
</P>
<P>
   The fall series that is already the poster child for network
television's supposed descent into the gutter is ``Action,'' a
half-hour comedy scheduled for 9:30 p.m. Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   The show is an astringent satire of Hollywood moviemaking. It
stars Jay Mohr, a ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member during one of
that show's nether periods, as a movie producer propelled by a
stream of profanity and guided by a loose ethical compass.
</P>
<P>
   Mohr's co-star is Illeana Douglas. She plays a prostitute who
becomes the producer's most trusted adviser. The show's creator,
Christopher Thompson, figures she's ``perhaps the person on the
firmest moral ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot episode of ``Action'' is an exercise in scatology,
blasphemy, sexual suggestiveness, transparently bleeped f-words and
similarly bleeped f-word compounds. Its story line finally comes
down to the studio chief's penis size. Which is immense. Viewers
will very nearly see for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where it gets interesting. Originally developed for
HBO on the free-swinging pay cable end of the TV spectrum,
``Action'' is, at least in pilot form, the most scathingly funny
network show in years, and easily the most unabashedly adult series
in network history.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the pilot tape five or six times, and by now I can
recite whole patches of dialogue. Here at these semiannual meetings
between reporters and television suppliers, I've found other
critics who've also succumbed to repeated ``Action'' fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Herzog and Thompson had to play defense in separate
interview sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog stuck mainly to the line that while ``we don't expect
(``Action'') to become a bleep-out fest,'' Fox needs to break away
from a diet of bland TV shows and reassert itself as the edgiest
broadcast network. Fox is especially eager to establish a half-hour
comedy hit that isn't a cartoon, a feat that's somehow eluded the
fourth network all through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog described Fox's attitude toward ``Action'' this way:
``Well, it's funny, but it's definitely pushing the line a little
bit. It's definitely taking it to a new place. Are we ready to go
there? Is the audience ready to go there? Are the advertisers ready
to go there? And our feeling is yeah, we can get everybody there
and make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is a bit of a maverick who last flamed out with ``The
Naked Truth'' on ABC and NBC. He seems pleasantly surprised that
Fox hasn't sanitized ``Action,'' and he says show's cynicism and
bleeped profanities merely reflect the Hollywood he's experienced
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody who I've ever sat with in my office, or
just dealt with upstairs, who says `fricking,' or `kicked in the
heinie,' or `that guy is a real doodie-head,''' Thompson said.
``Those things aren't said in my world. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm not an advocate of the coarsening of the culture. I'm
not an advocate of any of the behavior that's displayed in this
show. I am an observer of it. I am a chronicler of it, and I
believe that it can be made to be entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Fox seems eager to accept entertaining in almost any
form.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. Fox did intervene with the scissors in a few scenes
involving the Mohr character and his preteen daughter. In one, she
was drinking champagne. Snip. In another, Mohr discussed penis size
with her. Snip. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson admits that he may have gone too far, attributing it to
``my own jaded life and way too precocious children.'' There are
three of them, he said, and they're Hollywood kids. His oldest
daughter, he said, has ``virtually grown up at Jack Nicholson's
house. I mean, you get jaded little kids in that. This was probably
an area where I was drawing from my life a little too vividly.''
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of Hollywood kids, Thompson added, ``A Hollywood 8
is 23 in Minnesota years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was quizzed, too, about the real-life model of the
show's powerful studio mogul with the oversized sex organ _ and
with a sexual appetite for young males.
</P>
<P>
   The character is called Bobby G, and Thompson is having his
cackles over that fact that four Hollywood biggies, so far, have
called to ask if they were the model for Bobby G.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where my bread is buttered,'' said Thompson. ``I told
all of them, `Well, there are parts of you in there.'''

SNAKES IN WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Can rattlesnakes swim? I need to know before I take
a dip in a lake bordering on Rattlesnake Hill.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Rattlesnakes are good swimmers, though they are not in a
class with species that spend all or most of their lives in water
or even with the familiar garter snake, according to
``Rattlesnakes,'' by Laurence M. Klauber.
</P>
<P>
   Klauber, who died in 1968, was an engineer who studied
rattlesnakes and collected lore about them as a hobby. He became a
recognized expert and was consulting curator of reptiles at the San
Diego Zoo for more than 30 years. He said it was clear from
published accounts and the reports of his own correspondents that
rattlesnakes would swim readily enough when their travels in search
of food, mates or refuge required them to cross water.
</P>
<P>
   Rattlesnakes are buoyant and float well, Klauber pointed out,
and they propel themselves fairly fast in water with a sinuous
motion. They may hold their rattles above water when resting or
floating, he said, but they use their tales for propulsion, with
their rattles below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Rattlesnakes can bite when in or under water, he said, but
cannot strike efficiently because they lack a solid base.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person must be careless indeed,'' he wrote, ``who would get
near enough to a swimming rattler to be within its striking range
and then proceed to annoy it into biting.''

 &HT;    AS WYE PEACE PLAN IS DEBATED, LITTLE CHANGE IS NOTICED BY THE
FIRST SETTLERS AFFECTED BY IT
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   KADIM, West Bank While Israeli and Palestinian leaders meet
Tuesday night to discuss the long-stalled Wye River peace plan, the
Jewish settlers where the plan started say the problems they feared
have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is different. Nothing has changed,'' said Frida
Naftali, a 50-year-old grandmother who has lived in the Kadim
settlement for 16 years. ``We were scared, that's true. You're
always afraid of the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   New Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is scheduled to meet
Tuesday night with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
and will likely ask him to restructure some of the peace plan,
which was brokered last fall at the Wye River Plantation in eastern
Maryland. Barak reportedly is worried the plan will expose Jews and
Arabs in the West Bank to more points of contact and friction,
which could disrupt the process before it can be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye plan is just one step in a peace process that is to
eventually resolve the conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In Kadim, they are used to contact with the Arabs and have only
infrequent problems.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 families live in Kadim, a hilltop development of about
a dozen cul-de-sacs lined by small cottage duplexes. Land nearby
was turned over to Palestinian control in November under Wye. While
the settlers say they are nervous, they still let their children
ride the roads at night to go to nearby Jewish towns and still shop
in neighboring Arab cities.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some settlers, few here are ideologues seeking to help
Israel stake a claim to the largely-Arab lands captured in the l967
war between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   They came for affordable housing or the quiet of country life.
They have generally good relations with Palestinians in Jenin, a
city that begins just a few hundred yards from the barbed-wire
fence and patrol road encircling Kadim.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
signed the Wye River Memorandum at a White House ceremony, agreeing
to a three-stage transfer of West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The first transfer took place near Kadim in November. It gave
Palestinians total control of land on one side of a road entering
the settlement. Then, Netanyahu froze the process and it has stayed
frozen through the May elections, in which Barak defeated
Netanyahu. Barak took office earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Wye transfer, a settler from Kadim was injured
in a shooting near Jenin, an example of the kind of flare-ups Barak
may fear with more land transfers. Settlers believe the shooting
was not committed by local Palestinians, but may have been
instigated by an organized group.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that the peace process will leave them surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled land and that Palestinian leaders could
provoke other incidents against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everything is OK. The people want to live in peace, but I
think the politicians have another idea,'' said David Monsonegro, a
leader at the Kadim settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's meeting Tuesday night is the next in a series of talks
aimed at restarting the peace process. He met with President
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair last week. He is
scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for a
second time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak and Arafat meet Tuesday evening, according to reports
in the Israeli press, the prime minister may ask that subsequent
land transfers remain on hold while other parts of the agreement
are allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the land transfers, which are scheduled to total
13 percent of the West Bank by the time the Wye plan is complete,
the Israelis are supposed to release Palestinian political
prisoners and allow Palestinians a ``safe passage'' route through
Israel between Palestinian areas in the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank.

WHEN THE BRAIN'S MAILBOX IS FULL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ga., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memory lapses in older people may signal that a mailbox of
memory is full rather than that the brain fails to process
information, a new study on memory suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get older, we run out of places to store new
information,'' said Dr. H. Lee Swanson, a psychologist at the
University of California at Riverside and the author of the study.
``We have a limited amount of space in our memory system.''
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory studies of 778 people from ages 6 to 76, Swanson
found that working memory, also called short-term memory, peaked at
age 45. ``There is nothing magical about 45,'' he said. ``Then,
between 45 and 55, you see some kind of drop compared to someone 25
to 35, even if ever so slight.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson's findings came as part of a larger study conducted from
1987 to 1994 to establish a standardized test for learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   For the study, he explored how rapidly and efficiently
associations were made between new information and old, using the
working memory, which temporarily processes and records everyday
information like phone numbers. Some psychologists compare the
process to a computer's random-access memory, a temporary storage
device.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson tested his subjects, divided almost equally by sex, on
their ability to recall numbers, organize words into abstract
categories and remember directions long enough to trace them on an
unmarked maps. Children and older adults did worse than younger
adults. To assess how various factors contributed to age-related
working memory performance, he retested, using cues to improve the
memory.
</P>
<P>
   All subjects improved with such aids, but older adults had to
rely more on the cues, which helped them recall new information
that had not been stored in long-term memory, comparable to a
computer's hard drive. The ability to process new information
suggested to Swanson that it was not the memory that gave out with
age but storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The study was reported this month in Developmental Psychology, a
journal of the American Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson emphasized that not everyone experienced a memory slide
after the mid-40s. Not all ``mailboxes'' are the same size and
people organize them differently, he said. ``We have different
abilities in what we can store and some of us are more efficient in
what we can store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Salthouse, a cognitive psychologist at the Georgia
Institute of Technology and co-author of the book ``Adult
Development and Aging,'' said that research into age-related memory
was controversial. ``It seems unlikely that any single study,
regardless of its quality, will be able to resolve the issue,'' he
said. ``We don't know how to measure storage capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   The sampling at the upper end of Swanson's study was too small
to explore what happens to storage and retrieval capacities beyond
the 50s. The average age of his oldest group was 57 with only a
handful of participants over 65, but Dr. Robert N. Butler, a
gerontologist and president of the International Longevity Center
in New York City, found the study reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If so-called memory loss is really a storage problem,'' Butler
said, ``ways might be found to disgorge information no longer
necessary, to make room for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert L. Kahn, co-author of the book ``Successful Aging,''
based on the results of a study of aging by the MacArthur
Foundation, agreed that short-term memory was reduced with age, but
he rejected ``the mechanistic notion that treats the brain as a
bunch of shelves and pigeonholes which run out of space.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired psychology professor, Kahn said he preferred the
concept of ``the lifelong elasticity of the human brain'' with
training and mnemonic devices used to sharpen memory skills.

INVESTIGATORS THINK THEY'VE SOLVED MYSTERY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On the morning of Dec. 24, 1996, a chartered
Learjet 35A took off from Bridgeport, Conn. Destination: Lebanon,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was covered in thick clouds, and the pilots missed
their approach. Confused, they circled around for a second attempt.
The plane dipped below radar _ and was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thousands of volunteers have explored more than
1,000 square miles of mostly forested, mountainous territory in New
Hampshire and Vermont, spending more than $750,000 to find some
trace of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   But all that the largest search in New Hampshire's history found
was a mystery: How could an 8-ton, 40-foot-long aircraft just
disappear?
</P>
<P>
   Now a Schenectady private investigator and her team of
search-and-rescue experts think they know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on the side of 3,453-foot Carr Mountain in New
Hampshire, they theorize, the jet slammed into the ground. Flying
at 285 mph, or almost five miles a minute, the Learjet didn't just
break apart on impact. The dart-like craft disintegrated instantly
and collapsed into a tiny impact zone only a few feet wide. The
pieces are so small they have proved impossible to find.
</P>
<P>
   Schenectady private eye Marilyn Greene and the other six members
of the Adirondack Rescue Dog Association hope to change that
failing record on a 10-day search that began last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After millions of people followed the search and recovery of the
plane piloted by John F. Kennedy Jr., Greene's team will be combing
the New Hampshire woods in obscurity by comparison. The job won't
be easy. The woods on top of Carr Mountain could not be thicker: a
double canopy of pine trees so dense that standing on the ground,
you can barely see the sky.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the team _ two jet pilots, a library researcher, an
insurance agent, a house painter _ is being paid to be there. In
fact, some are using vacation time to go. They don't even know the
pilots or their families.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a mystery, and that is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Learjet N388LS took off at 9:20 a.m. that December day. The
flight was supposed to be routine: pick up a wealthy family in
Lebanon, fly to Southampton, Long Island, and return to Connecticut
in time for Christmas Eve. Both pilots were experienced. Capt.
Patrick Hayes, 30, of Clinton, Conn., had 4,250 hours of flying
experience, including 832 in jet planes. Copilot Johan Schwartz,
31, of Fairfield, Conn., had 2,066 hours flying, including 267 in
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, worth about $3.5 million, was reported to be in good
mechanical condition. The only thing missing was an emergency
locater device worth about $1,000. The homing beacon, used to
locate downed planes, is required on international charter jet
flights. It was removed because the Federal Aviation Authority does
not require the beacon on domestic charter flights.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:44 a.m. the plane was a few miles away from Lebanon, pushed
north and east by a 60- to 80-knot tailwind. The airport was
obscured by a thick cloud cover that began at 1,200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Flying by instruments, the pilots dropped to 7,000 feet. Then
they missed a directional beacon that would have showed them where
the runway was.
</P>
<P>
   N388LS looped around and asked for a different landing approach.
The tower directed them to the northeast. They were to make another
180-degree turn and head south toward the runway. Flying at 4,200
feet, they headed away from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Recordings of the flight conversation show no sign of fear _
only confusion. Hayes, in charge of communication as his partner
flew, told the tower at 10:01 a.m.: ``Lear Eight Eight Lima Sierra
is VOR outbound.'' It meant the plane had passed over the beacon
they were looking for and knew where they were.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the last words he spoke over the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, the plane disappeared from radar and was
never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter went up a short time after the crash to search for
the plane, but bad weather brought it back down. It was bitterly
cold, windy and overcast, and not much had been done to find the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, several helicopters and planes from the Civil Air
Patrol began to work the area. Later, the state Fish and Game
Department organized a large-scale ground search. The Air Force,
Coast Guard and National Guard also sent in aircraft. More than 300
flights were flown.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the missing pilots organized a ground search with
hundreds of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Rescue Dog Association.
</P>
<P>
   The search team is a ``Mission: Impossible'' list of experts:
two jet pilots who spent the past year recreating the Learjet's
flight before it crashed; a researcher at the New York State
Library; an expert in the use of maps and compasses; and an
emergency medical technician.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Greene, a woman the Wall Street Journal once called
``the country's foremost finder of lost souls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm trying to do is help people find the missing people in
their families,'' said the 50-year-old investigator. ``I enjoy the
mystery ... and when I solve it, I can look back and see it as an
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene's interest in finding missing people goes back three
decades. In 1970, she helped form the Adirondack Rescue Dog
Association, whose ``air-scent'' search dogs use techniques dating
back to the Swiss Saint Bernard rescue dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's success in finding lost people eventually led her to
become a full-time private investigator. She has solved more than
250 missing-person cases. Throughout her career, Greene continued
to work with the Adirondack Rescue Dog Association. Today SHE runs
teams in New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Team members Roseanne Perini and her husband, Rudy, heard about
the plane crash first.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne Perini, a Nassau resident who flies a Gulf Stream jet
for a wealthy New York City businessman, approached Greene more
than a year ago. The mystery intrigued the team. So Perini, her
husband and a colleague started to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   After looking over radar information, talking to airport
personnel and poring over topographic maps, Perini came up with a
theory. She suspected the pilots thought they were closer to the
airport when they made their final turn. If they thought they were
within 10 miles, they might have started descending. And if they
were actually farther away from the airport, Carr Mountain would be
right in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Accidently flying outside the Lebanon Airport zone is common,
Perini found out _ eight of 10 pilots leave the 10-mile limit due
to high winds, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then the team found someone who said he heard a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Stickney, now 74, lives only a few miles from Carr
Mountain. He says he was outside Christmas Eve morning when he
heard a jet plane fly overhead. He turned up to the overcast sky,
thinking he would see it go by. Instead, he heard the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, crash investigators didn't talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His information just added fuel to our theory,'' Perini said.
Finding the wreck would do more than just solve the mystery. It
would ease the pain of the families of the two pilots. Jay Hayes,
the Learjet captain's older brother, said his mother still cries
often over her missing son. And his father has let his health slide
since the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want Patrick forgotten,'' Jay Hayes said. ``I
don't think I can go on with my life until Patrick is found.''

RAIDERS QB STILL HAS SOME LESSONS TO LEARN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ Depending on whom you talk to, Rich Gannon must
bond with his teammates the next five weeks for the Raiders to be
successful, or his social skills will have no impact on the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden believes his new starting
quarterback would be wise to buddy up with the other guys wearing
Silver and Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to learn his teammates,'' said Gruden, whose team
began practice for the 1999-2000 season on Saturday. ``We want him
to get a feel for our players. That will only come with a good
solid training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work of getting acquainted will be done on the
field. But not all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get accustomed to throwing to Rickey Dudley and
Tim Brown,'' the coach said. ``Get a feel for James Jett and some
of our other key players. But the better his relationships become
in the locker room and at the dinner table with some of these guys,
the more natural his leadership will become and the more it will
help our team.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Brown's 12th professional season. He's had more
quarterbacks throwing him the ball than he'd probably care to
remember, and he doesn't think it makes the slightest difference if
he and Gannon wind up spending evenings having some brews together
or going their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for him (Gannon) to play good football,'' Brown said.
``I don't care about this leadership stuff. Just throw the ball
where you're supposed to throw it. All the other stuff, as far as
I'm concerned, is hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon disagrees. If he is to become a presence in the huddle,
someone his new teammates respond to and respect, he believes it's
crucial that he develop a personal relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we did in Kansas City,'' he said. ``We made a big
emphasis on the offseason program because that's the time you build
trust in each other and develop relationships. That's where you
start to develop your football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, who signed as a free agent this winter, replaces Jeff
George as the Raiders starting quarterback. Despite having one of
the strongest arms in the game, George was an expensive bust.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said he made poor decisions once the ball was snapped,
couldn't get out of the way of the pass rush and was equally slow
to recover from injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon is supposed to be smart, mobile and tough. And even
though the book on the quarterback is that he has trouble throwing
the ball deep, he says: ``I've never had a problem reaching
receivers. I don't anticipate having that problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders were so convinced he's the right guy for the job,
they were willing to give him a contract worth $16 million over the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gutsy decision. The Raiders will be Gannon's fifth team
in 12 years in the NFL, and during that time he has been the
undisputed starter only once, in 1992 when he was with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon was drafted out of Delaware by New England in the fourth
round of the 1987 draft, then was almost immediately traded to the
Minnesota Vikings. He started intermittently there before being
dealt to Washington in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out the 1994 season with a shoulder injury, he
signed with Kansas City and appeared in only two games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he played in 12 games, three as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   As for criticism that he lacks experience as a started, Gannon
said: ``If you look at the last two years, I've pretty much been
the starter in Kansas City. I started the majority of those games.
So I don't really look at it as a new experience. I'm comfortable
in that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Chiefs weren't impressed enough to offer him the
starting job for the '99 season. So he signed with the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity for me to go somewhere else,'' Gannon
said. ``I was excited by what Jon (Gruden) is trying to accomplish
here and want to be a part of it.''

   In the past decade, John and Anne Marion's keenly focused
vision, abetted by $55 million, has had a breathtaking impact on
the cultural landscape of Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   For years a sleepy town whose art scene was cloaked in nostalgia
and touristic cheese, Santa Fe now boasts the only truly
independent, international biennial art expo in the United States;
a museum devoted to the art of Santa Fe legend Georgia O'Keeffe; an
art institute offering opportunities to work one-on-one with some
of the nation's top artists; and a photography center headed by an
internationally renowned authority on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But now that SITE Santa Fe, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, the
Santa Fe Art Institute and the Marion Center for Photographic Arts
are up and running, the Marions, Fort Worth-based philanthropists,
will be turning their efforts homeward.
</P>
<P>
   This fall marks the groundbreaking for the new Modern Art Museum
of Fort Worth, and they are inextricably tied in to that project:
As they did in Santa Fe, the Marions channeled funds _ in this
case, $10 million to purchase a site _ to the Modern project
through the Burnett Foundation, established by Anne Marion's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Considering, though, that their involvement in Santa Fe began in
1990 with a $62,000 grant to the St. Elizabeth Shelter and then
quietly edged in the direction of arts funding with $25,000 for the
Santa Fe Art Institute, it seems likely the $10 million to the
Modern will be followed by further gifts to that project.
</P>
<P>
   And just as important, their work in Santa Fe has proved the
Marions have an abundance of ideas, energy, time and devotion to
give.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis Walker, who reports on cultural affairs for the ``Santa
Fe New Mexican,'' the local newspaper, calls the Marion's
contribution to the city ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anne Marion describes it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe has been part of her life since she was a baby, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were things that I've had in mind for some time, that
all came together at the same time,'' she adds _ not so much
modestly as matter-of-factly. ``It's been kind of hard financing
these projects, but we're getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for John Marion, he holds up his hands and, with
self-deprecating wit, says, ``Don't look at me. She's the patron.
I'm just the caddy.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made their generosity possible is careful nurturing of
the Burnett Foundation's endowment. It has grown from $35 million
at the time it was established in 1978 _ after Anne persuaded her
mother to devote her Tandy inheritance to philanthropy _ to its
current $260 million.
</P>
<P>
   About $44 million in cash, artworks and donations of property
have gone to the O'Keeffe Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Anne's devotion to the O'Keeffe Museum is intensely personal.
Her mother was a friend of the cranky artist, and her own
collection of O'Keeffe works is distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   The Marions' College of Santa Fe gifts included $5 million for
construction of a facility shared by the college's Visual Arts
Center and the independently run, campus-based Santa Fe Art
Institute; and $1.1 million to endow a director's chair for the
Marion Center for Photographic Arts at the Visual Arts Center. They
additionally provided more than $1.5 million to the Art Institute
for operations and have pledged $1 million in matching funds for
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The Marions also were instrumental in the choice of Ricardo
Legoretta to design the new art complex and in recruiting James
Enyeart to serve as the photography center's director.
</P>
<P>
   SITE Santa Fe _ which presents an international art exhibition
every two years, as well as an ongoing program of art exhibitions,
lectures and other offerings _ has received $2.5 million, but also
has benefited from John Marion's service as trustee and board
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and Anne are ideal patrons in that they not only give the
grants, but also take time to give of themselves,'' says John
Whitney Payson, art patron and great-nephew of Whitney Museum
founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   As a trustee of the Skowhegan School of Art in New York and
Maine, Payson recommended the Marions receive the school's 1998
Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Award for art patronage. Other
recipients include Dominique de Menil, Paul Mellon, Ruth Carter
Stevenson and William Paley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often patrons just give money to high profile projects to
boost their own image,'' Payson says. ``As a couple, John and Anne
draw attention to themselves without meaning to. But they've also
taken the lead in showing it's worthwhile to become personally
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what becomes important _ the inner reward.''
</P>
<P>
   If the O'Keeffe museum is the Marions' most popular achievement
in Santa Fe, what is reshaping the city's cultural community are
the projects that nurture local artists and educate area residents
about international, cutting-edge art, says Walker of the ``New
Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she adds, SITE Santa Fe is attracting serious
international attention to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York and Los Angeles might not yet recognize what has been
accomplished here, but Berlin does. What SITE is doing is a lot
more like what you see overseas,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Keeffe museum already receives more traffic than it can
handle _ there were 350,000 visitors in its first year
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been farsighted, the museum would have been twice as
big,'' Anne Marion says. Still, it is probably 5 to 10 years away
from an expansion, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, O'Keeffe companion Juan Hamilton has given the
museum all of the late artist's personal effects. The Marions
bought O'Keeffe's Ghost Ranch house from Hamilton for $3 million:
They first, however, had to pay $350,000 to the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.), which owns the surrounding property and claimed right of
first refusal on Ghost Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Such wheeling and dealing initially had insular Santa Fe
residents reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are so suspicious about anyone who seems to come
from the outside to change things,'' says Kathy Webster, a Fort
Worth artist who owns a house in Santa Fe and has summered there
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   When the Marions started investing in projects, even the ``New
Mexican'' responded with suspicion, publishing a
less-than-complimentary editorial, Webster says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Fe calls itself a big art town,'' she says. ``But SITE
Santa Fe is of a caliber most people here still don't understand.
There was so much flak over it, I can't believe the Marions didn't
just pack up their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Webster says, not long afterward the ``New Mexican''
named John Marion one of the city's 10 most important citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sustained health and impact of these dazzling
developments remains to be seen, reporter Walker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marions have said they don't intend to be funders in
perpetuity of any of these organization,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Marions are not entirely alone in their efforts.
Fellow patrons include the Phillipses; collector and dealer Eugene
Thaw and his wife, Clare; collector and philanthropist Emily Fisher
Landau; Patrick Lannon, whose eponymous foundation supports
cutting-edge projects in literature and visual art; and Marc
Glimcher, son of New York gallerist Arnold Glimcher and one of the
community's younger, emerging patrons. What is needed is an even
broader base of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the challenge is for others to step up to the plate and
make contributions,'' Walker says. ``There's so much yet to be done
in fund raising for these organizations to continue on the high
level the Marions envision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They care about what they've done.''

   CHINA-SECT (Shanghai) _ As part of an expanding political
campaign that could affect China's economic reforms, Chinese
authorities have detained about 1,200 government officials who are
members of Falun Gong, the spiritual movement that was officially
outlawed last week, a human rights group reported Monday. By Seth

   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ A few years ago, a photo of
Ahmed Qurei, a senior Palestinian official, was splashed on the
cover of every Israeli newspaper. It showed him stepping on an
Israeli flag during a demonstration in Ramallah, and the image
implanted itself in many Israelis' heads. Monday, as if it were a
commonplace and not ground-breaking event, Qurei, who is known as
Abu Ala, ambled into the flat-roofed Israeli parliament, a guest of

   FLA-MARIJUANA (Miami) _ The Drug Enforcement Agency has not been
able to stop it. Countless sheriff's deputies with machetes and
dynamite have been unable to curb its spread. Law enforcement
officials have tried everything, from high-flying spy planes to
bloodhounds, to stop the proliferation of marijuana in rural
Florida. Now, Florida's new drug czar, Jim McDonough, is hoping

standing on the barely visible tip of what scientists say is a

MIJENIX'S ZIPMAGIC98 MAKES WORKING WITH COMPRESSED FILES RELATIVELY
EASY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have managed to get through most of my computing life
without dealing with ZIP files. But someone has now sent me
something I must have, and it's in ZIP format. What is the best way
to deal with these files?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this case, ZIP does not refer to Zip drives, the 100- or
250-megabyte floppy drives from Iomega. These refer to files that
are compressed groups of other files.
</P>
<P>
   ZIP comes from PKZip, an ancient MS-DOS compression shareware
program by PKWare. The compression scheme it used was superior to
other types, and the fact that it was freely distributed via
computer bulletin boards didn't hurt its popularity, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the Windows era, the reigning champ for handling ZIP files is
WinZip. A very friendly program that's easy to install and use,
it's available as shareware at www.winzip.com.
</P>
<P>
   While WinZip is easy to use _ you just click on a ZIP file and
it launches WinZip with the enclosed files ready to extract _ it's
not the easiest. Mijenix makes an excellent program called
ZipMagic98 that makes ZIP files look just like folders on a hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   When you download a ZIP file, it appears as a Windows folder
with a .ZIP extension. When you open the file, it's just like
opening a folder. In fact, if the ZIP file contains an executable
program, you can even run it right from inside this folder.
</P>
<P>
   There are other packages that do the same thing. Microsoft's
Windows 98 Plus pack included a ZIP folders feature, for example.
But ZipMagic is the best implementation of this idea. You can
download a trial version at www.mijenix.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you please tell me exactly how close to the computer or
monitor can a CD or floppy be before it ruins it? I have an open
rack of about 30 or so CDs in their cases about 12 inches from the
computer and about 8 inches below the monitor. There is nothing
between them. Is that going to ruin them?
</P>
<P>
   A: In general, I have good news for you. Neither the CDs nor the
floppies will be ruined, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   CDs store data optically, and floppies store data magnetically.
The floppies can be affected by some devices that have a strong
magnetic field; the CDs cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Floppies store data on a disk that contains material similar to
a cassette tape. A magnet in the floppy drive changes the magnetic
state of this material. Any exposure to a powerful enough magnet
can damage or even completely erase the data on floppy.
</P>
<P>
   Data is stored on a CD via a laser that burns tiny dots into a
metal plate encased in the plastic disk. Because these dots are
physical, the data is not affected by magnetic interference.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the monitor has not damaged the data on your floppies by
now, it probably won't. Most quality monitors, speakers and other
equipment used with computers are well shielded enough that they
don't represent a threat. Still, unless you know for sure how safe
a component is, it's best to keep floppies at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of office equipment you definitely want to keep away
from floppies is a telephone. A ringing phone can zap data
instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading somewhere that a monitor should be .28 dot
pitch. Most, apparently, are. I am now considering buying a Dell
with 17-inch monitor, however, and notice that Dell's monitors are
all .26. What's your take on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is one case where smaller is better.
</P>
<P>
   The dot pitch on a monitor refers to the distance between the
dots that make up the screen image. The closer the dots, the
smaller the dot pitch and the better the image. Closer dots also
means more dots, for a sharper image.

 &HT;    The weirder, the better in new shows this fall
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weirdos stand out in new fall shows
</P>
<P>
   Whew! It's time to put in for hazardous-duty pay. . . . I've
finally finished watching all but a handful of the new fall series,
and boy is my brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a sea of sameness coming your way. Lots of dramas
about teens and twentysomethings, lots of white people, lots of
relationship angst. And a good deal of vomiting, for reasons that
are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A few interesting weirdos did rise to the surface. Not
necessarily because they were high art or Emmy caliber, but simply
because they were different. At least you won't fall asleep
watching these folks, and a few are even enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to the WB's ``Roswell'' (a high-school drama
about earthling and alien teens who mix and match), which I have
not seen because the tape arrived mangled beyond recognition, here
are my favorite weirdos of the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn is the spoiled-rotten, filthy-rich snob on Fox's teen
sudser ``Manchester Prep.'' She wears headbands and pearls with her
school uniform, but beneath the preppy exterior beats the heart of
Alexis Carrington from ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Played by Amy Adams, Kathryn strips down to her Victoria's
Secret skivvies and tries to seduce her brand-new stepbrother,
Sebastian. She also tries to get all the people she and her cohorts
deem unworthy kicked out of their exclusive Manhattan high school.
She is especially eager to get rid of a sweet, middle-class girl
named Annette, whom Sebastian has his eye on. It's unclear why
Kathryn is so desperate to seduce her stepbrother; does she really
like him or does she want to get him kicked out of the school and
the palatial home she'd rather not share?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dragon definitely stands out in the crowd. He's the
thoroughly foul-mouthed, egomaniacal film producer on Fox's
satirical sitcom ``Action.'' Set in the cut-throat movie business,
the show zeroes in on Peter, played to bleeping perfection by Jay
Mohr. Peter is an equal opportunity insulter, hurling four-letter
diatribes at everyone from the commissary worker, whose
employee-of-the-month parking space he steals, to whimpering agents
and studio executives. In the blink of an eye, however, he can
become a master sucker-upper, dripping kindness all over guest
stars such as Keanu Reeves. The scary thing is this character may
be the most realistic guy on television this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Kaczmarek plays a truly wacky Mom on Fox's new sitcom
``Malcolm in the Middle,'' about a 9-year-old boy who's recently
been diagnosed a genius. Over-worked and under-organized, Mom
presides, as best she can, over her chaotic household. Her three
sons are usually fighting, and her husband is rarely home _ which
may account for why Mom is so distracted that she sometimes forgets
to put on clothes. One Saturday morning, while juggling kids and a
pile of laundry, she answers the door totally topless when
Malcolm's stunned teacher comes calling.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's swell sitcom ``Stark Raving Mad'' boasts a trio of
memorable weirdos: Ian Stark, the macabre mystery writer with a
penchant for practical jokes; his wildly amorous dog, Edgar; and
Henry McNeely, Ian's obsessive book editor who wallows in
antiseptic hand cream.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are all mad as hatters. Ian pulls terrifying jokes on
Henry, ostensibly as research for his books so that he can witness
the screaming reactions. In the pilot, Henry first encounters Ian
hanging by his neck in a corner of his loft. Another time, Henry
finds Ian's head perched on the sofa _ the rest of the author's
body is tucked inside.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his rampant germ phobia, Henry is terrified of heights,
which makes living and working in New York skyscrapers a challenge.
Whenever terror strikes (approximately every five minutes), Henry
whips out his trusty inhaler. This guy makes Felix Unger look like
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   No way to explain Edgar, whose sudden appearance in the pilot
may force NBC to slap a TV-M on the show. Let's just say Edgar has
a fetish for human legs, and the scene lasts a very long time.
Training, natural instinct or doggie Viagra? It's a mysterious, uh,
performance with which dog owners everywhere will readily identify.

UNEARTHING A COLD SNAP  
 MORE FINDINGS ON FULLERENES  
 TELESCOPE RESCUE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cold snaps go, the one that occurred about 8,200 years ago
was a whopper. Average temperatures in Western Europe fell by about
6 degrees Fahrenheit, while Greenland suffered a 15-degree drop.
And this wasn't just a brief climatic event: it persisted for two
to four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team of scientists has offered a theory as to why this
cold spell, the most severe in the last 10,000 years, occurred.
They say that flooding caused by the melting of ice dams in two
huge glacial lakes in the Hudson Bay region disrupted ocean
currents that contribute to atmospheric warming in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This was no garden-variety flood. The scientists, writing in the
journal Nature, estimate that more than 100 trillion cubic meters
of cold, fresh water _ more than the current volume of the five
Great Lakes _ was released into the Labrador Sea when the ice dams,
remnants of the Laurentide Ice Sheet that covered much of
northeastern North America during the last Ice Age, melted.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence for the flooding includes sediments that once underlaid
the glacial lakes that were found 800 miles away, carried by the
water (which probably flowed for a year as the lakes drained).
</P>
<P>
   Under normal ocean conditions, warm water from the tropics is
carried north into more temperate regions and then loses much of
its heat to the atmosphere. The resulting warm air is blown toward
Europe by the prevailing winds. But the vast intrusion of fresh
water would have effectively shut down this conveyor-belt system
and cut off Europe's supply of warm air, resulting in the big
chill.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The soccer-ball-like nature of fullerenes, carbon molecules made
up of 60 or more atoms, has intrigued scientists since the
molecules were discovered in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, their cagelike structure can trap gas
molecules within. Some scientists speculate that fullerenes in
celestial objects like meteors or asteroids could have brought not
only carbon but gases to Earth to play a role in the origin of
life.
</P>
<P>
   While fullerenes consisting of 60 and 70 atoms have previously
been found in meteorites, a team of researchers has now found
evidence of even larger molecules, with up to 400 carbon atoms, in
samples of the Allende meteorite. This is the first finding of
so-called higher fullerenes in a sample from nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Allende meteorite is very old, formed from dust in the solar
nebula, the great disk of matter that eventually coalesced into the
sun and planets. It started as a tiny dustball 4.6 billion years
ago, slowly accreting and being transformed over the eons into the
rock that crashed in Mexico in 1969, leaving behind at least two
tons of fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Since fullerenes were first discovered by scientists trying to
duplicate the conditions under which the stars formed, it is
perhaps no surprise that they have been found in such presolar
rock.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers, who describe their findings in Nature, note
that the presence in the meteorite also indicates that fullerenes
can survive the long accretion process (and the long passage
through space that accompanies it) as well as an explosive arrival
on Earth, adding fuel to those who argue that they may have played
a role in this planet's history.

<P>
   Readers who may have wondered what is to become of the 21-foot
telescope mirror on an Arizona mountaintop that was unevenly
aluminized earlier this month can rest assured that all is not
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian
Institution, which operate the Multiple Mirror Telescope
Observatory, say the lumpy surface will be removed and engineers
will try again in several months to vaporize a thin, even film of
aluminum on the glass.

LIZARDS WITH BIG APPETITE FIND FIREFLIES A FATAL ATTRACTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   To call the bearded dragon lizard a voracious eater would be an
understatement. It happily consumes most any insect, no matter what
the defense mechanism of the prey. It will gobble a cockroach that
sprays irritating chemicals, or a moth laden with foul-tasting
alkaloids.
</P>
<P>
   It has even been known to lunch on a bombardier beetle after
being sprayed in the face with a hot, nasty liquid that is enough
to deter lesser lizards. Like a glutton suffering only a temporary
distraction, the bearded dragon simply wipes the stuff off its chin
and chomps away.
</P>
<P>
   But the lizard, an increasingly popular pet among reptile lovers
in the United States, can go an insect too far, scientists at
Cornell University said. And the meal that can do it in is the
common firefly.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper to be published in The Journal of Chemical Ecology,
the Cornell scientists and others relate firsthand accounts from
lizard owners who, running short on the customary fare, crickets,
fed fireflies to their pets. Within minutes after eating even one
of the flashing insects, a bearded dragon starts shaking its head
violently, gapes with open mouth as if trying to vomit and develops
severe breathing trouble. Shortly after, it keels over, dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fireflies have long been known to be toxic, said Dr. Thomas
Eisner, a professor of chemical ecology at Cornell and an author of
the paper. Twenty years ago, after spending a summer feeding over
100 different insect species to a thrush and having fireflies be
one of the few that the bird rejected, Eisner determined that
fireflies contain a type of steroid, which he called lucibufagin.
It is similar to plant steroids like digitalis, which is famous as
a stimulant for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Fireflies use the chemical as a defense against predation,
Eisner said, and have one of the highest concentrations of steroids
found in nature. The lizards, he said, ``are overdosing on a heart
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   While birds and other predators, including other types of
lizards, know to stay away from fireflies, bearded dragons, which
are native to Australia, do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they come from an area of the world where they don't
have to deal with a lot of defensive insects,'' Eisner said. ``It's
amazing how fearless they are of prey.''
</P>
<P>
   North American lizards have probably evolved a genetic
predisposition to avoid fireflies, said Dr. Kraig Adler, a Cornell
biology professor and another of the paper's authors. ``Those
foolish enough to eat them are no longer with us,'' Adler said.
Bearded dragons, being new to this country, are unfortunate
innocents.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of bearded dragons has risen in recent years as
the popularity of keeping lizards as pets has increased. By some
estimates, 20 million American households now keep at least one
reptile or amphibian.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mailloux, who breeds bearded dragons in Bonsall, Calif.,
estimated that about 50,000 of the reptiles are hatched every year
in the United States. He breeds 3,000 to 4,000 a year, selling them
for $200 to $300 each. They can live for six years or longer (if
they stay away from fireflies).
</P>
<P>
   Lizards, Adler said, ``are the convenient pets of the '90s.''
Unlike birds or small mammals, lizards have very slow metabolisms,
and thus don't eat much. ``As long as a lizard has some water, a
busy person can go away for the weekend and not worry about it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iguanas are the most popular as pets, but they have one major
flaw: they can grow to be six feet long. ``Ultimately, that's not
so convenient,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded dragon (which gets its name from the folds of skin
on its neck that expand to resemble a full beard when the animal is
threatened) only grow to about 20 inches as adults. They can also
be flamboyantly beautiful; the ones Mailloux sells often have
red-orange skin on the head. And unlike most lizards, which are
skittish around humans, bearded dragons will sit on a shoulder or
lap and can be fed from the hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mailloux, who has been breeding the lizards for 18 years, said
that he had occasionally heard accounts of death-by-firefly from
customers. ``A lot of people call us up to ask us things,'' he
said. ``Sometimes they'll say, `My dragon just up and died. I fed
it a firefly and wondered if that had anything to do with it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell researchers in the past few months have learned of
similar deaths among African chameleons and another type of lizard,
one that is native to Eastern Europe. ``The implication is that
this susceptibility to toxicity is a fairly widespread
phenomenon,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   Their paper is being published next month, but the scientists
said that with the firefly season in full swing, and with a lot of
bearded dragons around, it was good to get the word out sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `One can actually save some lizards,''' Eisner
said. ``Or some fireflies, depending upon which side you're on.''

CATHOLIC GROUP SEEKS HARDER LINE ON PARISH PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By J. MICHAEL PARKER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A vigilante Catholic group has urged pastors and
deacons to stop what it calls abuses in the Mass and a lack of
reverence among lay Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Patrick Flores of San Antonio said the group,
Defenders of the Magisterium, has no official standing and no
permission to evaluate liturgical practices.
</P>
<P>
   Magisterium refers to the Catholic Church's official teaching
authority represented by Pope John Paul II and the bishops in union
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette Ammari wrote in a general letter to pastors that
failure to comply with norms set by the Holy See ``results in
impairment of the unity of faith and worship in the church,
doctrinal uncertainty, scandal and bewilderment among the people of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   She listed as abuses more than 30 practices, including using
simple baskets to hold communion hosts, not wearing proper
vestments for Mass, using improper chalices for communion wine,
using unauthorized language in Mass prayers, using non-organ music
and skipping certain key prayers at Sunday and Holy Day Masses.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote that the San Antonio organization plans to check
parishes for liturgical errors and publish a public report on
strengths and weaknesses in parish liturgies. She declined to say
when.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, in his own letter to priests, welcomes concern for
proper liturgies but says he is ``disappointed by the tenor of the
letter as well as by the guidelines for judging liturgical abuses
and so-called abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   It adds: ``The Defenders of the Magisterium in no way have been
approved by me to evaluate the way the liturgy is celebrated in our
parishes. If you would like the liturgies in your parishes
evaluated, you may invite the (archdiocesan) Office of Worship to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammari said that many parishes aren't offering the Mass in a
uniform manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be unity in the liturgy under laws set down by
the Holy See and the conference of bishops,'' she said, adding:
``As Catholics, we're obliged to obey the pope and the magisterium.
We can't be in unity unless we do.''
</P>
<P>
   She said other members have discussed such concerns with Flores
personally, but added: ``They say he doesn't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores said an unidentified woman from the group recently told
him she was ``practicing her faith just as she had as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if she were still abstaining from eating meat on
Friday, and she said no. I asked if she always covered her head
when entering a church as women were once required to do, and she
said no,'' Flores recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after receiving similar answers to other questions,
he suggested she examine her own conscience rather than point
fingers at others.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said he also had heard complaints about the ``handshake
of peace'' shortly before Communion and not kneeling at certain
points of the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd rather have people shaking hands in peace than hating
and not talking to one another,'' he said, adding: ``And if they go
to Europe, they'll see that nobody kneels _ even in St. Peter's
Basilica.''
</P>
<P>
   He said reverence in the heart is the issue, not body position.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said the group can say what it wants because ``freedom of
speech is very strong in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo Vargas, a seminarian from 1951-56, said he founded
Defenders of the Magisterium in 1997 to counteract ``a serious
crisis of faith in the Catholic Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lack of official status, he said, ``We don't need
the archbishop's permission to bring our concerns to the attention
of the people. We are exercising our rights under canon law.''
</P>
<P>
   He said official membership is about 350, of whom 150 are
active. Its Internet address is
www.stic.net/users/homecom/defender.htm. The site provides
information about the organization, upcoming events and other Web
links.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Eddie Bernal, pastor of St. John Berchmans Parish,
criticized the group for ``attending celebrations of the Eucharist
for the purpose of finding fault with others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what the Mass is for. You may have priests who obey
all the guidelines for celebration of Mass but won't obey the
social teachings of the same Catholic Church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jesus never told people to kneel in his presence or
worship him. ``He told us to love and care for the least of his
brothers.''

EDGY CARTOONS REMIND US THAT ANIMATION NEVER HAS BEEN A KIDS-ONLY
CLUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As parents anguish over the psyche-warping effect ``South Park:
Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' will have on their little ones, and
others carp that its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have
hijacked the innocence of animation, it's clear that people have
forgotten something important: Cartoons weren't originally made
specifically for children.
</P>
<P>
   For this development, you can thank the cultural hijacking at
Walt Disney, where they took a branding iron to animation and used
it to reach the most impressionable audience, kids. Post-Disney,
the idea that cartoons could be for a more mature palate has come
to be considered a revolutionary concept, despite the current
preponderance of such adult-oriented fare as ``South Park,'' ``The
Simpsons,'' ``Dilbert,'' ``Dr. Katz,'' ``Family Guy,'' ``The PJs''
and ``Spawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of cartoons being a kids-only medium evolved in the
1950s, after cartoons aired in hour-long blocks on television in
the mornings, serving as a source of cheap programming in the early
days of TV. They ended up in wasteland time slots in the first
place because, as with everything of value, the studio heads had no
idea of their worth.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this tale, from the hilarious memoir ``Chuck Amuck,''
by Chuck Jones, the animation master who made Daffy Duck a beast of
pure, sputtering id: Jack Warner, one of the Warner brothers, sold
off all of the studio's pre-1948 cartoons for $3,000 apiece. That
he managed this spectacular feat when the 400 cartoons then in the
Warner library were averaging $5,000 a year in rentals is a tribute
to the low esteem he held for these little masterpieces. (Jones
also noted that Harry, another Warner brother, once ignorantly said
of the studio's cartoon division: ``The only thing I know is that
we make Mickey Mouse.'')
</P>
<P>
   In ``Chuck Amuck'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $29), Jones
mentions that cartoons were created as one part of a full cinematic
meal, one from each film group: a trailer, a newsreel, a feature
film and a short subject. Cartoons were a way for animators to
invent a whole new language for physical comedy _ one that didn't
have to adhere to the laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   Their comedy existed despite battles with the humorless
factotums who ran the animation division _ apparently, a sense of
humor would only have weighed them down. The early cartoon creators
had to struggle to get their ideas in their cartoons, not unlike
the fights Parker and Stone had with the Motion Picture Association
of America's Ratings Board over ``South Park's'' satire on the
American fear of sex.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of taking on an outside enemy, Jones and others
fought with the very men who signed their paychecks. There was a
famous exchange between MGM's head of animation and Tex Avery when
Avery wanted to humiliate an animated version of Hitler in ``The
Blitz Wolf.'' Supposedly, the cartoon chief wanted Avery to be
careful about his satire because ``after all, we don't know who's
going to win the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that such cartoons weren't made just for children doesn't
mean that kids couldn't enjoy cartoons. But there was a
sophistication involved that allowed cartoons to play to adults,
who knew that the idea of Bugs Bunny hitting invisible air brakes
to avoid crashing into the ground after an endless plunge was
ridiculous. What sense would that make to kids, who presumably had
never used brakes in a car?
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Jones talks about being inspired by Buster Keaton
and Charlie Chaplin, and that all of the animators at Warners _
some of whom escaped from Disney _ made cartoons they wanted to
see. At no point does he mention slanting them to a young crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, animators also parodied movie conventions and conditions
that children would never have understood.
</P>
<P>
   Even the early Disney cartoon shorts employed a savvy that might
whiz above kids' heads, before they slumped into the kind of
one-note simplicity that could hypnotize young audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Disney even attempted to break down a wall in feature-length
animation with the misguided but beautifully made 1940 film
``Fantasia.'' This ambitious, bombastic marriage of classical music
and gorgeously hand-rendered animation flopped in its initial
release. It finally connected with adult audiences more than 30
years after it was made, when baby boomers started watching the
movie under the influence of ... um, mood-altering substances.
</P>
<P>
   The freedom that animation shorts creators claimed in the 1960s
resulted in films like ``The Crunch Bird,'' a cartoon about a
vicious, profane bird, and ``The Critic,'' the Oscar-winning
cartoon in which Mel Brooks voices a befuddled version of his
2,000-year-old-man character, suffering through a pretentious
collection of abstract images. ``Critic'' ridiculed the kind of
cartoon short that was then winning Oscars and acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   And by the late '60s, the new freedom granted by the ratings
board allowed former ``Mighty Mouse'' animator Ralph Bakshi to turn
the underground humor of R. Crumb's ``Fritz the Cat'' into the
first X-rated cartoon. Bakshi then produced a series of animation
explicitly made for adults, R-rated features that failed to exploit
the unlimited potential of the medium, including ``American Pop,
Heavy Traffic'' and the loathsome ``Coonskin'' (retitled
``Streetfight''), which tried to satirize racism and ended up being
racist itself.
</P>
<P>
   This period offered an atmosphere that lent itself to
adult-themed animation, like the adaptation of the sci-fi comic
magazine ``Heavy Metal'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, Matt Groening began the new wave of adult TV
animation when his creations, the Simpsons, were first featured on
``The Tracey Ullman Show'' and then spun off into their own series.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the early ``Simpsons'' feel like a punk slap at the
sticky warmth of ``The Cosby Show,'' but even the characters' hair
had the punky spikes of an audience at a Ramones reunion show.
Groening understands the implications of his work; he has admitted
that he won't allow his own children to watch his show.
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   A student of popular culture who has shoehorned many of his
personal obsessions into the show _ the crank calls to Moe's Bar
grew out of actual calls to an East Coast bar, where the proprietor
spewed a steaming stream of obscenities in reply _ Groening loves
the kind of arcana that leaves kids puzzled. And he riffs on how
kids become inured to the effects of cartoon violence with ``Itchy
&AMP; Scratchy,'' the cartoon-within-a-cartoon on ``The Simpsons.''
(''Itchy &AMP; Scratchy'' may also have been lifted from a murderous
spoof of the ``Tom &AMP; Jerry'' cartoons called ``Kit &AMP; Kaboodle''
that ran in the ``National Lampoon'' in the early 1970s.) In the
wake of ``The Simpsons,'' we get the fitfully funny ``The PJs,''
which occasionally seems reminiscent of an ``In Living Color''
sketch. We also get the fit-inducing ``Family Guy,'' with its
free-floating cultural assault.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these aren't as consistently adult as the infamous World
War II-era ``Private Snafu'' shorts, which were made by Warner's
studios for the U.S. Army and were sprinkled with mild profanity.
(The ``Private Snafu'' shorts have just been released on DVD; many
of these were written by Dr. Seuss himself, Theodore Geisel.)
</P>
<P>
   In roughly the same era were the classic animation pieces made
by the Fleischer Studios. Max Fleischer and his brothers were the
creators of the jazz hottie Betty Boop, who romped with Cab
Calloway in several shorts, including the set-in-a-graveyard
``Minnie the Moocher,'' complete with its original cocaine
reference.
</P>
<P>
   Even the black-and-white ``Popeye'' cartoons had a moody, tense
ambience, as an angry, frustrated Popeye muttered asides to himself
like Fredric March in a screwball comedy. The Fleischer stuff had
the erotic cool of German expressionist comedy, subtle
black-and-white shadow to indicate a Freudian play of thought. (The
Fleischer work can be seen on the Cartoon Network's ``Black &AMP;
White,'' which runs in the dead of night, unfortunately.)
</P>
<P>
   But the high point of the Fleischer output was the 14 Superman
cartoons they made in the 1940s, state-of-the-art minifeatures that
essentially bankrupted the studio. They carry a sensual splash of
color and powerful, sharp rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superman'' is filled with action, and the realistic threat of
violence to people, not wide-eyed wisecracking animals who could
bounce back from being squashed. There were stories of horrified
children being rushed out of theaters by their parents after seeing
the Superman cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, the brutal grace of the Fleischer work was
appropriated for the daily TV version of the WB's Batman cartoons.
And finally, the Fleischer influence can be in seen in the recent
series of Superman cartoons. They so closely ape the horror and
violence of the Fleischer originals that the Batman and Superman
cartoons are now accused of being bad influences on kids.
</P>
<P>
   That's an irony that the Fleischers, who wanted to explore the
adult aspect of cartoons more than any other animators, would
enjoy.

A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CAROLINE'S GRIEF 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CATHERINE MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waiting was the hardest part.
</P>
<P>
   The call came on an August afternoon almost 18 years ago, while
I worked at my usual place on the city desk of a midsize
Pennsylvania newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cath, are you sitting down?'' my brother Michael wanted to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Michael can be a prankster, so I responded a little impatiently.
At 3 p.m., deadline was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' Mike said. ``I want you to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear began to tighten its grip at my throat. Mike never called
me at work. Something was very wrong. Was it my niece? My
2-month-old nephew? His devastating news came out in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, our 23-year-old brother, Rob, had been fishing
with four of his buddies in two small motorboats after a softball
game. A man in a much larger boat ran into them, so drunk he didn't
know there had been a crash, dragging at least one victim in his
wake. He stopped only when his motor gave out.
</P>
<P>
   Rob's body was missing in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad and I think you should come home,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   Time came to a blurry, chilly stop. I stumbled over to the
newspaper's library, a large, private room off the newsroom. In the
following moments, someone escorted me to the publisher's office on
another floor. A call was made to the Wyandotte Police Department,
then the Michigan Coast Guard. The newspaper's publisher, an
influential member of the fifth estate, was on the phone demanding
information about the accident that had occurred the night before
in the waters of the Detroit River involving Robert James McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the background, someone was making arrangements for
my flight home to Detroit. The personnel manager was dispatched to
the bank to get some money for my trip.
</P>
<P>
   Then these sobering words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your brother and his friend were in his boat, the two other
guys in a boat next to them. A large boat, a cabin cruiser, ran
over your brother's boat. The other three boys are alive, although
one of them is in intensive care. Your brother's body is missing.
The other boys can only recall seeing Rob struggling in the water.
Then nothing after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police and the Coast Guard are searching along the banks.
The Coast Guard is considering calling in divers. No decision has
been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike and my dad met me at the airport gate. I had a million
questions. They had few answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do now is wait and hope,'' my dad told me.
</P>
<P>
   Off-shore accident. Missing. Water.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   I identify with many of the words used last week in the intense
coverage of the plane accident that left a brother and two sisters
lost in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   I kept a vigil at the television set, watching as the Kennedys
came out to take a Sunday stroll on the beach, reading about how
they flew kites on Sunday, when it was still early enough to hope.
I couldn't stop thinking about Caroline and her pain in losing a
beloved brother.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to draw serenity from the water, the early morning
sails while they waited for news.
</P>
<P>
   That long ago summer, I stood at the river's edge, looking out
into the water, watching, waiting, hoping for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could he be unconscious somewhere? Just hurt and waiting on
the shore for someone to come and find him?'' my 8-year-old son
asked earlier last week about John F. Kennedy Jr. ``Isn't he a good
swimmer?'' he wanted to know. ``Could they still be alive?'' The
same questions, the same words that once haunted me.
</P>
<P>
   It would be four days before my family knew what happened to
Rob. Walking searches of the banks each day and two dives by the
Coast Guard came up empty. The search was called off each night at
dark, leaving me feeling powerless and angry. How could they stop
searching when he's out there somewhere? He might be fighting for
his life in that water, holding on, at that very moment.
</P>
<P>
   The second day into the search, I took an afternoon nap. I
dreamed I was standing on the shoreline when Rob walked up from the
water. I watched as he moved closer to me and made his way to the
surface. I woke up crying with relief.
</P>
<P>
   Friends gathered each day at Rob's house to wait for news,
comforting us with funny stories about him. We cuddled and played
with my 2-year-old daughter, Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedy children have a way of keeping things light during
this period of waiting,'' a family spokesman said on Sunday.
``Children have a way of keeping us all distracted during difficult
times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the crash, every phone call brought renewed
hope that Rob was still alive. They'll find him, I tried to
convince myself. He's an athlete. He's strong. He's a survivor.
He'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   But with the turn of each new dawn, the inevitable became harder
to ignore. I wanted news. Any news. I wanted the waiting to be
over.
</P>
<P>
   After three days, the Coast Guard called off the search _
something about budget problems and funding.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, four days after he was killed, the phone rang at
Rob's house. An area police department had received a report of a
body that had washed ashore downriver. The wallet held a Michigan
driver's license registered to Robert James McMahon. Someone was
needed to identify the body.
</P>
<P>
   I never saw the body. Reports indicated that the water had left
it badly decomposed. Yet a measure of relief washed over me, before
the unspeakable grief set in. The waiting, at least, was over.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly two years for me to obtain all the details of the
crash, but I searched out every one. I had to have answers, no
matter how painful they were. How did the other boys escape? Why
didn't Rob swim to safety? Why had Rob been the only one to perish
in the water? The autopsy reports revealed that Rob's arm had been
broken when his body became caught in the bigger boat's motor. He
couldn't swim.
</P>
<P>
   It took years to meander my way through the grief of losing my
brother so abruptly. The pain never ends, it just softens and
changes. I remember how Rob loved the water. How proud he was the
day he showed me his new boat. One of our happiest times together
was spent two months before he died. We took the boat over to the
Canadian shore for a day of diving and swimming. We had a picnic on
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Water has come to signify serenity in my life. The beach in
wintertime is my favorite place. The initial, violent image of a
brother thrashing to stay alive is now a vision of peace, of
floating in soothing waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found the women,'' a colleague informed me on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting, at least, was over.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When we think about our U.S. senators, we
think about someone who understands what it's like to live under
the Texas sky; someone who lives Texas, breathes Texas, pays
property tax in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, we were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for the U.S. Senate from our state don't even have to
live in Texas. They just have to say they ``intend'' to live here
and then show up on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Which is apparently akin to what Hillary Rodham Clinton is doing
in New York. The first lady, who has never lived in New York _ and
obviously doesn't live there now _ is exploring the possibility of
running for one of that state's two U.S. Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   And, actually, importing potential senators from other states
expands our candidate pool immensely. Consider the possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL JORDAN: Great potential as a towering political figure.
His familiarity is such that his name has appeared 4,024 times in
this newspaper during the past eight years. For the sake of
comparison, the name ``Jesus Christ'' has appeared 1,615 times
during the same time frame. This doesn't mean Jordan is more
important, of course, but he certainly gets more ink, not just
here, but everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ELWAY: Cowboys fans may bristle, but the Super Bowl-winning
former Denver Broncos quarterback is out of work and might be a
fine candidate to pass legislation. Plus, Elway's past competitor,
former Seattle Seahawks receiver Steve Largent, hasn't done such a
bad job representing the state of Oklahoma in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BRANDI CHASTAIN: As soon as she cleans up her on-air television
language, this 30-year-old Women's World Cup soccer game-winning
goal kicker could be a contender, with a zest for life that can
magnetize the masses.
</P>
<P>
   FRED ROGERS: Better known as Mr. Rogers, but as Sen. Rogers, we
think he'd ensure it would be a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   DENZEL WASHINGTON: Because he's the lone star that women
everywhere love.
</P>
<P>
   SHIRLEY MacLAINE: This actress-turned-New Age-devotee can bring
past life experiences to the job.
</P>
<P>
   GERALDO RIVERA: Couldn't you just see this television talk-show
host stirring up action on both sides of the Senate chamber's
aisle?
</P>
<P>
   JERRY SPRINGER: See above, only no holds barred.
</P>
<P>
   RICKY MARTIN: He already knows ``La Vida Loca,'' which is pretty
much a requirement in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, so maybe Denzel isn't the lone
women's candidate. We'd love to see this former Clinton adviser on
the Texas campaign trail. I would personally volunteer for the
``listening tour.''
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH DOLE: Assuming she doesn't receive the Republican
presidential nomination, Dole may wish to give Texas a go. We have
appreciated the former Transportation Department secretary ever
since she was quoted saying, ``Some pundits say I'm scripted, but
according to my notes, that's not true. Some pundits have written
that my biggest accomplishment in government service was giving
America the air bag. I can't believe they would use that term to
describe my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   BILL BRADLEY: Assuming he doesn't receive the Democratic
presidential nomination, Bradley is welcome to come to Texas. Born
in Missouri, the former Oxford-educated New York Knicks player is a
senator from New Jersey. Clearly, he knows something about
traveling.

 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a routine physical, a 75-year-old patient named Joseph
was surprised to learn that his pulse was highly irregular: 50
beats one minute, 140 the next, seemingly without provocation.
</P>
<P>
   He was surprised because, he said, he felt fine and hadn't
noticed any symptoms, except for three brief, isolated periods of
complete lethargy that had occurred over three months.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis: atrial fibrillation, a chaotic rhythm in the heart's
upper chambers that empty blood into the ventricles, the heart's
main pumping chambers. When the atria function erratically, they
can disrupt the rhythm of the ventricles, causing the heart to race
one minute and crawl the next.
</P>
<P>
   People with atrial fibrillation, or AF, often experience
palpitations, a strong, racing heart that typically beats 140 to
180 times a minute. Other symptoms like dizziness, faintness,
shortness of breath and fatigue can result when the heart cannot
pump enough blood to the body and brain.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that atrial fibrillation is often underappreciated
and undertreated. The condition, estimated to affect 2.2 million
Americans, is the most common heart rhythm disorder seen by
practicing physicians. Its prevalence increases with age, from 0.5
percent in people ages 50 to 59 to nearly 10 percent among those 80
and older.
</P>
<P>
   Uncorrected, AF may lead to congestive heart failure or
aggravate other heart problems. But by far the most serious problem
associated with it is an increased risk of stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Though the risk is practically nonexistent in young people and
minimal in the middle-aged (about 1.5 percent among people aged 50
to 59), as people age the risk of stroke rises, reaching 30 percent
in people aged 80 to 89. The rate of stroke among elderly people
with AF averages 5 percent a year, or six times that of people
without the condition.
</P>
<P>
   And if undetected and mini-strokes are included, the rate rises
to about 7 percent a year. And, when people with the condition
suffer a stroke, it is more likely to be severe or fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association has singled out atrial
fibrillation as a major cause of stroke, especially in the elderly.
The association estimates that 15 percent of strokes result from
untreated atrial fibrillation and that a third or more of people
with AF who are at significant risk for a serious stroke are not
being treated adequately to prevent this dire complication.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Framingham Heart Study has indicated
that the prevalence of AF, adjusted for the age of the population,
has increased substantially over 30 years, beginning in the
mid-1950s. With the growth of the elderly population, this increase
in prevalence suggests that the impact of AF as a cause of strokes
and other health consequences may be much greater than believed,
the heart association concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The atria are the heart's two upper chambers; one atrium
collects oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and the other collects
oxygen-depleted blood from the rest of the body. This blood is then
pumped into the ventricles below; the right ventricle pumps blood
to the lungs to be oxygenated and the left ventricle pumps
oxygenated blood to the body and brain. When all the chambers
function normally, the atria contract just ahead of the ventricles
in an orderly rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   In atrial fibrillation, the rhythm in the atria is rapid and
irregular. These episodes, in turn, disrupt the rhythm of the
ventricles, causing an irregular or racing pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Various conditions are known to touch off the fibrillation,
especially heart failure, which can also result from AF, and
diseased heart valves. Other precipitating conditions include a
heart attack, an enlarged heart and infections of the heart muscle
or surrounding tissue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, certain other factors that raise the risk of
developing atrial fibrillation include alcohol abuse, cigarette
smoking, diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, an enlarged left
ventricle and serious infections.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the atrial rhythm is erratic, the chambers do not empty
properly. Blood pools inside them and clots can form. If these
clots escape and reach the brain, a stroke results.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ventricular fibrillation, which can cause death in
minutes, atrial fibrillation is not an emergency situation: in some
people with the condition, the heart reverts to a normal rhythm on
its own in a day or two. When the heart fails to correct itself,
depending on the patient's heart problems, doctors may first try to
normalize the heart rate with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of treatment for atrial fibrillation is to
prevent a stroke. This can be accomplished by normalizing the heart
rhythm and treating the patient with a blood thinner, usually the
drug warfarin (coumadin).
</P>
<P>
   But treatment can be tricky; sometimes the methods used to
control the rhythm make it worse, and drugs that thin the blood
increase the risk of bleeding problems, including a hemorrhagic
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a treatment approach, the physician has to evaluate
the patient carefully, taking age, health and ability to follow
medical instructions into account, as well as the seriousness of
the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Joseph was reluctant to accept treatment, thinking the
cure might be worse than the disease. But eventually, Joseph
realized that at his age, his chances of suffering a stroke
approached 1 in 3.
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to start taking warfarin, which means he must have
frequent blood tests to be sure his blood is clotting within the
normal range. His doctor also prescribed two other drugs to help
regulate his heart rhythm by treating previously undetected
underlying heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Joseph said, his heart rate is stabilized at 60 beats a
minute 95 percent of the time, whereas before treatment it beat
normally only 20 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Warfarin has been shown in at least five studies to be highly
effective in preventing strokes in patients with atrial
fibrillation. Those taking the drug in proper dosages had on
average nearly a 70 percent reduction in strokes, when compared
with people not on warfarin.
</P>
<P>
   However, warfarin is not recommended for patients with bleeding
disorders or dementia or those at high risk of falling. Aspirin,
which reduces the risk of clotting by interfering with blood
platelets, can be prescribed instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, drugs are inadequate, and other methods may
be used, especially electrically shocking the heart back into a
normal rhythm. The drug Corvert given before the shock greatly
increases the chances of success, a recent study showed.
</P>
<P>
   If both these approaches fail, a catheter can be inserted into
the area of the heart where the rhythm is generated and that region
can be removed or destroyed. The patient is then fitted with a
pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of stroke following treatments to restore a
normal rhythm, patients are given anti-coagulants for three weeks
beforehand and four weeks afterward.

 &HT;    JFK Jr. still dominating coverage
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Magazines mourn the passing of John F. Kennedy Jr. this week
with special sections, memorial editions and reminiscences.
Newsweek ($5.95) publishes a 96-page, ad-free issue with essays and
photographs about JFK Jr. and the Kennedys' role in the life of a
nation. And, ironically, Life's ($3.99) commemorative edition of
rare and unpublished photographs immediately follows a pictorial
tribute to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis that hit newsstands last
week. In the past 46 years, the Kennedys have been featured 54
times on the cover of Life _ more than any other subject.
</P>
<P>
   In The New Yorker ($3), John Updike, Pete Hamill and other
writers eloquently pay tribute to the young prince of Camelot.
``Being born to fame is not like earning it,'' Updike writes. ``You
have to create your own worth in other coin, you have to escape
history's shadow and get, as they say, a life. To his credit, he
was trying, and seemed to be succeeding.'' Hamill recalls casual
conversations with a teenage Kennedy, and his interest in
newspapers and reporting. In the end, Hamill writes, he became ``a
journalist who covered other people while being covered himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Time ($3.50) devotes 30 pages to the tragedy and the aftermath,
including a stunning three-page foldout of the young Kennedy
sitting with his father in a beached, wooden boat on one page, and
a long-range shot of last week's funeral service aboard the USS
Briscoe. Emblazoned across the bottom of the panoramic photograph
is the quote from John F. Kennedy: ``We are tied to the ocean. And
when we go back to the sea, whether ... it is to sail or to watch
it, we are going back from whence we came.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the Kennedys that seems to attract tragedy?
Perhaps it is genetics linked to risk-taking, says U.S. News &AMP;
World Report ($3.50), or maybe it's simply misfortune. In a
poignant essay, Roger Simon quotes Bobby Kennedy as saying, ``Good
luck is something you make and bad luck is something you endure.
The Kennedys intend to stay in public life. There are more of us
than there is trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pay scales: What's a hero worth? Well, according to Atlanta
($3.50), it depends on what kind of uniform you wear. Greg Maddux
of the Braves brings in $10.6 million while firefighter/ hero Matt
Moseley makes $29,334. Other salaries: $2.50 an hour plus tips for
a Varsity car hop; $800 a night for a Gold Club dancer; and
$107,000 a year for a master plumber. But fame and fortune come
with a price, too. In a separate article, Scott Freeman interviews
CNN's Lynne Russell, former WAGA-TV anchor Cynthia Good and others
about fans who are so obsessed they become stalkers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best of the west: The September issue of Cowboys &AMP; Indians
($5), a thick, glossy magazine crammed with upscale ads for Indian
art and western furnishings, is worth a look even for those without
a frontier mentality. A breezy profile of Sam Elliott traces the
actor's career from his breakthrough role in ``Lifeguard'' to his
latest TNT movie, ``You Know My Name,'' and looks ahead to his next
non-western role in a political film. Also of interest is a
behind-the-scenes look at the latest video of Brooks &AMP; Dunn, dubbed
``The Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid of Country Music.''
</P>

   NUTRITION: A GAIN, WHEN COMPANIES CUT THE FAT
</P>
<P>
   A new study has found that companies that offer nutrition
information and provide healthy food choices in their cafeterias
significantly improve the dietary habits of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, which was a follow-up to the Working Well Trial,
the largest workplace cancer and nutrition trial in the United
States, researchers handed out questionnaires to more than 9,000
employees. Participants evaluated their smoking status, described
their food habits and indicated their intentions of changing their
eating and smoking habits.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, the surveys were taken again for a control
group and at companies that provided improved access to nutrition
information and more fruits and vegetables and other low-fat,
high-fiber menus. The group with the healthy workplace program
showed the greater improvement in eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Group members were also more likely to report support from
co-workers for choosing low-fat diets and they believed that
management cared about their nutrition. But follow-up responses for
smoking were similar in both groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really significant about this paper is that it shows
the importance of addressing the environment that people find
themselves in,'' said Dr. Lois Biener, senior research fellow at
the Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts
at Boston and lead author of the study. It appears in the current
issue of Health Education and Behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional way of addressing behavior issues is to try to
help individuals to change, but people have to exist in a social
world and if a lot of people around you are involved in unhealthy
behaviors, it's really difficult to make those changes,'' Biener
said.
</P>
<P>
   Participating companies ranged in size from 49 to 1,700 workers,
with an average size of 316.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbins Company, in Attleboro, Mass., with 430 employees,
was enthusiastic about its results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people spend a great amount of time at the company,'' said
Charles Dress, the human resources director. ``If they are going to
be doing that, we have to ask ourselves what can we do to make
their lives better, different and healthier? And from a corporate
perspective, if our workers are healthier, benefits stay reasonable
and there's less stress and greater productivity.''

   TIMING: YEAR'S FIRST BABY? ON WHOSE WATCH?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, some obstetricians said that April 9 was the
prime date for couples hoping to conceive the first baby born on
Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many people apparently took the advice to heart, encouraged by
special deals from hotels, contests and, perhaps, the belief that a
maternity ward is as good a place as any to spend the last New
Year's Eve of the 1900s, since every other establishment of note
has long since been booked.
</P>
<P>
   All of this got two London pediatricians thinking. How, they
wondered, could anyone really be sure if that baby slipping under
the wire at 12:01 really is the first baby?
</P>
<P>
   ``Validation of the `first baby' requires an accurate clock in
the labor room,'' the pediatricians write in the current issue of
The British Medical Journal. Alas, they report, ``This may not
always be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   How do Dr. Jonathan Round and Dr. Nigel Kenna of St. George's
Hospital know this? The way that scientists know anything: close
scrutiny of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our labor ward, where 2,600 babies a year are delivered,
each room has an independent battery-powered quartz clock,'' the
doctors wrote in a letter to the journal.
</P>
<P>
   They compared the time on the clock with the time given by
British Telephone. ``All six clocks were slow, by a median of 93.6
seconds,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then ventured to a large teaching hospital,
where they found that the clocks ranged from 4 minutes 12 seconds
slow to 2 minutes 25 seconds fast.
</P>
<P>
   The public relations folks at the journal, aware, perhaps, that
the ineffable British sense of humor does not always travel well
abroad, helpfully noted to reporters that the doctors' letter was
``tongue in cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the report will set off a flurry of clock
checking in maternity wards across the world. Doctors in at least
one major New York City hospital declined an invitation to check
their clocks, even in the interest of science.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it hardly matters, since the Americans and the
British and their newborns will be late entrants into the new year.
It will first arrive in the Central Pacific. So the real question
is: How good are those clocks at hospitals in places like the
Republic of Kiribati and the Chatham Islands?

   SAFETY: EYES AT RISK, AS THE BLADES WHIRL
</P>
<P>
   Each year 230,000 to 400,000 people are sent to emergency rooms
because of lawn mowing accidents, with the majority of injuries
occurring in the eyes, the American Academy of Ophthalmology
reports.
</P>
<P>
   People using lawn mowers can suffer a range of eye injuries,
from mild corneal abrasions to retinal detachment, a significant
trauma to the eye that can lead to blindness, the academy says.
These injuries are usually caused by fragments of rocks or twigs
thrown from the mowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eye socket protects the eyeball from large objects such as
basketballs or fists,'' said Dr. H. Jay Wisnicki, chairman of
ophthalmology at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. ``But
smaller objects, like the kind shot from lawn mowers, can wreak
havoc on the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The ophthalmology academy offers these suggestions for safe lawn
mowing:
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the mower, remove sticks, stones and other
objects from the area to be mowed that could be thrown into the
eyes. Replace thin and worn mower blades because pieces of them can
break off and become dangerous flying objects.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure that bystanders are at least 10 yards away so they are
not in the ``line of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Wear eye protection gear while mowing. Regular glasses or
contact lenses are not strong enough to protect the eyes from
flying hazards. The academy recommends polycarbonate goggles that
meet educational and industrial standards.
</P>
<P>
   If minor eye injuries do occur, blink several times, pull the
upper eyelid over the lower eyelid so the lashes of the lower lid
can brush the foreign object from the underneath surface of the
upper eyelid, and run lukewarm water over the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a severe injury, seek medical treatment
immediately. ``If the eyeball is cut or pierced,'' Wisnicki said,
``cover the eye, avoid pressure and rubbing, and go to the
emergency room right away to prevent further damage to the eye.''

<P>
   Nadine McGann is thinking very hard, but she cannot remember the
last time she felt joy, or happiness, or even simple pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, she drags herself out of bed after her sister's
daily wake-up call, walks her dogs in Prospect Park, in New York,
and slogs through the afternoon, fighting anxiety, inertia and
fatigue. On a bad day, she mostly stays in bed. ``I don't really
know what it is like to feel good,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people who suffer from depression, Ms. McGann, who is
37, has heard the public service announcements that proclaim her
condition to be eminently treatable.
</P>
<P>
   She has seen the advertisements for Prozac and Zoloft and Luvox
and a dozen other anti-depressant drugs, old and new, promotions
that show smiling men and women happily going about their lives.
She can cite the studies showing that certain types of
psychotherapy are effective for depression, especially when
combined with anti-depressants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGann's own experience, however, has been slightly
different: In the five years since her latest battle with the
illness began, she has tried virtually every treatment the
mental-health field has to offer _ and not one of them has worked.
Not drugs, either singly or in combination, not psychotherapy, not
the electroshock therapy she received in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Recently she had a device implanted under her collarbone that
delivers electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve in her neck _ a
procedure that has proved effective for some forms of severe
epilepsy, and that Columbia University researchers are trying on an
experimental basis in depression. But so far that treatment, too,
appears to be failing.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, she said, she may decide to undergo a
cingulotomy, a form of brain surgery in which fibers deep in the
frontal lobe are severed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very frustrating,'' she said. ``I'm sort of running out
of options.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGann's case is extreme: She is unable to work, and her
life is severely limited by her illness. But there are many others
who share her plight to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   Depression, a recurrent illness that afflicts more than 19
million Americans over the age of 18, in some cases is considerably
more difficult to treat than the drug advertisements suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists estimate that 60 percent to 70 percent of people
who can tolerate the side effects of anti-depressants get better
with the first drug they take. But 10 percent do not respond _ even
after trials on many different drugs. And still others _ the
estimates of how many vary _ get better but do not recover
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel somewhat improved,'' said Dr. Jan Fawcett, chairman
of psychiatry at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago, an expert in what doctors call ``refractory'' or
``treatment-resistant'' depression. ``They might be able to
function. But they don't really enjoy life.''
</P>
<P>
   For such people, finding help can become a full-time occupation.
They wait impatiently for each new anti-depressant to reach the
market. They go from doctor to doctor, hoping the next physician or
therapist they consult will be able to provide relief.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGann, for example, has tried at least 20 different
psychiatric drugs, and is now taking six: Effexor, an
anti-depressant; Clozaril and Risperdal, both anti-psychotic
medications; Adderall, a stimulant; and Klonipin, an anti-anxiety
drug.
</P>
<P>
   She has consulted five psychotherapists from a variety of
theoretical schools, as well as three experts in
psychopharmacology. Her present therapist specializes in
cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, which has been shown effective
in treating depression.
</P>
<P>
   A 45-year-old Boston woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said
she had consulted more than 40 therapists for the depressions she
had experienced since childhood. Prozac was effective for a while,
she said, but then it stopped working _ a phenomenon sometimes
referred to as the ``poop-out'' syndrome. Other drugs and
combinations of drugs failed as well. She recently decided to
undergo electroshock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I have choice,'' she said. ``This illness
has taken my life away.''
</P>
<P>
   Many clinicians, faced with patients who do not improve, ``tend
to throw up their hands,'' said Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   And even psychiatrists who specialize in treating difficult
cases may resort to a hit-or-miss strategy with treatment-resistant
patients, trying out any new approach they have heard about from
colleagues or seen mentioned in the journals.
</P>
<P>
   They may shift patients from one medicine to another, add other
drugs like lithium, amphetamines, beta blockers, anti-psychotics or
thyroid hormone, and recommend electroshock if drugs and
psychotherapy fail. Sometimes patients get better; sometimes they
do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treatment-resistant depression is a continuum,'' said Dr.
Harold Sackheim, chief of biological psychiatry at the New York
State Psychiatric Institute. ``Some people don't do that well with
first treatment, but they respond to the second. Some will go 20
years and nothing helps them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most dire and intractable cases, some physicians turn to
experimental approaches like vagus-nerve stimulation, which
Sackheim's institute is studying as a treatment for refractory
depression, or even cingulotomy, which has been found to help some
people for whom nothing else works.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers know little about why some people respond fully to
anti-depressant treatment and others do not. In some cases, the
difference may lie in brain structure or brain chemistry: Different
people respond differently to any type of drug.
</P>
<P>
   But some patients who are deemed refractory may also simply have
received inadequate treatment, taken a drug at a dosage too low to
be effective or discontinued the medication before the four to six
consecutive weeks that most experts consider a reasonable trial.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating things further, many patients who do not respond to
anti-depressant treatment are not only depressed but have other
difficulties as well: medical or neurological conditions, for
example, or other psychiatric problems like substance abuse, panic
attacks or personality disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration,'' Kupfer said, ``is that there are a number
of different factors where The final common denominator is that
people are not feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   And while experts agree that most types of severe or recurrent
depression have their roots in biology, psychology plays a role as
well. Dr. Judith Nowak, a psychopharmacologist and psychoanalyst in
Washington, said that in her experience some people who did not
respond to anti-depressants or combinations of drugs had
complicated life problems that could ``only be understood, managed
and corrected through psychological intervention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen several people who had lifelong refractory
depression and got caught in a loop of many experimental medication
regimens,'' Dr. Nowak said. ``But it really was through good
psychotherapy that they were helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the problem is that there have been few
systematic studies of refractory depression, or of how best to
treat patients who do not improve after routine treatments. In
particular, said Kupfer, little is known about treatment
sequencing: When is it best to follow one drug with another or to
add a different drug? When is it best to use psychotherapy in
addition to drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies, eager to prove their products are effective for
large numbers of patients, conduct short-term clinical trials to
establish the efficacy of individual anti-depressants, but have
little interest in conducting studies of anti-depressant failure,
or exploring strategies for treating patients who remain depressed
or show only partial improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers have largely ignored the topic, and what
research exists, said Dr. Matthew Rudorfer, associate director for
treatment research at the National Institute of Mental Health, is
``haphazard'' at best. Many studies were conducted using older
anti-depressants, Rudorfer said, or included only small numbers of
patients or lacked rigorous scientific controls.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of stimulating more research, the institute has
decided to sponsor its own clinical trial on treatments for
refractory depression, and will award a multimillion dollar
contract this fall to the research team with the most compelling
plans for a large-scale national study.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous gap between a lot of people out there
suffering and what we really could do about it,'' said Dr. Steven
Hyman, director of the mental-health institute. ``People deserve
the data.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute's trial, Hyman said, will include psychotherapy as
well as anti-depressant drugs, which most mental-health experts
believe are an essential component of treatment. But the project,
he said, is still only a beginning, and many more studies will be
needed before researchers can offer patients much solace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. McGann, and others who suffer similarly, can only
hope, and live from day to day. ``I feel like I'm not a person
right now,'' she said. ``And I don't feel like I can make any
decisions about my future. That's the worst part of it.'' For her,
better answers cannot come soon enough.

FORGET THE HALO. `ANGEL' NEEDS A PERSONALITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A rather impressive display of limos
dominated this city's main retail and entertainment strip the other
day, crawling bumper to bumper in militarylike precision, as if
more proof were needed that the television industry is in the midst
of an all-out ratings war.
</P>
<P>
   The destination was a sleek Italian eatery, situated 30 or so
feet off this fashionable street. The spot was perfect, supplying
just enough room for the stars of the WB network to stroll down a
red carpet while camera flashes popped around them like machine-gun
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8:45 p.m., a shiny black limousine pulled up, from which
a tall, dark-haired young man emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, David Boreanaz wasn't even invited to join
his ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' co-stars to discuss the drama on a
panel at the annual summer TV critics' tour. And he could have
slipped in and out of a place like this without much fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Of course that's impossible now. Thanks to his sensual presence
on Buffy and a shrewdly orchestrated symphony of buzz, Boreanaz is
being positioned as the WB's Next Big Thing, a star certain to
capture the hearts of women ages 18 to 34, a category considered
vital for the promising network.
</P>
<P>
   The WB was eager to unveil Boreanaz to the press. But it didn't
have the same enthusiasm for showing off his spinoff drama
``Angel,'' which was sold on the strength of its concept alone, a
supernatural adventure in which Angel saves souls.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Joss Whedon, who created Buffy and will supervise both
shows, has shifted Angel to Los Angeles and teamed him with a
disreputable spiritual mentor (Glenn Quinn of ``Roseanne''), a
half-human, half-demon out to help Angel right wrongs. There's also
the snappy Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), whose role as something
other than comedic spark is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the clips, many pulled from Buffy, Angel will carry
the same dark humor as Whedon's prized series. Earlier in the day,
Sarah Michelle Gellar had confirmed that Buffy would make a
cross-over appearance, but not until after the series is standing
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Angel, not Buffy,'' Gellar says. ``And while it's kind of
a continuation of a story born out of our series, it needs to
establish an identity of its own. And I'm sure David would agree
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   What's uncertain is how Boreanaz will handle being a lead. Long
a smoldering, brooding figure of few words, he'll now find himself
in nearly every frame, which means he'll have to display something
he didn't have on Buffy: a personality.
</P>
<P>
   Angel, which will follow Buffy on Tuesday nights, is one of six
new shows for the network, all geared toward a young adult
audience. Also screened:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack &AMP; Jill'' is a promising romantic drama featuring a
twentysomething love triangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe Harbor'' is another fluffy family drama from ``7th
Heaven'' producer Brenda Hampton, featuring Gregory Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular'' is a comedy series about high school acceptance and
cliques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission Hill'' is an animated series revolving around an
aspiring cartoonist and his eclectic world.
</P>
<P>
   While the WB has gotten criticism for its narrowcasting,
presenters UPN and Fox seem oddly similar.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's ``Shasta McNasty,'' airing Tuesdays, is about three
carefree hip-hop rappers living on Venice Beach. It's part music
video, part sitcom, all disgusting. (The pilot features a fight
scene with a parrot.) Says executive producer Neal Moritz:
``Basically, what we did was create a show that was kind of The
Monkees meets the Beastie Boys.'' As for the series' tone, Moritz
characterized it as falling somewhere between ``There's Something
About Mary'' and ``The Waterboy.'' You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Jaleel White dropped by to promote ``Grown Ups,'' his first
series since leaving ``Urkel'' and ``Family Matters.'' It's a
coming-of-age sitcom centering on two lifelong friends (White and
Dave Ruby) trying to navigate that odd period between post-college
and pre-parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   White, as did every performer of color to mount the interview
stage, spent more time answering questions about the NAACP's
criticism of network television's lack of minority characters. The
same was true with ``The Parkers,'' the Moesha spinoff with
Countess Vaughn and newcomer Mo'Nique, as a mother-daughter buddy
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   As always, White sounded like a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP has been good to me,'' he says. ``Let's leave it at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The network, still struggling for an identity, has again
refocused, this time with young men in mind. Slated for fall:
``Secret Agent Man,'' a spy drama, and a two-hour weekly World
Wrestling Federation night on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   UPN President and CEO Dean Valentine got into his usual fiery
exchange with reporters, launched early in his press conference
when asked whether the sexist, racist, homophobic and satanic
overtones of the entertainment sport would be left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing sexist or violent about the WWF,'' Valentine
says. ``There's nobody getting knifed ... there are no guns going
off. None of the real causes and issues of crime in this country
are part of that franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox presented ``Manchester Prep,'' one of the many series this
season to be set in a high school, and ``Malcolm in the Middle,''
about a young kid with a high IQ. Critics took a shine to the pilot
of Malcolm, which had its share of laughs and poignant moments,
many delivered by its likable pint-sized star, Frankie Muniz, who
spends a lot of his time talking directly into the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' two series stood out: the
WB's ``Roswell'' and Fox's ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of ``Roswell,'' which was turned down by Fox, does
well in setting up its suspenseful premise, set around three
teen-age alien survivors of the infamous ``spacecraft'' crash of
1947 in the New Mexico town. (When a character does the math,
asking how can one who crashed 52 years ago be 16 years old, you
want to scream: ``Because it's on the WB!'')
</P>
<P>
   Max Evans, last seen on ``Dawson's Creek,'' is Max, who along
with his sister, Isabel (Katherine Heigl) and friend Michael
(Brendan Fehr) will spend each week trying to keep their identities
under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' is a half-hour comedy slated for Thursdays, starring
Jay Mohr as a profanity-spewing film producer. The series was
originally written for HBO, but a financial agreement was never
struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought this to Fox and I asked, quite frankly, how can we
get this on network TV?'' says creator and writer Chris Thompson.
``This is what we came up with.''
</P>
<P>
   The language is bleeped, but what's being said is clear.
(Thompson's defense is that ``we live in a profane world, get over
it.'') Panelists for ``Action,'' who included Mohr, Thompson and
Illeana Douglas, who plays a prostitute-turned-film director, were
bombarded with questions about this device.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas became so defensive, she literally stopped answering
questions, and Mohr gave critics a tongue-lashing near the end of
the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeez,'' Mohr said afterward. ``Here you have this funny, witty
project and you guys sound like a bunch of mothers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Action'' is that despite the bleeping of the
profanity, it really is what Mohr claims it is: funny and witty and
so far the most intriguing new half-hour screened here. Its
satirical look at not only the film business but life in Hollywood
is dead-on, making sitcoms like the WB's midseason series ``Movie
Stars'' seem like a high school experiment.

   BALTIMORE _ Staff members in hospital intensive-care units
sometimes joke that the best time to be a patient is during
business hours. Otherwise, they say, doctors may be scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is true is unknown. But now a group of
intensive-care specialists from Johns Hopkins Hospital here is
trying to make the question moot. The group has developed a remote
surveillance system that is designed to allow specialists to
monitor intensive-care patients from long distance, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   They say a trial of the system in a Baltimore hospital cut
mortality among intensive-care patients by more than half, which
has led hospitals around the country to express interest in the
system as a way to expand service to their sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   The system, with video cameras and computers, will allow teams
of doctors, nurses and technicians at a remote command center
outside the hospital to observe up to 40 patients at a time and
evaluate a continuous flow of data from the bedside, like heart
rate and blood pressure. The teams will also have computerized
access to each patient's medical history and the latest research on
a broad number of medical conditions. In theory, they will be able
to spot any sudden change and tell hospital workers what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors designing the system, which is expected to be ready
for use later this year, acknowledge that each command center would
cost up to $4 million to set up. But they said that, in addition to
its health benefits, the system ultimately would cut medical costs
by earlier detection of problems, would shorten stays in the
intensive-care unit and would ease strains on doctors who work
there. Its inventors, Dr. Michael Breslow and Dr. Brian Rosenfeld,
said the pilot test reduced hospital costs by 25 percent and cut
the average length of a patient's stay by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is, you want to intervene before a complication
arises,'' Breslow said. ``A nurse can recognize something like
chest pain or when a patient stops making urine, but only after it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors contend that their remote system, which they call
Continuous Expert Care Network, will standardize maximum care by
enabling the team of monitors to notify hospital staff the moment
data show a change, suggesting that a serious problem is looming.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baltimore hospital where the pilot study was conducted,
Dr. Haya Rubin, a health services researcher who served as an
independent evaluator of the pilot program, said while patients
were monitored by the remote system, the mortality rate of the
sickest of them was half what had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin called the results ``pretty remarkable,'' a response
repeated by other intensive-care specialists, some of whom worry
that their ranks, numbering about 5,500 doctors nationwide, are not
growing while the demand for their services does.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works, it's a helpful supplement,'' said Dr. Tom
Rainey, a former president of the Society of Critical Care
Medicine, who is now director of the intensive-care unit at
Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. ``But there is some abuse
potential if it is converted into a system that replaces physicians
at the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Rod Hochman, chief medical officer of the Sentana Health
System of Norfolk, Va., which has expressed interest in the system,
said, ``Doctors with patients in an intensive-care unit do not want
to lose control of their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld and Breslow insist that on-site workers will have
final authority over recommendations from the monitoring team. They
said the standardized care their system encouraged was their
strongest sales point.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether the system will be adopted
elsewhere. ``From our standpoint, the No. 1 concern is quality _
saving lives, improving health and doing it quickly,'' said Chris
Stenzel, director of development for Kaiser Permanente, the managed
care organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're impressed with it,'' he said. But he added that he would
not try the system without more evidence of success. ``With any new
approach, especially in life-and-death situations, you don't want
to go in and start making changes without solid evidence,'' he
said. ``Physicians are trained to look at hard data. That could
make a big difference for us.''

A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CAROLINE'S GRIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to fix slug)

By CATHERINE MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waiting was the hardest part.
</P>
<P>
   The call came on an August afternoon almost 18 years ago, while
I worked at my usual place on the city desk of a midsize
Pennsylvania newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cath, are you sitting down?'' my brother Michael wanted to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Michael can be a prankster, so I responded a little impatiently.
At 3 p.m., deadline was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' Mike said. ``I want you to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear began to tighten its grip at my throat. Mike never called
me at work. Something was very wrong. Was it my niece? My
2-month-old nephew? His devastating news came out in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, our 23-year-old brother, Rob, had been fishing
with four of his buddies in two small motorboats after a softball
game. A man in a much larger boat ran into them, so drunk he didn't
know there had been a crash, dragging at least one victim in his
wake. He stopped only when his motor gave out.
</P>
<P>
   Rob's body was missing in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad and I think you should come home,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   Time came to a blurry, chilly stop. I stumbled over to the
newspaper's library, a large, private room off the newsroom. In the
following moments, someone escorted me to the publisher's office on
another floor. A call was made to the Wyandotte Police Department,
then the Michigan Coast Guard. The newspaper's publisher, an
influential member of the fifth estate, was on the phone demanding
information about the accident that had occurred the night before
in the waters of the Detroit River involving Robert James McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the background, someone was making arrangements for
my flight home to Detroit. The personnel manager was dispatched to
the bank to get some money for my trip.
</P>
<P>
   Then these sobering words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your brother and his friend were in his boat, the two other
guys in a boat next to them. A large boat, a cabin cruiser, ran
over your brother's boat. The other three boys are alive, although
one of them is in intensive care. Your brother's body is missing.
The other boys can only recall seeing Rob struggling in the water.
Then nothing after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police and the Coast Guard are searching along the banks.
The Coast Guard is considering calling in divers. No decision has
been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike and my dad met me at the airport gate. I had a million
questions. They had few answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do now is wait and hope,'' my dad told me.
</P>
<P>
   Off-shore accident. Missing. Water.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   I identify with many of the words used last week in the intense
coverage of the plane accident that left a brother and two sisters
lost in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   I kept a vigil at the television set, watching as the Kennedys
came out to take a Sunday stroll on the beach, reading about how
they flew kites on Sunday, when it was still early enough to hope.
I couldn't stop thinking about Caroline and her pain in losing a
beloved brother.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to draw serenity from the water, the early morning
sails while they waited for news.
</P>
<P>
   That long ago summer, I stood at the river's edge, looking out
into the water, watching, waiting, hoping for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could he be unconscious somewhere? Just hurt and waiting on
the shore for someone to come and find him?'' my 8-year-old son
asked earlier last week about John F. Kennedy Jr. ``Isn't he a good
swimmer?'' he wanted to know. ``Could they still be alive?'' The
same questions, the same words that once haunted me.
</P>
<P>
   It would be four days before my family knew what happened to
Rob. Walking searches of the banks each day and two dives by the
Coast Guard came up empty. The search was called off each night at
dark, leaving me feeling powerless and angry. How could they stop
searching when he's out there somewhere? He might be fighting for
his life in that water, holding on, at that very moment.
</P>
<P>
   The second day into the search, I took an afternoon nap. I
dreamed I was standing on the shoreline when Rob walked up from the
water. I watched as he moved closer to me and made his way to the
surface. I woke up crying with relief.
</P>
<P>
   Friends gathered each day at Rob's house to wait for news,
comforting us with funny stories about him. We cuddled and played
with my 2-year-old daughter, Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedy children have a way of keeping things light during
this period of waiting,'' a family spokesman said on Sunday.
``Children have a way of keeping us all distracted during difficult
times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the crash, every phone call brought renewed
hope that Rob was still alive. They'll find him, I tried to
convince myself. He's an athlete. He's strong. He's a survivor.
He'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   But with the turn of each new dawn, the inevitable became harder
to ignore. I wanted news. Any news. I wanted the waiting to be
over.
</P>
<P>
   After three days, the Coast Guard called off the search _
something about budget problems and funding.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, four days after he was killed, the phone rang at
Rob's house. An area police department had received a report of a
body that had washed ashore downriver. The wallet held a Michigan
driver's license registered to Robert James McMahon. Someone was
needed to identify the body.
</P>
<P>
   I never saw the body. Reports indicated that the water had left
it badly decomposed. Yet a measure of relief washed over me, before
the unspeakable grief set in. The waiting, at least, was over.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly two years for me to obtain all the details of the
crash, but I searched out every one. I had to have answers, no
matter how painful they were. How did the other boys escape? Why
didn't Rob swim to safety? Why had Rob been the only one to perish
in the water? The autopsy reports revealed that Rob's arm had been
broken when his body became caught in the bigger boat's motor. He
couldn't swim.
</P>
<P>
   It took years to meander my way through the grief of losing my
brother so abruptly. The pain never ends, it just softens and
changes. I remember how Rob loved the water. How proud he was the
day he showed me his new boat. One of our happiest times together
was spent two months before he died. We took the boat over to the
Canadian shore for a day of diving and swimming. We had a picnic on
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Water has come to signify serenity in my life. The beach in
wintertime is my favorite place. The initial, violent image of a
brother thrashing to stay alive is now a vision of peace, of
floating in soothing waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found the women,'' a colleague informed me on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting, at least, was over.

ROBOT CRAFT TO COZY UP TO ASTEROID FOR STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nine months of cruising through space testing
new technology for future missions, a robot spacecraft with a mind
of its own is closing in for a very close encounter with a small
asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, called Deep Space 1, is bearing down on the
asteroid for a swift flyby early Thursday that will hopefully
include picture-taking and remote scans to disclose its chemical
composition.
</P>
<P>
   Unmanned space vehicles have visited and photographed only four
of the thousands of asteroids that inhabit the solar system, and
researchers say this encounter will be the most difficult ever
attempted. Asteroids are believed to be remnants of the early
formation of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is known about the target asteroid, an elongated
potato-shaped piece of rock and rubble estimated to be only about a
mile in diameter that was discovered in 1992. Until Monday, the
target was known by its unceremonious catalog name of 1992 KD.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Planetary Society of Pasadena, Calif., announced
that the new name for 1992 KD would be Asteroid Braille, the result
of a contest that drew more than 500 entries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Following an inventor theme, the name honors Louis Braille, the
19th-century blind French educator who developed the system of
raised-dot printing and writing named for him.
</P>
<P>
   If the spacecraft properly maneuvers itself to find the tiny
asteroid in the vastness of space, the craft will dash by the rocky
body at about 35,000 miles per hour while passing less than nine
miles from its surface, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   This near approach, which should occur at about 12:46 a.m. EDT
at a point about 118 million miles from Earth, would be the closest
any spacecraft has come to a body in the solar system without
landing on it, they said. No previous asteroid flyby has come
closer than 750 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really challenging encounter and it may not work,''
said Dr. Marc D. Rayman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., the chief mission engineer. ``We didn't build
DS-1 to be an asteroid flyby spacecraft. The focus of the
spacecraft is testing technologies. This is a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid is the smallest body in the solar system ever
studied up close by a spacecraft, Rayman said. Astronomers know so
little about it and its orbit that they cannot predict its exact
location with the precision normally desired for such an encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1, a 1,000-pound craft jammed with miniature
instruments and other devices, was launched on Oct. 24, 1998, by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to trouble-shoot
12 innovative technologies that could be used by future spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Among the technologies aboard is an autonomous navigation system
that lets the spacecraft guide itself, a miniature integrated
camera and imaging spectrometer for determining the composition of
distant objects, a combination ion and electron spectrometer,
advanced software with artificial intelligence that lets the
spacecraft manage its own mission as situations change, a new type
of solar-power array, and a variety of diverse, low-power
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The innovation that has drawn the most attention is the craft's
propulsion system, a solar-electric ion engine that nudges it
through space by producing a tiny amount of thrust. Ion propulsion
has been tested in space before, but it had never been a
spacecraft's primary drive.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than burning fuel like conventional rockets, the ion
engine electrically charges its xenon gas fuel to create high-speed
particles that exit the engine so fast that they produce thrust in
very small amounts. The energized particles, called ions,
accelerate out of the engine using the pull of two
oppositely-charged metal grids, producing about one-250th of a
pound of thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Following some problems at the beginning of the mission, the ion
motor has performed almost flawlessly, including thrusting without
a break for six weeks. During about 75 days of firing so far,
Rayman said, the ion drive has used only about 25 pounds of the 186
pounds of xenon fuel aboard, enough to increase the spacecraft's
speed _ which is 60,000 mph _ by 1,600 mph.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rayman said 11 of the technologies aboard Deep Space 1 have
completed testing and validation, while the 12th, the automatic
navigation system, or AutoNav, had accomplished 95 percent of its
goals. Negotiating the asteroid encounter would be its final test,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft's primary mission, with a budget of $152 million
that includes $42 million in launching costs, ends in September
unless NASA elects for an extension, which is being considered.
Under an extended mission, the probe would fly on to meet a dying
comet know as Wilson-Harrington in January 2001, and then continue
on for a September swing by the comet Borrelly, one of the most
active to visit the inner solar system regularly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last technologies to be tested was artificial
intelligence software called Remote Agent, which completed its
validation last month by independently operating parts of the
spacecraft, and diagnosing and correcting a series of simulated
problems, with minimum direction from ground controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the spacecraft's primary mission _ testing
equipment _ did not require the asteroid encounter, but NASA
officials felt that technology missions like this should try to
deliver some scientific results, said Dr. Robert M. Nelson, the
head scientist on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will need many small, inexpensive missions _ like
those that can be based on Deep Space 1 technology _ to solve the
riddle of the asteroid belt found between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter, Nelson said. ``There are 10,000 asteroids out there that
we have to sample and we've only looked at four so far,'' he said.
``We have to find better, more efficient ways to do it if we are
going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the asteroid encounter depends on the precision
of AutoNav, which uses the spacecraft's multifunction camera to
take pictures of stars with asteroids in the background. The
spacecraft uses this information for reference points to infer its
position and to navigate itself, including the ability to adjust
its course and decide how close it will come to an asteroid or
comet.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Deep Space 1 needs to know where Asteroid Braille is
before the flyby, but might not locate it until the day before the
encounter. ``So, we are counting on the spacecraft getting itself
to the right place at the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The entire encounter will be under the spacecraft's direction,
as it constantly changes its pointing direction and exposure times
for picture-taking as it speeds by the asteroid. The
black-and-white pictures, infrared spectrum data on chemical
composition and other information will be sent to Earth hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the camera that takes readings in ultraviolet
wavelengths has failed, scientists said, preventing the collection
of some useful data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know for hours if we have anything and it will take
several days to download and examine the data,'' Nelson said.
Scientists hope to determine the shape and size of Braille, and to
learn about its terrain, mineral content, the degree to which its
surface reflects light and any magnetic field it might have.
</P>
<P>
   Rayman noted that Deep Space 1 was the first installment in a
program to validate unusual technologies that could be used in more
efficient and cheaper spacecraft. People planning new missions are
sometimes reluctant to try untested but promising technology, he
said, and projects like Deep Space 1 build confidence in these new
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already done most of what we set out to do with Deep
Space 1,'' Rayman said, ``and it's exciting to add some science to
these accomplishments.''

WHEN THE MIT ARTIST SHOUTS, HIS `PAINTING' LISTENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)  
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within the art world, professor John Maeda, 32, is an anomaly _
a prize-winning graphic designer and kinetic artist with a fistful
of engineering degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   From his base in MIT's Media Laboratory, where he is the Sony
Career Development Professor of Media Arts and Sciences and directs
the Aesthetics and Computation Group, Maeda uses the computer as a
tool and medium to create art that can be produced only digitally
and that has the specific look of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best-known pieces is a drawing called ``Time Paint,''
in which colors fly through space. Another piece, ``The Reactive
Square,'' is about squares that change shape when a viewer shouts
at them.
</P>
<P>
   Maeda's computer-generated art pieces have been shown at the
Ginza Gallery in Tokyo and in that great digital art gallery _ the
World Wide Web. We talk in his dark computer-filled Cambridge
offices on an otherwise sunny summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your last book, ``Design By Numbers,'' (MIT Press) is an art
book that is also a manual for a new computer language that you
invented to help artists understand the guts of computer design.
Why create a whole new computer language?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Several reasons. I wanted to make a system that was free of
charge. Second, all the programming languages are in English.
Because this one is free and distributed on the Web, we are now
offering it in French, Spanish and German. It will soon be in
Korean and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The third reason was that programming languages are made for
people to write programs _ big applications.
</P>
<P>
   For someone just starting out making art on their computers,
they don't want this big Mack truck of a system. They just want a
simple bicycle that they understand.
</P>
<P>
   So I designed the visual equivalent of a simple bicycle. Design
by Numbers, DBN, was an attempt to demystify the technology behind
computer art, to show how simple it is, and that people can do it.
DBN can run directly within any Java-enabled Web browser. The Web
site address, by the way, is dbn.media.mit.edu.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you are creating your own computer art pieces, do you
ever use prepackaged drawing programs like Adobe?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yes, all the time. There are all kinds of fine touches
that prepackaged software makes easy. I could invent my own
finishing system, but this is faster. Of course, the basic ideas, I
create.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Yet, I sense you're scornful of Adobe users?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The problem is that most people can't just ``finish'' things
with it. They have to use it to start them, also. For much of
recent history, people have created with brush, ink, paper _ the
materials of art. Now that they have begun creating with software
and computers, the styles that emerge are homogeneous because the
software is universal.
</P>
<P>
   Without being able to know how to program, you can't break out
of the technology _ just like if you don't know how to use brush
and ink, you're limited.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, this really isn't a problem; they aren't
necessarily looking for anything new. But for people who are
seeking the next step, the prepackaged becomes an impossible
barrier to break free from.
</P>
<P>
   I make everything I do. Many people are surprised that I don't
have a programmer making things for me. And others are surprised
that I don't have an artist controlling me, telling me how to
program. Because today, people don't realize that it is possible to
think and create on the computer. Artists are used to thinking that
programming is very hard _ impossible.
</P>
<P>
   And technologists are used to thinking that they can never
become artists. Me, I just make things. It's just a natural flow of
action and thought. If people see, ``Oh, he does that.'' then maybe
they'll think, ``I can do it too.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: But lots of nonartists use computers for creating images . .
.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: They are using it as a tool, but not as a material. And to
use it as a tool, you need to understand the medium, which means
understanding the technology. Young people are changing this,
because they have grown up with computers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a conventional artist produces an object on a computer,
does that automatically make it art?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: It's art, but it's just a painting and no different than
conventional art.
</P>
<P>
   It's not intrinsically different or superior just because it was
created digitally and it's not digital art. Because digital art
starts with an understanding and appreciation of the medium _
which, unfortunately, is today programming.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you were growing up in Seattle, what were your
aspirations?
</P>
<P>
   A: My aspirations were my father's _ and his were that all of us
kids would go to either Harvard or MIT He didn't know what or where
they were.
</P>
<P>
   He was a cook and a tofu maker by trade. These were the only two
schools he'd heard of. His were immigrants' dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I was very good at math and at drawing and I had a teacher
who said, ``You should go to MIT because it's a good place for
math.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the term artist ever come on your screen as a child?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of my teachers felt that I should become an artist, but
my parents looked down upon this because they pictured me as poor.
</P>
<P>
   So I got to MIT in 1984 _ a time when, all of a sudden, the
computer had become visual. There was a great demand on the campus
for people who could design icons, choose fonts. I worked at
different places on campus doing this type of work and I thought I
was so good at it. People used to tell me, ``maybe you should be a
graphic designer.'' I didn't know what that was. I only knew what
engineers, tofu makers, and Japanese restaurant owners did.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I saw this book, ``A Designer's Art,'' by Paul Rand and I
was shocked. Paul Rand did the IBM, ABC, UPS logos and I saw how
exquisite his power over space was and I realized I wanted to do
this. I told my father. He said, ``No way. You must be an
engineer.'' So I went on and got my bachelor's and my master's in
engineering, and once I did that, I told my father that I still
wanted to be an artist and he said, ``Now that you're a man, you
can do what you want.'' So I thought the very place to go was the
MIT Media Lab and I joined the Ph.D. program here.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you happy at the Media Lab?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Not happy, on two levels. The Media Lab was more a technology
place than an art place and I was constantly reminded of that fact.
I was fortunate to know Muriel Cooper, the design professor at the
lab, and she gave me the best advice, which was, ``Go away.'' So I
went away. I went Tsukuba University, the great classic design
school outside of Tokyo.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did studying in Japan teach you?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The most important thing was to not to be embarrassed about
who I was. I had always been embarrassed about coming from a
manual-labor family. In Japan, I was studying conventional art, and
I used my hands all the time. That made me feel in touch with my
human side, which I had lost when I came to MIT. I think the people
who make things in Japan are kind of elevated. There are television
shows there where cooks and noodle makers are shown as heroes. The
ordinary, well done, is celebrated. So, once I realized that I came
from a tradition that mattered to me, I gave up on technology and
swore it off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, my teacher at the art school asked, ``John, what
are planning on doing with your life?'' I said, ``Honor the
classics, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused me of being the Japanese equivalent of a horse's rear
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young, you should do things that are new. When
you're old you can always go back to the classics. They'll always
be there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, I went back to technology and rediscovered
everything. I became a sort of born-again technologist.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the new technology mean the end of art as we know it?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it does. It represents a new dimension to the way art
will be understood or perceived.
</P>
<P>
   It's a departure from appreciating a singular moment. What that
means is ... the reason why we can appreciate art is because most
art has a single resting point: canvas.
</P>
<P>
   It's painted. It's dried. It aspires to be perfect. The medium
of the computer is continually shifting. It can shift at will, in a
microsecond. Or an hour.
</P>
<P>
   There's no limit on how it can be taught to change.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the 1960s, there was a kind of avant-garde-technoart
movement that came out of Bell Labs. Do you like the abstract
technoart of the 60s?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Defiantly. Because they were pushing the limits of their
medium. They had a vision, but they didn't know how to make it
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   I like a computer artist named Michael Noll, who was a Bell Labs
scientist. He could make all these things, but he didn't know what
they were and didn't know how to contextualize them. Karl Gerstner,
whom I respect the most, was a visionary artist/designer, who
foresaw the potential of computers, but didn't know how to realize
them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this mean that the artists of the future will all be
going to MIT.?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I think artists of the future will have to go to better art
schools, which will teach them how to control technology instead of
being controlled by it. MIT is one option. One of the things that
brought me back to MIT was the idea that engineering will be the
humanities of the 21st century. I believe there is room in this
world for a humanist technologist.

IS THE MAN IN YOUR LIFE MAKING YOU SICK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real men roast hot dogs, broil burgers and sear steaks over hot,
smoky grills in the good ol' summertime.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not be doing you much of a favor when they assume
outdoor cooking chores. In fact, the man in your life may be making
you sick, the American Dietetic Association says.
</P>
<P>
   Most men don't take care to follow all the proper grilling
guidelines to prevent food-borne illness, also known as food
poisoning, the association found in a recent survey of 565
households.
</P>
<P>
   Men don't use meat thermometers. They don't wash their hands
during food preparation at a picnic site. They don't clean the
cooler with soap and water between uses.
</P>
<P>
   What they do do is use the same tongs and turning forks for raw
and cooked foods, wiping them only with a paper towel between uses.
They leave leftovers out for snacking later, and carry coolers in
the trunks of their cars rather than in the air-conditioned
insides. All of these practices break food-safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, women are guilty of the same offenses. But according
to the survey, men who cook outdoors are less careful than women.
And, men are more likely to be involved in outdoor food
preparation, where food safety is often thrown to the wind, says
Joan Horbiak, a registered dietitian and national spokeswoman for a
new three-year public-health initiative to raise consumer awareness
about home food safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when evaluating their own summertime food-safety record,
most men (78 percent) give themselves an average or below-average
grade,'' Horbiak notes.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, sponsored jointly by the American Dietetic
Association and the ConAgra Foundation in conjunction with their
``Home Food Safety: It's in Your Hands'' campaign, found that more
education didn't mean more food-safety savvy, Horbiak says.
</P>
<P>
   The dietetic association recommends four easy steps that go a
long way toward assuring food safety, no matter who's doing the
grilling:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash hands often.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep raw meats and ready-to-eat foods separate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cook meat to proper temperature.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refrigerate promptly to below 40 degrees (most household
refrigerators are set for 40 degrees; it may not be enough to set
leftovers back into an ice chest where most of the ice has melted).
</P>
<P>
   ``Using a meat thermometer takes less than 20 seconds. It should
be an automatic habit _ like fastening your seat belt. Tell your
husband it's a grilling gadget. Guys love gadgets. Don't tell him
it's for safety. Tell him if he uses a meat thermometer, his burger
won't taste like a hockey puck,'' Horbiak advises.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If the bacteria don't get you, the charred edges might.
</P>
<P>
   Undercooking meat has always been a concern in food safety, but
in recent years, overcooking _ especially burning and charring
meat, chicken and fish on the backyard grill _ is being linked to a
more long-term health threat.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at the American Institute for Cancer Research have been
urging consumers to curb possible cancer risks by pre-cooking in a
microwave to reduce the time and temperature needed to grill meat,
removing any fat that may drip onto flames and cause flare-ups, and
using tongs to turn meat without piercing it, which also causes
flares.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say the most effective means to make grilling safer
may be a quick dose of marinade.
</P>
<P>
   Even a brief bath in the simplest of marinades can impede the
formation of heterocyclic amines (HCAs), carcinogenic compounds
that normally result when meat is cooked at high temperatures,
particularly when it is charred, institute researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The heat of flame cooking causes creatine, a compound within
muscle meats, to react with amino acids and produce HCAs.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how marinating inhibits this process is not known, but
scientists believe the acidity in most marinades plays a large
role, says Melanie Polk, director of nutrition education for the
institute, a nonprofit foundation dedicated to exploring the link
between diet and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Most marinades combine an acidic component, such as lemon juice,
orange juice or vinegar, with herbs and onion, garlic or soy sauce.
(Traditional marinades also include oil, but many health-conscious
chefs leave it out to lower fat and create less smoke.)
</P>
<P>
   In repeated trials, researchers marinated beef, pork, chicken
and fish for varying lengths of time prior to grilling. Using a
variety of standard recipes, they found that the marinated foods
had 92 percent to 99 percent fewer HCAs than their nonmarinated
counterparts. It made no difference whether they were marinated for
40 minutes or two days.
</P>
<P>
   Polk says marinating should be done in a glass, plastic or
stainless-steel dish. She offers this recipe for a spicy chicken
marinade:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons liquid honey
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced ginger root
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes .MDBO/.MDNM/

 &HT;    Clinton Critic Hitchens Confounds Left and Right
 &HT;    Moving on (k) commentary wires.
 &HT;    By Susan E. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Christopher Hitchens, man of the moment in
post-impeachment Washington, is an unwelcome messenger from the
political left.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy who'll point out the elephant in the living room,
or in the case of
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, the donkey in the dining room. And he does it
better than the
</P>
<P>
   president's conservative critics, who urged his impeachment
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   That greatly confounds liberals and leftists alike. And that's
fine with Hitchens, a self-defined socialist.
</P>
<P>
   Since the publication of ``No One Left To Lie To: The
Triangulations of William
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson Clinton,'' Hitchens, a columnist with Vanity Fair and
The Nation, has been busy defending his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals in writing the book were to make people uncomfortable
with their
</P>
<P>
   illusions, to rub their noses in it. I like to do that, and it
needs doing. I could
</P>
<P>
   have written a book saying Newt Gingrich is a dirtbag, but
there's no struggle
</P>
<P>
   about that,'' Hitchens said during a free-ranging interview
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The unflinching book attempts to build a morally bankrupt bridge
between Clinton's personal behavior and his political betrayals _
from Lani Guinier, the nominee for assistant attorney general whom
he abandoned after her views on voting were criticized _ to Monica
Lewinsky, the intern with whom he had a secret sexual relationship
that he lied about.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens passionately argues that the ``protean'' Clinton has
neither courage nor
</P>
<P>
   conviction and that supporters who stooped to defend him were
duped.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledgements in the book, he writes: ``Thanks are due to
all those on the
</P>
<P>
   Left who saw the menace of Clinton, and who resisted the moral
and political
</P>
<P>
   blackmail which silenced and shamed the liberal herd.''
</P>
<P>
   Although all politicians use triangulation _ the art of
co-opting the opponent's
</P>
<P>
   message and claiming the mushy middle-of-the road position _
Clinton has taken thepolitical practice to a new level, according
to the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me with Clinton was that it wasn't just a tactic,
it was the whole
</P>
<P>
   strategy. It was a means to getting somewhere. It's like saying,
'Why does someone cross the road? Because he wants to get to the
middle.' The other thing that got me was that it was a covert
action that depended on Dick Morris, one of the most unscrupulous
people around.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, a Republican strategist, resigned as Clinton's advisor
adviser in 1996
</P>
<P>
   when a tabloid detailed his relationship with a prostitute.
Morris' close personal
</P>
<P>
   and professional relationship with Clinton indicts both men,
Hitchens insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe the private stuff matters. I'm old-fashioned that
way. The private
</P>
<P>
   stuff matters analytically because it's made Clinton hostage to
(people like
</P>
<P>
   Morris).
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the people who say the personal isn't political have to
deal with the fact
</P>
<P>
   that Morris worked for Jesse Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Monica political daze, Hitchens' book has struck
either a raw nerve or
</P>
<P>
   a responsive chord, and has made him both celebrated and
vilified. His name appears frequently, often in snide references,
in The Washington Post and political
</P>
<P>
   publications.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens has been lambasted for factual errors in the book,
which he has owned up to, and for exposing confidential sources,
which he defends. But he says the
</P>
<P>
   vitriol surrounding the book, which has been out a few months,
has largely
</P>
<P>
   subsided.
</P>
<P>
   However, the author acknowledges that the book may irritate some
people because it offers no political solutions. But constructive
criticism is not his
</P>
<P>
   job, especially when it comes to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The American political system in which residents have only two
viable parties to
</P>
<P>
   choose from is partly to blame for the election of Clinton, who
many still view as
</P>
<P>
   the lesser of two political evils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to include in the book an essay I wrote for Dissent
magazine during the
</P>
<P>
   1996 campaign. It was an attack on the theory of lesser evil.
People literally take
</P>
<P>
   that theory as if it were literal truth... But it's a surrender.
It's political
</P>
<P>
   impotence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens' message may make many people uncomfortable. But that's
no reason to shoot the messenger, because much of what he says is
the untriangulated truth.

TEAM OF SCIENTISTS TO PREPARE A ROLODEX OF LIFE ON EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A group of countries has decided to prepare ``the
equivalent of a world telephone book of life on earth,'' a project
that promises to revolutionize the study of biology and influence
international environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem surprising,'' said Dr. James Edwards, an assistant
director at the National Science Foundation in Washington and one
of the scientists involved in the project, but there is no single
place that has recorded the scientific names of all species that
have been named.
</P>
<P>
   The project, he added, will include the creation of a catalog of
all named organisms, in effect a catalog of life. ``It will be a
fantastic resource for everybody,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   But the main thrust is the creation of a worldwide electronic
information network called the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility. Scientists hope it will become the single database that
pools all the recorded but widely scattered data about the earth's
animals, plants and microorganisms. The database is to be made
accessible via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the facility is to start this year. It is being launched
under the aegis of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, a Paris-based research group that encompasses the 29
most industrialized nations. Science ministers from the
organization approved the plan in June and specialists, with an
initial budget of $3 million, this month began setting up a
secretariat and work program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will mean that biodiversity information will finally move
from the cuneiform tablet to the computer screen,'' said Dr. Tom
Lovejoy, chief biodiversity adviser to the World Bank and one of
the planners of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``People doing molecular biology or gene sequencing started in
an era where they automatically used electronic systems,'' he said.
``Natural history began hundreds of years ago and has stayed
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The designers of the network say it should be a boon not only to
biology students and researchers but also to poor nations that are
rich in species but have small or no species collections of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the world's plant and animal species occur in
developing countries, almost all significant natural history
collections are in rich northern Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is scattered in dozens of centers, in museums,
universities, in journals, drawers and card files,'' Lovejoy said.
``The idea is to put all this together and make it available to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The global network is to include both the domestic biodiversity
of each participating country and the data about its stored
materials that have been collected around the world. Designers say
the database will have to be flexible enough to adapt as science
gains a greater understanding of organisms and redefines
categories.
</P>
<P>
   A number of countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada and
the United States, already have online programs offering biological
information on their main domestic species, but even in these
countries the biodiversity inventories are not complete. Moreover,
many of the world's historical collections, like those in Britain,
France, Germany and Russia, often dating back to the 18th century,
have not been entered into computer records.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the British Natural History Museum, which owns
one of the world's largest collections, only a few of its millions
of specimens have so far been put into computer catalogs. Museum
officials say the task is daunting and that it costs about $5 per
specimen to enter it into the new, digitized databank.
</P>
<P>
   The network will not compile or organize its own species
inventories but will pull together the databases being created at
national and local levels in many countries. ``A lot of countries
are very interested in getting all their collections up in
digitized form and accessible to everyone,'' Edwards said. ``Quite
a few want to use this initiative to get the ball rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   But weaving together existing records will be complex. ``The
databases that exist are very diverse and not based on common
methods,'' said Michael Oborne, an OECD economist who is involved
in designing the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work out an agreed road map so that all the systems
become compatible,'' Oborne said. ``It will be like creating a
world telephone book with the same codes. You want collections that
match seamlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other complications. In the past, different countries
and cultures have developed different methods of classifying or
naming species and definitions vary widely. In addition, many
species have duplicate names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what we'll have to do is to come up not only with the
named species but also all their synonyms,'' Edwards said. ``Now
that we try to computerize things, we'll have to weed out the
ambiguity that exists. This will be of value not only to scientists
but also to policy makers. If people prepare a new law, say to
protect a species, there can be no ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The databases that will jointly make up the global center will
remain the property of the institutions that own and provide the
data and link them to the Internet. ``This seemed more appropriate
and more practical than starting a single central database for
biological information from scratch,'' Oborne said.
</P>
<P>
   The center will have its own secretariat and a small staff.
Several countries are bidding for the seat and have offered
accommodations, but the final decision is still pending. The $3
million budget is expected to grow in the next few years and will
be provided by the member countries.
</P>
<P>
   During the preparatory meetings in June, several countries said
they did not want the new center to compete with other
international programs compiling biological information, including
the Clearing-House Mechanism for recording species, created as part
of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the mechanism, tailored to the least advanced
countries, was intended to be little more than an archive and has
been slow in starting. ``An understanding has been reached that
this new facility will get moving and concentrate on digitizing all
the information,'' Oborne said. ``The idea is not to duplicate or
compete but to help the Clearing-House Mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental point, he continued, is to help provide a
measuring stick for basic questions on the world's species. Among
the questions: Are new species evolving? Are many being lost? What
exists today?
</P>
<P>
   The center will have an open-ended membership. After the richer
countries provide the data and pay for the infrastructure, poorer
countries will be able to join, but will be allowed to pay lower
fees.
</P>
<P>
   This will provide people who have access to computers with a
large online reference that will include images and details of
their domestic specimens, now housed in museums, libraries and zoos
of the rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   Economic planners and industry, including pharmaceutical
companies that do biological prospecting, also may find the data
useful, the project backers believe.
</P>
<P>
   But the most challenging part will be the next stage, the
``vertical links,'' said Dr. Stefan Michalowski, one of the
planners, ``when the project will try to link the species databases
with others dealing with soil, climate, human populations and the
like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you want to know the effect of a pesticide on some
species,'' he continued. ``Then you should be able to see what
climates the species live in, what else is part of that ecosystem
and how all that will be affected by the chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   The vertical links ``will be the most worthwhile, but
horrendously difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that it will take several years for the first
phase of the project to go on line. The broader project is expected
to grow and evolve indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   But even in its embryonic phase, the project will make an
enormous difference, said Edwards. ``Right now, if I wanted to know
all the specimens of a particular bird,'' he said, ``I would have
to write to all the museums that may have a specimen, then go to
the museums myself and look at labels and cards. Our initial focus
is to get the data from the tags and the drawers into the computer

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Twohy, who had polio as a child, needs to use a
wheelchair most of the day, and the list of little things that are
hard to do in a wheelchair is just about endless. But she has a
friend, Ike, who helps out.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up things she drops, turns light switches on and off,
puts clothes in the dryer and takes the dishes out of the
dishwasher, sorts the recyclables and brings her the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that Ike can't do that would be really nice
would be to drive the car,'' said Ms. Twohy, director of disability
services for Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, N.J. Ike does
have a license, but it's a dog license.
</P>
<P>
   For close to 70 years, blind people have been assisted by guide
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people with physical disabilities are getting the same kind
of help from ``service dogs'' specially trained to make up for
limitations in mobility, coordination or strength.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Carroll, a lawyer for the Paralyzed Veterans of America,
said demand for service dogs had grown ever since the Americans
With Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, helped bring more people
with disabilities into the work force and out into their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what service dogs do are just energy-saving things,''
said David Manzo, the director of development for Canine Partners
for Life, a nonprofit organization in Cochranville, Pa., which
trains and places 15 to 20 dogs a year. ``They help disabled people
get more hours out of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Training a service dog takes two years and about $15,000, an
amount handled entirely by private financing. Ms. Carroll said she
was not aware of any insurance company that covered their costs.
</P>
<P>
   However, a 1996 study published in The Journal of the American
Medical Association described service dogs as ``an economically
sound and efficacious option that improved quality of life and
allowed disabled people to work more and rely less on paid
household assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Labradors and retrievers or mixes of the two are the favored
breeds for service dogs, said Rob Manaseri, the director of
development for Canine Companions for Independence, a national
network of five centers that placed more than 170 dogs last year.
</P>
<P>
   The first year of training is spent letting the puppy be a
puppy, although the volunteers who raise them are asked to get them
accustomed to as many different settings as possible. In the second
year, Manzo said, they move into the kennels, where the first six
months are spent on basic commands.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to guide dogs or service dogs, Manaseri's group
trains hearing dogs, which alert deaf people to important sounds
like ringing phones and crying children.
</P>
<P>
   Some experiments have been conducted using service monkeys with
people whose disabilities are too severe to allow them to work with
dogs, Manzo said. But the idea has not gone far, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs are usually retired after about eight years on the job.
There's an overlap period with their replacements, during which
``generally the old dogs teach the young ones new tricks,'' Manzo
said. Dogs that are retired are kept either by their original
recipients or go back to the families that raised them.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing differences in training, Manzo said that guide dogs
were taught to disobey commands that appeared to be leading a blind
people into danger while service dogs spent the last six months of
their training learning how to respond to the special needs of
their recipients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Manzo said, just one of his group's disabled
clients has an artificial leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says it's as easy to misplace the leg as it is to forget
where you put your shoes last night,'' Manzo said. ``So his dog had
to learn the command, `Go find my leg!'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Twohy said that her dog, Ike, a yellow Labrador, had learned
to position himself in just the right place and to brace himself to
support her when she stood up. ``He also wipes his own paws when he
comes in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to come up with new tasks for him to master, in part
because she can feel his pride in his accomplishments, a pride she
shares. ``It's not a pet type relationship at all _ we're a team,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of myself as the master, I think of myself as
the alpha dog,'' Ms. Twohy said. ``I spend a lot of my time making
sure he's safe and well cared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ann Dubecky, the canine coordinator and an instructor at
the Canine Companions for Independence center in Farmingdale, N.Y.,
said that team concept was the most important point to get across
to recipients during training.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not robots, they're dogs,'' Ms. Dubecky said. ``And
they each have their own personality. A lot of what makes for
success is learning about the individual nature of the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she has seen a tremendous benefit in the attention that
disabled people receive when they go out in public with their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people see somebody in a wheelchair and shy
away,'' she said. ``But when you add a dog to that picture, people
will come right up and talk to them. It can be a help to their
self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Twohy, however, the main benefit is something much
simpler: ``He's allowed me to keep working,'' she said.

WOMEN'S TENNIS ENJOYING NEW POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHELLE SMITH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sex, power, money and conflict. It's not
politics. It's not Hollywood. It's women's professional tennis at
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   If the late, great days of Billie Jean King and Chris Evert were
about backhands and breaking barriers, this is the era of magazine
covers, tabloid stories, ego and image. All that and the most
physical and aggressive tennis in the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even to those of us who've been around for a long time, this
is the strongest that women's tennis has ever been,'' said former
player and current television analyst Pam Shriver. ``There's even
the soap opera thing going on as well and it all adds up to a lot
of ink right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And unprecedented popularity. Attendance at women's tour events
is at record levels. Television ratings are stronger than they've
been in years. Prize money is increasing. Any number of players can
end up in a tournament final, producing competitive, entertaining
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the men's game, people really appreciate the
talent of the women players and the style of play. The rallies are
longer, there's more serve and volley,'' said Peter Tatum,
tournament director for the Bank of the West Classic, which runs
Monday through next Sunday at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rivalries and emerging superstars. There's a lot to
sell and people are buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The business world isn't as sold as the fan base. The Women's
Tennis Association tour is struggling to secure a title sponsor, a
task that would seem easy in the game's present atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of top players overflows with a combination of
ability and personality and covers virtually every demographic.
</P>
<P>
   There are the requisite teen-age sensations _ Martina Hingis,
Venus and Serena Williams, Anna Kournikova, and now 18-year-old
Wimbledon qualifier-turned-semifinalist Alexandra Stevenson.
Talented veteran players like No. 1-ranked Lindsay Davenport, Jana
Novotna and Mary Pierce and fading superstars in Steffi Graf and
Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, women's tennis is just rockin','' said Nike's Skip
Lei, the company's business director for tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, the women's game was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Seles had been stabbed on the court and was out of the game,
Jennifer Capriati had gone from a prodigy to the nation's most
famous juvenile delinquent, and Graf dominated virtually every
tournament but couldn't enjoy it fully because her father was in a
German jail for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is cyclical, but the last low point was pretty
low,'' Shriver said.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to today.
</P>
<P>
   The father of Venus and Serena Williams is a controversial quote
machine, but he's raised two of the most physically imposing
players the game has ever known. Hingis alternates her brilliance
on the court with displays of arrogance and fits of pique.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova is a worldwide sex symbol with paparazzi in her wake
but without a tournament victory. Meanwhile Graf is on her farewell
tour and Seles probably isn't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   And on a day-to-day basis, any one of them could beat the other.
</P>
<P>
   The sporting public has responded.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at WTA events is up 14 percent this year over last
year, which concluded with a record total of 3.6 million fans.
Eleven tournaments have reported record attendance and that number
might just jump to 12 after the Bank of the West. The tournament
drew better than 42,000 people over six days in 1998 and ticket
sales are well ahead of last year's event.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam television ratings for the women are up
significantly. At the French Open, the Hingis-Graf final on NBC
rated 35 percent higher than 1998's final.
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon final ratings were up 59 percent from 1998 for the
match between Davenport and Graf. The title match on Centre Court
was the highest-rated Grand Slam women's final since 1993. ESPN is
earning a .8 average rating for its telecasts, the highest number
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The players have broken out of the tennis bubble and into the
mainstream culture, lured by a treasure chest of endorsement
opportunities and sometimes pushed by their agents and the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis appeared on the cover of GQ magazine and in the British
version Elle just last month. Serena Williams is featured in an
upcoming issue of Shape. After winning Wimbledon, Davenport did the
New York media blitz, appearing on the ``Today'' show and ``Late
Show with David Letterman.'' Kournikova is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love the exposure,'' said Joe Favorito, the WTA's vice
president of communications. ``They've bought into the benefits and
have been extremely cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Lei believes the mainstream attention is more than beneficial.
It's crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They key to the kingdom is that your sport has to be
integrated into popular culture,'' Lei said. ``If not, you're just
another sport in a sea of sports.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jet-stream winds from the northwest will direct another mound of
slightly cooler and noticeably drier air from the Great Lakes into
the Northeast. The leading edge of the more comfortable air mass
will stretch along the northern Appalachians and into the Ohio
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer and somewhat humid air preceding the front will help
trigger a few thunderstorms across interior New England. There may
be a couple of storms in the central Appalachians, the remnants of
a cluster of storms from the upper Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and pleasant conditions will cover the central Great Lakes
as high pressure glides east from Michigan. The return flow of
humid air into the upper Mississippi Valley will produce some
clouds and scattered thundershowers. A complex of thunderstorms
will likely form early Tuesday in Missouri or Illinois and slowly
dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Readings near 100 degrees will be common in the central
Carolinas as bright sunshine returns to the region. Afternoon
thunderstorms will develop along the Gulf Coast and Florida as
sea-breeze fronts develop along the coasts and move inland during
the day. It will be rather hot in Texas and Oklahoma under sunny
skies.
</P>
<P>
   A more active monsoon will cause thunderstorms to grow over much
of the Southwest, including the deserts of southeast California.
Fog will hold its ground along the California coast. The Northwest
will be mainly sunny with light winds and well above seasonal
temperatures. The hot air will return to the northern Rockies as
readings rise toward 100 degrees in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Drought Paradox
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent paradox, it is not unusual for floods and
drought to co-exist. In West Virginia on Sunday, flash flood
warnings were issued in the same areas have that have their most
serious drought since the early 1950s. Storms developed in the
sultry air which produced 1 to 2 inches of rain in less than hour
at several spots. The excess water ran quickly into small streams,
but did little to penetrate into the deeper ground water supplies.
While isolated thunderstorms are possible each day this week, there
is no prospect of widespread steady rain that could bring drought
relief.

ASTRONOMERS ADOPT DOOMSDAY INDEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By ANAHAD S. O'CONNOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To help deal with public fascination _ and sometimes undue alarm
_ about possible threats from asteroids, astronomers have adopted a
scale that rates the likelihood that a particular asteroid or comet
will collide with Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A 0 indicates that there is no chance of impact and a 10 means
certain catastrophe on the scale, which was endorsed on July 22 by
the International Astronomical Union.
</P>
<P>
   The scale was created by Dr. Richard P. Binzel, professor of
Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and is named the Torino Impact Hazard
Scale, after the Italian city in which it was first proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The major benefit to the scale is that it can be used by both
the scientific community and the public in determining the
likelihood of an impact, Binzel said. ``Scientists haven't done a
very good job of communicating to the public the relative danger of
collision with an asteroid,'' he said, adding that he hoped the
scale would help astronomers ``clearly inform but not confuse or
unnecessarily alarm the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The astronomical community was embarrassed last year by the
mixed signals it gave about asteroid 1997 XF11. An early prediction
that it would pass within 30,000 miles of Earth and could actually
strike it inspired doomsday headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But a day later, new data showed the asteroid would pass no
closer than 600,000 miles. On the Torino scale, that asteroid would
have been a mere category 1, Binzel said.
</P>
<P>
   On the scale, objects in the white zone _ 0 and 1 _ will not
collide with Earth or are so small they will disintegrate in
Earth's atmosphere. Asteroids or comets in the green, yellow and
orange zones _ from 2 to 7 _ are categorized as ``events meriting
careful monitoring'' to ``threatening events.'' In the red zone _
from 8 to 10 _ are objects capable of causing local, regional or
global devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid that scientists believe collided with the Earth 65
million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs would receive a 10 on
Binzel's scale. Of all the recorded near-Earth objects to date,
none would have received a score greater than 1.
</P>
<P>
   Recent movies like ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep Impact'' have
focused attention on the possibility of a catastrophic asteroid
impact. And when Shoemaker-Levy, a comet one-mile in diameter
collided with Jupiter several years ago, it released more energy
than the combined force of the world's nuclear arsenals, and proved
that such events can happen in this solar system.

 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By American Indian tradition, he is the Trickster, the most
cunning but also the most flawed and human of animal spirits. Noble
and godlike in some ways, he is also perverse, vain, deceitful,
larcenous, obsessed with sex, and a lover of pranks who repeatedly
blunders into trouble and gets his comeuppance, but always bounces
back.
</P>
<P>
   To ranchers in the West, he is nothing more than a despised
varmint to be hunted down and killed.
</P>
<P>
   To generations of movie and television viewers who have watched
the ``Roadrunner'' cartoons, he is Wile E. Coyote, the sneaky but
hapless hunter blown up, squashed or zapped in midair, only to show
up in the next frame, whole and ready to go again.
</P>
<P>
   Today, to paraphrase William Faulkner, the coyote has not just
survived _ it has prevailed. It has defied every effort to defeat
it _ hundreds of thousands of coyotes are deliberately and legally
killed every year _ and has literally taken over North America.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsurpassed display of adaptability in the face of human
dominance of the landscape, it has spread far beyond its original
range on the Western plains and northern Mexico, and now inhabits
wild lands, suburbs and cities from the Panama Canal to the edge of
the Canadian tundra and from New York City to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many coyotes exist; educated guesses range from
a million to tens of millions. But for sure, there are ``more now
than there have ever been, anywhere,'' said Dr. Russell Mason, a
federal wildlife expert in Utah whose task has been to help control
coyotes. The Trickster has not made it an easy job.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern United States, where coyotes did not live until
the 20th century, their trademark yip and howl have become
familiar. In the absence of wolves, they may have become the top
predator in the region _ including suburbs, where they think
nothing of having a cat for lunch or killing any dog they can; they
probably see it as a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the coyote is an ecological success story. Along with
the white-tailed deer, the moose and the red fox, it has
established itself as a champion adapter in an era when the ability
to adjust to changes brought about by humans has created a whole
new class of dominant large mammals.
</P>
<P>
   So what accounts for the coyote's extraordinary success? That is
one of the main questions pondered by scientists who are paying new
attention to what they see as a fascinating character. ``It's by
far the neatest animal I've ever worked with,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the answer may lie in the coyote's evolutionary
position among wild canids, or doglike predators. Roughly the size
and shape of a German shepherd, the coyote (the name comes from the
Aztec word ``coyotl'') fills an ecological niche between that of
the wolf and that of the fox. In fact, its very appearance and
behavior seem to combine features of both.
</P>
<P>
   Though smaller, more pointed of snout and more delicate of build
and features, it looks markedly like a wolf. And contrary to
earlier belief, it organizes itself in family-based packs dominated
by an alpha male and an alpha female, again like wolves. Field
researchers now know that coyotes hunting in concert can and often
do bring down animals as large as adult deer.
</P>
<P>
   But coyotes also have the beautiful bushy tail of the fox, and
their preferred prey and individual style of hunting are foxlike.
Both species dote on small mammals like mice, and both sneak up on
the prey like cats and strike with a cat's pounce.
</P>
<P>
   With the wolf's ability to attack and kill big prey and the
fox's feline stalk for small animals, the coyote is almost always
assured of finding something to eat. Its willingness to eat almost
anything gives it a further advantage. Analysis of coyote waste has
identified up to 100 different kinds of food. They gobble crickets,
apples, grass, even shoe leather, and they love to forage in
landfills. They also love watermelon; in Texas, they have become a
serious problem for watermelon growers.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the coyote's hardiness is that it evolved
originally in a harsh, arid climate where summer days are blazing
and nights are freezing. This enables it to adapt to a wide variety
of conditions, said Dr. Robert Crabtree, an independent Montana
ecologist, who with his wife, Jennifer Sheldon, has long studied
the species.
</P>
<P>
   But if nature equipped the coyote to survive, people have opened
the door for it to prevail. They have played to the coyote's
strength, for example, by chopping the forests of the eastern
United States into isolated fragments. The edges of the forest
fragments provide ideal habitat for small mammals, and their
populations have exploded, providing a coyote buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other types of animals, such as turtles and frogs,
coyotes are mobile enough to cross forest clearings, roads and
other barriers in search of food and breeding territory, and they
consequently thrive in human-altered environments.
</P>
<P>
   They are highly territorial, and the drive to strike out and
establish turf sends them aggressively into densely inhabited
cities and towns. And ``because they look so much like dogs, they
are actually able to move through areas relatively unnoticed,''
said Dr. Michael Klemens, director of the Metropolitan Conservation
Alliance, an arm of New York's Wildlife Conservation Society that
deals with regional wildlife issues.
</P>
<P>
   They have been spotted in New York City in recent years, most
recently in late March and early April, when the police cornered
and captured one in Central Park. Four years ago, a coyote lived in
Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, eating spaghetti with meatballs and
shrimp lo mein that a neighborhood couple brought.
</P>
<P>
   But feeding coyotes is not necessarily a good idea, since people
have sometimes been bitten by them, and some reports say this
happens when coyotes are fed. Coyotes also sometimes stalk people
from a distance or chase joggers. ``I think we'd be foolish'' to
ignore the possible danger, said Dr. Matthew Gomper, a behavioral
ecologist at Columbia University. But he added, ``We'd be foolish
to overplay the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way in which humans have increased the coyote's fortunes
is by exterminating wolves, which kept the coyote bottled up,
ecologically speaking. The demise of the wolf in most of the
contiguous 48 states liberated coyotes in two ways: Deer
populations exploded, providing more prey, and coyotes' most
important predator disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the canid hierarchy of primitive North America, wolves
dominated coyotes wherever the species coexisted. Wolves are easily
able to kill coyotes, and wolf packs do so whenever they can. This
has been vividly demonstrated in Yellowstone National Park, where a
reintroduced wolf population, according to Crabtree's studies, soon
reduced the coyote population by more than half (though it has
recovered somewhat).
</P>
<P>
   In the wild, coyotes consequently exist on the fringes of wolf
packs' territories; a trip to the core of wolf turf could bring
instant death. The same is true of the next step down the
hierarchical ladder: Foxes exist on the fringes of coyote
territory. ``Foxes are to coyotes as coyotes are to wolves,''
Gomper said.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree believes the coyote is resilient ``because it
co-evolved with a larger competitor that kills it.'' Having to look
out for wolves made coyotes more vigilant and more adept at evading
capture.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree tells the story of a male coyote he once tried to trap
in Washington state. He has caught some 300 coyotes in
rubber-padded leg-hold traps, put radio collars on them for
scientific study, and then released them. But this particular
coyote turned in a virtuoso performance in evasion.
</P>
<P>
   As Crabtree tells it, he first encountered the coyote when it
was trying to free its mate from the scientist's trap in
Washington. For the next four years, it seemed, the coyote taunted
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would do things like dig up my trap and flip it over,
unsprung,'' Crabtree said. ``One time he scraped the dirt off and
defecated on it without springing it.'' Another time, when the
scientist tried to drop a net on the coyote from a helicopter, it
jumped up and tried to bite the helicopter and then hid under
sagebrush. ``He was one smart guy.'' And he was never caught.
Another win for the Trickster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyotes think about things,'' Mason said. ``A coyote only
needs to be shown something once.''
</P>
<P>
   The coyote's evasion skills have frustrated efforts to control
its livestock predations (especially on sheep) by nonlethal means,
Mason said. Guard dogs, strobe-light alarm systems, aversion
strategies in which lamb meat is laced with substances to make the
coyote sick _ all have fallen short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried every possible method,'' said Bob Acord, the
administrator of the Agriculture Department's Wildlife Services
division, which is in charge of federal predator-control activity.
``They seem to adapt to any method.'' Often the authorities are
driven to their last resort: killing coyotes that kill livestock.
Altogether, Acord said, more than 350,000 coyotes are ``taken''
each year for this and other reasons, including fur harvest and
hunting for sport.
</P>
<P>
   If Crabtree is right, the killing may actually increase coyote
numbers in the long run. He believes coyotes produce more pups, and
more survive, when overall numbers drop. The theory is that when
older adult coyotes are killed, there is more food for the
survivors; pups are born stronger and have more to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree says that in Yellowstone, only about 30 percent of
coyote pups survived to adulthood before wolves were reintroduced;
now nearly three-quarters do.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if they are dominant, territorial adult coyotes are
killed, says Gomper, leaving younger, unattached coyotes freer to
form their own family groups _ and younger females tend to have
bigger litters.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to suggest that deliberate killing of coyotes is
counterproductive in the long term, and so it is controversial.
Mason disputes the Crabtree studies and says that in any case they
are ``situation specific'' and cannot be extended generally. In
Texas, he says, limiting the coyote population has actually
decreased litter size.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mason said, coyotes must sometimes be controlled in the
interest of nature's variety. ``If you have a lot of coyotes,'' he
said, ``you're not going to have a lot of other things.'' In the
West, for example, coyotes have depressed mule deer populations and
threatened re-establishment of the endangered black-footed ferret.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of biodiversity, he said, coyote populations in
ferret country need to be suppressed until the ferrets become
established: ``not forever, just now.'' The same thing holds true
in areas where mule deer have their fawns, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes also pose potential health problems. Mason said they
spread rabies from Mexico into Texas, where officials attacked the
problem by air-dropping bait laced with rabies vaccine. More than
90 percent of coyotes are believed to have been immunized in a
buffer zone designed to halt the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Easterners are now beginning to experience coyotes as Westerners
have for a long time; in Maine, coyotes are believed to have cut
substantially into deer populations. But there is a difference:
Eastern coyotes are bigger than Western ones. While a good-sized
Western coyote might weigh 35 pounds, Mason said, they can go up to
80 pounds in the East.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, scientists say, is probably widespread interbreeding
between coyotes and Eastern timber wolves, which still inhabit the
upper Great Lakes region and eastern Canada. (While wolf packs kill
coyotes, lone wolves looking for mates sometimes breed with them.)
</P>
<P>
   Do coyotes often mate with domestic dogs to produce what are
called coydogs? ``I don't think it is widespread,'' Gomper said.
``It may occur, but true cases of it occurring in the wild are
fairly rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomper and his colleagues are gearing up for a detailed study of
coyotes in the New York region, but already, he says, it is clear
that coyotes have arrived in packs in rural New England and New
York, where their calls in the evening and early morning indicate
that they are marking territorial boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   That may mean, Gomper said, that they have achieved such numbers
that population pressure is pushing their core territories ever
closer to humans. If so, he said, ``we'll be seeing more
interactions with humans and pets on a day-to-day basis.''

`WAR OF THE RATS': HUNTING THE HUNTER AT STALINGRAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Battle of Stalingrad, perhaps the single most critical and
certainly one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, is a great
setting for a historical thriller, and in ``War of the Rats'' David
L. Robbins has made good use of its potential. His story centers on
a duel to the death between two men: Chief Master Sgt. Vasily
Zaitsev, sniper extraordinaire of the Russian army, and a German SS
colonel named Heinz Thorvald, the Nazis' greatest marksman. When
Russian snipers led by Zaitsev begin to take a demoralizing toll of
German troops, picking them off like hunters shooting bears, the
high command in Berlin dispatches Thorvald to the battlefield with
orders to accomplish a single task: Kill Zaitsev.
</P>
<P>
   A deadly contest ensues, with Robbins skillfully building up
each of his protagonists as so deadly in their murderous crafts as
to acquire the dreadfulness of indomitability. The literary
archetype is easy to identify here. It is not David versus Goliath,
but Hector versus Achilles, the manly conflict of two equally
matched and equally remorseless adversaries. The story moreover is
based, Robbins writes in the introduction, on two real historical
figures, though it is unclear whether the real Zaitsev and Thorvald
engaged in the kind of duel described in ``War of the Rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, in other words, has written a readable, gritty
adventure story, a good candidate for the thriller of the summer
award. This is true even though he does not rise above the standard
mechanics of the genre, his writing workmanlike but verging on the
melodramatic. And his plot, while supposedly grounded in historical
verisimilitude, strains the bounds of plausibility. One can only
imagine what a John le Carre would have done with the promising
scheme that Robbins has invented, or perhaps the Mark Helprin of
``A Soldier of the Great War.'' As it is, Robbins has done well
enough, both to entertain and to teach us something about the
theater of havoc and death that Stalingrad was.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins opens with a German lieutenant named Hofstetter who
makes the mistake of tilting his head back to drink from a canteen
and is felled by a single shot from a distant rifle. We then meet
his killer, the Russian Zaitsev, who, before World War II, was a
hunter on the Siberian taiga, instructed by his grandfather in the
almost mystical and intuition-filled techniques of stalking. (``God
is about fear, a way to make you afraid and obey,'' the old man
told him. ``The man of the forest is without fear.'') Zaitsev is
called into the dirt-floored bunker of his commanding officer one
day and ordered to train a team of snipers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to hold out, Vasily,'' the officer says. ``We've got
to keep the Germans' feet to the fire. I can't tell you why,
because I don't know why. But something very big is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russian soldiers actually spoke to each other in such
idioms is hard to know _ they probably did not _ though Robbins
here and there puts more clearly misplaced phrases into his
characters' mouths, like ``level playing field'' and ``give me
credit.'' The reason for keeping the enemy tied down in Stalingrad,
however, is easy to know. The Germans have to be kept against the
Volga River until the gigantic pincers movement that will
eventually defeat them can be mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Zaitsev and his partner, big Viktor Medvedev, draw together
their team of sharpshooters. This includes one beautiful woman of
unusual provenance, a certain Tania Chernova who, Robbins tells us
in his introduction, was an actual combatant at Stalingrad. Tania
is from New York and was visiting her grandparents in Minsk when
the German invasion came. Rather than go back to her Manhattan
apartment, she becomes first a partisan and then a member of
Zaitsev's team. She kills without remorse and also provides Robbins
with the occasion to toss some sex, some passion and a lovers'
quarrel or two into his mix.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Thorvald arrives from Berlin and we get to the heart
of the action. Thorvald, unlike Zaitsev, is an aristocrat, soft and
cynical. He would rather be at the opera in Berlin than sleeping on
the ground in Russia. But he can also shoot a victim through the
eye from 500 meters, which is a little bit better than Zaitsev can
do. The duel thus pits the stationary marksman against the stealthy
hunter. It also depends on a certain reduction of the large,
chaotic Stalingrad battlefield into a small and coherent enough
place for Zaitsev and Thorvald to find each other without too much
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins has thought this through and leaves no logical questions
unanswered, like how Zaitsev would even know that Thorvald was
there, or how Thorvald would know where Zaitsev's team was
operating. Still, while nothing is missing in the way of logical
connective tissue, the whole of the story hums along too smoothly
and easily to be believable. It's just not plausible, for example,
that Zaitsev would recognize what he calls Thorvald's ``stench,''
his ``unmistakable style,'' because the bullets that kill two
Russian snipers were aimed with such uncanny accuracy that they
smashed their telescopic sights.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, much of the detail has an authentic feel to
it, Robbins' having learned about weaponry, snipers' tactics and
the conditions that prevailed at Stalingrad. The contest of skills
and wills between Zaitsev and Thorvald has energy, precision and a
touch of the unexpected to it. It's a good story, a creative
variation on the wartime adventure genre, and it gives a compelling
and graphic sense of the heroism-filled nightmare called
Stalingrad.

  (For release Wednesday, July 28)

 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that a Florida jury has found Big Tobacco guilty of
conspiring to hide the danger and addictiveness of cigarettes, it
is fun to wonder how many other American companies we can make jump
three feet in the air simply by whispering the words ``compensatory
damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make beer, wine and whiskey are obvious targets
because they conspired to keep from us the fact that excessive
drinking can lead to liver disease, car wrecks and pounding
hangovers. While we may have heard or read something about these
unpleasant side effects in the media, the booze makers never said a
word. Or, then again, maybe they did. Who knows? We were drunk and
it is their fault.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers also have reason to worry. What is the point
of suing the worthless punk who shot your brother when you can sue
Smith &AMP; Wesson? The worthless punk might want to sue Smith &AMP;
Wesson, too, because the company never warned him that guns could
kill people and now he's got to spend the rest of his life behind
bars as a result of this conspiracy of silence. The NRA will
undoubtedly object to this, in which case we should sue their
butts, too. The same goes for Charlton Heston and any and all
characters he played in the movies, including Moses.
</P>
<P>
   While we are suing Big Firearms and Big Firewater, we may as
well sue Big Automakers so they do not feel left out. Cars, after
all, are one of the nation's leading causes of car crashes,
something General Motors has, or at least might have, gone to great
lengths to keep the public from knowing. If you happen to crash
your car while drinking whiskey and shooting a gun, you are set up
for a huge payday.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to drive, drink whiskey, shoot a gun and order pizza
from your car phone, yet some people have tried to do it, to their
everlasting regret. Cell phone manufacturers are clearly culpable
because we, as busy Americans, do not have the time or inclination
to imagine how yapping on a phone could be a dangerous distraction
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   All that talking on our cell phones can make us hungry, causing
us to eat foods that are bad for our health. I figure I have eaten
well over 1,000 hot dogs in my life, which means I have unknowingly
ingested massive wads of artery-clogging cholesterol and saturated
fats, not to mention more cow lips and eyelids than could possibly
be good for me. Clearly, there is a conspiracy to turn me into an
Oscar Mayer weiner, and I want to be paid off in something more
substantial than mustard packets.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of atherosclerosis, I read that the residents of
Irwindale, Calif., eat more Big Macs, per capita, than anyone else
in America. Every man, woman and child gobbles an average of 337 of
these fat bombs every year.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, McDonald's: Can you say class-action suit? It is just a
matter of time before Irwindale disappears into a giant sinkhole
from the combined weight of its Big Mac eaters and the lawyers who
represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Things that may not appear to be dangerous can lead to
profitable lawsuits, given the right circumstances. Take underwear,
for instance. I once bonked my head on the dresser when I lost my
balance trying to step into my underwear in the dark. Was this
accident strictly the result of my own clumsiness? Hardly. It was,
as my crack legal team will prove, a design flaw in my Fruit of the
Looms. (No lights around the leg holes.)
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's was sued a few years back for irresponsibly serving
hot coffee to a customer who burned her thighs when the coffee
spilled on her lap while driving. (I don't know if she was drinking
whiskey, shooting a gun and/or yakking on a cell phone at the time
of the mishap, but if she wasn't, she'll know better next time.) In
the future, I see cold being just as actionable as hot. No one
should have to bear the (uncompensated) pain of a cold soft drink
on a just-filled tooth or the pounding headache that comes from
eating an ice cream cone too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us, myself included, were too stupid to cash in on the
stock market boom, but that does not mean we can't make a fortune
suing Big Business. We might start by suing Bill Gates for not
letting us know that his company was going to be so profitable.

CRIME DRIVING JAMAICANS OUT OF THEIR HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ Were it not for the nightly gunshots he
hears from his front porch, the all-too-frequent stories of friends
being attacked and robbed, and the gang members who are fighting
for control of his neighborhood, Patrick Corliss would not think of
leaving his boyhood home.
</P>
<P>
   But the 37-year-old resident of West Kingston has had enough.
With violence seemingly out of control in his working-class area,
Corliss packed a wooden cart two weeks ago with dirty clothes, some
old family photos, and boxes of canned foods to move someplace _
anyplace _ else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we'll end up,'' Corliss said, adding that
his wife and two teenage children had sought temporary shelter
already with a relative just outside the capital. ``We can't stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   It has become a common scene in this city of 800,000 people:
scores of families abandoning their homes with armfuls and carloads
of their possessions in a desperate bid to escape an explosion of
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered the easygoing hub of a reggae-loving Caribbean
island, Kingston is being choked by economic stagnation and an
eruption of gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Public anger over out-of-control crime last month prompted Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson to support restoring the death penalty
here, 11 years after the last hanging.
</P>
<P>
   And Jamaica is not the only sun-splashed island where high crime
rates have brought new cries for the death penalty. Governments in
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia have all recently
proposed restoration of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Trinidad, which hanged an alleged drug lord and
eight of his associates last month, has carried out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In Jamaica, some officials and business leaders worry that
unless the crime wave is stopped, it could threaten tourism, which
has grown steadily in recent years _ largely on its ability to
promise peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spate of criminal madness has broken out in certain
inner-city sections,'' Patterson said in a nationally broadcast
speech. ``I ask all well-thinking Jamaicans to share this resolve
with us. We simply cannot allow the criminals to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of criminal terror that has overwhelmed residents and
frustrated police has already led Patterson to impose dusk-to-dawn
curfews in several neighborhoods, enforced by platoons of soldiers
carrying assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   But the capital punishment proposal is the most controversial
measure. It has sparked much of the same moral arguments as in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kingston residents said they support the measure mostly
because they are tired of being afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never kill a man, because I have no right to,'' said
Benjamin Miller, 54, a mechanic, standing outside his East Kingston
repair shop. ``But if someone kills me, then he should be killed.
Otherwise when will this stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Jamaica has recorded more than 500 homicides,
most of them in Kingston. Last year, there were 953 murders in this
country of 2.6 million, more than twice the number two decades ago.
There have been 70 killings in just the last three weeks, including
an incident on July 5 when four men were fatally shot while
watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Officials attribute most of the crime wave to deadly bands of
drug gangs who fight each other for turf and recruits, and on an
increasing number of militant political groups.
</P>
<P>
   They also blame Jamaica's drooping economy, which has suffered
over the last few years from factory shutdowns and rising
unemployment and is expected to end this year with zero growth.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials and the government said another factor is the
growing number of criminals who have been deported to Jamaica after
running afoul of the law in the United States, Britain, and Canada.
Approximately 3,000 deportees have returned to the country in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, said Adrian Robinson, chairman of the Jamaica Tourist
Board, the crime wave has not affected tourism, in part because
most of the violence has been in Kingston on the southern coast,
across the island from Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, and Jamaica's other
popular resort areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaica is still one of the most popular islands for vacations
in the Caribbean,'' Robinson said, noting that 1.3 million tourists
visited last year, up 4 percent from 1998. ``The greater problem is
how people perceive the crime in Kingston and whether that might
make them think the problem is throughout Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, crime worries are on the rise outside of Kingston as
well. Extra police have been deployed along a stretch of the
island's southern coast, and there have been public marches against
violence in communities across the island. Late last year, a US
State Department information sheet warned travelers that violent
crime is a problem throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's constitution allows for executions. But its ability to
carry out death sentences had been slowed by the House of Lords in
London, which for the last 30 years has been Jamaica's ultimate
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The London court, known as the Privy Council, has favored
lifetime prison terms over hangings.
</P>
<P>
   Four Caribbean countries, however, have nearly finished
negotiations to set up a homegrown final appeals court where many
of the 250 pending death-row appeals are expected to be heard. Some
critics already have labeled the new institution ``the Hanging
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a license for Jamaica and other countries to do
hangings,'' said Bernard Headly, a criminologist and specialist on
Jamaica at Northeastern Illinois University. ``The politicians are
trying to con people into thinking that the death penalty is the
only way to fight crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights advocates also argue that rather than
resorting to executions, governments should stop the tide of
illegal weapons that flow into their countries and create legal aid
and compensation programs for families affected by crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Jamaicans are skeptical that these proposals will work.
</P>
<P>
   As he leaned against a chain-link fence at the Harbourview
Moravian Church in a tidy, middle-class section of East Kingston,
Leonard Price, 68, said those proposals are just too soft for
dealing with hard criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people who talk about humanity and human rights,
that's bull,'' said Price, a maintenance worker at the church, a
triangular structure shrouded in protective metal fencing like many
of the surrounding homes. ``What about the rights of those of us
who are hurt by these criminals? The real problem is that no one is
putting his foot down.''

DIRECTOR ADDS AN EROTIC TWIST TO A BAROQUE ENCHANTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of ``Larmore'' in 8th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ If Robert Carsen is being hailed as a fresh young face
on the European opera scene, it may have more to do with his new
kudos and boyish features than his age and experience. His
acclaimed, sexy new production of Handel's ``Alcina'' at the Paris
National Opera is proof enough of his talent, but it took him 13
years to break into the business and another decade to reach the
top. Now 45, the soft-spoken Canadian stage director is not exactly
a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, when you know nothing and nobody, it was
incredibly difficult,'' he said in a clipped English accent that
echoes his long years of residence in London. ``I almost gave up. I
was free-lancing as an assistant director until 1980, when I got a
job at Glyndebourne for four seasons, but it was all restagings. By
1986 I was doing a few little things on my own, but my career was
going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck then intervened in the form of Hugues Gall, then director
of the Geneva Opera, who was persuaded to travel to London to see
Carsen's production of Mozart's ``Finta Giardiniera'' at the
minor-league Camden Festival. ``I told him it was Mozart's most
boring opera, but he did a really brilliant job with just a few
thousand pounds,'' Gall recalled. ``I was pleased with that, so I
asked him, `What do you dream of doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Luck again stepped in. Carsen mentioned Boito's ``Mefistofele,''
and, by chance, Gall had been discussing a new production of the
opera with the American bass Samuel Ramey. In 1988, with Ramey in
the title role, Carsen's ``Mefistofele'' had its premiere in
Geneva, and the young director at last had a calling card. The
production, which has already been seen in San Francisco, Chicago,
Washington and Houston, arrives at the Metropolitan Opera of New
York in November.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Mefistofele'' Carsen's star quickly rose in Europe. He
followed up in Geneva with works by Gounod, Wagner and Bellini. He
did four well-received productions for the annual opera festival at
Aix-en-Provence in France, directed a seven-opera Puccini cycle for
the Flanders Opera in Antwerp and Ghent, Belgium, and brought
Verdi's three ``Shakespeare operas'' (``Otello,'' ``Falstaff'' and
``Macbeth'') to the Cologne Opera.
</P>
<P>
   His debut production of Tchaikovsky's ``Eugene Onegin'' at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York in March 1997 was given mixed
reviews, with some critics noting that he seemed overwhelmed by the
Met's huge stage. Still, when Gall took over the Paris Opera in
1995, he opened his first season with Carsen's new production of
Verdi's ``Nabucco.'' And here, at least, the director handled the
Bastille Opera's comparably large stage with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about 30 opera productions into his career, it seemed
appropriate that Gall should again play a role in Carsen's greatest
triumph to date by inviting him to close the season by directing
``Alcina'' (pronounced Ahl-CHEE-nah) at the Palais Garnier. The
star-studded cast included Renee Fleming, Susan Graham, Natalie
Dessay and Kathleen Kuhlmann and the orchestra and chorus of Les
Arts Florissants, conducted by William Christie.
</P>
<P>
   French music critics, who rarely agree on anything, were
unanimously enthusiastic, praising not only Carsen's modern take on
the opera but also the voices and orchestra, as well as Tobias
Hoheisel's set and costumes and Jean Kalman's lighting. The nine
performances of ``Alcina'' through July 1 were sold out, leaving
frustrated Parisians with the option of following the production to
the Lyric Opera of Chicago. (The only expected cast change is that
Jennifer Larmore will replace Ms. Graham.)
</P>
<P>
   The opera tells of the enchantress Alcina (Ms. Fleming) who
transforms her suitors into rocks, trees and beasts. Ruggiero (Ms.
Graham), though, escapes this fate because Alcina has fallen for
him. Meanwhile, Bradamante (Ms. Kuhlmann), intent on recovering her
fiance, Ruggiero, arrives disguised as a man called Ricciardo.
Alcina's sister Morgana (Ms. Dessay) then falls for Bradamante, to
the distress of her suitor, the knight Orante (Timothy Robinson).
Finally, Alcina loses her power, her lover and her life, leaving
the original couples to make up.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I have always been struck that the story of an
opera is not necessarily what the story is about,'' Carsen
explained over coffee in the Cafe de Flore on the Left Bank. ``I am
a storyteller and I need to find out what is the story I am
telling. You might think `Alcina' is about a dreadful witch who
turns men most unfairly into inanimate objects. But when you listen
to what Handel has done, that is not what the story is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having discovered what it is about, for this time, this
theater, this audience,'' he went on, ``how are you going to tell
the story? My approach is not, `How do I shake this audience out of
its bourgeois stupor?' I prefer to ask, `How do I give it a very
powerful experience?' I am always thinking of the audience because
the audience makes it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Alcina,'' then, Carsen decided to modernize the opera by
dropping 18th-century magic in favor of 20th-century eroticism.
``My feeling about the piece is that it is as much about the men
wanting to be turned into animals,'' he said. ``And the nearest men
and women get to being animals is when they are making love. So
these men are imprisoned by their fascination with Alcina, by their
own bestiality.''
</P>
<P>
   His production, then, is probably sexier than Handel had in
mind. The curtain rises on a stage covered with the unconscious
forms of 40 or so men in various states of undress. With Ruggiero
played by a woman and Bradamante dressed as a man, Carsen also adds
some passionate same-sex embraces and he again uses nudity (with
Alcina caressing two naked men on a bed) ``because we have to show
what makes Ruggiero fall out of love with her.''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic high point comes at the end of Act II when a
despairing Alcina recognizes that she has lost Ruggiero. Here,
Carsen has Ms. Fleming walking amid the bodies of her comatose
suitors as she sings to the spirits that have deserted her. ``It's
an incredibly difficult piece of music, going round and round like
a mad scene,'' Carsen said. ``When I proposed adding the bodies,
Renee immediately said, `Let's try it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming said she was struck by his concern for every visual
and dramatic aspect of the production. ``He's very interested in
the physical portrayal of the character, but also in the mental
process, in motivation. He's a very organic director. He kind of
discovers everything with us. And he listens to suggestions, which
is important because, as performers, we have to believe in what
we're doing. He does push, but the pushing is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Ms. Fleming and the other singers had Christie
looking after their interests in the orchestra pit. ``Robert will
push a singer as far as he or she will be pushed,'' Christie said.
``Some of this I approve of, some of it I don't. What makes me
unhappy is to have a singer doing a very complicated parcours in a
very difficult moment. Sometimes I'll say to Robert, `You're going
too far.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Christie was blunt, it was not only because he likes to speak
his mind; like Gall, he has also played an important role in
Carsen's career to date through their successful collaborations on
``Orlando,'' ``Semele,'' ``The Magic Flute'' and ``The Marriage of
Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert is wonderfully directive,'' Christie said. ``I think he
was born with that. He's extremely classical, very refined. He's
one of the cleverest directors I know. First all, he's a musician.
He can relate to opera as many cannot. With `Alcina,' if I were
asked to describe what he was doing, I'd say he was sublimating the
magical and phantasmagoric aspects of the piece to something more
rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Carsen feels equally at home working with Christie. ``I divide
conductors into two,'' the director said. ``Those who want to be in
the theater and those who just wish they were doing a concert, to
whom everything to do with opera is a hindrance. I think you're in
the theater to make theater. And William Christie is one of those
who completely understands and cherishes and supports that.''
</P>
<P>
   To make theater in opera, of course, means acting. And here
Carsen still relies on a lesson learned at the Bristol Old Vic
Theater School in England 25 years ago before he turned to
directing. ``We had this marvelous teacher, an old Austrian, Rudy
Shelly,'' he recalled. ``He would say, `Oh, I see this awful
danger: Actor at work! I want to put a sign around you: Danger,
actor at work! So stop acting and start reacting.' In `Alcina,' I
kept saying to the singers and to the chorus, `Feel it, don't show
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   His advice was apparently heeded. In an opera with lengthy
recitative and no fewer than 26 arias _ one lasts 12 minutes _ the
powerful emotions stirred by Ms. Fleming, Ms. Graham and others
ensured that interest in the story itself never flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, given his concern for performance, Carsen makes
a point of watching over the frequent restagings of his
productions. So this fall, he will be shuttling between Chicago and
New York during rehearsals for ``Alcina'' and ``Mefistofele.'' And
soon afterward he will be in Milan for a restaging of his Amsterdam
production of Poulenc's ``Dialogue des Carmelites.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season he will open a Janacek cycle with ``Jenufa'' at the
Flanders Opera, present Richard Strauss' ``Frau Ohne Schatten'' in
Vienna and direct a new production of Offenbach's ``Contes
d'Hoffmann'' at the Bastille Opera, with James Conlon conducting.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest challenge, though, lies further ahead. In December
next year he will present ``Das Rheingold'' at the Cologne Opera,
with the other three operas of Wagner's ``Ring of the Nibelung''
following in successive years. Carsen may already have tackled a
good part of the traditional opera repertory, but he knows the old
maxim that no opera director has truly made it until he has
conquered ``The Ring.''

HELPING CHILDREN WITH ALLERGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)  
(ms) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Philip R. Fischer of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,
believes that at least 15 percent of all children have significant
allergies. But these children are divided into two groups, experts
emphasize: those whose parents are aware and expect to cope, and
the rest, who have not yet met their allergens and may do so far
from home, creating a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When allergic children travel, adults who are aware of the
child's situation need to be sure they have packed a special pillow
or protective case, any medicines taken regularly, inhalers and
whatever else the child may need in a medical emergency. Parents
who are not aware of allergies in their children also have a
responsibility, said Dr. Alejandra Gurtman, medical director of the
Travel Health Program at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. They
should learn how to identify an allergy and differentiate it from a
cold or everyday rash, and know how to respond. They should
probably pack a basic antihistamine.
</P>
<P>
   Gurtman and Fischer, who works in the Mayo Clinic's Department
of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, participated in the
children's allergies session of the International Travel Medicine
Conference in Montreal in June. The session began with a discussion
of airline peanuts, a source of recent controversy focusing mainly
on whether another passenger's eating peanuts can cause an acute
reaction in an allergic child.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, who said 1 percent of children were hyperallergic to
peanuts, later provided citations in medical journals reporting
severe reactions among people after ``minimal contact,'' for
example, eating a single peanut or taking one or two bites of a
food with an unknown ingredient. In one article cited, almost half
of a group of 622 people who said they had a peanut allergy
reported a reaction on touching a peanut. However, Fischer knew of
no reports that peanut exposure other than eating had caused death.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is difficult for an airline. Writing to Newshare, a
publication of the travel medicine society, Dr. J.C. Merritt, the
principal medical officer of Cathay Pacific Airways, said the
potential hazards of peanuts had been a topic of ``serious debate''
among airlines for some years. Even if an airline bans peanuts, he
wrote, there is no way to keep passengers from bringing aboard
foods with peanut content. ``Rather than induce a false sense of
security in those who . . . suffer from this allergy,'' Merritt
wrote, ``it is better to be upfront about this and let those with
the allergy make their own decisions on the wisdom of travel on
commercial flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts urge parents with sensitive children to learn the
foreign words for peanuts, peanut oil, eggs, milk, tree nuts and
other dangerous food so that restaurant staff can be asked if a
dish contains the ingredient. Even this is not foolproof. Merritt
reported on a case where a waiter said peanut oil was not used in a
dish, but the recipe had been changed without the waiter's
knowledge, and the diner had an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Gurtman, who has two children with allergies, said parents of
such children should discuss with the clinic or pediatrician a
progression of steps to assist a child in an attack, especially
respiratory. At the Citicorp health service department for
employees going overseas, Lynn Bunnell, nurse manager of
international travel services, said that writing out what to do
next if the first step does not work, and so forth, can prevent
panic if the family is far from a medical facility.
</P>
<P>
   Gurtman and Ms. Bunnell said that the Epipen Jr., a pen-sized
injector loaded with a pediatric dose of epinephrine, commonly
called adrenaline, was potentially valuable. This device, placed
against the thigh, automatically injects the hormone, which can
counter a serious allergic reaction. It requires a prescription.
The two clinic directors said that families should also ask what
the proper dosage of liquid Benadryl is for the child's weight; it
is also helpful in an emergency because it enters the child's
system quickly. Two of everything should be packed, one in carry-on
luggage, in case of loss or damage.
</P>
<P>
   For children who have severe respiratory attacks, Gurtman said
she sometimes recommends a battery-operated nebulizer, a device to
spray medicine into the mouth, with a mask. This is quite
expensive, about $450, she said, although it lasts a long time.
Another help is a peak-flow meter for lung capacity, which is
inexpensive. This device enables parents to check daily how well
the child is breathing, and to anticipate problems if capacity
declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the child has had three crises in the last month,''
Gurtman said, ``you might want to consider where you are going and
pick a place not too far from help.''
</P>
<P>
   When families with children suffering from allergies are going
overseas for a long time, they should get information and
references to local physicians. Those making shorter trips need
other ways to find help. Fortunately, there is quite a bit of
information these days.
</P>
<P>
   For trips abroad, a prime resource is the International
Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers, a voluntary
organization with headquarters in Canada, headed by M. Assunta
Uffer-Marcolongo. It provides members with a directory of
physicians around the world who speak English fluently. These
doctors have agreed to a set rate for members using their services,
for example $75 (in United States dollars) for a house call.
Treatments and vaccines are likely to be extra.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also sends its members a bundle of leaflets:
world climate charts, a sheet to list personal medical data and
information on malaria and other diseases. Membership is by
donation; $35 is probably a sensible minimum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers &LR; ,
417 Center St., Lewiston, N.Y. 14092; (716) 754-4883 or
www.sentex.net/iamat.
</P>
<P>
   The two major medical organizations dealing with allergy have
information phone lines and United States physician directories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology &LR;  is at
85 West Algonquin Rd., Suite 550, Arlington Heights, Ill. 60005.
Requests for names of board-certified allergists may be made to
(800) 842-7777. It also has a list, searchable by ZIP code, on its
Internet site, allergy.mcg.edu.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology &LR; , at 611
East Wells St., Milwaukee, Wis. 53202, has a help line at (800)
822-2762, to request brochures and other educational material. It
provides a reference service focused by ZIP code. Its Web site,
www.aaaai.org, also has this information. Its Western Hemisphere
mold and spore map is revised three times a week.

   &UR; Mount Sinai Travel Health Program &LR; , 5 East 98th St., 11th
floor, New York, N.Y. 10029; (212) 241-7468, is a clinic providing
pretravel counseling and vaccines, with particular expertise in
allergy. Gurtman recommends that the family schedule a visit six to
eight weeks before a trip. The consultation fee will depend on the
time required; for a family, it should range from $65 to $110, plus
any vaccines.

 &HT;    TAPES MADE BY MISTRESS ARE ADMITTED TO CISNEROS TRIAL
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge ruled Monday that the jury in
former housing secretary Henry Cisneros's upcoming trial can hear
nearly the entire contents of 26 tapes secretly recorded by his
former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled that Cisneros's
lawyers had ``presented no direct evidence that the voice on the
tapes is not his, nor that the statements attributed to him are
inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the four tapes that contain deletions and what is
described in the ruling as ``obvious alteration'' will be kept from
jurors. However, Sporkin will allow the ex-mistress, Linda Jones,
to testify about what she remembers of those conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin's ruling is a victory for independent counsel David
Barrett and a serious problem for Cisneros's high-powered legal
team. On the tapes, Cisneros and Jones speak almost constantly
about the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both sides refused to comment on Monday's ruling.
But ``tapes, as we know, are very powerful evidence,'' defense
lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. told Sporkin while arguing against
allowing the tapes to be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros goes on trial Sept. 7 on charges that he lied to the
FBI about the more than $250,000 in ``hush money'' he allegedly
paid to Jones. His statements to the FBI came in a background check
before being named by President Clinton in 1993 to serve as
secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Cisneros told the FBI he never paid Jones more than $10,000 in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-day pre-trial hearing that stretched over four weeks,
Sullivan argued that the tapes were ``inauthentic'' because all 26
are copies, and because Jones admitted deleting parts of some of
them. She destroyed the original tapes sometime before July 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During the pre-trial hearing, Jones admitted lying on numerous
occasions to the FBI and to other federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sporkin wrote in his ruling that Jones's ``credibility is
in issue,'' he said the tapes contained ``reliable and accurate
representations of the conversations that occurred between Medlar
and Cisneros between April 1990 and December 1993.'' Jones, who has
resumed using her maiden name, was known as Linda Medlar during the
affair, which took place when Cisneros was mayor of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin also rejected defense arguments that Jones illegally
recorded the conversations for purposes of extortion or blackmail
and to publicize sensitive personal information about Cisneros,
grounds for a civil lawsuit under Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin found that Jones made the tapes in order to have a
record of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medlar's stated reasons do not indicate any desire to disclose
personal, or sensitive, matters not of legitimate concern to the
public,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The love affair burst onto the national scene in 1994 after
Jones gave an interview on the tabloid television program, ``Inside
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   It eventually cost Cisneros his position in Clinton's cabinet
and Jones her marriage and job as a San Antonio fund-raiser. He is
now president of Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language
television network. She is serving a 3 1/2-year federal prison
sentence on bank fraud charges connected to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to testify in the upcoming trial.

   BUSH-FAITH _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Last week, GOP presidential
front-runner George W. Bush announced some specifics on his ideas
for faith-based programs at the federal level. As governor, Bush
has aggressively promoted partnerships between government and
faith-based groups, which he says can provide many social services
more effectively _ and cost-efficiently _ than the state
bureaucracy. But it isn't clear how effective the partnerships
between Texas and faith-based groups have been _ in fact, nobody is
even sure how many of them there are. We watch a faith-based group
in action, talk to people who say such groups have changed their
lives, and discuss some potential pitfalls as government and
faith-based groups forge closer relationships. (Greenberger, Austin

   PRIEST-MOLEST _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In February, two
Nashville dectectives flew to West Palm Beach and went to a neat
pink bungalow in Flamingo Park.. There they met Frank Richards and
interviewed him for three hours. He told them how in the '80s he
had been a Catholic priest and high school principal in Nashville.
He also told them how he and a priest colleague sexually molested
dozens of boys during a decade of abuse in their Tennessee diocese.
Richards' colleague has been sentenced to 25 years in state prison
for his offenses; Richards, though admitting molesting at least 25
boys, has never been charged or sued, but paid an out-of-court
settlement to three of his victims. The statute of limitations has
expired on all his known offenses. State officials and diocese
acknowledge Richards slipped through their cracks. Both men were
forced out of the priesthood a dozen years ago. Today Richards is
an employee of the state of Florida, working for the Palm Beach
County Health Department. His division regulates day-care centers.

   Route 66
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am thinking of taking a trip this year on Route 66. What
are the best deals on a one-way car rental? And as a woman who will
be traveling alone, I'd like suggestions on guidebooks that would
list safe, reasonably priced accommodations. _ Jane McGivena, New
York
</P>
<P>
   A. Route 66, the highway between Chicago and Los Angeles that
was inaugurated in 1926, was celebrated in song by Nat King Cole
and nicknamed the Mother Road by John Steinbeck.
</P>
<P>
   But just as drought sent the Joads and other Dust Bowl refugees
westward, the Interstate highways eventually left Route 66 to
wither. Its 2,448 miles have vanished without a trace from road
maps in the states it crossed _ Illinois, Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   In the hearts of romantic travelers, though, it's as if Tod and
Buzz still jump into their Corvette each week on the 1960s TV show.
There are numerous guides to the old highway, including one by Tom
Snyder, founder of the U.S. Route 66 Association: ``Route 66
Traveler's Guide and Roadside Companion'' (St. Martin's, $11.95).
It offers original road maps plus detailed directions on following
a route that has been obliterated by Interstates in some places.
</P>
<P>
   For lodging and dining suggestions, there's ``Route 66, the
Illustrated Guidebook to the Mother Road,'' by Bob Moore and
Patrick Grauwels (Roadbook International, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   The authors include warnings about stretches that they do not
consider safe. Part of the attraction of the old road is the
desolation and ``ghost town'' feel along some stretches. But there
are many active businesses along most of the old route, and because
it parallels Interstate highways for the most part, you should be
about as safe as with any driving trip along major highways.
</P>
<P>
   You can also subscribe to Route 66 Magazine, 326 West Route 66,
Williams, AZ 86046, published quarterly at $14 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Retracing Route 66 is slow going _ you'll have to follow
directions in these guidebooks carefully. About 100 miles a day, or
three weeks from end to end, is a leisurely pace.
</P>
<P>
   As for a one-way car rental, the best tactic may be to shop the
Internet for a deal with the lowest drop-off charge. One site you
can try is ETN, at www.etn.nl/cars/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Music and Dance in India
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to visit Chennai in India and would like to know about
the annual music and dance festival. _ Guy Capuzzo, Emerson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. The festival is presented in December and January every year
by different organizations of music lovers in Chennai (the Tamil
name for the city formerly known as Madras) called sabhas. The most
popular concerts are organized by the Music Academy and the Narada
Gana Sabha at their respective auditoriums. Besides these, there
are about 15 other sabhas. So at the height of the season, there
can be six to eight concerts going on at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is a celebration of the classical Carnatic music
and dance of southern India. At each site, there is usually a
lecture in the morning followed by a three-hour concert in the
afternoon or evening. Some of the instruments used are the vina, a
large stringed instrument over 300 years old, and the ghatam, or
mud pot.
</P>
<P>
   Many programs are free, but tickets to performances with the
most famous artists range from $1 to $10, at 43.22 rupees to the
dollar. Tickets are usually sold at the hall, or you can buy them
in advance after the schedules are published, sometime this month.
Some sabhas plan to sell tickets on the Internet, although details
are not yet available. Contact Tamil Nadu Tourism Development
Corp., 25 Dr. Radhakrishnan Salai, Mylapore, Chennai 600004, Tamil
Nadu; telephone (91-44) 854 7335 or 854 7344, fax (91-44) 8546620.
</P>
<P>
   Another source is the Music Academy, 306 T.T.K. Road, Chennai
600014, Tamil Nadu; telephone (91-44) 8275619 or 8275162.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Spas
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be attending a conference in San Antonio this month
and would like to spend a few days at a spa retreat. I do not want
a day spa. Do you have any suggestions? _ Ilene Ingram, New York
</P>
<P>
   A. Look at this positively: You will be visiting a city where
the style of living is so relaxed and healthy that the residents
evidently don't need spa treatments. When we looked for spa resorts
in and near San Antonio, we couldn't find any.
</P>
<P>
   One option you may consider is a local resort with extensive
health-spa facilities. The Hyatt Regency Hill Country, (210)
647-1234, is on 200 acres in northwestern San Antonio. Its health
club has a whirlpool, three types of massage (half-hour $50, 90
minutes $100), exercise rooms, saunas, beauty treatments (facials
$65 to $85) and water aerobics. The grounds also have jogging
trails.
</P>
<P>
   For a more complete spa-resort experience, you'll have to make a
detour about 100 miles up I-35 to Austin, where the Lake Austin Spa
Resort, (800) 847-5637, sits up in the hills on a secluded inlet of
the lake. The resort specializes in exercise and wellness, with
daily lectures on nutrition and psychological well-being. Most of
the simple, comfortable rooms overlook the lake. Spa treatments are
also available.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-night stay in a standard room is $1,790 a person, double
occupancy, plus tax, $1,990 for single occupancy. There is a
minimum three-night stay ($890 a person, double).
</P>
<P>
   A House Near Naples
</P>
<P>
   Q. We would like to rent a house near Avellino, just outside
Naples. We will be five adults and need at least two bedrooms and a
sleeper sofa or three bedrooms. Do you know of any rental agencies
in the area? _ Donald N. Petito, Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   A. You can try these real-estate agencies, although you will
probably need an Italian speaker to help you reserve:
</P>
<P>
   Immobiliare Meo Tre, 36 Corso Vittorio Emanuele, 83100 Avellino,
telephone (39-082) 521665, fax (39-082) 534685, and Immobiliare
Nazzaro &AMP; Palumbo, 77 Viale Italia, 83100 Avellino, telephone
(39-082) 531227, fax (39-082) 5782021.
</P>
<P>
   You might also consider Mercogliano, a town on a hill near
Avellino that is more of a tourism center. Agencies here include
Agenzia Family, Torretta di Mercogliano, 265 Via Nazionale, 83013
Mercogliano; telephone (39-0825) 682968.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is a farmhouse rental, through the regional
Agriturism office at 137 Corso Arnaldo Lucci, 80132 Napoli,
telephone (39-081) 284077. The annual guide lists rental properties
near Avellino.
</P>
<P>
   The Avellino tourist office is at 50 Piazza Liberta, (39-082)
574732, fax (39-082) 574757.

LIFE IS SIMPLER IN COWBOY VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOGWOTEE PASS, Wyo. _ High in the Rockies overlooking the Grand
Tetons, there's a place above and away from it all, where you can
still beat the crowds of Jackson Hole and Yellowstone National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   You can still get all the best, the nonpareil wildlife viewing
of Yellowstone, the day hikes with breathtaking views at the
Tetons, but lose yourself in true peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Cowboy Village, a small settlement of log cabins, a
lodge, a store and a restaurant, set outside of Yellowstone's
southern entrance, about 17 miles from the nearest town. In a
100-mile radius of the Tetons and Yellowstone, there is no better
hideaway to use as a base camp, where you can still enjoy
recreation adventure amid one of the world's greatest natural
treasures and not feel as if you have been in a battle to pull it
off.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 years since the colossal fire of Yellowstone,
when 793,880 acres of the park were burned and devoured by
wildfires set by lightning strikes. The tree skeletons still span
for miles in giant mosaic patterns, but beneath them is a lush
understory as the land is reborn. The benefit is for the wildlife,
with this habitat like a giant all-you-can-eat grocery store for
the elk, bison, moose, grizzly and black bear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trails in the Tetons, as well as in the Rockies,
are now largely clear of snow. They can provide a series of great
day hikes with eye-popping views of the Grand Tetons, the Rocky
Mountains, south Yellowstone and several emerald lakes at the foot
of the Tetons.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together _ the hidden cabins, the wildlife, the hikes
_ and you get one of the greatest recreational travel experiences
available anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I love the world's natural treasures,
Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon and others, but I don't
want to fight the crowds to enjoy them. There is always a way to
pull it off, I've found, providing you do some detective work.
</P>
<P>
   The trip started here with our arrival in Jackson Hole, thrilled
at the first views of the Tetons, but plenty wary of the legendary
crowds. Jackson Hole was once a real cowboy town that I enjoyed,
where some 20 years ago Waylon Jennings locked the doors at the
Million Dollar Cowboy Bar and blew the roof off with a private
concert. Nowadays, Jackson Hole has been turned into a ticky-tack
minicity filled with streets of shops that sell you tourist stuff
made elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The experience trying to camp in Yellowstone or the Tetons is
best described as combat camping, always jammed, often loud,
anything but tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be another way.
</P>
<P>
   From Jackson Hole, we headed north 30 miles to Moran Junction,
then turned right and cruised another 17 miles up into the Rockies.
Near the Continental Divide at Togwotee Pass, we found this
woodsy-style lodge and small development, set at an elevation of
8,600 feet. After checking in, still apprehensive at what awaited,
we found the log cabin in stellar condition, knotty-pine interior,
clean and well equipped, including a kitchenette. Prices at peak
season are $149 per night for cabins, $99 for a room and $119 for a
suite in the lodge, less pricey than at Jackson Hole.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. A great relief. We then headed out to
Yellowstone to survey the continuing recovery from the '88 wildfire
and to look for wildlife. Still outside the park, we spotted five
buffalo, and America's greatest wildlife adventure was a go.
</P>
<P>
   In sequence, right from the road, we spotted moose, elk,
grizzly, coyote, prairie dog, antelope, deer and golden eagle.
</P>
<P>
   With binoculars, you can bring them right up, and with a 300-mm
lens on a camera, bring them right home.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot near the Fire Hole River, I spotted a buffalo about
200 yards off, on the opposite side of the river. Of course, you
should always keep your distance from wildlife, but this was an
opportunity to stalk and sneak, and get within short range _ with a
river separating us. At one point, to keep out of sight, I even
crept on hands and knees.
</P>
<P>
   Now get this: The buffalo, a huge bull, never even twitched.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, right at the river bank, I just stood full up, in plain
view directly across the river, and took my pictures, and that old
bison could care less. By the time I got back to the road, guess
what? Two buffalo were standing there, one right in the road,
behind our vehicle, causing a traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, we saw a grizzly with two cubs running around
like little dogs while momma scolded them. At another, we saw a
moose with a baby as well. In all, we figured we had 400 sightings
of wildlife, including about 200 elk, 100 antelope and 25 moose.
There is no wildlife viewing opportunity like this anywhere else in
America, including Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The hiking in Yellowstone, on the other hand, is less than
divine.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through a burned forest is interesting for about five
minutes, then outta here.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was off to the Tetons, where there are all matter of
hiking trails. They include easy hikes on the shore of big lakes,
such as Jackson Lake and Ginnie Lake and up to 200-foot Hidden
Falls and the nearby Inspiration Point Lookout. The ambitious few
can extend the latter trail for 4.5 miles up Cascade Canyon and
well into the Tetons, where you can lunch at hidden Lake Solitude
at 9,035 feet, set north of Old Grand.
</P>
<P>
   To take in the entire panorama, from Cowboy Village we climbed
up to the top of Angle Mountain, summiting at 10,204 feet on the
Continental Divide. With nary a soul in range, we absorbed the
sweeping 360, across the valley to the Tetons, the Elk Refuge,
South Yellowstone, and up and down the crest of the Rocky
Mountains. In the moment, there seemed perfect quiet.
</P>
<P>
   It has everything. That is, everything but the crowds.

 &HT;    Lawmakers visit plant on F-22
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three congressmen went on a listening tour of the
Lockheed Martin Aeronautical System today to determine if there is
a chance the plant can get costs under control on the F-22 fighter
_ or whether the program should be nixed as so expensive it
undermines other military needs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the congressmen, Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.) chairs the
defense appropriations subcommittee that wrote $1.8 billion in
initial production funding for the F-22 out of the budget. Experts
say that could kill the program and possibly prompt Lockheed Martin
to close the Marietta, Ga. plant.
</P>
<P>
   The decision brought protests from the Pentagon, the White House
and Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) whose district includes the plant. Barr
accompanied Lewis and Rep. Norman Dicks (D-Wash.) on a tour of the
plant. The Senate's version of the defense appropriations bill
includes funding for the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks and Lewis said they were visiting the plant to talk with
Lockheed executives to see if they were incorrect in their analysis
that the F-22 cost overruns made the state-of-the-art fighter too
costly to build. The Air Force plans to buy 339 of the planes at a
total cost of about $62 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have pressure from the White House or the
Pentagon,'' Lewis said. ``We had some facts, but we didn't have all
the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said that he feared the plane was headed down the path of
the B-2 bomber which became so costly that the Air Force could only
afford to buy a handful of planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to size up the seriousness of Lockheed Martin . . .
to holding costs in place,'' Dicks said.
</P>
<P>
   LMAS President Tom Burbage was scheduled to hold a press
conference on the tour's results later today.

WALTER J. BATE, 81; WROTE PULITZER-PRIZE BIOGRAPHIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Walter Jackson Bate, a professor of English at Harvard
University who won Pulitzer Prizes for biographies of John Keats
and Samuel Johnson, died of cardiac arrest Monday in Deaconess
Clinical Center in Boston. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bate was awarded his first Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for ``John
Keats,'' a 731-page biography of the English poet. In his review of
the book, Globe critic Herbert A. Kenney wrote, ``The matter can be
stated flatly: this is the best book on John Keats that has ever
been done, and it is difficult to see how it could be improved in
the scope of a single volume.''
</P>
<P>
   He received a second Pulitzer in 1978 for his biography of
Johnson, the English man of letters and lexicographer. That book
also won the National Book Award and the National Book Critics
Circle Award.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bate was born in Mankato, Minn. He earned bachelor's and
master's degrees and a doctorate at Harvard, where he taught from
1946 until his retirement in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   An unassuming man, the evening he won his first Pulitzer he was
attending a dinner of the Harvard Society of Fellows. ``I couldn't
miss this meeting,'' he said, according to a Globe report of May 5,
1964. ``May is a busy month for professors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bate's lecture series at Harvard ``The Age of Johnson'' and
``The Function and Criticism of Literature,'' were very popular.
His students, according to one Harvard publication, ``are often too
interested to take notes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 25th anniversary report of his class at Harvard, Mr. Bate
said he was devoted almost entirely to writing, research, and
teaching. ``Like others in that kind of situation where one's
recreation is the same as one's work and where so much of one's
work consists of writing,'' he wrote, ``I find myself unable ever
to say what I'm doing without falling into a long rambling summary
of everything I've been trying to talk or write about, long and
rambling because one starts to use the opportunity to qualify or
try to improve on what one's already said. That's the occupational
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Cambridge, who also had a home in Amherst, N.H.,
he wrote in 1964, ``My principal hobby has been farming.
Unsuccessful farming, I hasten to add. For a few years I actually
had a dairy farm of sorts, and then, after continual loss, decided
to grow rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a sister, Jane Dear of Raleigh, N.C.; and several
nieces and nephews.

NOT A FULL HOUSE FOR MILLENNIUM TOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 1)  
 (ms)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was ballyhooed as Minneapolis' biggest New Year's Eve party
ever, but the Millennium Celebration _ a six-day, $8 million
festival scheduled to welcome the year 2000 _ has been canceled.
The corporate sponsors who were expected to underwrite the concerts
and welcoming events had second thoughts, partly fearing a public
relations black eye in the event of a Y2K computer problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So as of now Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul are without a
gala celebration for the end of the year, although some more modest
events are being planned. And only a year after many cities,
countries, islands and protectorates were claiming that theirs
would be the biggest or best millennium celebration in 1,000 years,
reality appears to have overtaken much of the hype. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true, travel agents say, of widely promoted
tours to remote Pacific islands or to other unknown corners of the
earth that few people would travel to otherwise. Although Hurley
Travel Services of Portland, Me., has sold several millennium tours
to Australia, which has ample airline service, abundant
accommodations and a huge party scheduled for Sydney to welcome
2000, millennium tours to many other exotic spots remain unsold.
``We've had a lot more people decide to stay home after they found
out that prices for many of the millennium celebrations are pretty
much a rip-off,'' said Pat Hurley, the agency's owner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the AAA South County Travel Agency in St. Louis,
millennium bookings are fairly slow, because people are leery about
the high prices, said Jane Barnett, the agency manager. But cruise
bookings may pick up, she said, because some lines are dropping
prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cruise line officials blanch at suggestions that they are
discounting millennium cruises, which many of the lines are
counting on to top off what they expect to be a record 1999 season.
But they acknowledge privately that their millennium cruises longer
than a week still have space, and the time-honored way to fill
ships is by lowering prices for unsold berths as departure dates
near. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some cruise lines did not wait that long to jump-start occupancy
on their millennium cruises. Earlier this year, Royal Caribbean and
Celebrity Cruises began offering free round-trip flights from some
two dozen cities and also reduced cruise-only rates for inside
cabins. Those specials are still available. So are the rates that
Carnival lowered by 15 percent earlier this year on five millennium
cruises of nine nights or more.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have space on our longer sailings,'' said Erik
Elvejord, a Holland America spokesman, ``but we're getting steady
bookings without having to make deals.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Art Sbarsky, executive vice president of Norwegian Cruise Line,
said there is still space available on all six of that line's
ships, but it expects to sell it without discounting. ``We've just
started the second phase of our marketing, using direct mail and
other promotions,'' he said, ``so we're fairly confident that
things will work out well.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet some longer millennium cruises have already filled. In a
jibe at the competition, a recent Crystal Cruises news release
mentioned reports of decreasing demand for millennium travel,
adding that Crystal is boasting record waiting lists for its two
sold-out ships, the Crystal Harmony and Crystal Symphony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Crystal Harmony's 16-day sailing from Buenos Aires to
Barbados will anchor in Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro to witness
the fireworks that will welcome in 2000. Passengers aboard the
Crystal Symphony's 17-day cruise from Auckland, New Zealand, to Los
Angeles will party while crossing the international dateline at
midnight. Each ship carries 940 passengers, and cruise-only fares
begin at $8,375 for the Harmony and $8,975 for the Symphony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None of the above is meant to suggest that party animals will
have few choices this New Year's Eve. Among foreign cities, Paris,
London, Rio, Sydney and Singapore are expected to draw huge crowds,
and if Auckland, Gisborne, Queenstown and many other cities in New
Zealand _ which for two years has been positioning itself as ``the
first nation in the world to welcome in the new millennium'' _ do
not draw crowds of tourists, it will not be for lack of trying.
That country's dozens of events include a Millennium Golf
Tournament, a Millennium Marathon, a First Light Triathlon and a
Jazz Festival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the weather cooperates, most big American cities, including
Washington and Las Vegas, are expecting big crowds. Travel agents
predict that New York will easily fill Times Square and surrounding
streets and avenues with the million-plus revelers expected for the
biggest New Year's Eve event in Times Square history.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Event planners say that one reason prices for many millennium
events are as high as they are _ tickets for the star-studded
Celebration 2000 at Jacob Javits Convention Center start at $1,000
each, the blowout at Windows on the World will set a couple back
about $4,000 _ is that even less-than-big-name performers are
charging several times their usual fee. But planners also
acknowledge that since New Year's Eve prices are always higher than
usual, a New Year's Eve that rolls around only once every thousand
years is deserving of a premium on top of that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And for those who care more about traveling than partying, Ms.
Hurley of Hurley Travel Services has a suggestion: ``We're telling
our customers that if they can wait until two weeks after the
millennium, they'll save at least 30 percent.''

 &HT;    INCUMBENCY HELPS GORE OFFSET MONEY GAP WITH BUSH
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the vice president arrived to campaign for the
presidency, Air Force Two taxied past the local television crews,
turning slowly to give the impression of a presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part of it, at least in the view of those
responsible for financing the expensive campaign, was that much of
the travel cost of the vice president and his staff was paid not by
the campaign treasury, but by the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the advantage Vice President George Bush had in 1988
over his Republican primary rivals and, ultimately, Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   And such is the advantage Vice President Al Gore will have when
he travels to Houston on Wednesday to address the annual convention
of the National Council of La Raza, which represents the key Latino
voting bloc in next year's presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was invited to deliver the keynote address to the
convention, and unless he makes an overt political pitch _ such as
``if elected, I promise ... `` _ or adds a campaign fund-raising
event to his schedule, his trip to Houston will be an official
expense of his vice presidential office.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he splits his time between official duties and political
activities, the Gore campaign will have to pay only for whatever
percentage of time he spends politicking.
</P>
<P>
   This formula is the one used by all modern presidents and vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of the many advantages that incumbents have in
politics today,'' said Meredith McGehee, vice president and
legislative director of Common Cause, a public policy organization
that promotes campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Another major advantage is the free national media exposure
office-holders attract just by doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, has contended that his
record-setting pace for raising money is aimed in part at
offsetting the advantage of such perks for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Through June, Bush had raised about $37 million to Gore's $19
million, and the governor has announced he will refuse federal
matching funds in order to avoid limits on what he can spend.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``some legitimacy'' to Bush's argument, McGehee said.
``But does it justify the current arms race? I don't think so,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's like an army every time Gore lands, much of it
taxpayer-subsidized,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of
the Center for Public Integrity, a political watchdog organization
founded in 1989. ``But I have a hard time reaching for my
handerchief to shed a tear for George Bush and his $37 million _
and it's only July.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the perks of incumbency at the White House are ``far
from a partisan issue,'' since ``it's been going on a long time,''
from one administration to another, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Salazar, spokesman for the Gore campaign, said it is ``a
misconception'' that the taxpayers have to pick up the tab when the
vice president travels on Air Force II. ``That's just not true,''
he said. ``We have to pay for every seat we use.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel on Air Force II, charged at the rate of first-class air
fare, cost the Gore campaign $188,000 during the first six months
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to ensure that the campaigns are paying their
fair share, Lewis said. ``The problem is no one ever gives you the
precise numbers,'' he said, ``or, at least, there is no way to know
if they are precise.''
</P>
<P>
   The planes used by the president and vice president are operated
by the Air Force. But Freedom of Information Act requests to the
Air Force about the cost of the fleet are routinely referred to the
White House, which is exempt from the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Catch-22 that works to their advantage,'' Lewis said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ross Perot _ mercifully absent from the national
political debate since he won only 8.5 percent of the vote in his
weird 1996 presidential bid _ reappeared live and still cranky on
C-Span Saturday before the small Reform Party convention.
</P>
<P>
   He should have tactfully remained at home, where hopefully he
will stay from now on. His was an obsolete speech at an irrelevant
convention.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a ballroom podium in Dearborn, Mich., to clusters of
empty chairs and 350 unenthusiastic delegates, slightly more than
half of the nearly 600 participants that organizers had
anticipated. The low turnout was unmistakable evidence that the
party he founded with great expectations less than a decade ago has
slipped drastically toward terminal impotence and disorganization.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult in retrospect to fathom how voters ever took
Perot seriously as a presidential alternative. Yet he drew 19
percent of the vote in his first White House run in 1992, which he
financed with $16.5 million, mostly his own money.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention he was at his peppery, patronizing worst. He
recycled his familiar, stale criticism of the political process and
touted his familiar, unrealistic and now mostly outdated reform
agenda. His scripted speech echoed the feeble effort to revive old
memories of a talk he gave in January 1998 at the National Press
Club here. Same words, same whines, same result. Thud.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, his staccato delivery and unsmiling demeanor were as
warm and fuzzy as a snare drum's rat-a-tat-tat. And as for shaking
friendly hands, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Old Ross, full of tired cliches and vague pieties.
Fortunately, there will be no New Ross. After he spoke, the Reform
Party kicked out his hand-picked team and handed the leadership to
allies of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. They promise to run a fresh
face for president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the only Reform Party candidate to hold a statewide
elected office, has taken what remains of the organization away
from Perot, who wasn't paying much attention to it anyway. Its
headquarters will be moved from Perot's home state of Texas to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If the party can be salvaged, it was the only thing to do. Perot
had been missing in action since his 1996 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't lobbied for his favorite causes. He watched mutely
while more practical, effective politicians took over the most
important issues, reshaped them and even translated some into law.
Although he threatened to run Reform Party candidates against
vulnerable members of Congress whose policies he didn't like, such
candidates never materialized. Perot failed to respond when Ventura
tried to contact him during his gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, Perot repeated his principal gripes,
including demands for a constitutional amendment to mandate a
balanced budget and compulsory congressional term limits. Hello?
Anyone upstairs there? The nation happens to have a balanced
budget, achieved without resorting to constitutional tinkering. And
the term limits notion has fallen from favor with former advocates,
who suddenly realized it means curtailing their own office-holding
days.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody, probably even Ventura, would much care about Perot
or his party except for the money. Because Perot won more than 5
percent of the 1996 vote, the party's 2000 presidential candidate
will qualify for $12.6 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   That's not much compared with the $37 million already raised by
Republican hopeful George W. Bush, but enough to get some
recognition, publicity and maybe more than 5 percent of the vote in
2000 to keep the subsidy game going. Ventura says he won't run for
president next year but hints he'd like to do so in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, post-Perot, is to find a credible presidential
candidate and develop some relevant issues. No third party has a
chance without some overwhelming theme that neither major party
candidate is properly addressing.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no burning issues on the horizon. These days both
Democrats and Republicans are trying to move to the middle and
become ideologically indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   So it may come down to whether Ventura and his allies can
recruit a presidential figurehead who will be taken seriously on
the strength of his own celebrity alone.
</P>
<P>
   They insist the party is liberal on social issues, conservative
on economic issues. That rules out refugees from losing right-wing
campaigns like Gary Bauer, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith and
commentator Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura likes former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr., an
ex-Republican and now an independent, but hardly anybody else does.
The hunt for new leadership will be complicated. How about a sports
figure? Another wrestler?
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, how about that marvelous Baltimore Oriole superstar
Cal Ripken Jr.? He'd get my vote any time.

 &HT;    INCUMBENCY HELPS GORE OFFSET MONEY GAP WITH BUSH
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the vice president arrived to campaign for the
presidency, Air Force Two taxied past the local television crews,
turning slowly to give the impression of a presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part of it, at least in the view of those
responsible for financing the expensive campaign, was that much of
the travel cost of the vice president and his staff was paid not by
the campaign treasury, but by the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the advantage Vice President George Bush had in 1988
over his Republican primary rivals and, ultimately, Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   And such is the advantage Vice President Al Gore will have when
he travels to Houston on Wednesday to address the annual convention
of the National Council of La Raza, which represents the key Latino
voting bloc in next year's presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was invited to deliver the keynote address to the
convention, and unless he makes an overt political pitch _ such as
``if elected, I promise ... `` _ or adds a campaign fund-raising
event to his schedule, his trip to Houston will be an official
expense of his vice presidential office.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he splits his time between official duties and political
activities, the Gore campaign will have to pay only for whatever
percentage of time he spends politicking.
</P>
<P>
   This formula is the one used by all modern presidents and vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of the many advantages that incumbents have in
politics today,'' said Meredith McGehee, vice president and
legislative director of Common Cause, a public policy organization
that promotes campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Another major advantage is the free national media exposure
office-holders attract just by doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, has contended that his
record-setting pace for raising money is aimed in part at
offsetting the advantage of such perks for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Through June, Bush had raised about $37 million to Gore's $19
million, and the governor has announced he will refuse federal
matching funds in order to avoid limits on what he can spend.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``some legitimacy'' to Bush's argument, McGehee said.
``But does it justify the current arms race? I don't think so,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's like an army every time Gore lands, much of it
taxpayer-subsidized,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of
the Center for Public Integrity, a political watchdog organization
founded in 1989. ``But I have a hard time reaching for my
handerchief to shed a tear for George Bush and his $37 million _
and it's only July.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the perks of incumbency at the White House are ``far
from a partisan issue,'' since ``it's been going on a long time,''
from one administration to another, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Salazar, spokesman for the Gore campaign, said it is ``a

precise numbers,'' he said, ``or, at least, there is no way to know
if they are precise.''
</P>
<P>
   The planes used by the president and vice president are operated
by the Air Force. But Freedom of Information Act requests to the
Air Force about the cost of the fleet are routinely referred to the
White House, which is exempt from the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Catch-22 that works to their advantage,'' Lewis said.

 &HT;    Mother of cop killer offers regrets
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Relatives of the man who killed two Cobb County
policemen over the weekend offered their sympathy Monday to the
families of the slain officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family sends its deepest regrets and heartfelt condolences
to the families of the slain and injured officers. Our thoughts and
prayers will continue to be with them,'' the family of Greg Smith
wrote in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely devastated by the tragic events that led to
the death of Cobb County Police Officer Stephen Gilner and Sgt.
Steve Reeves.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Smith started the standoff at about 6 p.m.
Friday by shooting a Cobb police officer five times at his house.
Five hours later, two Cobb SWAT team members were killed after they
burst into Smith's house.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff ended just before 10 a.m. Saturday when a police
officer shot and killed Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are profoundly saddened by the loss of one of our
family members, Greg Smith, we are eternally thankful that another
family member, Mildred Smith, came out without serious injury,''
the Smith family said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors treated Mildred Smith on Saturday morning for tear-gas
inhalation. She's now staying with family. On Sunday, her brother
and two cousins ventured into her house to get some clothes for
Mildred Smith and a suit in which they will bury her son.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Smith also went to her home on Sunday, but only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, Patti Barnett walked over to Mildred Smith in
her car, leaned in, and gave her a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional for both of them,'' said Cinnamon Callihan,
Mrs. Barnett's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Barnett's husband, Jerald, who summoned police to
the Smith's house after he and Greg Smith scuffled on Friday.
Jerald Smith had wondered how Mildred Smith, his friend and
neighbor of more than 20 years, would react to him.
</P>
<P>
   Callihan said that Mildred Smith told the Barnetts that she does
not blame them.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors are pitching in to show Mildred Smith that they want
her to come home. Andrews watered Mrs. Smith's tulips, azaleas and
petunias, and several neighbors have offered their skills and money
to help Smith repair her house.

KISS OF REBIRTH: ROCK'S LONGEST-RUNNING SIDE SHOW IS BACK ON TOP

entertainment package.)

package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Kiss with James DeBello, Edward Furlong,
Sam Huntington and Guiseppe Andrews in a scene from ``Detroit Rock
City.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's not your typical rock crowd.
 &HT;    Outside Chicago's posh Oak Brook Marriott Hotel, middle-aged,
overweight women in black bustiers and leather miniskirts jostle
with pimple-faced teen-age boys clasping old vinyl albums in death
grips.
 &HT;    It figures that they're waiting for Gene Simmons, lizard-tongued
ringleader of the still-outrageous band, Kiss.
 &HT;    ``I don't know why, but he's still the sexiest,'' says a
45-year-old waitress who claims to have Simmons' face tattooed on
her left breast. ``I've been waiting here for six hours just to
catch a glimpse.''
 &HT;    Mission accomplished: Accompanied by bandmate Paul Stanley, the
49-year-old bass player emerges in black-leather pants, a
black-leather vest and a crisp, white T-shirt, and stops to oblige
his fans.
 &HT;    ``They still want you,'' Stanley says.
 &HT;    ``I know,'' Simmons replies with a satisfied smile.
 &HT;    Actually, these days everyone seems to want him. Kiss has a new
movie opening on Aug. 13 _ ``Detroit Rock City,'' a 1970s saga
about four kids struggling to get to a concert by their favorite
band, you-know-who. The Fox network has a Kiss cartoon in the
works. NBC is planning a miniseries about the band's history. And
then there's Warriors of Kiss, the band's own WCW wrestling team.
 &HT;    ``We are like cockroaches,'' Simmons boasts. ``We will never go
away.''
 &HT;    Not bad for arguably the world's most critically despised rock
band.
 &HT;    ``Look, we're about to enter 30 years of Kiss on this planet,''
Simmons says, ``which proves that critics mean nothing _ they're
crap.
 &HT;    ``Look at stupid food critics,'' he adds. ``They're always
talking about what we should eat. I ask, `When is the last time
anyone actually ate frog's legs or dinosaur's lips?' This nation
wants hamburgers.
 &HT;    ``The rock group Kiss? Well, we're hamburgers.''
 &HT;    If so, ``Detroit Rock City'' may turn out to be Kiss' equivalent
of the Big Mac.
 &HT;    ``It's very much like `The Wizard of Oz,''' Simmons says.
``These kids realize they are not in Kansas anymore. We're just the
four guys who put them on the Yellow Brick Road _ and I am the
wizard.''
 &HT;    The film's focus on the fans _ led by Edward Furlong, of
``Terminator 2'' (1991) _ is no accident, Simmons adds.
 &HT;    ``The statement we want to make with the movie is that, without
the fans, we wouldn't be here in the first place,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``I still think that Kiss fans are literally the craziest people
you will ever meet on this planet,'' Simmons adds. ``They paint
their faces up. They tattoo my face on their bodies. They hold
their own Kiss conventions. There are Kiss tribute bands with the
makeup and everything.
 &HT;    ``They are clearly one of a kind,'' he concludes. ``Any band
would give their left nut _ and I mean that in the nicest way _ to
have our fans.''
 &HT;    Those fans first appeared in the early 1970s when, influenced by
his love of horror movies, the Israeli-born Simmons teamed with New
Yorker Stanley to form Kiss. Among their subsequent string of hits
_ good for more than 80 million albums sold _ were ``Rock and Roll
All Nite,'' ``Shout It Out Loud'' and ``Beth.''
 &HT;    But even while they were earning as much as $100 million a year,
all was not well with Kiss. In 1979, substance-abuse problems
forced Simmons and Stanley to oust the other two founding members,
Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.
 &HT;    ``We think of this band like an Olympic team. We want only the
best of the best,'' Simmons says. ``Anyone who doesn't meet the
requirements of being the best is out on his ass, and that included
Ace and Peter in the days when they were self-destructive. And I
don't care how much money was involved.''
 &HT;    In the aftermath of their departure, however, the band faltered.
As new-wave and punk music took hold in the 1980s, Kiss sales
plummeted. By 1983 the band was reduced to scrapping its makeup and
distinctive costumes for a comeback that fizzled.
 &HT;    ``People lost their passion for us,'' Simmons says and shrugs.
``You can't fake passion _ it's either there or it isn't.''
 &HT;    Ironically, however, it was even newer trends that ultimately
put Kiss back on the musical map. A new generation of musicians,
ranging from Nirvana to Garth Brooks and Mark Chesnutt, declared
themselves fans and cited Kiss albums as influences. Their fans
started to take notice of the band, and suddenly Kiss songs were
back on the radio.
 &HT;    A 1996 comeback tour _ featuring a by-now-rehabilitated Frehley
and Criss _ sold out in venues across America and Europe, dazzling
even Simmons.
 &HT;    ``This band is obsolete-proof,'' he says, citing audiences of
65,000 in Mexico City and 75,000 in Buenos Aires earlier this year.
 &HT;    ``I landed at the airport in Buenos Aires, which is the end of
the earth, and I was shocked,'' Simmons recalls. ``It was like
Beatlemania. I couldn't get through customs _ fans were hurling
themselves over barricades. Even the cops, who were supposed to be
our human shields, were asking us, `El autographo, Mr. Kiss?'''
 &HT;    Unlike many rock veterans, Simmons freely admits to enjoying the
perks of stardom. He even keeps a file of the many women he has
encountered on tour.
 &HT;    ``One day when I'm 80,'' he says, ``I'll be able to look back
and smile.''
 &HT;    He may be 49 and living in the age of AIDS, he says, but it's
still a blast to be a rock star.
 &HT;    ``Girls still want to have sex with me,'' he says frankly. ``It
hasn't changed a bit. The one thing with AIDS is that you must wear
condoms _ period.
 &HT;    ``The only other choice is abstinence,'' he adds. ``And I still
want to have a good time before I'm breathing dust six feet
under.''
 &HT;    Actually, he says, his sexual appetite may have helped keep him
from worse dangers that have plagued other rockers.
 &HT;    ``I didn't do drugs or drink, because someone once told me that
your penis doesn't work when you are wasted,'' he explains. ``The
women meant too much to me to let that happen.''
 &HT;    For all his wild persona, however, at home in Benedict Canyon,
outside of Los Angeles, Simmons lives a fairly stable life, raising
his two children with his longtime girlfriend, actress Shannon
Tweed.
 &HT;    But no, they've never married.
 &HT;    ``I'm crazy about her,'' Simmons says, ``but getting married
never entered into it. I don't want to play that game.''
 &HT;    ``The only thing wrong with marriage is one of the two people
getting married is a man,'' he adds, laughing.
 &HT;    ``Monogamy is not the nature of the beast,'' he says more
seriously. ``Man was meant to roam. It's part of our gene pool to
go over the hill and see what's going on over there.''
 &HT;    All the same, he says, he enjoys being a father.
 &HT;    ``I go to parent-teacher conferences like any other father,''
Simmons says. ``It's cool. During an Easter play once at school, I
got to play the ghoul.''
 &HT;    And then there was that special homework assignment ...
 &HT;    ``Once every kid in class had to bring in a picture of his mom
or dad doing something interesting at work,'' Simmons recalls,
laughing. ``Well, my kid brought in this thing of me spitting blood
into a crowd.
 &HT;    ``What other kid could top it?''

LIFE AFTER PEE-WEE: PAUL REUBENS, MYSTERY MAN 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Paul Reubens in a scene from ``Mystery
Men.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I have to say,'' the Artist Formerly Known as Pee-Wee Herman
admits, ``I felt a little cheap and dirty.''
 &HT;    No, no, not about that.
 &HT;    Paul Reubens, years past his Pee-Wee days, is talking about his
latest role _ The Spleen, a zit-faced superhero wannabe with a
unique superpower: He can break wind with lethal accuracy. The
Spleen does it often in ``Mystery Men,'' an action/comedy due in
theaters on Aug. 6, and it elicits raucous chuckles every time.
 &HT;    ``A fart,'' Reubens says, ``is such an easy way to get a
laugh.''
 &HT;    Looking natty in a gray suit and blue shirt during a
conversation at New York's Rihga Royal Hotel, Reubens grins coyly
as he faces the press for the first time in years. Clearly
uncomfortable, he speaks so softly he's almost whispering, but the
47-year-old actor is giving the publicity whirl his best shot.
 &HT;    ``Let's see how this goes,'' Reubens says. ``It's been a while
since I've done a press junket.''
 &HT;    Actually, the last time Reubens consented to talk he was still
in Pee-Wee mode, and insisted on conducting interviews as Pee-Wee.
 &HT;    ``It takes less time to get ready now,'' Reubens says. ``But
it's not as easy, because I could hide behind the character.''
 &HT;    No one would want to hide behind The Spleen. In ``Mystery Men,''
the creepy guy joins forces with Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The
Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), Invisible
Boy (Kel Mitchell), The Shoveler (William H. Macy) and The Sphinx
(Wes Studi) to protect Champion City after archvillain Casanova
Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps resident superhero Captain
Amazing (Greg Kinnear).
 &HT;    ``I liked the idea,'' Reubens says. ``I hadn't seen it before. I
loved the cast that was assembled by the time I came into it, and I
thought the script was fun, smart and goofy all at the same time.''
 &HT;    The Spleen gets less attention than some of ``Mystery Men's''
other super-losers, Reubens admits, but he insists that he didn't
have to resist any temptation to steal scenes or ham it up in order
to make the most of his screen time and be noticed by audiences.
 &HT;    ``I felt I was playing the character as kind of slow,'' he says,
``but when I saw the movie it didn't seem like that at all. I don't
know what that says.''
 &HT;    Reubens smiles.
 &HT;    ``Most of what I do is be there,'' he says. ``I'm just kind of
there, and that's how I approached it. I didn't think, `How do I
make my mark? What do I do?'
 &HT;    ``Particularly with this group of people, it would have been a
disaster if any of us did that,'' the actor adds. ``It was really
an ensemble situation, and we were giving each other material and
ideas.
 &HT;    ``This could have been a really difficult movie if all of these
high-profile people came in and said, `How do I make my mark in
this scene?' or stole focus,'' he says. ``I was looking for
material, things to do when I was on camera, but I didn't worry
about making a mark.''
 &HT;    Reubens knows about making his mark. It was 21 years ago, as a
member of the well-known, Los Angeles-based improv-comedy troupe
The Groundlings, that he introduced Pee-Wee. He later made the
character a key part of his hit nightclub act, then took Pee-Wee on
the road, appearing at comedy clubs and on the major late-night
talk shows.
 &HT;    The goofy one reached the silver screen with Tim Burton's
surprise hit, ``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' (1985), and by 1986
Reubens was starring in ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse,'' a colorful,
critically acclaimed children's-television program that ran for
five years and won three Emmy Awards.
 &HT;    Pee-Weemania swept the country, capturing children and adults
alike. He turned up everywhere, from lunch boxes to plush dolls,
and fans of all ages parroted such Pee-Wee nuggets as ``I know you
are, but what am I?''
 &HT;    In short, Pee-Wee was a star, even if Paul Reubens was still a
virtual unknown.
 &HT;    ``I oftentimes thought that maybe I should change my name to
Pee-Wee Herman,'' says Reubens, who was born Paul Rubenfeld in
Oneonta, N.Y., and raised in Sarasota, Fla. ``Most people think
that's my name. Seriously. It might have just been smarter to drop
the Paul Reubens thing and be Pee-Wee. But I didn't want to do
that.''
 &HT;    In retrospect, he says, he's proud of what he accomplished
during the Pee-Wee era.
 &HT;    ``I don't look back fondly on the amount of work it was,
particularly the kids' show,'' he says. ``But as it gets further
away it seems like less work.
 &HT;    ``I hoped `Pee-Wee's Playhouse' would be something special,'' he
adds. ``It was patterned after shows that I felt did, like `Captain
Kangaroo,' `The Mickey Mouse Club' and `Howdy Doody.'
 &HT;    ``I felt my show was a modern version of those shows.''
 &HT;    The Pee-Wee craze had already started to wane on July 26, 1991,
when Reubens was arrested for exposing himself in a Sarasota movie
theater while watching a porn film.
 &HT;    Many actors have survived worse episodes, but not as stars of
child-oriented television shows. Though Reubens bravely turned up
as Pee-Wee on the MTV Awards soon after _ asking ``Heard any good
jokes lately?'' _ the scandal effectively killed the character.
 &HT;    For a while Reubens maintained a low profile, then began to turn
up in such films as ``Batman Returns'' (1992), ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' (1992) _ his best post-Pee-Wee role, as a campy vampire _
and ``Buddy'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I sort of do what comes my way, what somebody wants me to do
or what I like,'' Reubens says. ``I realize that this is perceived,
maybe, as a comeback, and that's great. But I don't feel that _ I
don't think about it that way.''
 &HT;    Reubens will next be seen as a ``murderer/bank robber/rapist''
in ``South of Heaven, West of Hell,'' a road movie directed by
actor/singer Dwight Yoakam. He also hopes to star in ``The Pee-Wee
Herman Story,'' which he cryptically refers to as a ``fake
autobiographical'' feature.
 &HT;    Growing up, Reubens recalls, all he ever wanted to do was act.
He didn't dream of fame and, unfortunately, hadn't a clue about the
fickle nature of stardom.
 &HT;    ``It would be interesting to have a little seminar in Hollywood
for people starting to get famous,'' he says, ``to explain some of
the things you might want to know.
 &HT;    ``Fame is really odd,'' he continues. ``After you've been famous
for a while and you meet people who are just starting to become
famous, it's all the same stuff. So it would be great to have a
little manual with some tips.''
 &HT;    Reubens pauses.
 &HT;    ``There are two schools,'' he adds. ``Some people love being
famous and they really enjoy it ... ''
 &HT;    The sentence goes unfinished.
 &HT;    ``I'm not complaining, whatsoever,'' he says quietly. ``I'm just
not in that school.''

MICHELLE WILLIAMS, FROM `DAWSON'S CREEK' TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Michelle Williams with Kirsten Dunst in
a scene from ``Dick.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Like it or hate it, you have to admit that ``Dawson's Creek''
isn't a particularly funny show.
 &HT;    So it's no wonder that ``Dawson's'' star Michelle Williams was
antsy about her movie ``Dick,'' a madcap, Watergate-era satire that
opens Aug. 6.
 &HT;    ``I've never thought I was very good at making people laugh,''
she says. ``There's something about it that has always terrified
me. I decided that doing something I found scary would, hopefully,
give me a sense of accomplishment. I didn't want to let fear rule
my career choices.''
 &HT;    In the film, Williams and Kirsten Dunst play a couple of ditzy
teen-agers who are thrilled to meet President Richard Nixon, only
to find themselves swept up in the emerging Watergate scandal.
 &HT;    ``I just gave myself over to this kind of silly playfulness and
it got easier and easier,'' she says. ``The '70s outfits they gave
me to wear helped _ there was a lot of fluorescent orange and
yellow, which are definitely not my colors, but it was sort of good
to feel you looked ridiculous. You put on those clothes and you
just get funny.''
 &HT;    Williams' character, Arlene, develops a crush on the president
after she and her best friend are hired as presidential
dog-walkers. But don't expect anything like the Monica Lewinsky
affair to ensue.
 &HT;    ``I don't think there was anything sexual at all in Arlene's
attraction to Nixon,'' Williams says quickly. ``She was just sort
of looking for a father figure, and the president was an ideal to
her.''
 &HT;    In one hilarious scene, Arlene discovers Nixon's famous tape
recorder in his secretary's desk. She records a love message to the
president, and even bursts into song.
 &HT;    ``I loved that scene,'' she says. ``I could just picture myself
being an idiot like that. Since the singing was supposed to be
funny, I got a kick out of it.''
 &HT;    Williams also enjoyed working with Dunst, who plays Arlene's
slightly hipper girlfriend.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes we were laughing so hard we could barely get through
a take,'' she recalls. ``I think at one point I stuck a pin in my
finger to keep from giggling.
 &HT;    ``Kirsten and I have remained really good friends,'' she adds.
``I was just blown away by the fact that she's so unjaded, even
though she's been acting for years. Every few weeks we call and
check up on each other.''
 &HT;    ``Dick'' may stretch Williams' comic abilities, but it was her
dramatic capabilities that were recently tested in the Off-Broadway
play ``Killer Joe.'' She delivered a wrenching, critically
acclaimed performance as the virgin daughter of a trailer-park
family who is sexually abused and ends up killing her father and
brother.
 &HT;    One particularly brutal scene called for her to stand on stage
stark naked _ which may seem daunting, but Williams says it wasn't.
 &HT;    ``Taking off my clothes was really freeing for me,'' the actress
says.
 &HT;    ``I think doing that play was one of those experiences that
really changed who I am as a person and an actor,'' she adds. ``I
had to go through a lot of self-examination and introspection _ I
saw myself as I hadn't before. I was scared by it and I didn't know
how to deal with it at first. Now I think I'm more comfortable.''
 &HT;    It's been a fast ride to success for the 18-year-old Williams.
Only three years ago, after having made her debut at 12 in the
independent film ``Friends'' (1993) with James Earl Jones, she left
her parents in San Diego to live alone in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``I guess I was a little naive, and my mother certainly wasn't
thrilled,'' she recalls. ``I did some stupid, crazy things _ but I
think, in a way, that prepared me for what's coming now. Everybody
has to wrestle with their demons.
 &HT;    ``Hindsight is great,'' she adds with a smile. ``The risk of
being alone in L.A. at 15 is enormous. But I thought I was
invincible. I had a lot of growing up to do, and I slammed it into
a couple of short years. Fortunately I've always had a lot of
determination _ that's my survival skill.''
 &HT;    Williams was simply another struggling actress until she got the
part of Jen, the urban teen-ager whose frank sexuality shakes up
small-town conventionality in ``Dawson's Creek.''
 &HT;    ``The series has changed my life,'' she says. ``Not so much
creatively as in the way you're suddenly so well-known. It doesn't
shock and scare me now as much as it used to.''
 &HT;    In fact, Williams found her recent birthday more unsettling than
her celebrity.
 &HT;    ``I was pretty scared of turning 18,'' she says. ``I had huge
anxiety about it. It seemed like such a milestone, because that's
the time when most kids are getting a job or going to college. I
realized I'd already been through all the things that come with
being 18 _ it seemed like a letdown.''
 &HT;    Williams is currently working on ``If These Walls Could Talk
2,'' a three-part drama which focuses on the lesbian experience in
America.
 &HT;    ``I'm a girl in the lesbian-feminist movement in the '70s,'' she
says. ``It's such a challenge to represent a time that was so
important and personal for thousands of women. It was their
struggle, their passion in life. I knew I had to stay true to
that.''
 &HT;    As for a love scene with co-star Chloe Sevigny, Williams insists
that it won't be especially challenging.
 &HT;    ``We're going to film it soon,'' she says. ``I feel comfortable
about it. I'm not nearly as nervous or hesitant as if I were going
to be doing it with a man.''
 &HT;    Williams will soon pack up and head back to North Carolina,
where ``Dawson's Creek'' is filmed. She isn't sure what the season
ahead holds for her character, but she does have some ideas.
 &HT;    ``I was thinking about that the other day,'' she says. ``I'd
like to see Jen have a job. I'd like her to have some passion and
fire about something she believes in, like politics.
 &HT;    ``I want her to rise above that plateau we've reached, which is
basically drinking-and-sex and sex-and-drinking,'' the actress
adds. ``I think it would great if she'd get a little more involved
in the world.
 &HT;    ``On the other hand,'' she says, ``if you really take yourself
back to being a teen-ager, there is a lot of angst _ your life is
full of humiliation and tumult. It is one hell of a ride.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jane Leeves in a scene from
``Frasier.'') 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Leeves knows funny when she sees it. The English actress'
resume includes stints with Benny Hill, Monty Python and Jerry
Seinfeld, not to mention her current gig, as ``Frasier's'' daffy
physical therapist, Daphne Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Funny has been good to Leeves, who at 23 came to Los Angeles
from England with little professional experience and even less
cash. She studied hard, starved a little and soon landed the
recurring role of Audrey, Miles Silverberg's flighty girlfriend on
``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came her memorable ``Seinfeld'' turn as Marla, the sweet
virgin who rejects Jerry, and then Daphne. To round things off, she
married the boss, and has been blissfully wed to
matinee-idol-handsome Paramount executive Marshall Coben since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Five seasons into ``Frasier,'' Leeves is a seasoned pro with her
own production company _ Bristol Cities, and more on that later _
and a major motion picture to boot: Wes Craven's
soon-to-be-released ``The Music of My Heart,'' which stars her
childhood idol, Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's a dream come true for someone who says that as
early as age 5 she'd decided to become a performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't honestly remember ever wanting to do anything else but
be in the spotlight,'' she says, ``which is really so strange,
because my family have always accused me of being too shy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shy'' is hardly the word for anyone bold enough to perform
with the famously raunchy Hill _ but Leeves reports that his
offscreen personality was much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me to audition at his home,'' she recalls, ``which
sounds very strange, but really wasn't. He answered the door in his
pajamas, with a can of air freshener in his hand. Apparently he'd
had a few of his work buddies over the night before, and he was
frantically running around spraying everything to get rid of the
smell of all the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proceeded to audition for him while he was in his pajamas,''
Leeves says, ``and he kept running into another room to bring out
more skits for us to try. It was very bizarre, but he was a very
charming, lovely man.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeves also worked as a dancer on ``Monty Python's The Meaning
of Life'' (1983), which she recalls as a treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single girl dancer had a crush on Terry Jones _ which is
kind of strange, because he's the one who always dressed up like a
woman,'' she says. ``But we all found him terribly sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham Chapman, I remember, was extremely sweet and kind,
because we wore these extremely uncomfortable costumes, and he
would run around saying, `They need a rest!' He really took care of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though her career in England was beginning to unfold, Leeves
decided to head for Hollywood, even if it meant virtually starting
from scratch. She arrived in Los Angeles almost penniless, signed
up for a drama class _ where she met an intimidating roster of
fellow students that included Jim Carrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Adam
Sandler, Winona Ryder and Molly Ringwald _ and began her rounds of
auditions.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, she says she's astounded at her own courage in
coming to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, it was the best thing I ever did,'' she says,
``but it was very scary. My first year here was most horrifying and
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well, however, and ``Frasier'' seems an
ideal match for the actress' comic talents. The role of Daphne fits
her as if it had been written for her _ as indeed it was, to a
considerable extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the details came from me,'' she says. ``I created
much of her background before we shot the pilot. I tried to imagine
where this woman was coming from and what kind of family life she'd
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers were asking questions like, `Does she have any
brothers or sisters?''' Leeves recalls. ``And I said, straight
away, `Oh yes, eight brothers. She's the only girl in a family of
eight boys, and they used to roughhouse with her and push her
around.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that helped explain why she was so comfortable with the
Cranes, because she was used to dealing with guys. She knows how to
handle them and whack them across the head when necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The question Leeves hears most often is, ``What's going to
happen with Daphne and Niles?'' But she insists that she's happy to
be asked _ ``because it proves that people are invested in it'' _
though she can't provide any inside information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dying to know myself,'' she says, ``but I do believe we
will see some action in that area. I don't think there will be any
more teasing. I sense that, by the end of next season, they will
somehow be together.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Grammer, who has battled alcohol problems and rumors of
prima-donna behavior, Leeves says that he's actually the ideal star
as far as she's concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``On other shows, I understand, it's made quite clear that the
star is the star,'' she says. ``But Kelsey is constantly saying,
`Give me less to do and give everyone else more to do.' He just
loves it when the rest of us are out in front getting a big
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hyde-Pierce, who plays Niles, is equally congenial, she
adds. In fact, she says, the entire cast is a delight to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't stand a chance on our set with any ego,'' she
says, laughing. ``For one thing, John Mahoney would put you right
in your place!''
</P>
<P>
   Leeves recently joined forces with another ``Frasier'' cast
member, Peri Gilpin, to form a production company to develop roles
for themselves and others. As has become widely known, its name
includes a subtle joke of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decided to form the company,'' Leeves says, giggling,
``Peri and I were told that it would be smart to pick a name that
suggested it was run by two women. Well, we couldn't think of a
thing, so as a joke I suggested `Bristol Cities,' and she said,
`Oh, that certainly sounds like an independent movie company, what
does it mean?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I explained that it's actually Cockney rhyming slang for
`titties!'''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, Leeves adds, her personal life is going even better
than her career _ she describes herself as ``very, very, very, very
happily married.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, she says, her biggest worry derives from the simple
fact that she's actually realized virtually everything she dreamed
about back when she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty scary,'' she says. ``It's really tough when you're
so happy, because you keep thinking, `Please don't let anybody
disturb this or take it away from me!'''
</P>

City.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's not your typical rock crowd.
 &HT;    Outside Chicago's posh Oak Brook Marriott Hotel, middle-aged,
overweight women in black bustiers and leather miniskirts jostle
with pimple-faced teen-age boys clasping old vinyl albums in death
grips.
 &HT;    It figures that they're waiting for Gene Simmons, lizard-tongued
ringleader of the still-outrageous band, Kiss.
 &HT;    ``I don't know why, but he's still the sexiest,'' says a
45-year-old waitress who claims to have Simmons' face tattooed on
her left breast. ``I've been waiting here for six hours just to
catch a glimpse.''
 &HT;    Mission accomplished: Accompanied by bandmate Paul Stanley, the
49-year-old bass player emerges in black-leather pants, a
black-leather vest and a crisp, white T-shirt, and stops to oblige
his fans.
 &HT;    ``They still want you,'' Stanley says.
 &HT;    ``I know,'' Simmons replies with a satisfied smile.
 &HT;    Actually, these days everyone seems to want him. Kiss has a new
movie opening on Aug. 13 _ ``Detroit Rock City,'' a 1970s saga
about four kids struggling to get to a concert by their favorite
band, you-know-who. The Fox network has a Kiss cartoon in the
works. NBC is planning a miniseries about the band's history. And
then there's Warriors of Kiss, the band's own WCW wrestling team.
 &HT;    ``We are like cockroaches,'' Simmons boasts. ``We will never go
away.''
 &HT;    Not bad for arguably the world's most critically despised rock
band.
 &HT;    ``Look, we're about to enter 30 years of Kiss on this planet,''
Simmons says, ``which proves that critics mean nothing _ they're
crap.
 &HT;    ``Look at stupid food critics,'' he adds. ``They're always
talking about what we should eat. I ask, `When is the last time
anyone actually ate frog's legs or dinosaur's lips?' This nation
wants hamburgers.
 &HT;    ``The rock group Kiss? Well, we're hamburgers.''
 &HT;    If so, ``Detroit Rock City'' may turn out to be Kiss' equivalent
of the Big Mac.
 &HT;    ``It's very much like `The Wizard of Oz,''' Simmons says.
``These kids realize they are not in Kansas anymore. We're just the
four guys who put them on the Yellow Brick Road _ and I am the
wizard.''
 &HT;    The film's focus on the fans _ led by Edward Furlong, of
``Terminator 2'' (1991) _ is no accident, Simmons adds.
 &HT;    ``The statement we want to make with the movie is that, without
the fans, we wouldn't be here in the first place,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``I still think that Kiss fans are literally the craziest people
you will ever meet on this planet,'' Simmons adds. ``They paint
their faces up. They tattoo my face on their bodies. They hold
their own Kiss conventions. There are Kiss tribute bands with the
makeup and everything.
 &HT;    ``They are clearly one of a kind,'' he concludes. ``Any band
would give their left nut _ and I mean that in the nicest way _ to
have our fans.''
 &HT;    Those fans first appeared in the early 1970s when, influenced by
his love of horror movies, the Israeli-born Simmons teamed with New
Yorker Stanley to form Kiss. Among their subsequent string of hits
_ good for more than 80 million albums sold _ were ``Rock and Roll
All Nite,'' ``Shout It Out Loud'' and ``Beth.''
 &HT;    But even while they were earning as much as $100 million a year,
all was not well with Kiss. In 1979, substance-abuse problems
forced Simmons and Stanley to oust the other two founding members,
Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.
 &HT;    ``We think of this band like an Olympic team. We want only the
best of the best,'' Simmons says. ``Anyone who doesn't meet the
requirements of being the best is out on his ass, and that included
Ace and Peter in the days when they were self-destructive. And I
don't care how much money was involved.''
 &HT;    In the aftermath of their departure, however, the band faltered.
As new-wave and punk music took hold in the 1980s, Kiss sales
plummeted. By 1983 the band was reduced to scrapping its makeup and
distinctive costumes for a comeback that fizzled.
 &HT;    ``People lost their passion for us,'' Simmons says and shrugs.
``You can't fake passion _ it's either there or it isn't.''
 &HT;    Ironically, however, it was even newer trends that ultimately
put Kiss back on the musical map. A new generation of musicians,
ranging from Nirvana to Garth Brooks and Mark Chesnutt, declared
themselves fans and cited Kiss albums as influences. Their fans
started to take notice of the band, and suddenly Kiss songs were
back on the radio.
 &HT;    A 1996 comeback tour _ featuring a by-now-rehabilitated Frehley
and Criss _ sold out in venues across America and Europe, dazzling
even Simmons.
 &HT;    ``This band is obsolete-proof,'' he says, citing audiences of
65,000 in Mexico City and 75,000 in Buenos Aires earlier this year.
 &HT;    ``I landed at the airport in Buenos Aires, which is the end of
the earth, and I was shocked,'' Simmons recalls. ``It was like
Beatlemania. I couldn't get through customs _ fans were hurling
themselves over barricades. Even the cops, who were supposed to be
our human shields, were asking us, `El autographo, Mr. Kiss?'''
 &HT;    Unlike many rock veterans, Simmons freely admits to enjoying the
perks of stardom. He even keeps a file of the many women he has
encountered on tour.
 &HT;    ``One day when I'm 80,'' he says, ``I'll be able to look back
and smile.''
 &HT;    He may be 49 and living in the age of AIDS, he says, but it's
still a blast to be a rock star.
 &HT;    ``Girls still want to have sex with me,'' he says frankly. ``It
hasn't changed a bit. The one thing with AIDS is that you must wear
condoms _ period.
 &HT;    ``The only other choice is abstinence,'' he adds. ``And I still
want to have a good time before I'm breathing dust six feet
under.''
 &HT;    Actually, he says, his sexual appetite may have helped keep him
from worse dangers that have plagued other rockers.
 &HT;    ``I didn't do drugs or drink, because someone once told me that
your penis doesn't work when you are wasted,'' he explains. ``The
women meant too much to me to let that happen.''
 &HT;    For all his wild persona, however, at home in Benedict Canyon,
outside of Los Angeles, Simmons lives a fairly stable life, raising
his two children with his longtime girlfriend, actress Shannon
Tweed.
 &HT;    But no, they've never married.
 &HT;    ``I'm crazy about her,'' Simmons says, ``but getting married
never entered into it. I don't want to play that game.''
 &HT;    ``The only thing wrong with marriage is one of the two people
getting married is a man,'' he adds, laughing.
 &HT;    ``Monogamy is not the nature of the beast,'' he says more
seriously. ``Man was meant to roam. It's part of our gene pool to
go over the hill and see what's going on over there.''
 &HT;    All the same, he says, he enjoys being a father.
 &HT;    ``I go to parent-teacher conferences like any other father,''
Simmons says. ``It's cool. During an Easter play once at school, I
got to play the ghoul.''
 &HT;    And then there was that special homework assignment ...
 &HT;    ``Once every kid in class had to bring in a picture of his mom
or dad doing something interesting at work,'' Simmons recalls,
laughing. ``Well, my kid brought in this thing of me spitting blood
into a crowd.
 &HT;    ``What other kid could top it?''

LIFE AFTER PEE-WEE: PAUL REUBENS, MYSTERY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Paul Reubens in a scene from ``Mystery
Men.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I have to say,'' the Artist Formerly Known as Pee-Wee Herman
admits, ``I felt a little cheap and dirty.''
 &HT;    No, no, not about that.
 &HT;    Paul Reubens, years past his Pee-Wee days, is talking about his
latest role _ The Spleen, a zit-faced superhero wannabe with a
unique superpower: He can break wind with lethal accuracy. The
Spleen does it often in ``Mystery Men,'' an action/comedy due in
theaters on Aug. 6, and it elicits raucous chuckles every time.
 &HT;    ``A fart,'' Reubens says, ``is such an easy way to get a
laugh.''
 &HT;    Looking natty in a gray suit and blue shirt during a
conversation at New York's Rihga Royal Hotel, Reubens grins coyly
as he faces the press for the first time in years. Clearly
uncomfortable, he speaks so softly he's almost whispering, but the
47-year-old actor is giving the publicity whirl his best shot.
 &HT;    ``Let's see how this goes,'' Reubens says. ``It's been a while
since I've done a press junket.''
 &HT;    Actually, the last time Reubens consented to talk he was still
in Pee-Wee mode, and insisted on conducting interviews as Pee-Wee.
 &HT;    ``It takes less time to get ready now,'' Reubens says. ``But
it's not as easy, because I could hide behind the character.''
 &HT;    No one would want to hide behind The Spleen. In ``Mystery Men,''
the creepy guy joins forces with Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The
Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), Invisible
Boy (Kel Mitchell), The Shoveler (William H. Macy) and The Sphinx
(Wes Studi) to protect Champion City after archvillain Casanova
Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps resident superhero Captain
Amazing (Greg Kinnear).
 &HT;    ``I liked the idea,'' Reubens says. ``I hadn't seen it before. I
loved the cast that was assembled by the time I came into it, and I
thought the script was fun, smart and goofy all at the same time.''
 &HT;    The Spleen gets less attention than some of ``Mystery Men's''
other super-losers, Reubens admits, but he insists that he didn't
have to resist any temptation to steal scenes or ham it up in order
to make the most of his screen time and be noticed by audiences.
 &HT;    ``I felt I was playing the character as kind of slow,'' he says,
``but when I saw the movie it didn't seem like that at all. I don't
know what that says.''
 &HT;    Reubens smiles.
 &HT;    ``Most of what I do is be there,'' he says. ``I'm just kind of
there, and that's how I approached it. I didn't think, `How do I
make my mark? What do I do?'
 &HT;    ``Particularly with this group of people, it would have been a
disaster if any of us did that,'' the actor adds. ``It was really
an ensemble situation, and we were giving each other material and
ideas.
 &HT;    ``This could have been a really difficult movie if all of these
high-profile people came in and said, `How do I make my mark in
this scene?' or stole focus,'' he says. ``I was looking for
material, things to do when I was on camera, but I didn't worry
about making a mark.''
 &HT;    Reubens knows about making his mark. It was 21 years ago, as a
member of the well-known, Los Angeles-based improv-comedy troupe
The Groundlings, that he introduced Pee-Wee. He later made the
character a key part of his hit nightclub act, then took Pee-Wee on
the road, appearing at comedy clubs and on the major late-night
talk shows.
 &HT;    The goofy one reached the silver screen with Tim Burton's
surprise hit, ``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' (1985), and by 1986
Reubens was starring in ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse,'' a colorful,
critically acclaimed children's-television program that ran for
five years and won three Emmy Awards.
 &HT;    Pee-Weemania swept the country, capturing children and adults
alike. He turned up everywhere, from lunch boxes to plush dolls,
and fans of all ages parroted such Pee-Wee nuggets as ``I know you
are, but what am I?''
 &HT;    In short, Pee-Wee was a star, even if Paul Reubens was still a
virtual unknown.
 &HT;    ``I oftentimes thought that maybe I should change my name to
Pee-Wee Herman,'' says Reubens, who was born Paul Rubenfeld in
Oneonta, N.Y., and raised in Sarasota, Fla. ``Most people think
that's my name. Seriously. It might have just been smarter to drop
the Paul Reubens thing and be Pee-Wee. But I didn't want to do
that.''
 &HT;    In retrospect, he says, he's proud of what he accomplished
during the Pee-Wee era.
 &HT;    ``I don't look back fondly on the amount of work it was,
particularly the kids' show,'' he says. ``But as it gets further
away it seems like less work.
 &HT;    ``I hoped `Pee-Wee's Playhouse' would be something special,'' he
adds. ``It was patterned after shows that I felt did, like `Captain
Kangaroo,' `The Mickey Mouse Club' and `Howdy Doody.'
 &HT;    ``I felt my show was a modern version of those shows.''
 &HT;    The Pee-Wee craze had already started to wane on July 26, 1991,
when Reubens was arrested for exposing himself in a Sarasota movie
theater while watching a porn film.
 &HT;    Many actors have survived worse episodes, but not as stars of
child-oriented television shows. Though Reubens bravely turned up
as Pee-Wee on the MTV Awards soon after _ asking ``Heard any good
jokes lately?'' _ the scandal effectively killed the character.
 &HT;    For a while Reubens maintained a low profile, then began to turn
up in such films as ``Batman Returns'' (1992), ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' (1992) _ his best post-Pee-Wee role, as a campy vampire _
and ``Buddy'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I sort of do what comes my way, what somebody wants me to do
or what I like,'' Reubens says. ``I realize that this is perceived,
maybe, as a comeback, and that's great. But I don't feel that _ I
don't think about it that way.''
 &HT;    Reubens will next be seen as a ``murderer/bank robber/rapist''
in ``South of Heaven, West of Hell,'' a road movie directed by
actor/singer Dwight Yoakam. He also hopes to star in ``The Pee-Wee
Herman Story,'' which he cryptically refers to as a ``fake
autobiographical'' feature.
 &HT;    Growing up, Reubens recalls, all he ever wanted to do was act.
He didn't dream of fame and, unfortunately, hadn't a clue about the
fickle nature of stardom.
 &HT;    ``It would be interesting to have a little seminar in Hollywood
for people starting to get famous,'' he says, ``to explain some of
the things you might want to know.
 &HT;    ``Fame is really odd,'' he continues. ``After you've been famous
for a while and you meet people who are just starting to become
famous, it's all the same stuff. So it would be great to have a
little manual with some tips.''
 &HT;    Reubens pauses.
 &HT;    ``There are two schools,'' he adds. ``Some people love being
famous and they really enjoy it ... ''
 &HT;    The sentence goes unfinished.
 &HT;    ``I'm not complaining, whatsoever,'' he says quietly. ``I'm just
not in that school.''

 (Includes a color slide of Michelle Williams with Kirsten Dunst in
a scene from ``Dick.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Like it or hate it, you have to admit that ``Dawson's Creek''
isn't a particularly funny show.
 &HT;    So it's no wonder that ``Dawson's'' star Michelle Williams was
antsy about her movie ``Dick,'' a madcap, Watergate-era satire that
opens Aug. 6.
 &HT;    ``I've never thought I was very good at making people laugh,''
she says. ``There's something about it that has always terrified
me. I decided that doing something I found scary would, hopefully,
give me a sense of accomplishment. I didn't want to let fear rule
my career choices.''
 &HT;    In the film, Williams and Kirsten Dunst play a couple of ditzy
teen-agers who are thrilled to meet President Richard Nixon, only
to find themselves swept up in the emerging Watergate scandal.
 &HT;    ``I just gave myself over to this kind of silly playfulness and
it got easier and easier,'' she says. ``The '70s outfits they gave
me to wear helped _ there was a lot of fluorescent orange and
yellow, which are definitely not my colors, but it was sort of good
to feel you looked ridiculous. You put on those clothes and you
just get funny.''
 &HT;    Williams' character, Arlene, develops a crush on the president
after she and her best friend are hired as presidential
dog-walkers. But don't expect anything like the Monica Lewinsky
affair to ensue.
 &HT;    ``I don't think there was anything sexual at all in Arlene's
attraction to Nixon,'' Williams says quickly. ``She was just sort
of looking for a father figure, and the president was an ideal to
her.''
 &HT;    In one hilarious scene, Arlene discovers Nixon's famous tape
recorder in his secretary's desk. She records a love message to the
president, and even bursts into song.
 &HT;    ``I loved that scene,'' she says. ``I could just picture myself
being an idiot like that. Since the singing was supposed to be
funny, I got a kick out of it.''
 &HT;    Williams also enjoyed working with Dunst, who plays Arlene's
slightly hipper girlfriend.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes we were laughing so hard we could barely get through
a take,'' she recalls. ``I think at one point I stuck a pin in my
finger to keep from giggling.
 &HT;    ``Kirsten and I have remained really good friends,'' she adds.
``I was just blown away by the fact that she's so unjaded, even
though she's been acting for years. Every few weeks we call and
check up on each other.''
 &HT;    ``Dick'' may stretch Williams' comic abilities, but it was her
dramatic capabilities that were recently tested in the Off-Broadway
play ``Killer Joe.'' She delivered a wrenching, critically
acclaimed performance as the virgin daughter of a trailer-park
family who is sexually abused and ends up killing her father and
brother.
 &HT;    One particularly brutal scene called for her to stand on stage
stark naked _ which may seem daunting, but Williams says it wasn't.
 &HT;    ``Taking off my clothes was really freeing for me,'' the actress
says.
 &HT;    ``I think doing that play was one of those experiences that
really changed who I am as a person and an actor,'' she adds. ``I
had to go through a lot of self-examination and introspection _ I
saw myself as I hadn't before. I was scared by it and I didn't know
how to deal with it at first. Now I think I'm more comfortable.''
 &HT;    It's been a fast ride to success for the 18-year-old Williams.
Only three years ago, after having made her debut at 12 in the
independent film ``Friends'' (1993) with James Earl Jones, she left
her parents in San Diego to live alone in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``I guess I was a little naive, and my mother certainly wasn't
thrilled,'' she recalls. ``I did some stupid, crazy things _ but I
think, in a way, that prepared me for what's coming now. Everybody
has to wrestle with their demons.
 &HT;    ``Hindsight is great,'' she adds with a smile. ``The risk of
being alone in L.A. at 15 is enormous. But I thought I was
invincible. I had a lot of growing up to do, and I slammed it into
a couple of short years. Fortunately I've always had a lot of
determination _ that's my survival skill.''
 &HT;    Williams was simply another struggling actress until she got the
part of Jen, the urban teen-ager whose frank sexuality shakes up
small-town conventionality in ``Dawson's Creek.''
 &HT;    ``The series has changed my life,'' she says. ``Not so much
creatively as in the way you're suddenly so well-known. It doesn't
shock and scare me now as much as it used to.''
 &HT;    In fact, Williams found her recent birthday more unsettling than
her celebrity.
 &HT;    ``I was pretty scared of turning 18,'' she says. ``I had huge
anxiety about it. It seemed like such a milestone, because that's
the time when most kids are getting a job or going to college. I
realized I'd already been through all the things that come with
being 18 _ it seemed like a letdown.''
 &HT;    Williams is currently working on ``If These Walls Could Talk
2,'' a three-part drama which focuses on the lesbian experience in
America.
 &HT;    ``I'm a girl in the lesbian-feminist movement in the '70s,'' she
says. ``It's such a challenge to represent a time that was so
important and personal for thousands of women. It was their
struggle, their passion in life. I knew I had to stay true to
that.''
 &HT;    As for a love scene with co-star Chloe Sevigny, Williams insists
that it won't be especially challenging.
 &HT;    ``We're going to film it soon,'' she says. ``I feel comfortable
about it. I'm not nearly as nervous or hesitant as if I were going
to be doing it with a man.''
 &HT;    Williams will soon pack up and head back to North Carolina,
where ``Dawson's Creek'' is filmed. She isn't sure what the season
ahead holds for her character, but she does have some ideas.
 &HT;    ``I was thinking about that the other day,'' she says. ``I'd
like to see Jen have a job. I'd like her to have some passion and
fire about something she believes in, like politics.
 &HT;    ``I want her to rise above that plateau we've reached, which is
basically drinking-and-sex and sex-and-drinking,'' the actress
adds. ``I think it would great if she'd get a little more involved
in the world.
 &HT;    ``On the other hand,'' she says, ``if you really take yourself
back to being a teen-ager, there is a lot of angst _ your life is
full of humiliation and tumult. It is one hell of a ride.''

NOT-SO-PLAIN JANE: `FRASIER'S' JANE LEEVES LOOKS AHEAD

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Jane Leeves in a scene from
``Frasier.'') 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Leeves knows funny when she sees it. The English actress'
resume includes stints with Benny Hill, Monty Python and Jerry
Seinfeld, not to mention her current gig, as ``Frasier's'' daffy
physical therapist, Daphne Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Funny has been good to Leeves, who at 23 came to Los Angeles
from England with little professional experience and even less
cash. She studied hard, starved a little and soon landed the
recurring role of Audrey, Miles Silverberg's flighty girlfriend on
``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came her memorable ``Seinfeld'' turn as Marla, the sweet
virgin who rejects Jerry, and then Daphne. To round things off, she
married the boss, and has been blissfully wed to
matinee-idol-handsome Paramount executive Marshall Coben since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Five seasons into ``Frasier,'' Leeves is a seasoned pro with her
own production company _ Bristol Cities, and more on that later _
and a major motion picture to boot: Wes Craven's
soon-to-be-released ``The Music of My Heart,'' which stars her
childhood idol, Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's a dream come true for someone who says that as
early as age 5 she'd decided to become a performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't honestly remember ever wanting to do anything else but
be in the spotlight,'' she says, ``which is really so strange,
because my family have always accused me of being too shy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shy'' is hardly the word for anyone bold enough to perform
with the famously raunchy Hill _ but Leeves reports that his
offscreen personality was much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me to audition at his home,'' she recalls, ``which
sounds very strange, but really wasn't. He answered the door in his
pajamas, with a can of air freshener in his hand. Apparently he'd
had a few of his work buddies over the night before, and he was
frantically running around spraying everything to get rid of the
smell of all the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proceeded to audition for him while he was in his pajamas,''
Leeves says, ``and he kept running into another room to bring out
more skits for us to try. It was very bizarre, but he was a very
charming, lovely man.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeves also worked as a dancer on ``Monty Python's The Meaning
of Life'' (1983), which she recalls as a treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single girl dancer had a crush on Terry Jones _ which is
kind of strange, because he's the one who always dressed up like a
woman,'' she says. ``But we all found him terribly sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham Chapman, I remember, was extremely sweet and kind,
because we wore these extremely uncomfortable costumes, and he
would run around saying, `They need a rest!' He really took care of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though her career in England was beginning to unfold, Leeves
decided to head for Hollywood, even if it meant virtually starting
from scratch. She arrived in Los Angeles almost penniless, signed
up for a drama class _ where she met an intimidating roster of
fellow students that included Jim Carrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Adam
Sandler, Winona Ryder and Molly Ringwald _ and began her rounds of
auditions.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, she says she's astounded at her own courage in
coming to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, it was the best thing I ever did,'' she says,
``but it was very scary. My first year here was most horrifying and
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well, however, and ``Frasier'' seems an
ideal match for the actress' comic talents. The role of Daphne fits
her as if it had been written for her _ as indeed it was, to a
considerable extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the details came from me,'' she says. ``I created
much of her background before we shot the pilot. I tried to imagine
where this woman was coming from and what kind of family life she'd
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers were asking questions like, `Does she have any
brothers or sisters?''' Leeves recalls. ``And I said, straight
away, `Oh yes, eight brothers. She's the only girl in a family of
eight boys, and they used to roughhouse with her and push her
around.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that helped explain why she was so comfortable with the
Cranes, because she was used to dealing with guys. She knows how to
handle them and whack them across the head when necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The question Leeves hears most often is, ``What's going to
happen with Daphne and Niles?'' But she insists that she's happy to
be asked _ ``because it proves that people are invested in it'' _
though she can't provide any inside information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dying to know myself,'' she says, ``but I do believe we
will see some action in that area. I don't think there will be any
more teasing. I sense that, by the end of next season, they will
somehow be together.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Grammer, who has battled alcohol problems and rumors of
prima-donna behavior, Leeves says that he's actually the ideal star
as far as she's concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``On other shows, I understand, it's made quite clear that the
star is the star,'' she says. ``But Kelsey is constantly saying,
`Give me less to do and give everyone else more to do.' He just
loves it when the rest of us are out in front getting a big
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hyde-Pierce, who plays Niles, is equally congenial, she
adds. In fact, she says, the entire cast is a delight to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't stand a chance on our set with any ego,'' she
says, laughing. ``For one thing, John Mahoney would put you right
in your place!''
</P>
<P>
   Leeves recently joined forces with another ``Frasier'' cast
member, Peri Gilpin, to form a production company to develop roles
for themselves and others. As has become widely known, its name
includes a subtle joke of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decided to form the company,'' Leeves says, giggling,
``Peri and I were told that it would be smart to pick a name that
suggested it was run by two women. Well, we couldn't think of a
thing, so as a joke I suggested `Bristol Cities,' and she said,
`Oh, that certainly sounds like an independent movie company, what
does it mean?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I explained that it's actually Cockney rhyming slang for
`titties!'''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, Leeves adds, her personal life is going even better
than her career _ she describes herself as ``very, very, very, very
happily married.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, she says, her biggest worry derives from the simple
fact that she's actually realized virtually everything she dreamed
about back when she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty scary,'' she says. ``It's really tough when you're
so happy, because you keep thinking, `Please don't let anybody
disturb this or take it away from me!'''
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y. _ Alice Fiske, grande dame of Sylvester
Manor on this coastal island, emerged from the stately Georgian
house, steadying herself with a walking stick, to inspect the
defacement of her handsome front lawn. She couldn't have been more
pleased about the big hole there, the mark of archeologists at
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we have so much history here,'' Mrs. Fiske said,
nodding toward the dig, then the house and the water beyond, where
ships of commerce once tied up and a society of cultural diversity
took some of its first steps in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists are not only digging into the past of her late
husband's family, going back to the middle of the 17th century, but
are also discovering material remains of an aspect of American
colonial history little known and rarely investigated: the
existence of Northern plantations worked by African slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People generally assume all the plantations with slaves were
in the South,'' said Dr. Stephen Mrozowski, an archeologist at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston and co-leader of the
excavation. ``No one has really looked at the archeology of a
Northern plantation in a systematic way.''
</P>
<P>
   As the second summer of excavations drew to a close, Mrozowski
said the new findings, combined with a study of old wills, deeds
and other documents, were beginning to reveal patterns of life and
work on the Sylvester plantation, which at one time encompassed
virtually all of Shelter Island.
</P>
<P>
   Starting around 1650, this was a major enterprise with a long
economic reach. Unlike Southern plantations, which concentrated on
large cash crops like tobacco and cotton, this was one of several
``provisioning plantations'' founded at the time in the North. Its
main function was to supply food and timber for the Sylvester
family's sugar plantation on Barbados in the West Indies. Ships
regularly sailed to Barbados bearing cured meat, grain, barrel
staves and lumber and returned with molasses for making rum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the beginning of the modern world,'' Mrozowski
observed. ``These people were already thinking of commerce on a
global scale, labor from Africa, a plantation in one place
supporting another far away and the products being traded on two
continents. And you see all these cultures coming together,
English, Dutch, Native American and African.''
</P>
<P>
   At both plantations, much of the labor fell to African slaves.
According to inventories in the 1680s, more than 20 slaves worked
at Sylvester Manor, more than 200 on Barbados. The slaves are
listed on lines just above the inventory for livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Only a generation or so after the settlement of Jamestown in
Virginia, in 1607, and the arrival of the Pilgrims at Plymouth,
Mass., in 1620, plantation culture had spread to a few places on
the Northeast coast, where Africans were brought in as slave
workers. Excavations here, the archeologist said, could reveal
whether there were differences in the lives of Africans on Northern
plantations compared with those in the South, perhaps reflecting
differences between a provisioning plantation and those based on
large crops requiring intensive field work.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark P. Leone, an anthropologist at the University of
Maryland at College Park, said the excavations should turn up
``interesting and important results'' about the role of Africans in
early American culture, particularly in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Until about two decades ago, African-Americans were a neglected
element in archeology. Excavations at plantations usually focused
on the architecture of the big houses of the white masters and were
confined to the South. As an example of the changing emphasis,
Leone has been investigating the slave quarters of historic houses
in Annapolis, Md., to learn how the slaves maintained their African
identity.
</P>
<P>
   The excavations at Sylvester Manor are directed by Mrozowski and
Dr. Marley Brown, director of archeology at Colonial Williamsburg
in Virginia. The two had worked together on a dig at Jamestown, the
first permanent English settlement in what is now the United
States. A third partner is the Shelter Island Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping down into the excavation on the front lawn, Mrozowski
said, ``The beauty of archeology here is, we only have to go down
inches to get to the 17th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Here the archeologists were looking for traces of the original
plantation house, built in 1651; the present manor house dates to
1735. They found some Dutch-made yellow bricks and red roof tiles
that belonged to the old house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the present house was always painted yellow, probably
because the original one was built of yellow brick,'' Mrs. Fiske
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the foundations of the original house have eluded
archeologists, perhaps because it stood on the site of the present
house. But they think they may be able to learn even more about
plantation life from the artifacts coming out of the lawn and other
dig sites. Where he stood, Mrozowski said, he and his graduate
students uncovered a deposit of 17th-century trash. This must have
been outside the kitchen, most likely a free-standing structure in
those days and a place occupied by the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, excavation also exposed the wood stains from decayed
posts, coral-based mortar and other traces of a building. Mrozowski
said he was not sure, but the arrangement of the post holes and
trenches reminded him of construction patterns of some slave houses
made of clay or mud mixed with branches or straw _ wattle and daub
_ on South Carolina plantations. These the slaves had built
themselves along the lines of dwellings where they or their
ancestors had come from in West Africa.

SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y.: Africa.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among animal bones, remains of plantation meals, archeologists
here found broken pottery they considered even more distinctive
evidence of an African presence. The pieces, gray to brown and
unglazed, were from earthenware cooking pots in a style known to
archeologists as colono ware. For a long time, such artifacts were
thought to be Indian pottery. Now, archeologists have noted
similarities to pottery in Nigeria and Ghana and agree that
Africans, not Indians, were its primary if not exclusive makers in
the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Some Indian artifacts, primarily wampum shells, have been
uncovered on a peninsula near the manor house, but it is not yet
clear what role Indians had in plantation life. The shells could be
from a pre-plantation encampment. But Indians lived on the island
after the Europeans' arrival. The island's first census, in 1771,
counted ``140 persons white, 27 slaves, five free negroes, 23
Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Sylvester, founder of the plantation, emigrated from
England to the New World, probably by way of Holland, and, with
some partners, acquired the land from the Montauk Indians. (Mrs.
Fiske' husband, Andrew Fiske, was a descendant of the Sylvesters.)
</P>
<P>
   From the evidence in the trash deposit _ or midden, in
archeological parlance _ the Sylvesters were a cosmopolitan family
and their plantation prospered from the start. ``It's the most
upscale midden I've ever excavated,'' Mrozowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Two student archeologists, Ann Hancock and Lee Priddy, arranged
a sampling of their artifact haul on a table inside the manor
house. There were English, French and Irish coins; fine German
ceramics along with humbler colono ware; silver buckles and a stick
pin, and pieces of Dutch clay pipes and a copper pipe tamper.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the manor house, on a lawn sloping to Gardiner's Creek,
the archeologists have uncovered traces of 17th-century
outbuildings that appear to run down to the water. They suspect
that these were places where workers made the barrel staves and
stored the goods to be transported on the next ship to Barbados.
Further excavations are planned here.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the artifacts, the one most prized by Mrs. Fiske is a
rusted latch key, four inches long. Because it was found in the
17th-century midden, archeologists told her it was most likely the
key to the original manor house, and one more key to the past of a
Northern slave plantation.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises has added Norcross, Ga.-based
Headhunter.net to the list of co-branded content providers on its
homepage. Financial terms of the one-year contract were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Internet service provider, which plans to
announce its second quarter earnings today after the market closes,
also has a deal with Barnes&AMP;Noble.com to provide specialized
content for MindSpring subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring subscribers will have access to Headhunter.net's job
database. The subscribers can post resumes for free and receive a
10 percent discount off the cost of posting a job opening.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dell Computer, which has been rumored to be a
possible suitor in a business partnership, will hold a conference
call today at 11 a.m. to make what it calls ``a new consumer
initiative that will extend Dell's Internet leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a MindSpring/Dell partnership have been rampant since
the ISP issued a statement saying it was in talks about possible
business combinations. Neither MindSpring nor Dell has given any
comment about a possible business deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Headhunter.net deal will benefit MindSpring's individual
subscribers, but the deal is also advantageous for MindSpring's new
business unit, MindSpring Biz.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Jolly, MindSpring's vice president of consumer products,
said in a statement the company's partnership with Headhunter
``gives our customers a real edge in their hiring practices, which
is imperative for small businesses intent on driving growth.''

U.S. AND RUSSIA MOVE TO BRIDGE GAP LEFT BY KOSOVO

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ In what a Russian foreign ministry official here
welcomed as the week of getting Russian relations with the United
States back on track, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and
the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, met here Monday night
in their first conversation since the Kosovo war. Instead of the
Balkans, they dwelt on arms reduction, Iraq and economics.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion, after a daylong session of the annual meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, will be followed by
meetings in Washington on Tuesday between the new Russian prime
minister, Sergei V. Stepashin, President Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint news conference, Ms. Albright and Ivanov both
suggested that the damage done to the Washington-Moscow
relationship by the Kosovo war should be quickly repaired. ``We
should redouble our effort to further the relationship,'' Ivanov
said, after signing an agreement to open a telephone hot line for
use between Ms. Albright and himself.
</P>
<P>
   He said his government would press for passage of the Start 2
arms reduction treaty when the Russian Parliament convenes in late
September. The treaty has been stalled in the Communist-dominated
parliament, though, and similar pledges by President Boris N.
Yeltsin have failed to move it.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Albright said discussions would soon begin
between Russia and the United States on amending the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972 and on the Start 3 treaty, which calls on
both sides to reduce their nuclear arsenals. The United States
wants changes in the 1972 treaty that would allow the United States
to start work on an anti-missile system announced by Clinton in
January.
</P>
<P>
   On economic issues, a senior administration official traveling
with Ms. Albright said it was likely that the board of the
International Monetary Fund would give final approval this week to
a $4.5 billion loan intended to prevent Russia from defaulting on a
loan from the monetary fund. Since Stepashin became prime minister
in the spring, the Russian Parliament has approved legislative
measures demanded by the fund as a prerequisite to receiving the
loan, the administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some progress on those issues, the aftermath of bad
feelings from the war in Kosovo still lingers. At the start of the
war, Russia left the Permanent Joint Council, the NATO body where
the alliance consults with Russia. Russia came back last week. But
at its insistence, the agenda was limited to sorting out problems
associated with the Russian military presence in Kosovo, said
Vladimir Rakhmanin, the foreign ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian-NATO relations are still frozen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Association of South East Asian Nations session Monday,
Ms. Albright raised her concerns about Myanmar, which she has
criticized in the past for its authoritarian rule and poor human
rights record. She called the country, formerly Burma, a ``threat
to regional stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Myanmar government's failure to prevent wide-scale narcotics
production and trafficking pose dangers for neighboring nations,
she said in a paper devoted to several Asian themes and circulated
among the conference participants.
</P>
<P>
   She urged the country's military authorities, who have been in
power since 1962, to begin a dialogue with opposition parties,
including the National League for Democracy, headed by Daw Aung San
Suu Kyi. The opposition party won a landslide victory in 1990
elections but has been prevented from taking power.
</P>
<P>
   To make that dialogue possible, Ms. Albright urged the
government to grant a visa to a special U.N. envoy, Alvaro de Soto,
who has been designated by the U.N. secretary general to facilitate
the talks. A State Department official said Monday that he
understood that the Myanmar government had approved a visit by De
Soto.

 &HT;    FRUSTRATED BY COMPLEXITY, WOMEN LAG IN BUYING COMPUTERS
 &HT;    1130&AMP;add. With WOMEN-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington, (l)
lifestyle and (f) financial categories for release Sunday, Aug. 1.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Put a computer in the home, and women are nearly as
likely as men to go on line. But despite their surging Internet
savvy, millions of women won't buy a computer unless a man helps
choose it, buy it and set it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying a computer is still perceived as something men do,''
said Michaela Platzer, vice president for research for the American
Electronics Association, a trade group for high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons most women balk at buying computers are complicated.
A major factor is that they have less patience than men with
finicky machines that are hard to use and keep working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the consequences are clear, for both
families and society as a whole:
</P>
<P>
   _ Households without computers face an educational and economic
disadvantage in a world rapidly becoming high-tech. Such households
are more likely to be headed by a woman, the federal government has
found. Black children, more than half of whom live in single-parent
homes headed by women, are particularly affected.
</P>
<P>
   _ If educators want all children to get access to the Internet,
they first must figure out how to get more women to purchase
computers. And if companies doing business on the Internet want to
vastly expand their pool of potential customers, they too have to
find a way to turn more women into computer customers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, computer manufacturers and marketers have failed to win
over large numbers of women. Because the computer industry is
changing so rapidly, up-to-date statistics are difficult to come
by. But spot surveys of clerks in computers stores show that only
about one computer customer in 10 is a woman, said Michael
Erbschloe, vice president of Computer Economics Inc., a private
research company in Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even among women who routinely use the Internet to buy clothes,
books and other goods, computers are a tough sell, according to a
recent survey by The Strategis Group, a Washington D.C. based
consulting firm. The survey showed the number of women using the
Internet is rapidly catching up to men, with 38 percent of all
women accessing the Internet by the end of 1998, compared with 46
percent of men. Still, among people who use the Internet to shop
for computer equipment, men outnumbered women by about three to
one.
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't more women buying computers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because computers go down, they crash,'' and that discourages
women who are unsure of how to keep the equipment running, Platzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to sociologists to sort out the underlying reasons, but
people who make and sell computers say that men and women react
differently when faced with a beige box full of chips and wires.
Men generally are far more willing to put up with the complexities
of setting up a computer, and are less discouraged when the
electronic beasts misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I draw the analogy to the car,'' Platzer said. ``When they
used to break down a lot, women didn't want to buy them.'' But now
that cars have become more reliable and simpler to use, a woman
coming into an auto showroom is no longer a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Platzer said the computer industry, too, is moving toward
greater ease of use. ``If you bought a computer a couple of years
ago, it took you hours to set it up,'' she said. In the past year,
``friendlier'' computers, such as Apple Computer's iMac, have
become popular with women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, manufacturers have not developed the ``plug and play''
ease that comes with, say, a television. Even the simplest
computers can befuddle first-time users, said David Eisner, a
spokesman for America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that appears every morning as AOL's phones begin
ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have millions of calls to customer service every month,''
Eisner said, because computer equipment and software makers have
failed to create products that people can use without lots of
questions. ``We have to ask ourselves, 'Why are there still so many
questions?' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   First-time customers still sit down at a keyboard and look for
the button that says E-MAIL, not realizing how many steps it takes
to get to the point of actually sending an electronic message. ``If
computers were simpler, a lot more people would be on line,''
Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason computer's aren't simple is that in the industry's
early days, ``there were enough customers you could sell to''
without worrying about homemakers, Platzer said. But now that more
than half of all homes have computers, ``we have to figure out how
to move that percentage from 50 to 90,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's difficult-to-use computers aren't the only barriers to
women. Most sales clerks are young men who prefer to sell to men,
said Erbschloe of Computer Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are far less impressed by the 'bells and whistles' on a
computer,'' Erbschloe said. That means they often get ignored by
male clerks who are less than eager to wait on price-conscious
shoppers. ``The guy under 25 (who is selling computers) is
thinking, 'There's no up-sale here,' and moves on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday in a Circuit City store in Rockville, Md.,
a young male clerk, Rudi Safak, agreed with Erbschloe's assessment.
``A man looks for something more powerful,'' Safak said. ``Women
buy whatever they need and nothing more, which is smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Content on the Internet also has driven more men than women to
buy computers, Erbschloe said. Many men have been willing to put up
with the difficulties of buying computers because they are more
motivated to get on-line information on investments, sports and
hobbies. And to get pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unquestionable,'' he said, that many men have
purchased computers for access to porn. Reliable statistics are
difficult to come by because ``some things are still taboo,'' he
said, but industry insiders believe porn helps explain why
households with men are more likely to have computers.
</P>
<P>
   Erbschloe said that only recently have Web site creators begun
targeting women by offering information on health, child rearing,
homemaking and gardening. Sites dedicated to helping plan weddings
are particularly popular, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Women are already flocking to sites that interest them, and as
they become more motivated to reach such content, they will be more
eager to pick out their own computers and learn to use them,
Erbschloe predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan Chau, a college student who was brousing at the Rockville
Circuit City, said she was interested in owning a computer, but
didn't feel confident about picking one. ``I'm not that comfortable
(making a purchase) because I don't know which one is better,'' she
said. When it comes time for a decision, she said she'll seek help
from her father or a friend. ``I think men do know more,'' she
said. And as she spoke, a man passing by offered advice, urging her
to go for ``speed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons women are cool to computer shopping, the
children of many female-headed households are finding themselves at
an economic and educational disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Labor market experts are unanimous in saying that computer
literacy will be the key to good wages in the next century. In
1998, wages in the information technology sector of the economy
rose 7.1 percent, compared with just 3.8 percent in the private
sector as a whole, according to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Those wage statistics throw a chilling light on the department's
recent ``Digital Divide'' report regarding children's use of
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department found that a child in a dual-parent
white household is nearly twice as likely to have Internet access
as a white child in a white single-parent home.
</P>
<P>
   For black children, the difference was even greater. Those
growing up with two parents in the home were nearly four times as
likely to have access to the Internet as children in single-parent
black households.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address this gap, Oprah Winfrey will present a
13-part series on cable TV called ``Oprah Goes Online'' beginning
in February. The series, produced by Oxygen Media Inc., is targeted
at women who are intimidated by computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Oprah will reach a lot of women who are not yet
on line and get them to take the leap,'' said Debra Smul, a vice
president of Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   But Oprah is not motivated only by altruism. Besides helping
women, she would like to steer more customers to her own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the industry say Oprah is just one of many
entrepreneurs who are wising up to the economic importance of
getting women on line. As electronic commerce expands, computer
makers and Web site marketers are bound to get more serious about
attracting female customers, they predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming a daily necessity at work. It's
getting to where you can't live without it,'' said Jeffrey Moore, a
spokesman for the Strategis Group, a consulting firm in Washington.
As businesses recognize the untapped potential of female customers
and employees, they inevitably will lower the barriers that have
kept women away from computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing is on the wall,'' Moore said.

   WASHINGTON _ Put a computer in the home, and women are nearly as
likely as men to go on line. But despite their surging Internet
savvy, millions of women won't buy a computer unless a man helps
choose it, buy it and set it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying a computer is still perceived as something men do,''
said Michaela Platzer, vice president for research for the American
Electronics Association, a trade group for high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons most women balk at buying computers are complicated.
A major factor is that they have less patience than men with
finicky machines that are hard to use and keep working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the consequences are clear, for both
families and society as a whole:
</P>
<P>
   _ Households without computers face an educational and economic
disadvantage in a world rapidly becoming high-tech. Such households
are more likely to be headed by a woman, the federal government has
found. Black children, more than half of whom live in single-parent
homes headed by women, are particularly affected.
</P>
<P>
   _ If educators want all children to get access to the Internet,
they first must figure out how to get more women to purchase
computers. And if companies doing business on the Internet want to
vastly expand their pool of potential customers, they too have to
find a way to turn more women into computer customers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, computer manufacturers and marketers have failed to win
over large numbers of women. Because the computer industry is
changing so rapidly, up-to-date statistics are difficult to come
by. But spot surveys of clerks in computers stores show that only
about one computer customer in 10 is a woman, said Michael
Erbschloe, vice president of Computer Economics Inc., a private
research company in Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even among women who routinely use the Internet to buy clothes,
books and other goods, computers are a tough sell, according to a
recent survey by The Strategis Group, a Washington D.C. based
consulting firm. The survey showed the number of women using the
Internet is rapidly catching up to men, with 38 percent of all
women accessing the Internet by the end of 1998, compared with 46
percent of men. Still, among people who use the Internet to shop
for computer equipment, men outnumbered women by about three to
one.
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't more women buying computers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because computers go down, they crash,'' and that discourages
women who are unsure of how to keep the equipment running, Platzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to sociologists to sort out the underlying reasons, but
people who make and sell computers say that men and women react
differently when faced with a beige box full of chips and wires.
Men generally are far more willing to put up with the complexities
of setting up a computer, and are less discouraged when the
electronic beasts misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I draw the analogy to the car,'' Platzer said. ``When they
used to break down a lot, women didn't want to buy them.'' But now
that cars have become more reliable and simpler to use, a woman
coming into an auto showroom is no longer a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Platzer said the computer industry, too, is moving toward
greater ease of use. ``If you bought a computer a couple of years
ago, it took you hours to set it up,'' she said. In the past year,
``friendlier'' computers, such as Apple Computer's iMac, have
become popular with women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, manufacturers have not developed the ``plug and play''
ease that comes with, say, a television. Even the simplest
computers can befuddle first-time users, said David Eisner, a
spokesman for America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that appears every morning as AOL's phones begin
ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have millions of calls to customer service every month,''
Eisner said, because computer equipment and software makers have
failed to create products that people can use without lots of
questions. ``We have to ask ourselves, 'Why are there still so many
questions?' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   First-time customers still sit down at a keyboard and look for
the button that says E-MAIL, not realizing how many steps it takes
to get to the point of actually sending an electronic message. ``If
computers were simpler, a lot more people would be on line,''
Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason computer's aren't simple is that in the industry's
early days, ``there were enough customers you could sell to''
without worrying about homemakers, Platzer said. But now that more
than half of all homes have computers, ``we have to figure out how
to move that percentage from 50 to 90,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's difficult-to-use computers aren't the only barriers to
women. Most sales clerks are young men who prefer to sell to men,
said Erbschloe of Computer Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are far less impressed by the 'bells and whistles' on a
computer,'' Erbschloe said. That means they often get ignored by
male clerks who are less than eager to wait on price-conscious
shoppers. ``The guy under 25 (who is selling computers) is
thinking, 'There's no up-sale here,' and moves on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday in a Circuit City store in Rockville, Md.,
a young male clerk, Rudi Safak, agreed with Erbschloe's assessment.
``A man looks for something more powerful,'' Safak said. ``Women
buy whatever they need and nothing more, which is smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Content on the Internet also has driven more men than women to
buy computers, Erbschloe said. Many men have been willing to put up
with the difficulties of buying computers because they are more
motivated to get on-line information on investments, sports and
hobbies. And to get pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unquestionable,'' he said, that many men have
purchased computers for access to porn. Reliable statistics are
difficult to come by because ``some things are still taboo,'' he
said, but industry insiders believe porn helps explain why
households with men are more likely to have computers.
</P>
<P>
   Erbschloe said that only recently have Web site creators begun
targeting women by offering information on health, child rearing,
homemaking and gardening. Sites dedicated to helping plan weddings
are particularly popular, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Women are already flocking to sites that interest them, and as
they become more motivated to reach such content, they will be more
eager to pick out their own computers and learn to use them,
Erbschloe predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan Chau, a college student who was brousing at the Rockville
Circuit City, said she was interested in owning a computer, but
didn't feel confident about picking one. ``I'm not that comfortable
(making a purchase) because I don't know which one is better,'' she
said. When it comes time for a decision, she said she'll seek help
from her father or a friend. ``I think men do know more,'' she
said. And as she spoke, a man passing by offered advice, urging her
to go for ``speed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons women are cool to computer shopping, the
children of many female-headed households are finding themselves at
an economic and educational disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Labor market experts are unanimous in saying that computer
literacy will be the key to good wages in the next century. In
1998, wages in the information technology sector of the economy
rose 7.1 percent, compared with just 3.8 percent in the private
sector as a whole, according to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Those wage statistics throw a chilling light on the department's
recent ``Digital Divide'' report regarding children's use of
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department found that a child in a dual-parent
white household is nearly twice as likely to have Internet access
as a white child in a white single-parent home.
</P>
<P>
   For black children, the difference was even greater. Those
growing up with two parents in the home were nearly four times as
likely to have access to the Internet as children in single-parent
black households.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address this gap, Oprah Winfrey will present a
13-part series on cable TV called ``Oprah Goes Online'' beginning
in February. The series, produced by Oxygen Media Inc., is targeted
at women who are intimidated by computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Oprah will reach a lot of women who are not yet
on line and get them to take the leap,'' said Debra Smul, a vice
president of Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   But Oprah is not motivated only by altruism. Besides helping
women, she would like to steer more customers to her own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the industry say Oprah is just one of many
entrepreneurs who are wising up to the economic importance of
getting women on line. As electronic commerce expands, computer
makers and Web site marketers are bound to get more serious about
attracting female customers, they predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming a daily necessity at work. It's
getting to where you can't live without it,'' said Jeffrey Moore, a
spokesman for the Strategis Group, a consulting firm in Washington.
As businesses recognize the untapped potential of female customers
and employees, they inevitably will lower the barriers that have
kept women away from computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing is on the wall,'' Moore said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I had a very positive second interview
for a midlevel management position with a major nonprofit health
agency. The vice president who interviewed me explained that the
next step was an evaluation of the three candidates using a
professionally developed profiling system. He said it would be a
week or more before I heard from them. Two days later I received a
generic turndown letter, and it was dated on the day of my
interview. I am stunned, and I would appreciate your input. S.H.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Although this is a health agency, it does not sound
particularly healthy. This incident points to an organization with
questionable understanding of the importance of treating people
honestly and with respect and trust. Unless the agency is trying to
increase ill will and negative publicity, there is no reason to
treat applicants this poorly.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is easy to rationalize that you are better
off not working there, and it is better to learn this now rather
than after being hired. However, the interview went well, you were
supposed to go through the profiling system, and then you received
the generic rejection letter mailed on the day you were
interviewed. Something does not make sense.
</P>
<P>
   You have nothing to lose by calling the vice president who
interviewed you and indicating that you are confused by what
happened. It is possible that a mistake was made, although it is
more likely that the organization prevented you from making a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am employed at a very reputable company as an
administrative coordinator. Up until recently, I enjoyed my job
immensely. However, my new boss is extremely demanding, every voice
mail message is urgent, and she often produces last-minute
assignments. I was astonished when she called me into the office
and said that if I can't keep up with the pace, maybe I should look
for another position in the company. I'm not sure how to handle
this situation. C.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: When you have a new boss, the job that you enjoyed immensely
can be changed immensely. Sometimes such a change is for the
better, and sometimes it is like your situation.
</P>
<P>
   The style that your boss is using went out long ago, and the
fact that you refer to her as a boss rather than as a manager or
supervisor is revealing. As the word implies, she is bossing you
around and showing minimal concern for your ideas or input. Rather
than providing any real communication, training or leadership, she
merely indicates that you should consider changing departments.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you need to meet with her to discuss where all of
this is going. If the relationship stays as strained as it is now,
it is going to burst, and you are the one who will be hurt. It is
time to discuss and agree upon specific performance standards,
expectations and goals.
</P>
<P>
   For the two of you to work productively together, there will be
a need for regular two-way communication, goal-setting, guidance
and support. If she continues to boss you around, then you should
look around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many advertisements are searching for applicants who have a
sharp eye for detail. Do the placement professionals intend for
these ads to be poorly written so that the applicant will proofread
and correct the grammar, spelling and punctuation errors as a type
of screening? By doing these corrections and sending back the
revised version, along with my resume, will I insult or offend the
writer? J.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Companies do not typically throw ``red herrings'' into an ad
just to see if an applicant notices. In fact, most employers would
wonder about an applicant who sends in a resume along with a
red-penciled copy of their job advertisement. In many cases, the
next thing to be red-penciled would be the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   However, much of this depends upon the company and the way that
you present the corrections. There are people in some companies who
may think that an applicant who has the confidence and expertise to
correct their advertisement may be just what the place needs. But
other individuals may think that such an applicant is overly
critical and may be real trouble. You need to check out the
companies carefully and tailor your presentation from there.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are that correcting an ad is more likely to work
against you than for you. With this in mind, the safest approach is
to let your resume and cover letter initially demonstrate how
thorough, accurate and detail-minded you are. If you get to the
interview stage, then you may consider mentioning the company's
advertisement. Be sure to do so in an upbeat, nonevaluative and
constructive tone. And, you better be right!

</P>
<P>
   Women are already flocking to sites that interest them, and as
they become more motivated to reach such content, they will be more
eager to pick out their own computers and learn to use them,
Erbschloe predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan Chau, a college student who was brousing at the Rockville
Circuit City, said she was interested in owning a computer, but
didn't feel confident about picking one. ``I'm not that comfortable
(making a purchase) because I don't know which one is better,'' she
said. When it comes time for a decision, she said she'll seek help
from her father or a friend. ``I think men do know more,'' she
said. And as she spoke, a man passing by offered advice, urging her
to go for ``speed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons women are cool to computer shopping, the
children of many female-headed households are finding themselves at
an economic and educational disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Labor market experts are unanimous in saying that computer
literacy will be the key to good wages in the next century. In
1998, wages in the information technology sector of the economy
rose 7.1 percent, compared with just 3.8 percent in the private
sector as a whole, according to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Those wage statistics throw a chilling light on the department's
recent ``Digital Divide'' report regarding children's use of
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department found that a child in a dual-parent
white household is nearly twice as likely to have Internet access
as a white child in a white single-parent home.
</P>
<P>
   For black children, the difference was even greater. Those
growing up with two parents in the home were nearly four times as
likely to have access to the Internet as children in single-parent
black households.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to address this gap, Oprah Winfrey will present a
13-part series on cable TV called ``Oprah Goes Online'' beginning
in February. The series, produced by Oxygen Media Inc., is targeted
at women who are intimidated by computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Oprah will reach a lot of women who are not yet
on line and get them to take the leap,'' said Debra Smul, a vice
president of Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   But Oprah is not motivated only by altruism. Besides helping
women, she would like to steer more customers to her own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the industry say Oprah is just one of many
entrepreneurs who are wising up to the economic importance of
getting women on line. As electronic commerce expands, computer
makers and Web site marketers are bound to get more serious about
attracting female customers, they predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming a daily necessity at work. It's
getting to where you can't live without it,'' said Jeffrey Moore, a
spokesman for the Strategis Group, a consulting firm in Washington.
As businesses recognize the untapped potential of female customers
and employees, they inevitably will lower the barriers that have
kept women away from computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing is on the wall,'' Moore said.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A few years ago, a photo of Ahmed Qureia, one of the
top three Palestinian officials, was splashed on the cover of every
Israeli newspaper. It showed him stepping on an Israeli flag during
a demonstration, and the image implanted itself in many Israelis'
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as if it were a commonplace and not groundbreaking
event, Qureia, who is known as Abu Ala, ambled into the flat-roofed
Israeli parliament, a guest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a peep of protest could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and nodding, Qureia strolled past key symbols of the
Zionist state: the same flag with its Star of David, an eternal
flame for the fallen soldiers, a giant menorah and a mounted scroll
bearing the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago there would have been raucous demonstrations against
Qureia's presence. Monday, two right-wing members of parliament did
a little pro forma heckling, and one Israeli Arab member asked for
a Palestinian flag to be displayed as a courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise there was little sound of yet another barrier being
toppled as Israelis and Palestinians took one more gingerly step
toward making their relations normal. Although Palestinian
legislators have visited parliament at the invitation of individual
members, Qureia is the highest-ranking Palestinian to visit and the
first to enter the bastion of Israeli sovereignty as a formal guest
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first invitation, and I highly appreciate the
courageous decision to invite me,'' he said. ``The support of the
peace process is our main target, and we as elected people have a
role to play, particularly in this very serious and dangerous and
important stage, where everybody is hoping that the peace process
will come back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Qureia, who is the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, was invited, peer to peer, by Avraham Burg, the new,
activist speaker of the Israeli parliament. The invitation was as
much a part of internal as external Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting Qureia was classic Burg, a big and attention-grabbing
gesture that upstaged the new prime minister, Ehud Barak, at least
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great public relations,'' said Naomi Chazan, a member of
parliament from the leftist Meretz Party. ``You've got to hand it
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg, a high-ranking member of Barak's own Labor Party, was
elected against the prime minister's will in a victory that
represented Barak's first political defeat since his own election.
</P>
<P>
   But Burg, a religious Jew and an ardent dove since the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon in 1982, was also genuine in his intentions.
With his gesture, he was kicking off his bid to assert a hands-on
role for parliament in the peace effort. He has also extended an
invitation to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad not only to visit
parliament but to address the members.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the peace process has been conducted at the summit
level and on a people-to-people basis,'' Burg said in an interview.
``Well, the parliament wants to participate too.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg stood at the iron gates of parliament to welcome Qureia,
escorting him with a hand on his back through the Chagall Lobby and
down the steps into the speaker's huge office, with its panoramic
view of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame!'' Michael Kleiner, a member of a small far-right party,
called after them.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashed, Israeli television cameramen requested the sine qua
non of Israeli-Palestinian encounters: a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, of course,'' Burg said. ``And we'll save you some time.
We'll exchange our presents immediately too.''
</P>
<P>
   With a slight bow, Burg handed Qureia a silver-wrapped box _ and
a box-cutter to open it. It contained a silver dove paperweight.
``The symbol of peace, something I believe both of us are fully
committed to,'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent peace in the land of peace,'' Qureia responded as he
held it above his head, right under the portrait of Theodor Herzl,
the founder of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``So help us God,'' said Burg.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia gave the Israeli speaker a carved alabaster box inlaid
with mother-of-pearl. ``Made in Bethlehem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the camera crews filed out, the two made formal chit-chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we have to work to build public pressure for
peace,'' Qureia said.
</P>
<P>
   Burg asked Qureia where he lived. ``Abu Dis,'' Qureia said,
referring to the Arab town outside Jerusalem that is being
discussed as a possible capital of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aha!'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   They met privately for 45 minutes and then emerged to face the
media, Palestinian journalists who peppered them with questions in
Arabic alongside their Hebrew-speaking colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The two men sat before a giant Marc Chagall tapestry that
depicts Moses handing down the Ten Commandments to the Israelites.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Ehud Olmert, the mayor of Jerusalem, scoffed
at those fellow members of his conservative Likud Party who
denounced Qureia's visit beforehand _ like Ariel Sharon, the former
foreign minister, who has himself met with Qureia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who met Abu Ala in a private home should not oppose his
coming to the Knesset,'' said Olmert, who is running against Sharon
for the Likud leadership. ``It should be remembered that it is the
Palestinians who have always refused to come to places which
symbolize the Israeli status, sovereignty and rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his visit was, as Olmert asserted, a recognition of
Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Qureia said: ``I don't agree that my
visit to Jerusalem is a recognition of its annexation. Jerusalem is
part of the Palestinian Occupied Territories. Jerusalem is one of
the issues of the permanent-status negotiations. We are looking at
Jerusalem as a capital of Palestine, and the likely solution is for
it to be a capital for two states.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg disagreed, and Benny Elon, another far-right member of
parliament, yelled that he was humiliating himself and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The two speakers said they would work to establish parliamentary
links. Qureia extended and Burg accepted an invitation to visit the
Palestinian legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Then bells rang, summoning the members of parliament to vote on
a motion of no confidence in Barak's government based on the
premise that he had informed Arab leaders of his peace plans before
telling his own government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is sacred,'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia pointed to his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-confidence time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The motion failed by a vast majority of the few members who
bothered to show up for the vote.

   HOLBROOKE-CONFIRM (Washington) _ The Senate's prolonged delay of

COMMENTARY: TAIWAN SHOULD BUY TIME, NOT GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've said it before and I will say it again: Taiwan is a
remarkable country. And so much about Taiwan has changed for the
better in the past decade. Its politics has changed to a vibrant
democracy; its economy is the high-tech envy of Asia. Its media
have evolved into the freest in Asia. Yes, so much has changed for
Taiwan. There's just one thing that hasn't changed: its geography.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is still a tiny island of 23 million people living 90
miles off the coast of a China with 1.3 billion people. A senior
Taiwanese official recently described the Taiwan-China
relationship, saying: ``It's like I have an 800-pound gorilla in my
living room, and the worst thing is, he thinks he's my brother.''
It may be awkward, but that's the reality, and both we and Taiwan
must never lose sight of that.
</P>
<P>
   Let me be clear: If China attacks Taiwan without provocation,
the United States must defend Taiwan. We cannot turn our backs on a
country that has built its whole political system and economy in
our own image. But this is not a fight that Taiwan or the United
States should court. Yet that is what Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, was doing when he said in an interview with German radio
that henceforth relations between Taiwan and China should be seen
as a ``special state-to-state relationship'' rather than an
``internal'' one _ seemingly nullifying the fiction that there is
one China that will one day be reunified.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating that fiction and ambiguity about whether Taiwan will
ever be reunited with China was reckless, because it is precisely
that fiction and ambiguity that have enabled Taiwan to triumph over
its geography. By pretending that one day it might reunite with
China, Taiwan has kept China at bay, ensured continued U.S.
military support and bought itself time to build up an economy so
dynamic _ the 12th-largest in the world _ that it now has critical
leverage over China. Taiwanese own 40,000 businesses around the
mainland, making Taiwan the most important foreign investor in
China today.
</P>
<P>
   It was also reckless because President Lee's effort to eliminate
the ambiguity in Taiwan-China relations was not part of any
apparent, considered strategic reassessment, let alone coordination
with the United States. It was simply tossed off in an interview by
Lee, primarily to pick up some pro-independence votes in the
upcoming Taiwanese presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, it was reckless because the only long-term solution for
Taiwan _ the only thing that will ensure that its flourishing
democracy and free market are never threatened by China _ is not if
it describes China differently, but only if China actually becomes
different, only if China evolves into a more democratic,
pluralistic country that will not seek unity with Taiwan by force
and that Taiwan itself would find a more attractive partner.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking more time, through more ambiguity, for this evolution
should be the centerpiece of Taiwan's strategy. This is no time for
provoking clarity. It was little noticed that last week Standard &AMP;
Poor's Ratings Service downgraded China's government debt and the
bonds of nine shaky state-backed Chinese banks. It was the first
time that China's official debt has been downgraded since the
Tiananmen massacre. S&AMP;P cited a slowing Chinese economy and rising
unemployment as the main reasons for the downgrade. If China's
economy continues to decline, and there is more urban unrest,
Beijing could be tempted to deflect internal tensions by attacking
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that if you go to Silicon Valley today and ask
high-tech execs there which country they fear most, many will tell
you Taiwan _ because it combines entrepreneurial talent with
innovative prowess. Taiwan has been recognized by Silicon Valley;
it doesn't need to spend billions to be recognized by Suriname.
Being recognized by Silicon Valley may not come with embassies and
flags, but it conveys real power _ a power that makes Taiwan
unignorable even if it remains diplomatically unrecognizable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What will make Taiwan diplomatically recognizable is a change in
China. Not only is that change in process, but Taiwan has a huge
role to play in nurturing it. The only thing Taiwan needs is time,
and the key to buying time is not clarity about its relations with
China, but ambiguity. Ambiguity is what bought time for Taiwan to
make itself unignorable, and more ambiguity is what will buy it the
time to make itself fully recognizable. Forcing clarity now is
reckless and stupid for Taiwan. It will buy Taiwan nothing but
trouble.

BRYANT GUMBEL DUE BACK ON THE MORNING SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Nobody exudes more cool than Bryant Gumbel.
But even the coolest guy in TV journalism has to be feeling the
pressure. On Nov. 1, Gumbel returns to the morning shift as co-host
of ``The Early Show'' on CBS, his first regular gig at the network
since the evening newsmagazine ``Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel''
tanked last year.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one expects ``The Early Show'' to bump NBC's ``Today''
show from its lofty perch anytime soon, nobody expects Gumbel to
stay third in a three-horse race, either. Gumbel's boss, CBS News
president Andrew Heyward, salivates at the possibilities that have
eluded CBS in the morning. ``Television's supposed to be a cyclical
business,'' Heyward said Monday, ``but it's a little bizarre to me
that the cycle has never turned in CBS's favor. This time I think
we have by far the best chance we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel admitted he was reluctant at first, but now sees ``The
Early Show'' as a chance ``to build something from scratch ... and
get back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Falcone,'' the TV extension of the film ``Donnie Brasco,''
didn't make the cut for CBS's fall season because its violent pilot
episode made Les Moonves a little queasy. Moonves, president of CBS
Television, says he screened the pilot about a week after the
massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a visceral response to some of the violence,''
Moonves admitted. ``It was too early at that point in time to say,
`Yes, let's go ahead and put this on the fall schedule.'''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Falcone'' is on the midseason schedule instead, and
producer Mark Johnson says the series, based on the life of former
FBI undercover agent Joe Pistone, will suggest violence rather than
show it. ``The pilot,'' Johnson said, ``is more violent than I
think it needs to be and certainly more violent than will ever be
aired.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Gedrick (``EZ Streets,'' ``Murder One'') plays Pistone, a
k a Joe Falcone, in the series, taking over for Johnny Depp, who
played Pistone, a k a Donnie Brasco, in the film.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pax TV, the ever-earnest family-values network that was
launched last year by multistation owner Bud Paxson, barely shows
up on the Nielsen radar screen, but its president is on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sagansky, the former CBS honcho who now runs Paxson's
``seventh network,'' says the big networks continue to lose
audience share because they're all narrowing their focus while
trying to compete with cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky said Pax TV commissioned a Nielsen survey of 4,000
people and found that 54 percent said they want more family fare on
TV. ``That's a huge universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky said it's especially puzzling when the top-rated show
on The WB, ``for all its cutting-edge attitude,'' is the
family-friendly ``7th Heaven,'' and the No. 1 show at CBS is
``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only hit that NBC has had in the past couple of years,''
he added, ``is `Providence, ... so I think the audience is
screaming at the networks for what they want, and the networks are
turning a deaf ear.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Odds 'n' ends: CBS has signed singer Ricky Martin to appear in
his first network special, probably during the November ratings
sweep. Shania Twain and Celine Dion also will return to the network
in hourlong specials this fall. ... Pax TV will resurrect the
talent show with ``Star Search'' creator Al Masini next season when
it launches ``Destination Stardom.'' No sign of Ed McMahon this
time. ``Entertainment Tonight'' reporter Lisa Canning will be the
host.

FREESERVE'S IPO DRAWS HEAVIEST TRADING IN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Freeserve PLC, the British upstart that radically
changed Internet competition by offering customers free access to
the World Wide Web, transformed itself into a $3.3 billion company
Monday by selling shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In the first initial public offering of a major European
Internet company, Freeserve's shares rose 37 percent on the opening
day of trading. Freeserve was the most heavily traded stock Monday
in London, an indication that the euphoria over Internet public
offerings, by now common in the United States, had spilled over to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that euphoria will last over Freeserve was unclear. Its
competitors have offered customer inducements to rival what
Freeserve offers, and the company has lost money since its creation
10 months ago by Dixons Group PLC, Britain's top electronics
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Freeserve is considered a pioneer in the rapidly
expanding Internet market in Europe. It stunned competitors by
quickly becoming Britain's most heavily used access provider with
1.3 million users, displacing AOL UK, a venture of America Online
and the German media giant Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve's main innovation is in luring customers by not
charging them the monthly subscription fee for Internet access.
Instead, it shares a percentage of the revenue generated by the
cost of a user's telephone call with the local phone company, which
charges all calls by the minute. Freeserve also derives revenue
from advertising and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   By the market close in London, Freeserve shares had risen from
their issue price of 1.50 pounds, or $2.39, to 2.055 pounds, making
the company worth 2.07 billion pounds, or $3.29 billion.
Ninety-five million shares changed hands, representing nearly
two-thirds of the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve's American depository receipts traded on the Nasdaq
market in New York rose similarly, to $32.125 from an offering
price of $23.67.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the public offering had soared in the last week as
investors sought 30 times the shares available. But analysts said
the demand was at least partly a reflection of pure stock
speculation, not necessarily any long-term bet on Freeserve's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's jumping in and jumping out. But that's the way it
goes,'' said Miles Saltiel, an analyst with West LB Panmure Gordon.
``It's less outrageous than it could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve plans to use the proceeds of the stock offering to
invest heavily in marketing and additional content.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Internet companies, it has yet to turn a profit.
Indeed, the company lost 1.04 million pounds, or about $1.65
million, on revenue of 2.73 million pounds from its September start
through April.
</P>
<P>
   Even measured by the outsized valuations of Internet companies,
many analysts seem to think that the company is overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valuation of Freeserve looks quite high compared to many
U.S.-based Internet companies like a Yahoo,'' said Peter Wyatt of
Credit Lyonnais Securities here. ``However, it's the only major
Internet play in Europe, and it's got that Internet cachet.'' Wyatt
said he was advising clients to sell shares in the company; he said
Freeserve was worth about half its closing share price.
</P>
<P>
   Several free-subscription Internet service providers have
intensified the competition for Freeserve in recent months
including British Telecommunications PLC, Virgin Group and the
Microsoft Network. It seems that almost any company tangentially
connected to the Internet in Britain now offers a subscription-free
service. Even the British soccer team Manchester United offers free
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service is no longer unique,'' Saltiel noted. ``It's going
to be a struggle for them. It will be a battle of the deep
pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the most telling sign yet that Freeserve's model
has taken hold, AOL UK announced that it, too, would enter the
competition next month with its own free-subscriber service, to be
called Netscape Online. The move is a strategic about-face for the
company, which has relied on subscription revenue, only two months
ago questioned the sustainability of a free-subscription business
model.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to some confusion about Freeserve's business model is
that deregulation among European telecommunications companies and
new pricing plans that may include all-you-can-eat American-style
calling plans could kill the subscription-free model that Freeserve
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model is quite elegant and has been quite successful,''
said Noah Yasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications here. ``But
long term, the future is based on unlimited calling plans, so there
is a real question about how they will respond.''

BOXER CALLS GOP TAX CUT IRRESPONSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer on Monday said the $792 billion
tax cut approved by the House last week was ``irresponsible'' and
would send the government ``back to the dark days of the deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat, a member of the Senate Budget
Committee, said in an interview that she would favor a tax
reduction of no more than $250 billion, in line with what President
Clinton has advocated.
</P>
<P>
   With the government anticipating a budget surplus of $2.9
trillion over the next decade, a tug-of-war has erupted over what
to do with the money. The Republicans and Democrats largely agree
that there should be some tax relief, and that at least a portion
of any surplus should be used to shore up the Social Security
program.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the scope of these goals that is creating
disagreement. Republicans contend that Democrats will waste the
surplus unless there is a major tax cut. Yet Democrats like Boxer
insist that Americans are more interested in saving Social Security
and Medicare _ the cornerstones of the Clinton administration's
plan for using projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership in the House scrambled on Thursday to
pull the party together and pass, 223 to 208, a 10-year, $792
billion tax-relief package paid for from surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vowed to veto the bill. The White House seeks about
$250 billion in tax relief, while some Senate Democrats are
considering a plan to cut taxes by as much as $500 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said the surplus should be divided in thirds, with
one-third going toward tax relief and one-third going to shore up
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The final third, she said, would provide money for programs to
help homeless people, improving airports, making railroad crossings
safer, fighting cancer, cleaning up toxic waste sites, improving
veterans' medical care and beefing up after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts she favors include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Making health insurance deductible for people who buy their
own coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permanently extending the tax credit for research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excluding employer-paid education from income.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving some tax breaks to small start-up companies and to
companies that provide child care.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will begin to consider the House-approved tax cut
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said the economy is doing very well and ``to reverse
course would be very dangerous and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican tax-cut plan, Boxer said, ``Most of the
benefits would go to wealthy people who have done swimmingly
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The millionaires are doing great,'' Boxer said. ``We have many
more millionaires now. For them to give back to their country, I
think, is a good thing.''

BOSTON SETTLES SUIT ON RACISM IN PUBLIC HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Resolving a landmark lawsuit over racial harassment in
public housing projects, the Boston Housing Authority reached a
settlement with tenants on Monday that federal officials said could
serve as a model for a handful of other such suits around the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the housing authority, which was accused
of failing to protect tenants in its apartments, must adhere to a
demanding program to combat racism in public housing _ a goal it is
already pursuing. It must also pay $1.5 million in damages and
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which must still be approved by the judge
presiding in the case in U.S. district court here, would end the
suit begun in 1996 when 13 black and Hispanic tenants complained of
attacks on them and their children after they moved into mainly
white housing projects in Boston as part of a desegregation plan.
They accused the housing authority of failing to investigate and
stop the harassers, even though some of their identities were
known.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement could also show the way to resolving similar suits
pending in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, said Bill
Lann Lee, the acting assistant attorney general in charge of civil
rights at the federal Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her reaction on Monday to the settlement, Reina Rodriguez,
a plaintiff, said: ``Relief that it's over. And I hope they do what
they're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Omayra Claudio, another plaintiff, said Monday that after she
and her four children moved into the Bunker Hill project in
predominantly white Charlestown, they were called names, spat upon
and otherwise harassed until even a trip to the store became
terrifying. ``I felt like I couldn't go anywhere,'' she said,
adding that when she complained to housing officials, they would
mainly tell her ``to get names.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit included even more frightening incidents of harassment
from 1992 to 1996, including BB-gun pellets fired into a family's
apartment, an evil prank in which a woman who was pregnant and near
term found herself trapped in her apartment because her door had
been tied shut from outside, and beatings of minority children by
white gangs.
</P>
<P>
   In February, federal housing officials backed up the tenants,
announcing that they were filing their first charges ever of
``systemic discrimination,'' in which they accused the Boston
Housing Authority of failing to stop the harassment. For the last
several months, lawyers for the federal government, the city and
the tenants hammered out the agreement announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, much has already changed at the Boston Housing
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   It now has a civil rights protection plan that includes a hot
line to handle such complaints, and it moves more actively to evict
aggressors. But the settlement will require it to do even more.
</P>
<P>
   Among aspects of the settlement plan are a requirement that the
authority must add new staff to handle complaints of racism, must
evaluate employees on how well they follow civil rights procedure,
must seek out and erase racist graffiti weekly, must increase
police patrols in projects where racism has been a problem and must
hire a civil rights monitor to oversee all this.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also requires that the authority adhere to a
``zero-tolerance'' policy in which tenants who violate others'
civil rights are evicted with their whole households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landlords cannot turn a blind eye to racial violence on their
property,'' Lee said. ``This settlement sends a message to all
landlords, large and small: The federal government will not stand
by when racial harassment takes place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all Boston's problematic history with race relations, there
was a sense on Monday that federal and city officials, along with
the members of the city's Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights who
helped the tenants, were preaching to the converted.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Boston Housing Authority has been headed by
Sandra Henriquez, a black woman who said at the press conference
announcing the settlement on Monday that she is keenly aware of
``the issues of race and disparate treatment that confront persons
of color daily in this nation, in this state and city.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to answer the tenants' complaints, she said, is to
reshape the housing authority ``from the top down and the bottom
up. This may take some time, but that is the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``zero-tolerance'' policy is already in place, she said, as is
a civil rights program considered the most progressive in the
nation. But all this work does not mean that deep-rooted racial
harassment will instantly end, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Omayra, the former tenant at the Bunker Hill housing
development, already seems to know that. Asked if she could live in
the Bunker Hill project now, she said: ``No. I don't even pass
through there anymore.''

JUDGE RULES JURORS CAN HEAR TAPES IN CISNEROS TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Monday dealt a blow to former
Cabinet secretary Henry Cisneros, ruling that jurors at his felony
trial may hear potentially incriminating tapes of conversations he
had with his ex-mistress.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings could be significant in the trial of Cisneros, a
former secretary of Housing and Urban Development who is accused of
lying to FBI investigators about the amount of money he paid to
Linda Jones, a political fund-raiser, during and after their
affair.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury indicted Cisneros in December 1997 on
several counts of lying four years earlier to FBI agents conducting
a background check on him when he was under presidential
consideration for the housing post.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was not under oath when he spoke with the FBI, but
lying to the agency is a federal crime. Cisneros could face up to
15 years in prison if convicted of all 18 counts of lying and the
related offenses of obstructing justice and illegally conspiring.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled that federal
prosecutors will be allowed to introduce at trial 22 tape
recordings Jones made of conversations with Cisneros between April
1990 and December 1993. But Sporkin said four other tapes,
substantial parts of which Jones has admitted deleting, cannot be
introduced at Cisneros' trial, scheduled to begin Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cisneros' defense attorney Brendan Sullivan nor federal
prosecutor David Barrett would comment on Sporkin's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to use the tapes in an effort to prove Cisneros
lied to the FBI about the amount of money he paid Jones, who went
by the married name Medlar until her 1989 divorce. Cisneros'
defense attorneys had argued unsuccessfully that none of the 26
tapes should be admissible at trial because they had either been
copied by Jones or heavily doctored by her. Jones destroyed the
originals.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting that argument, Sporkin ruled that the 22 tapes that
had been copied may be admitted at trial. Cisneros' defense team
could then argue before the jurors that they should disregard the
recordings because they are copies and not originals, the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisneros has presented no direct evidence that the voice on
the tapes is not his, nor that the statements attributed to him are
inaccurate,'' Sporkin wrote in his decision. ``This court will ...
allow the jury to decide the weight it will give to this
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sporkin said the four doctored tapes could not be introduced
at trial because their reliability cannot be proven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain portions of these tapes contain noticeable breaks in
the recording and flow of the conversation that indicate obvious
alteration,'' Sporkin wrote. ``As to these particular portions, the
government has failed to demonstrate that the possibilities of
misidentification and adulteration ... have been eliminated as a
matter of reasonable probability.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Sporkin also rejected the defense team's argument
that federal law prohibits the tapes from being used at trial.
Under the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, private
recordings of conversations are barred from trial if they were made
with the intent of committing a criminal or civil offense, such as
blackmail, Cisneros' lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Sporkin ruled that Jones had not recorded the conversations
for nefarious purposes but rather to protect herself ``in the event
she needed to correct inaccurate public accounts of their
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, mayor of San Antonio when his affair with Jones became
public in 1988, had told FBI agents that he had made payments to
her of less than $10,000 annually between 1990 and 1993 and that
the transactions had stopped. He also said the money was intended
not to buy Jones' silence but to atone for the damage the affair
had done to her reputation and to help her financially.
</P>
<P>
   But Barrett, an independent counsel, alleges that Cisneros paid
Jones more than $250,000, including $73,000 after he became housing
secretary in 1993. Barrett, whose office has spent $10 million on
its probe of Cisneros, contends that the tapes confirm that the
former mayor lied to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' affair with Jones ended by 1991 and he has reconciled
with his wife, Mary Alice. Cisneros, who resigned from the Cabinet
under the cloud of this scandal in 1996, is now president of
Univision, a Los Angeles-based Spanish-language television network.
</P>
<P>
   During the approximately dozen days of pre-trial hearings this
summer on whether the tapes may be admitted, Cisneros' defense team
of Sullivan and Barry Simon questioned the credibility of Jones and
her recordings, hammering away at her belated admission that she
doctored many of the tapes to delete statements that could prove
incriminating or embarrassing to her. The lawyers are expected to
repeat that tactic at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is serving a 3 1/2-year sentence after pleading guilty to
fraud for initially misrepresenting the tapes as unaltered
originals. Now she is working with Barrett _ the prosecutor who
sought her conviction _ in hopes of a reduction in her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also accepted $15,000 from ``Inside Edition'' in return
for her 1994 appearance on the syndicated television show. That
television appearance, during which portions of the tapes were
aired, triggered Barrett's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' alleged payments were the subject of Jones' 1994
lawsuit against him, in which she claimed the former mayor owed her
$250,000 for allegedly breaking a promise to pay her $4,000 per
month until her teen-age daughter graduated from college. The
former lovers settled the case out of court, with Cisneros paying
$49,000.

IBM MAKES MOVE ON DATA-STORAGE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM Corp. took square aim Monday at data-storage market leader
EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass. by rolling out a new system for
corporate customers and signaled plans to market it at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   IBM says its big new disk-drive system, known as ``Shark,'' will
win over electronic commerce customers such as major banks,
airlines and Web-based retailers who need to make vast amounts of
information available to their computers.
</P>
<P>
   EMC last year held 22 percent of the market for what are called
``external storage systems'' and IBM had just 10 percent, according
to International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   This wide EMC lead doesn't seem threatened in the short run
because some of Shark's key features won't be available until next
year, such as the ability to plug high-speed fiber-optic cables
directly into the devices.
</P>
<P>
   But Shark will sell at between 25 to 27 cents per megabyte of
information, IBM said, or roughly half the cost of EMC's high-end
Symmetrix systems, according to analysts. That could save customers
millions of dollars; a typical large Shark system, with enough
memory to hold the printed works of the Library of Congress, might
sell for around $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cost savings, plus features to keep Shark systems running
even during software upgrades should help Big Blue catch up, IBM
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   At EMC, however, spokesman Mark Fredrickson argued that
customers consider more than price alone when choosing these high
end storage systems. ``Clearly price is important but not as
important as other things,'' he said. ``If you measure the total
cost of ownership, EMC sells the cheapest equipment in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kilpatrick, general manager of IBM's storage-systems
division, said the name Shark was chosen ``because it shows a level
of aggressiveness on the part of IBM that you haven't seen for a
while,'' Referring to systems built around a popular operating
system, Kilpatrick said EMC's lead in Unix ``exists no longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick and others at IBM declined to discuss just how soon
Shark sales might begin to add to revenue and profits at the
Armonk, N.Y., computer giant. As a result, some analysts said they
don't expect the systems to affect the overall competitive picture
until next year, by when EMC will have new designs of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly a better product for IBM than what they had
to offer so far,'' said BT Alex. Brown analyst Phil Rueppel. But,
he added, few computer-storage companies have succeeded on low
prices alone. ``There's some time left for EMC to react,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IDC analyst John McArthur said that by setting low prices for
its new devices, IBM is copying a strategy it used previously to
recapture sales of powerful ``server'' computers from competitors
like Hitachi. With its large sales force and support group, IBM now
``can make a case that could be quite compelling,'' to customers,
McArthur said.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Spokesman Mark Fredrickson said the company was sticking by
earlier estimates that its sales would grow to more than $10
billion by 2001, from $3.97 billion in 1998, with profits to grow
by a similar amount.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in IBM fell 1 13/16 to close at $123 in New York Stock
Exchange trading Monday. Shares in EMC fell 15/16 to close at 60
13/16.

BEIJING DETAINS 1,200 MEMBERS OF OUTLAWED SECT 
</HEADLINE>

 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ As part of an expanding political campaign
that could affect China's economic reforms, Chinese authorities
have detained about 1,200 government officials who are members of
Falun Gong, the spiritual movement that was officially outlawed
last week, a human rights group reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were taken over the weekend to schools in a city
in northern China, where they are being required to study Communist
Party documents and to renounce any allegiance to the movement,
said the Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China, based in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, Chinese authorities have rounded up more than
5,000 members of Falun Gong, ransacking homes and confiscating
printed material. State television reported Monday night that
customs officials had been ordered to seize all religious and
promotional material related to the group.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what rank the detained officials
held, or how long they would be required to undergo political
study. State-run media reports on the crackdown, detailing a broad
array of official actions against Falun Gong, did not mention the
large-scale detention.
</P>
<P>
   By the government's own account, Falun Gong is the greatest
political threat to Communist Party authority since the student
movement of 1989. Certainly it mobilized the largest illegal
demonstration in Beijing since 1989, when 10,000 Falun Gong
adherents shocked Chinese leaders by materializing without warning
last April outside their compound. Known to suspect any
organization they cannot control, party leaders have declared an
all-out offensive against a movement that until recently was seen
by many outsiders as innocuous and even somewhat flaky.
</P>
<P>
   If the crackdown appears to be heavy-handed, carried out on a
spiritual movement with no discernable political goals, it is
gradually taking on the recognizable characteristics of a broad
Communist Party-style political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Government organizations and quasi-governmental groups have been
instructed to come forward to denounce Falun Gong, and to hold
political study sessions to recite Marxist theory that few
officials, and fewer ordinary people, believe in any more. In a
front-page commentary Monday, the Communist Party newspaper,
People's Daily, urged all officials who have practiced Falun Gong
to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet gearing up China's extensive political apparatus to confront
Falun Gong carries a potentially damaging cost to the nation's
economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
   Although the full ramifications of the campaign remain untold,
any crusade that stresses Marxist study is likely to redirect
political will that could otherwise be expended to win support for
unpopular economic changes favored by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji,
whose brief is the economy. Zhu has become vulnerable in recent
weeks to accusations from ministry officials that the downsizing
and dismantling of state enterprises are undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the crackdown, coming just before China's leaders
fled the capital for their annual political retreat at the seaside
resort of Beidaihe, has prompted wide speculation about the reasons
behind Beijing's decision to pursue a full-fledged political
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a system that still relies on campaigns, as much as on
legislative and administrative means, leaders often use a crackdown
to advance unrelated and hard-to-discern goals, in part by throwing
rivals off-balance and in part by wielding power through political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin is said to be the primary force behind the
current campaign, which is being coordinated by Wu Bangguo, a
deputy prime minister and one of Jiang's closest allies. Wu's
official portfolio covers the restructuring of state-owned industry
but he is also known as Jiang's top trouble-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger inherent in the crackdown is that followers of
Falun Gong, ordinarily peaceful and apolitical, could react to the
suppression with unruliness. That is especially possible at a time
of growing dissatisfaction over rising unemployment and spreading
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one seems to know its size for sure, Falun Gong claims
to have 100 million members, compared with the Communist Party's 60
million. The government puts the number at 2 million, and some
Chinese scholars estimate that a truer count is between 20 million
to 60 million. Yet because many followers simply practice the
movement's breathing and meditative exercises, without necessarily
embracing all of the movement's beliefs, it is hard to gauge the
depth of their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown also threatens to further alienate masses of
ordinary people from the Communist Party, whose leaders often
display a singular inability to understand the power of faith. To
complicate matters, Falun Gong is just one school of qigong, the
traditional practice of using exercises to cultivate and channel
vital energies that the vast majority of Chinese believe in, in
some form.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders are doubtless mindful of the critical role that
religious cults have played in times of political turmoil
throughout Chinese history, attracting adherents confused by social
upheaval, and sometimes becoming explosively violent when the
authorities act to suppress them.
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing Falun Gong, officials have pointed out some of
its fanatical aspects, such as its teaching that modern technology
and medicine can be evil, leading some practitioners to refuse to
see doctors when ill. A few followers, the government alleges, have
gone insane and murdered family members under the spell of the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong's founder, Li Hongzhi, who now lives in New York
City, asserts that learning to channel spiritual energy can lead to
physical healing and even to supernatural powers. His teaching also
involves Buddhist and Taoist elements, as well as conservative
social principles about how to live and behave as a moral person,
fulfilling what many social critics say is a spiritual void in
China today. The group's name is derived from the falun, or law
wheel, that Li says revolves in the body, emitting and absorbing
energy.
</P>
<P>
   After the crackdown began last week, Li said that his movement
is apolitical and lacks a basic organizational structure, an
assertion belied by the group's remarkably widespread and
well-coordinated protests. Last week, as the crackdown began, tens
of thousands of Falun Gong members protested at government offices
in more than 30 cities.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200 officials, who are being held in Shijiazhuang, a city
200 miles south of Beijing, are being required to write guarantees
that they will no longer participate in the movement, the human
rights group reported.
</P>
<P>
   Other state-controlled newspapers reported Monday that the
crackdown on Falun Gong was a success, and that many people were
voluntarily turning in religious materials.
</P>
<P>
   In central Beijing, police and military personnel patrolled
politically sensitive areas in Tiananmen Square and outside
Zhongnanhai, China's leadership compound.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the human rights group based in London,
accused Chinese authorities of blatantly violating the legal rights
of followers of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crackdown flies in the face of the Chinese government's
commitments to increase social freedom and marks the beginning of
yet another circle of stifled dissent and repression,'' the group
said in a statement.

FLEET SETTLES US CHARGES AGAINST MORTGAGE ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seeking to close an ugly chapter in which they
allegedly exploited low-income borrowers with usurious fees and
rates, Fleet Financial Group Inc. and a former subsidiary settled
charges Monday with the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused
them of deceptive home lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   The former unit, Atlanta-based Fleet Finance Inc., and the
company that Fleet created out of its remains, Home Equity USA,
agreed to pay $1.3 million to the FTC, an industry regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by bad publicity surrounding Fleet Finance, Fleet sold
most of the troubled unit to a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Co. in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes as Fleet works to burnish its image with
housing activists ahead of its proposed merger with BankBoston
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Finance, whose offices spanned much of the country,
garnered a stream of criticism earlier this decade for its
lucrative work in the sub-prime mortgage lending market. The
operations won Fleet enemies among prominent housing advocates,
including Boston-based Bruce Marks, negative headlines, and
resulted in several major lawsuits. While Fleet is no longer in the
sub-prime business, it has been subject to criticism that it cuts
back on all types of lending, including home lending, after it buys
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to avoid protracted litigation, and without admission
of any violation, Fleet settled this matter regarding alleged
technical violations,'' a Fleet spokesman, James Mahoney, said
Monday. Fleet exited the sub-prime business after selling the unit,
Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-prime lending involves granting higher-priced home loans to
customers whose poor credit histories do not qualify them for
regular credit. Customers claimed the allegedly exorbitant rates
damaged their credit histories, left them unable to meet payments,
and often resulted in home repossessions. Fleet Finance made some
of the loans but also bought loans from other lenders that did not
have the capital to service them.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC had charged Fleet Finance with failing to provide
consumers with adequate cost comparisons, necessary information on
loan terms and consequences, and poor record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC lawyer, Carol Reynolds, said Monday that customers were
unable to comparison shop with other lenders to determine whether
they were getting a good deal. In many cases, she said, they were
not. In other cases, borrowers were not told how they could cancel
their loans. The practices, she said, violated Federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violations were nationwide, and not just a regional
problem,'' Reynolds said, adding that the FTC had been
investigating the Fleet unit ``for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the violations, she said, took place from 1990 through
1993. The $1.3 million payment will compensate certain holders of
loans written or purchased by Fleet Finance for that period. Home
Equity was taking part in the settlement because it had inherited
some loans from Fleet Finance, Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Fleet paid more than $100 million in 1996 to settle
two class-action lawsuits and state charges of alleged exploitation
and discrimination over home lending. In 1995, Fleet was
investigated by the Department of Justice for allegedly charging
minority home-loan borrowers higher fees and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, the nation's ninth-largest bank, is a diversified
financial services company. Its shares nudged up 3/16 Monday to
close at 42 1/16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS TO PAY $1.2B FOR UNITRODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer chip maker Texas Instruments Inc. will pay $1.2 billion
to round out its cellular telephone product offerings by acquiring
Unitrode Corp. of Merrimack, N.H., a leading maker of analog chips
used to extend battery life.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of Unitrode will get 8.9 million shares of Texas
Instruments stock, working out to a value of $38.60 per Unitrode
share _ 44 percent more than the $26.75 the New Hampshire company's
shares were worth at the close of trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unitrode shares gained 8 to close at 34 3/4 Monday, while Texas
Instruments closed down 3 3/4 at 135 1/4. Both companies trade on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the better-known microprocessor chips, which work with
digital data, Unitrode's analog chips are designed to measure and
regulate inputs from the real world.
</P>
<P>
   This makes them especially useful in cellular telephones,
compact disc players, video game consoles and other portable
electronic devices, regulating the flow of electricity and
converting analog signals to digital language and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   These applications make analog chips the hottest sector of the
computer chip business, according to the technology market research
firm, Dataquest Inc., which reports that $22 million worth of these
chips were sold last year and predicts sales will rise to $40.6
billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Unitrode acquired its battery-control chip business last year
when it bought Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc. and has two chip
making plants in Merrimack and facilities in Texas, North Carolina,
California and Singapore. The company earned $18.2 million on sales
of $157 million in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments, based in Dallas, said it plans to operate
Unitrode as a wholly owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Unitrode has about 840 employees. Robert Richardson, the
chairman and chief executive, said no layoffs or firings are
anticipated and there are no plans to close or to move any existing
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the premium Texas Instruments is paying for
Unitrode is about par in a telecommunications and electronics
marketplace that places high value on sound companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a handsome valuation for Unitrode? The answer is
yes,'' said Irwin Silverberg, senior managing director at Burnham
Securities in New York. ``But if you look at the valuation of other
good companies in the analog integrated circuit business, not out
of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson described Unitrode's chips as ``circuits that are
used to manage power, make it more efficient, make it more smart.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they can cut back the power being sent to a
computer's processing chip when the machine is idle, which not only
extends battery operating life but reduces waste heat that might
harm other components.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications take digital data and turn it into analog
outputs like music, video images or the sound of human voices.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments is the world's largest analog chip maker, but
has little presence in the market for chips that regulate
electrical power. Unitrode will fill this gap. ``We serve many of
the same customers,'' said Richardson.

MEEHAN CALLS FOR BEEFED-UP LAW ENFORCEMENT IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The United States must step up efforts to establish a
civilian law enforcment force in Kosovo, Rep. Marty Meehan
(D-Mass.) said Monday after returning from a three-day visit to the
war-ravaged region.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, 14 Serbs were killed near the village of Gracko,
Kosovo in what has been called the worst example of anti-Serb
violence since NATO and U.N. peacekeeping forces moved into Kosovo
in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``These killings grimly highlight the need for the quick
implementation of a civilan police force in Kosovo,'' Meehan told
reporters at Logan Internaitonal Airport as he prepared to board a
flight to Washington to brief members of the House Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the murderers are brought to justice soon, I fear that
this violence could spread,'' said Meehan who is a senior member of
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, he added, do not have the expertise to handle
such investigations, especially under the weight of an estimated
10,000 killings in the region that must be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   He said a law enforcement agency was needed so ``the people of
Kosovo can control their own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan was part of a Congressional delegation that traveled to
Kosovo last Thursday to view NATO operations and meet leaders of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has denied any involvement in the
the most recent massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Meehan said, Kosovo's fate depends on whether its
economy can be resurrected _ a task he believes lies in the hands
of European nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure the U.S. doesn't take the lead in
economic development over there,'' he said, adding that the United
States should focus on humanitarian aid and bringing stability to
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also needs to take a harder look at its role
in Kosovo from the beginning of the crisis, Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some analysis of our military efforts,'' he said,
citing errant bombing runs and civilan casualties.
</P>
<P>
   While Meehan said he was impressed with the work of American
troops in Kosovo, Meehan also said his trip exposed him to some
grim realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned at the devastation of housing in that region,''
he said, describing the devastation of the homes of many ethnic
Albanians. ``They put their whole life into a house that has been
destroyed.''

THE FULL GUMBEL EXPECTED ON `EARLY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Before he agreed to return to the smiley-face
domain of morning television as host of CBS's upcoming ``The Early
Show,'' Bryant Gumbel demanded and received assurances from his
bosses that he wouldn't get ``called into the principal's office
every morning'' for speaking his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel appeared in a mood to test those promises Monday. Here,
for instance, is what one of television's best-known black stars
had to say to the press about his industry's record on diversity:
``Any time you have a prime-time schedule that not only doesn't
reflect the percentages in America but is virtually lily-white, I
think it's shameful. I think it's inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   At 51, Gumbel, clearly has no intention of mellowing any time
soon. He will need every bit of competitive fire as he tries to
rescue CBS's morning program from the ratings doldrums where it has
long languished _ and the powerhouse blocking his path to the top
is the very program he hosted for 15 years: NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel acknowledged that when CBS executives first approached
him about hosting a revamped show to replace ``CBS This Morning,''
he didn't leap at the offer. But now, he said, he is itching to
``get back in the game and compete,'' to conduct what he called
``hardheaded interviews'' on live television, and to shape a new
program that reflects his personality and interests.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gumbel lavished praise on his close friend and
successor in the ``Today'' anchor chair, Matt Lauer, he couldn't
resist one direct shot at his old employer, NBC. In remarks to TV
critics after an interview session here, Gumbel said dryly that the
predominantly white prime-time shows on the networks ``are
beginning to look like NBC's news lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to bring back CBS's morning show from the dead,
Gumbel is teaming up with his old ``Today'' executive producer, the
famously strong-minded Steve Friedman, whom Gumbel has known for 27
years. To judge by Gumbel's description of their working
relationship, some of the liveliest segments of ``The Early Show''
could take place behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of yell at each other and don't take it personally,''
said Gumbel. ``He can storm out on me, call me whatever names he
wants. I can call him names, throw things at him, storm out on him,
and we see each other an hour later and we're OK. . . . We're both
fairly volatile, but we're pretty honest. It's the way that works
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Friedman, who will serve as senior executive
producer of ``The Early Show,'' showered superlatives on Gumbel.
``The two best interviewers on television are Ted Koppel and Bryant
Gumbel,'' he said. ``I've worked with them all, and I tell you
there is nobody better on live television. . . . The command that
he has on a television set is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman did not exactly throw down the gauntlet to his old
program, ``Today,'' but he made it clear he relishes the challenge.
``Maybe, just maybe, the viewing audience is getting a little tired
of the `Today' show, and want to watch a new kid on the block,'' he
said. ``We are that new kid on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman told critics that ``The Early Show,'' which will debut
Nov. 1, will offer ``a little edge, a little attitude.'' Toward
that end, he announced that Martha Quinn, one of the first VJs on
MTV, and Lisa Birnbach, author of ``The Official Preppy Handbook,''
will rotate as contributors to a regular segment called ``Yikes,
I've Grown Up,'' which will take a playful look at the adult roles
of parent and spouse.
</P>
<P>
   No cohost was announced Monday for ``The Early Show.'' Gumbel
downplayed speculation about Oprah Winfrey as a possible cohost,
and joked that he has been sent letters and tapes from applicants
whose ages run ``from 17 to about 84.'' He and Friedman said the
cohost is likely to be a little-known personality who they clearly
hope will bloom, Katie Couric-like, into a star; Gumbel said he is
looking for someone with ``a degree of warmth'' and a news
background.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when ``Today'' boasts Lauer and Couric as coanchors
and ABC's ``Good Morning America'' features Diane Sawyer and
Charles Gibson, CBS recognizes the importance of its choice to pair
with Gumbel. Within CBS News, the search for a cohost has been
dubbed ``Operation Glass Slipper.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gumbel personally, the new morning show represents a chance
to rebound from a major career setback. After leaving NBC to join
CBS two years ago for a contract worth a reported $5 million per
year, he became host of a prime-time newsmagazine titled ``Public
Eye With Bryant Gumbel,'' only to see it canceled last year due to
low ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it fail? Replied Gumbel: ``You have a vision of what you
want to do, and after a while you compromise it to satisfy others _
to be collegial, shall we say _ and after a while you get away from
what you wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that he won't make that mistake with ``The Early
Show.'' Viewers who tune in will get the full Gumbel, which has
often meant interviews free of cant or pablum. ``Sometimes your own
feelings are exposed,'' he said. ``If you're acting like a jerk,
I'm going tell you you're acting like a jerk. I'm not real good at
hiding those things.''

CLINTONS CONFIRM VINEYARD   VACATION PLANS, N.Y. STATE VISIT

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will begin a two-week vacation on
his birthday, Aug. 19, dividing his time between the family's
favorite vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard and New York state,
where Hillary Rodham Clinton is weighing a run for the Senate,
White House officials confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ending days of speculation about their vacation plans, officials
said the Clintons will stay on the Vineyard Aug. 19-27. They will
then depart for East Hampton, N.Y., for a weekend of Democratic
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the first family will spend several days in
Skaneateles, in upstate New York's Finger Lakes region. Skaneateles
is the eastern gateway to the region and home of Skaneateles Lake,
widely held to be the cleanest of the pristine lakes there. The
Clintons plan to stay there Aug. 30 through Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   While they will have spent five of their past seven summers in
the White House vacationing on the Vineyard, New York state is a
new addition to their routine. Mrs. Clinton has been on a
summerlong ``listening tour '' in New York, where the Clintons plan
to live after they leave the White House. As she moves toward a run
for the Senate, Mrs. Clinton had said she wanted to spend her
vacation in New York but was sensitive about the visit appearing to
be a political opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, the couple will stay at the Edgartown
vacation home of Boston businessman Richard Friedman, where they
have stayed four previous times. They will arrive in time for the
president's friends, including golfing buddy Vernon E. Jordan Jr.,
to throw their traditional birthday party for him. The president
turns 53 this year.

WOODSTOCK ON TV: THE BARE MAXIMUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technically speaking, Woodstock '99 came to you from an old Air
Force base in Rome, N.Y. For all intents and purposes, however _ at
least for the millions tuned into the three-day, 65-hour
pay-per-view _ it had the look of a biker rally in Laconia, N.H.
(Well, except for the Harleys.)
</P>
<P>
   Had Beavis and Butt-head been watching, they would have been in
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sprawling, multiband rock 'n' roll event with the
bands at center stage, but the audience was very much part of the
telecast, with a lot of that audience sporting skimpy variations of
their birthday suits. You might think of the music _ by Metallica,
Red Hot Chili Peppers, DMX, Alanis Morissette, and others _ as the
main dish, but the hors d'oeuvres and dessert were the myriad of
partially or totally naked bodies strutting about for the benefit
of fellow members of Woodstock nation and, one surmises, the
titillation of Woodstock Couch Potato nation, which got to look at
more flesh than you would during a daylong loop of ``Porky's.'' It
was a voyeur's delight . . . and, perhaps, a parent's nightmare.
(We heard stories of parents hastily ushering the littler ones out
of the room; then, again this $60 three-day event was advertised as
uncensored.)
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the exposure was provided by women, though
more than a few men bared all as they paraded past cameras. Never
one to be outdone, Red Hot Chili Pepper bassist Flea spent his
entire time on stage in the altogether. Sheryl Crow resisted the
crowd's urging that she shed her top, saying, ``You'd have to pay
way more than you paid to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, there is abundance of things, sometimes there is a
lack,'' noted Dave Matthews, sagely from the stage. ``Today,
there's an abundance'' of breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the women in the crowd were perched on men's shoulders;
others showed their stuff on small, makeshift stages, dropping
thongs as well, behaving like exotic dancers. Sexuality is
certainly a large and welcome part of rock 'n' roll culture, but
some of this seemed gratuitous exhibitionism, with the
Woodstockians and the cameras mutually cozying up to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Did the folks flash because the cameras were there or did they
flash because, ``it's Woodstock, man, it's tradition''
</P>
<P>
   There were 33 cameras, five directors, and 65 hours of
transmission produced by Jeff Rowland for Metropolitan
Entertainment Group, a company owned by the concert promoter. ``My
instructions were consistent and simple,'' said Rowland, Monday.
``I wanted to capture every aspect both good and bad. This is the
main record. I expected a lot of mud and exposed flesh, and I
actually felt there was so much (nudity) it was unavoidable. It was
nothing we were tyring to add. I'm still amazed at that. But in
this media age, it's a way of assuring you get the camera to focus
on you. Why you crave it so much, that's for the sociologists. But
(the nudity) was ubiquitous and pervasive. One of the things that
makes Woodstock attractive is the sense of freedom and anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   He says there was much X-rated material they didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   We logged more than 30 hours watching this TV rock 'n'
roll/strip show, and many acts extolled baring the flesh, including
Jamiroquai, Wyclef Jean, and Sheryl Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Voice of reason: Offspring's Dexter Holland who said bare
breasts didn't ``give you the right to molest them.'' Wit,
subtlety, songcraft . . . nah, not much. Maybe a bit from the
misplaced Elvis Costello (acoustic guitar and piano did not make a
big enough racket). Overwrought though she was, Jewel at least
brought a strong voice to an event that mostly featured barkers.
Musically, the rap/funk/metal brood (Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Korn,
Rage Against the Machine, Insane Clown Posse) went up against the
hippie noodling collective (Dave Matthews Band, Guster, Rusted
Root, Counting Crows, moe., the Roots) with just a few acts
(Morissette, Offspring, Chemical Brothers) not in either camp. The
ruling band? Metallica, which started with the perfect anti-peace
and love anthem by Anti-Nowhere League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock '99'' was beamed across the world, to Europe,
Australia, Latin America. A spokesman said final figures on how
many TV viewers signed up weren't yet available.
</P>
<P>
   As to the headline-making bonfires and destruction at the close
of the event Sunday night? The pay-per-view showed bonfires, but
they looked relatively benign. Then they cut from live coverage
into repeats of earlier performances. The destruction happened soon
after. A spokeswoman for PK Network Communications, the
pay-per-view publicists, said they did not cut away because of any
fear of what people might see. ``We had a scheduled amount of time
that was live,'' she said.

16 CRUISE LINES ADOPT STANDARD FOR REPORTING CRIME  
(DW
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Cruise-ship industry officials said Monday that
the industry had developed for the first time a uniform standard
requiring that all reports of crimes on board ships be relayed to
law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the standard, allegations of crime on ships will be
reported automatically to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for
any vessel that calls on United States ports or any incident
involving U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, cruise ships left it to victims to decide whether to
report crimes to law enforcement officials, and some victims
complained that ship personnel discouraged them from getting in
touch with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule was adopted by the 16 passenger cruise lines that
make up the International Council of Cruise Lines, which covers 90
percent of the American cruise industry, Cynthia A. Colenda, the
council's president, said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy comes as questions are being raised in Congress and
elsewhere about shipboard security and compliance with
environmental regulations. Last week, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.,
the second-largest cruise company, pleaded guilty to routinely
dumping oil and hazardous material in coastal waters around the
United States and agreed to pay an $18-million fine. It was the
company's second guilty plea in 13 months on dumping charges.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Carnival Cruise Lines, the largest company,
acknowledged that members of its crews had been accused of sexually
assaulting passengers and fellow workers 62 times over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Because cruise ships fly foreign flags and the companies are
registered in foreign countries, they are not required to report
all crimes to the FBI or other American authorities. Carnival
disclosed the 62 incidents after being ordered to by the judge in a
lawsuit brought by a former employee. The employee said she had
been raped by a ship's engineer. Carnival's lawyer said the 62
incidents covered a broad range of accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, the revelation from Carnival was seen as
remarkable,'' said William S. Laufer, a criminologist at the
Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ``The last thing
on the mind of the vacationing public is that they are vulnerable
to assault when aboard a luxury cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   Laufer said the fact that the accusations involved crew members
raised concerns about whether the company took sexual assaults
seriously and whether it had adopted proper procedures for handling
cases and training personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival officials and lawyers said the company takes every
allegation seriously and that it cooperates with law enforcement
authorities in reporting and investigating shipboard crimes. The
decision to adopt the first industrywide standard for reporting
crime reflected the potential damage to the booming cruise industry
from any perception that ships were dangerous or that personnel did
not respond quickly to problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to fellow executives, the senior officers of the
four largest cruise companies _ Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Princess
Cruises and Crystal Cruises _ advocated a zero-tolerance approach
to shipboard crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If crimes do occur, the appropriate law enforcement
authorities will be called to investigate and prosecute to the
fullest extent of the law,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Colenda said the policy reflected longstanding practices at
most cruise companies and that it was set forth to reinforce the
industry's commitment to the security of passengers. ``They want to
be pro-active and want to make it clear that passenger safety is
the No. 1 priority,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise industry executives adopted the policy unanimously on
Friday at a meeting in Washington. They also visited congressional
staff members to answer questions about shipboard crime and to try
to nip any momentum for new regulations. Two congressional
committees are examining whether new environmental requirements are
necessary, and other members of Congress have called for additional
disclosure of shipboard crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Colenda and cruise-ship lawyers maintain that the huge
ships, which carry 2,000 or more passengers, are safer than even
small towns in the United States. But it is difficult to gauge the
safety because there is no central repository for statistics and
victims and their lawyers say there have been active efforts to
cover up crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Laufer, who has studied corporate crime for a decade, said
little was known about the amount of crime that occurs within
corporations because most businesses are notorious for not
reporting it.
</P>
<P>
   He said the difficulty was magnified by the nature of the cruise
business and by the incentive to minimize bad publicity in such a
publicity-sensitive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know even less about crime on the seas, where there is less
regulation and visibility than on land and where enforcement is
extremely difficult,'' Laufer said. ``Cruise lines act as
independent national entities on the seas.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Mokhiber, editor of the Corporate Crime Reporter, a
Washington newsletter, said there was not enough evidence to
compare crime in the cruise business with other industries. ``The
real issue is the difficulty in policing and regulating almost all
industries,'' Mokhiber said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise industry officials dispute the assertion that their ships
are not regulated thoroughly. They said safety, security and
environmental compliance are overseen by the International Maritime
Organization, which is affiliated with the United Nations, as well
as the countries where the ships are flagged and the U.S. Coast
Guard, which inspects ships four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not accurate that we are not regulated by anyone,'' Ms.
Colenda said. ``This industry is very highly regulated.''

 &HT;    The 'Blair Witch' Phenomenon
 &HT;    By Bob Longino and Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hollywood's hottest ``project'' has distinct Atlanta
roots that were very much in evidence Saturday night as more than
100 friends and relatives of producer Robin Cowie came to the Tara
Theater to celebrate the low-budget horror film that has rocked the
movie world.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside the theater before another sold-out screening
of ``The Blair Witch Project'' resembled a Marietta (Ga.) block
party, as invited guests and investors chatted with Cowie, 27, a
Walton High School graduate, and co-director/writer Eduardo
Sanchez, who happily autographed posters in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project,'' the new darling of the independent
film circuit, which has made $5 million at the box office in two
weeks on only 27 screens, owes some of its remarkable success to a
small group of investors from Cobb County (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Three Marietta couples _ Richard and Jan Ungaro, Lindsey and
Francis Tanner and Les and Fran Cowie _ were among the first people
about two years ago to invest in the film, at the urging of the
Cowies' then 25-year-old son Robin, the movie's producer.
</P>
<P>
   The three couples put up a total of well over $10,000. ``Blair
Witch'' initially cost $30,000 to $35,000 for eight days of filming
to make the scary, innovative fictional story about a trio of
college students who disappear in the Maryland woods while
documenting a 1785 witch tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a risk when nobody else would,'' Robin Cowie said.
The Ungaros and Tanners ``had known me for a long time. They also
were very aware of the chances. The odds (of making a hit film) are
such a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the payoff has begun. As limited partners who bought shares
in ``The Blair Witch Project'' for a profit percentage, the
Ungaros, for example, have so far gotten a 150 percent return on
their investment, Cowie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never invested money expecting to get anything back,''
said Richard Ungaro, a former vice president of Blockbuster
Entertainment, who lives in Roswell (Ga.). ``But when I first read
the story, I knew there was something there. Something really
frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   At a celebratory dinner at South of France restaurant Saturday,
Robin's father, Les Cowie, admitted that he and his wife had some
nail-biting moments when they saw the movie for the first time in
the family's Marietta basement last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear, however, wasn't due to the scary subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I had pledged our entire pension on this,'' said
Cowie, 55, a computer software marketing and sales executive.
``When we saw it the first time, we had kind of a sinking feeling
that our money might be gone. We were frightened that it might not
be a money-smeller. I thought, `Maybe this is too original!' Then,
of course, it got accepted into Sundance and we saw that other
people realized the potential. It's a thrill to see your kid get a
shot at his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night showed that Robin Cowie hasn't forgotten the
people who initially fueled that dream. Toasting the dinner party,
he thanked his Walton High principal, John Flatt, and the school's
media center director, Diana Brown, crediting them as ``investors
in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said last week that, as a student, Cowie ``was good at
getting people excited about what he was doing ... innovative
things that were very advanced for his age and the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Tara (movie theater) lobby Saturday, Cowie dangled his
9-month-old son, Peter, on his knee and greeted old friends such as
Walton grad and Lilburn resident Chris Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty surreal experience to see all this happening,''
said Wilson, 29. ``When Rob first showed me the story, though, it
totally gripped me. It's great to see other people reacting the
same way. It's wild to see this happening to somebody you used to
play basketball with.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisan Entertainment, the movie's distributor, has estimated
that ``Blair Witch'' might gross $30 million to $40 million after
it moves into wider release at more than 1,000 North American
theaters starting this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the film was made for a relatively paltry sum,
production costs eventually rose to about $350,000, which included
the year-long editing process, getting a finished print and
expenses related to the movie's inclusion as a late-night feature
at the Sundance Film Festival. ``Just getting to print alone is
$100,000,'' Cowie said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Blair Witch's'' total cost pales in comparison to most
mainstream Hollywood films, which sometimes have budgets that soar
well above $100 million. Some top Hollywood stars command $20
million to star in a single movie.
</P>
<P>
   At least 75 individuals and organizations contributed in some
manner to the making of ``Blair Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ungaros, Tanners and Cowies became friends after the Cowie
family immigrated here 14 years ago from South Africa. Robin Cowie,
who now lives in Orlando, has a brother, Ian, 17, who attends
Walton High and a sister, Collette, 22, a student at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   How the young producer first met the Ungaros is a tale as unique
as the out-of-nowhere success of ``Blair Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowie said he was 16 or 17 and was driving home with a friend
when he saw a good-looking girl walking a new puppy. The girl, the
Ungaros' daughter Chrissy, so distracted Cowie that he drove into
her family's brick mailbox. Chrissy's father happened to be in the
yard videotaping the new puppy and caught Cowie's accident on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, her parents and my parents became best friends,''
Cowie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ungaros were the first investors in the film, period,''
Cowie says. ``It was critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his investment in ``Blair Witch,'' Lindsey Tanner
declined to discuss details but did say, ``We believe in Robin
Cowie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowie is one of five University of Central Florida graduates who
were instrumental in the creation of the movie. The others are
Sanchez and his writing-directing partner Dan Myrick, producer
Gregg Hale and co-producer Michael Monello. Together, they formed
Haxan Films (the name is Swedish for ``witchcraft'') in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last chance for all of us to make it,'' Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   He had written and directed a feature-length movie on 16mm
called ``Gabriel's Dream.'' ``It went nowhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell into depression. When you grow up wanting to be a
filmmaker and then you find that that might not really happen, that
maybe you don't have the talent to really pull it off, you wonder
how do I justify myself and who I am. You have to admit defeat. And
you wonder what it is you're going to do in life now.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he drove a delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling sorry for myself,'' Sanchez continued. ``And I
was driving and thinking, `Blair Witch' was something Dan and I had
been talking about. At that time we called it only `The Woods
Movie.' I decided I was going to make it because it was the best
idea we had.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Myrick. And over the next few months Hale, Monello and
Cowie were in, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cowie, who had produced promos for television's Golf Channel and
Nickelodeon, and his wife, Sarah, were trying to decide at the time
whether to buy a house or invest in the new movie venture.
</P>
<P>
   Cowie says they gave everything they had to the film. ``We spent
every single dime. I was broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, their decision looks like the kind of story movies are
made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were accepted at Sundance, I knew we had something
cool, unique,'' Sanchez says. ``Everything else that's happening
now is just kind of wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers are going in a decidedly different direction for
their next project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comedy, called `Heart of Love,''' Cowie said. ``It's a
little like putting Monty Python, Erik Estrada, Ruth Buzzi and
`It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' in a blender. Of course,
nothing's definite. I mean, we haven't actually signed Ruth Buzzi
yet. We're going to completely embrace our sophomore slump.''

INCONSISTENT RED SOX LOOKING FOR LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Losing games is bad enough, said Red Sox right fielder
Trot Nixon, but losing them by eight and nine runs _ as the Red Sox
did in Detroit over the weekend _ is worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get your tails kicked,'' said Nixon. ``But
we've been unlucky; we had no luck in this last series.''
</P>
<P>
   True, luck is never good when Pedro Martinez is placed on the
15-day disabled list, but the Red Sox were bad last weekend for
reasons more than luck. Inconsistent hitting blended with
inconsistent pitching always leaves the sour taste of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Said Nixon, ``The first night the Tigers came out swinging the
bats and the second night we came out swinging the bats,'' and
Sunday ``we swung the bats but we were just missing the balls.''
Now the spiraling Red Sox head into Toronto Tuesday night for a
two-game series against their key contender, a team headed in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox seem to be finding their true level, and without the
cushion of Martinez there to halt any long-term skids, that level
is not good. Just as much of a concern lately, though, is that the
Red Sox bats inspire little confidence that they can lead the team
back from an early deficit.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion posed to manager Jimy Williams is a possible move
of Nixon, the team's hottest hitter the last few days, up higher in
the order from the ninth spot, where he has hit all year. Nixon hit
three homers Saturday in Detroit, only the fourth time in major
league history that a batter hitting ninth has hit three homers in
a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hitting the ball very well,'' said Williams as he
considered the question. ``One thing you have to realize is where
did he come from since the start of the year? I've left him ninth
and there's a reason I've hit him ninth. I know you can change . .
. but I don't know if this is the right time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the status of Nixon is relatively minor, considering the
Sox' sorry play in July. Since their high point of the season, when
they took a 1 1/2-game lead over the Yankees in the American League
East June 4, the Red Sox have gone 20-25. Even worse, Boston has
not won consecutive games since July 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, by contrast, have won eight of their last nine
and have gone 28-10 in the last six weeks. Even more suggestive of
a team on the rise, Toronto has won nine games in its last at-bat
since June 29, and have 26 come-from-behind wins this season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, of course, remains publicly unflappable about the dire
straits in which his team now finds itself. There's always another
game, a game in which the Red Sox will win, said the manager,
taking his usual positive approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the schedule says we have to go and I think
that's where we're going,'' replied Williams, when asked if going
to Toronto for this mini-key series against the Blue Jays might
focus his team because of the importance of the games. ``We go
where the schedule says.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays are 16-5 in July and the Red Sox are losing, and
sometimes losing badly. ``You always like to be competitive,''
Williams said of the recent losses, some of which have been
one-sided. ``That's why you play . . . you get good pitching, good
defense (and a team can be competitive). The pitching capability is
there, it's always been there.''
</P>
<P>
   With two days off this week, the Red Sox will be able to go with
four starters against Toronto and then the Yankees. Bret Saberhagen
will open the series, followed by Pat Rapp _ making his first start
in more than a month _ and Mark Portugal, Brian Rose, and then
Saberhagen again will pitch against New York.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to turning aound the slide, said Williams, are the
eternal baseball verities: ``good pitching, good defense, and
getting key hits. Good pitching explains a lot of this
(inconsistency by the Red Sox, both on the mound and with the bat).
. . . Everything starts on the mound; that's the way it's always
been and the way it'll always be. Pitching and defense and then
taking chances when a guy gets on . . . that's all it is.''
</P>
<P>
   True, that's all baseball ever has been. But it is the good
teams that can do this day after day, instead of one day in three
or one day in two. And whether the Red Sox can do it more than a
day or two this week against Toronto and New York might answer
whether this team is good, or destined to mediocrity.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A few years ago, a photo of Ahmed Qureia, one of the
top three Palestinian officials, was splashed on the cover of every
Israeli newspaper. It showed him stepping on an Israeli flag during
a demonstration, and the image implanted itself in many Israelis'
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as if it were a commonplace and not groundbreaking
event, Qureia, who is known as Abu Ala, ambled into the flat-roofed
Israeli parliament, a guest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a peep of protest could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and nodding, Qureia strolled past key symbols of the
Zionist state: the same flag with its Star of David, an eternal
flame for the fallen soldiers, a giant menorah and a mounted scroll
bearing the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago there would have been raucous demonstrations against
Qureia's presence. Monday, two right-wing members of parliament did
a little pro forma heckling, and one Israeli Arab member asked for
a Palestinian flag to be displayed as a courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise there was little sound of yet another barrier being
toppled as Israelis and Palestinians took one more gingerly step
toward making their relations normal. Although Palestinian
legislators have visited parliament at the invitation of individual
members, Qureia is the highest-ranking Palestinian to visit and the
first to enter the bastion of Israeli sovereignty as a formal guest
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first invitation, and I highly appreciate the
courageous decision to invite me,'' he said. ``The support of the
peace process is our main target, and we as elected people have a
role to play, particularly in this very serious and dangerous and
important stage, where everybody is hoping that the peace process
will come back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Qureia, who is the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, was invited, peer to peer, by Avraham Burg, the new,
activist speaker of the Israeli parliament. The invitation was as
much a part of internal as external Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting Qureia was classic Burg, a big and attention-grabbing
gesture that upstaged the new prime minister, Ehud Barak, at least
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great public relations,'' said Naomi Chazan, a member of
parliament from the leftist Meretz Party. ``You've got to hand it
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg, a high-ranking member of Barak's own Labor Party, was
elected against the prime minister's will in a victory that
represented Barak's first political defeat since his own election.
</P>
<P>
   But Burg, a religious Jew and an ardent dove since the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon in 1982, was also genuine in his intentions.
With his gesture, he was kicking off his bid to assert a hands-on
role for parliament in the peace effort. He has also extended an
invitation to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad not only to visit
parliament but to address the members.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the peace process has been conducted at the summit
level and on a people-to-people basis,'' Burg said in an interview.
``Well, the parliament wants to participate too.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg stood at the iron gates of parliament to welcome Qureia,
escorting him with a hand on his back through the Chagall Lobby and
down the steps into the speaker's huge office, with its panoramic
view of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame!'' Michael Kleiner, a member of a small far-right party,
called after them.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashed, Israeli television cameramen requested the sine qua
non of Israeli-Palestinian encounters: a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, of course,'' Burg said. ``And we'll save you some time.
We'll exchange our presents immediately too.''
</P>
<P>
   With a slight bow, Burg handed Qureia a silver-wrapped box _ and
a box-cutter to open it. It contained a silver dove paperweight.
``The symbol of peace, something I believe both of us are fully
committed to,'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent peace in the land of peace,'' Qureia responded as he
held it above his head, right under the portrait of Theodor Herzl,
the founder of modern Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So help us God,'' said Burg.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia gave the Israeli speaker a carved alabaster box inlaid
with mother-of-pearl. ``Made in Bethlehem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the camera crews filed out, the two made formal chit-chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we have to work to build public pressure for
peace,'' Qureia said.
</P>
<P>
   Burg asked Qureia where he lived. ``Abu Dis,'' Qureia said,
referring to the Arab town outside Jerusalem that is being
discussed as a possible capital of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aha!'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   They met privately for 45 minutes and then emerged to face the
media, Palestinian journalists who peppered them with questions in
Arabic alongside their Hebrew-speaking colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The two men sat before a giant Marc Chagall tapestry that
depicts Moses handing down the Ten Commandments to the Israelites.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Ehud Olmert, the mayor of Jerusalem, scoffed
at those fellow members of his conservative Likud Party who
denounced Qureia's visit beforehand _ like Ariel Sharon, the former
foreign minister, who has himself met with Qureia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who met Abu Ala in a private home should not oppose his
coming to the Knesset,'' said Olmert, who is running against Sharon
for the Likud leadership. ``It should be remembered that it is the
Palestinians who have always refused to come to places which
symbolize the Israeli status, sovereignty and rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his visit was, as Olmert asserted, a recognition of
Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Qureia said: ``I don't agree that my
visit to Jerusalem is a recognition of its annexation. Jerusalem is
part of the Palestinian Occupied Territories. Jerusalem is one of
the issues of the permanent-status negotiations. We are looking at
Jerusalem as a capital of Palestine, and the likely solution is for
it to be a capital for two states.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg disagreed, and Benny Elon, another far-right member of
parliament, yelled that he was humiliating himself and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The two speakers said they would work to establish parliamentary
links. Qureia extended and Burg accepted an invitation to visit the
Palestinian legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Then bells rang, summoning the members of parliament to vote on
a motion of no confidence in Barak's government based on the
premise that he had informed Arab leaders of his peace plans before
telling his own government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is sacred,'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia pointed to his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-confidence time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The motion failed by a vast majority of the few members who
bothered to show up for the vote.

 &HT;    New bonus offer doesn't entice Anderson
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons increased their signing bonus offer to
Jamal Anderson from $6 million to about $7 million, which would
make it the biggest in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But it still isn't likely to lure the All-Pro running back from
his home in Salt Lake City to Thursday's start of training camp in
Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right guard Gene Williams, however, said he is likely
to report despite his unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   They can become unrestricted free agents after this season. The
Falcons initiated contract extension talks with Anderson last
November but have not approached Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson originally sought a signing bonus of about $10 million.
The Falcons held firm at $6million even when Anderson amended his
request to about $8million weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said Monday talks are, ``progressing,'' but apparently not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without something in place, or some assurances (the Falcons)
won't use the franchise tag,'' Anderson said, ``I'd say chances are
very slim,'' he'll report Wednesday to Furman University, where
practice begins at 9 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The final year of Anderson's contract calls for $1.6 million in
salary and $1 million in incentives triggered last year.
</P>
<P>
   Each NFL team can designate one player who would otherwise
become an unrestricted free agent instead as a franchise player, a
move that essentially binds him to the team one more season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stands to earn $1 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't even sent me an itinerary. I don't even know
where training camp is,'' Williams said. ``I guess that shows their
commitment to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I bought a ticket. It depends how I feel (today), if I
feel like showing up, if I feel like they're not going to (mess)
with me as far as being the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, had a more pessimistic take than his
client on the Falcons' latest offer as he faxed a counterproposal
about 5:30 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed increase in signing bonus comes at the expense of
salaries early in the contract. ``They're robbing from Peter to pay
Paul,'' Sims said. ``Unless we're deaf, dumb or blind it doesn't
make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said, ``In base salary, I'm to make $1.6 (million under
his current contract). Terrell Davis, Barry Sanders, Emmitt Smith,
Dorsey Levens, Curtis Martin . . . can you justify me making
millions, millions! less than these guys?''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how talks go, Anderson is likely to show up for the
season. If he or Williams sit out all season, their contracts would
carry over to the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just found out about that,'' Anderson said. ``But once you
enter a situation where you're prepared to take the first step,
you'd better be prepared to take the second step. It's like
stepping on the picket line to show you're not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players could be fined $5,000 daily for missing camp.

CLINTONS CONFIRM VINEYARD   VACATION PLANS, N.Y. STATE VISIT

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will begin a two-week vacation on
his birthday, Aug. 19, dividing his time between the family's
favorite vacation spot on Martha's Vineyard and New York state,
where Hillary Rodham Clinton is weighing a run for the Senate,
White House officials confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ending days of speculation about their vacation plans, officials
said the Clintons will stay on the Vineyard Aug. 19-27. They will
then depart for East Hampton, N.Y., for a weekend of Democratic
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the first family will spend several days in
Skaneateles, in upstate New York's Finger Lakes region. Skaneateles
is the eastern gateway to the region and home of Skaneateles Lake,
widely held to be the cleanest of the pristine lakes there. The
Clintons plan to stay there Aug. 30 through Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   While they will have spent five of their past seven summers in
the White House vacationing on the Vineyard, New York state is a
new addition to their routine. Mrs. Clinton has been on a
summerlong ``listening tour '' in New York, where the Clintons plan
to live after they leave the White House. As she moves toward a run
for the Senate, Mrs. Clinton had said she wanted to spend her
vacation in New York but was sensitive about the visit appearing to
be a political opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, the couple will stay at the Edgartown
vacation home of Boston businessman Richard Friedman, where they
have stayed four previous times. They will arrive in time for the
president's friends, including golfing buddy Vernon E. Jordan Jr.,
to throw their traditional birthday party for him. The president
turns 53 this year.

MEEHAN CALLS FOR BEEFED-UP LAW ENFORCEMENT IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROB NELSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The United States must step up efforts to establish a
civilian law enforcment force in Kosovo, Rep. Marty Meehan
(D-Mass.) said Monday after returning from a three-day visit to the
war-ravaged region.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, 14 Serbs were killed near the village of Gracko,
Kosovo in what has been called the worst example of anti-Serb
violence since NATO and U.N. peacekeeping forces moved into Kosovo
in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``These killings grimly highlight the need for the quick
implementation of a civilan police force in Kosovo,'' Meehan told
reporters at Logan Internaitonal Airport as he prepared to board a
flight to Washington to brief members of the House Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the murderers are brought to justice soon, I fear that
this violence could spread,'' said Meehan who is a senior member of
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, he added, do not have the expertise to handle
such investigations, especially under the weight of an estimated
10,000 killings in the region that must be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   He said a law enforcement agency was needed so ``the people of
Kosovo can control their own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan was part of a Congressional delegation that traveled to
Kosovo last Thursday to view NATO operations and meet leaders of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has denied any involvement in the
the most recent massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Meehan said, Kosovo's fate depends on whether its
economy can be resurrected _ a task he believes lies in the hands
of European nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure the U.S. doesn't take the lead in
economic development over there,'' he said, adding that the United
States should focus on humanitarian aid and bringing stability to
the area.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also needs to take a harder look at its role
in Kosovo from the beginning of the crisis, Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some analysis of our military efforts,'' he said,
citing errant bombing runs and civilan casualties.
</P>
<P>
   While Meehan said he was impressed with the work of American
troops in Kosovo, Meehan also said his trip exposed him to some
grim realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned at the devastation of housing in that region,''
he said, describing the devastation of the homes of many ethnic
Albanians. ``They put their whole life into a house that has been
destroyed.''

   HATE-CRIMES (Houston) _ Hate crimes against Hispanics are on the

officials and extremists, according to a report released by the

   CATHOLIC-VIGILANTE (San Antonio) _ A group of conservative
Catholics has urged pastors and deacons to stop what it calls
``abuses'' in the Mass and a lack of reverence among lay Catholics.
But Archbishop Patrick Flores of San Antonio says the group,
Defenders of the Magisterium, has no official standing and no
permission to evaluate liturgical practices. By J. MICHAEL PARKER.

3D games. Anyone who plays state-of-the-art games is going to want
a video card that's at least a couple of steps ahead of the
programs being run. I've found two that are guaranteed winners. You

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Last weekend you could see Ross
Perot, live on C-Span from the small Reform Party convention in
Dearborn, Mich., still recycling stale criticism of the political
process and sounding as warm and fuzzy as a snare-drum staccato.
Fortunately, it was his swan song. He lost party control to

have been a weak link in next year's GOP candidate lineup. By CLAY
ROBISON. (Already filed.)

   FLA-MARIJUANA (Miami) _ The Drug Enforcement Agency has not been
able to stop it. Countless sheriff's deputies with machetes and
dynamite have been unable to curb its spread. Law enforcement
officials have tried everything, from high-flying spy planes to
bloodhounds, to stop the proliferation of marijuana in rural
Florida. Now, Florida's new drug czar, Jim McDonough, is hoping
that a fungus can do what aerial photographs and drug informants
could not. But environmentalists say the fungus, a voracious eater
of marijuana plants, could be the next kudzu. By Rick Bragg.

   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ A few years ago, a photo of

cover of every Israeli newspaper. It showed him stepping on an
Israeli flag during a demonstration in Ramallah, and the image
implanted itself in many Israelis' heads. Monday, as if it were a
commonplace and not ground-breaking event, Qureia, who is known as
Abu Ala, ambled into the flat-roofed Israeli parliament, a guest of
the house. Barely a peep of protest could be heard _ yet another
barrier toppled as Israelis and Palestinians took one more ginger

MADISON AVENUE MAKES SEVERAL DEALS, INCLUDING SOME OVERSEAS
</HEADLINE>

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another week, another spate of deals on Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the most recent batch is the acquisition of an online
agency, Beyond Interactive, by Grey Advertising Inc. in New York.
Other transactions include purchases and joint ventures in fields
like event marketing and direct marketing as well as traditional
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal for Beyond Interactive, based in Ann Arbor,
Mich., are not being disclosed. The agency also has an office in
San Francisco and is opening one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Interactive has 80 employees working for clients like
Advanta, Borders Group, Petstore.com and Primedia; billings for
1999 are projected at $25 million. The agency will operate as an
autonomous unit of Grey, separate from existing new-media
operations like Grey Interactive Worldwide, Mediacom Digital and
Media.com.
</P>
<P>
   The present management team of Beyond Interactive _ several of
whom met while attending the University of Michigan _ will continue
to run the agency. They are: Jonn Berhman, 25, chief executive;
Matt Day, 25, vice president for client services; Darian Heyman,
25, who holds the fanciful title of chief Internet evangelist, and
Nick Pahade, 24, chief strategic officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited by the opportunity to become a prime mover in
the global development of Grey's full-service online offerings,''
Berhman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another acquisition involving high technology, JDA
Advertising in San Francisco, which lists among its clients Avid
Technology, IBM and Novell, bought Hurst Group in Salt Lake City,
an agency with capitalized billings estimated at $15 million from
clients like 3Com and Novell. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, founded in 1984, has become the Salt Lake City office of
JDA, which had capitalized billings last year of more than $45
million at offices that also include Cambridge, Mass.; Seattle, and
Washington _ in addition to San Francisco. Mark Hurst, 47, who had
been president at Hurst, becomes director for the Utah office of
JDA. The 12 employees of Hurst will be added to the JDA staff of
more than 50 employees.
</P>
<P>
   In a third high-technology agency deal, the Earle Palmer Brown
Cos. in New York acquired KSK Communications Ltd. in Vienna, Va.,
for undisclosed terms. KSK has capitalized billings estimated at
$25 million from clients like Group 1 Software, Lucent Technologies
and Zebra Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   KSK will operate as an autonomous unit of the EPB Partners unit
of Earle Palmer Brown. Karen Kennedy, 56, will continue as
president at KSK and add the title of partner at Earle Palmer
Brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turning to other deals, the Jack Morton Co. in New York, an
event-planning and marketing agency, acquired Instructional Design
Group in Morristown, N.J., which provides services aimed at
improving business efficiency like technical consulting. Terms were
not disclosed. Instructional Design Group _ which will be renamed
IDG, a Jack Morton Co. _ has 30 employees working with clients like
Exxon and IBM Morton is part of the Allied Communications Group
unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Novelli in New York, a public relations agency owned by
Omnicom Group, and Millsport, a sports marketing agency in
Stamford, Conn., teamed up to form a joint venture called Porter
Novelli Millsport Sports. The unit will formally establish existing
collaborative efforts for clients like GTE and the World No Tobacco
Day organization.
</P>
<P>
   Three executives will add the duties of jointly leading Porter
Novelli Millsport, all as senior counsels: Bob Druckenmiller, 54,
chief executive at Porter Novelli; Jim Millman, 48, chief executive
at Millsport, and Julie Winskie, 35, executive vice president and
consumer marketing practice director at Porter Novelli.
</P>
<P>
   Looking abroad, there have been three acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Draft Worldwide in Chicago, part of Interpublic, acquired
Strategic Solutions for undisclosed terms. Strategic Solutions will
be merged with the Draft Hong Kong office, which will now have
about 50 employees working on accounts with billings of $42 million
from clients that include the Economist Group and Charles Schwab.
The executives of Strategic Solutions will run the office with the
Draft Hong Kong executives.
</P>
<P>
   Publicis SA in Paris made two acquisitions _ AMA in Manila and a
majority stake in Publi-Graphics in Beirut, Lebanon _ both for
undisclosed terms.
</P>
<P>
   AMA will be merged with the Publicis Manila office and be
renamed Publicis-AMA. The merged agency will have 300 employees
working on accounts with estimated billings of $20 million for
clients that include British Airways and Magnolia Nestle. At
Publicis-AMA, Antonio R. Mercado, 65, president at Publicis Manila,
will become chairman and Joselito P. de Joya, 53, president at AMA,
will become president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Publi-Graphics will continue under that name with Mustapha Assad
remaining as president. Publi-Graphics has 300 employees working in
offices in 13 countries on accounts with billings of $150 million
for clients like Nestle and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   And WPP Group PLC in London, on behalf of its J. Walter Thompson
agency, acquired the 49 percent stake it did not already own in
Grill &AMP; Gull Thompson GmbH in Vienna for undisclosed terms. Grill &AMP;
Gull Thompson, which will remain under its current name and
management, has 40 employees working on accounts with estimated
gross revenue of $5 million for clients like Austrian Airlines,
Kellogg and Unilever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two marketing information companies acquired from a
third partner for undisclosed terms shares in Intelect ASW, a
market tracking service for the consumer electronics, information
technology and appliance industries.
</P>
<P>
   The shares in Intelect ASW were acquired by NPD Group in Port
Washington, N.Y., and GfK AG in Nuremberg, Germany, from Audits and
Surveys Worldwide Inc. in New York. The deal makes NPD and GfK the
sole partners in the service, which has been renamed NPD Intelect.
The sale comes after United Information Group in London, a media
research company, purchased Audits and Surveys. &QL;

   Delta Seeks Remedy For Excessive Bumping &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines took the top spot for leaving ticketed passengers
behind in the first three months of 1999. The line bumped _ could
not board _ 8,144 of its ticketed passengers, while the nine other
major airlines together bumped a total of 9,167.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's rate was 3.33 passengers for each 10,000 boarded, while
the rate for all 10 airlines in the Department of Transportation
report was 1.44 for each 10,000. Trans World Airlines had the
second-worst rate, with 1,409 passengers bumped, or 2.56 for each
10,000. Continental did best, with a rate of 0.31. Delta's rate for
the first quarter a year ago was 1.14 for each 10,000.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Involuntary denied boardings,'' as the government describes
bumpings, result when an airline has overbooked a flight and cannot
find enough people to volunteer for another plane. When a passenger
is bumped and cannot be delivered to a destination within four
hours of the scheduled time, the line must pay an amount equal to
twice the cost of the ticket, up to $400; for a delay of one to two
hours, the compensation is the cost of the ticket, up to $200. If
the delay is less than an hour, the passenger need not be
compensated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it considered its performance unacceptable. John
Kennedy, a spokesman for the line, said it was getting new computer
programs to make load levels more precise _ all airlines overbook
to compensate for no-shows _ and enable it to notify and rebook
people before they get to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people we are bumping are our business folks,'' Kennedy
said. ``We need to take care of them.'' Delta has set up a team to
focus on the potential overbookings on its 2,700 daily flights.
``It is now a company rule that we will be seeking a significant
decline in denied boardings,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Ontario Museum, The Idea Is `Do Touch' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine visiting a museum and trying on armor, seeing eye to eye
with a 16-foot-high Tyrannosaurus rex or digging in the dirt to
discover pottery shards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You won't see any ``Do Not Touch'' signs in the new Discovery
Gallery at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Climbing, pounding
and drawing are essential. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Designed for visitors ages 1 through 12, the Discovery Gallery
is divided into nine interactive theme areas. Budding scientists
can dig up dinosaur bones at the Field Camp, piece together a cat
skeleton in the Lab and write their names in Egyptian hieroglyphics
in the Communication Zone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the leafy trees in Franklin's World, based on the
children's stories by Paulette Bourgeois and the illustrations for
them by Brenda Clark, preschoolers can put on a puppet show, read
books by the pond or color in the turtle's rustic house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the gallery are specimens of fossils and insects for
inspection under microscopes as well as videos of museum
researchers discussing their recent finds in Vietnam and Central
Asia. A life-size cast of a giant ground sloth hangs overhead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the museum include free entrance to the gallery;
gallery tickets are for specified times. The gallery, at Bloor
Street West and Avenue Road, is open daily. Admission in August is
$9.50; $4.75 for seniors and students; $4 for children 5 to 14.

   St. Louis Exhibits Tell Stories of City and Arch &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wait to ride the tram to the top of the Gateway Arch in St.
Louis has become more entertaining with the addition of two new
exhibitions in the waiting area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When Riverboats Ruled,'' in the South Tram loading zone, takes
visitors back to a morning in 1855, in the era when St. Louis
dominated Mississippi commerce. The exhibit resonates with the
whistles of steamboats and trains, horses' hooves on cobblestones,
the shouts of men calling out the river's depth.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors hear stories from Mark Twain's ``Life on the
Mississippi'' and listen to tales of stevedores and merchants.
Examples of merchandise traded along the levees and old photographs
are also displayed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition in the North Tram loading zone recreates the
morning of Oct. 28, 1965, when the last eight-foot section of the
arch was lifted into place. ``Fitting the Final Piece'' features
graphics and videos on the two and a half years that it took to
build the 630-foot-tall arch, along with a full-size model of the
final piece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gateway Arch is part of the Jefferson National Expansion
Memorial and is open daily. The tram ride costs $6, $4 for ages 13
to 16, $2.50 ages 3 to 12. Information: (314) 982-1410. &QL;

<P>
   The Flying Scotsman Returns After 3 Years &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first steam locomotive to haul a passenger train nonstop
from London to Scotland is back in service after three years of
restoration. From London, passengers can now take luxury day trips
aboard Pullman-style carriages to various destinations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Flying Scotsman, with its distinctive apple-green livery,
was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley and built in 1923 by the London
and North Eastern Railway. It was selected by the company for the
British Empire Exhibitions in 1924 and 1925 in Wembley, in
northwest London, to represent the latest in steam locomotive
design.
</P>
<P>
   After 2 million miles, it was withdrawn from service in 1963 and
sold for preservation. Since then it has toured the United States
and Australia. By 1995 the engine was in pieces; it was rescued by
Dr. Tony Marchington, a pharmaceutical engineer from Derby, who
bought it in 1996 and restored it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen trips from London are planned this year to
destinations like Salisbury (85 miles southwest of London), Norwich
(115 miles northeast) and Shakespeare country, through Warwick to
Stratford-upon-Avon (121 miles northwest). A millennium trip to
Scotland will depart in the 20th century and return in the 21st. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tours of the cities visited, as well as meals, are included in
the prices. All tours except the millennium trip _ its price has
yet to be announced _ are $313. Information: (44-1543) 250865, fax
(44-1543) 417531. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tourists Tiptoe Into Saudi Arabia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian Study Tours, the travel arm of the Smithsonian
Institution, is taking advantage of Saudi Arabia's being open to
tourism since last fall. Three two-week tours, Inside Saudi Arabia,
will combine lectures on culture and archeology with visits to
historic sites, museums and national parks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tours will begin in Riyadh, the capital, where the group
will visit the National Museum to learn about Islamic architecture
and traditional Saudi life; the Diplomatic Quarter; Masmak
Fortress, a mud citadel in the heart of Old Riyadh that Abdul Aziz
captured during his conquest of the Arabian Peninsula in 1902, and
the souk, or marketplace. The Riyadh portion also includes a day
trip to Diraiyah, the first capital of the al-Saud clan _ a city
settled in 1446 that thrived until the beginning of the 19th
century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Riyadh the group will fly to Dhahran in the Eastern
Province, the major Saudi oil-producing region, where commercial
quantities of oil were first discovered in 1938. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medina is closed to non-Muslims, but its outskirts will serve as
a bivouac to Madain Salah, an archeological site famous for its 140
sandstone monumental tombs dating from about 100 B.C. to 100 A.D. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other stops will include Jeddah, a resort on the Red Sea, but
any swimming will be done in hotel pools. All visitors will have to
cover up so only hands and faces are exposed, and women in the
group must wear an abaya, the traditional floor-length black robe,
over their clothes, as well as a black head scarf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The price, $7,220 a person based on double occupancy, includes
all meals and round-trip air fare from New York. The first tour, in
October, is fully booked. Departures next year are scheduled for
Jan. 13 and Oct. 12. Call (202) 357-4700 or visit

SPORTS COLUMN: ARMSTRONGS EMBODY OUR HEART AND SPIRIT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``From this Tour de France, we asked for the moon; it gave us
Armstrong,'' wrote the French journalist Claude Droussent, in this
week's issue of L'Equipe magazine. He referred, of course, to Lance
Armstrong, the heart-emboldening and heartbreaking winner of the
world's great bike race, completed Sunday afternoon in Paris, under
the shading trees along the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon, in this month of July 1999,'' added Droussent,
``would have been a Tour freed of its doubts and suspicions if not
all doping.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, 30 years ago this month, Earth, in effect, asked for
the Moon, too, and it also gave us Armstrong. That is, Neil
Armstrong, the first man to walk _ or hop about, as it were _ on
our mystical and mysterious rock and metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the achievements of each of these strong-minded
Armstrongs was something beyond the science of NASA and the
technology of Lance Armstrong's two-wheeler. It was something
beyond the dark but starry 250,000-mile distance from Cape
Canaveral to the Sea of Tranquillity that Armstrong's Apollo
capsule traveled, and it was something over and above the
three-week, 2,290-mile journey from Le Puy du Fou to Paris, from
the French Alps to the River Seine.
</P>
<P>
   There was the crossing, or exceeding, or simply the stretching
of the indeterminate boundaries of the human mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Armstrong, along with his crew, didn't know if he would
return from the Moon _ or get there at all without drifting off
forever into space. Was this curtains?
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong also faced the distinct possibility of death.
Three years ago, at age 25, he was found to have an especially
lethal variety of testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs
and abdomen and brain. He underwent surgery to remove the tumors
and lesions, and doctors gave him no more than a 50 percent chance
of survival. After intense chemotherapy, and still riding his
bicycle 30 to 50 miles a day, the cancer disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``A miracle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other people have recovered from the kind of cancer he had _ he
is cancer free now, with only a 2 percent chance of it coming back
_ but they don't throw themselves into the kind of exhaustive
physical activity that Lance Armstrong has. As Dr. Lawrence
Einhorn, the oncologist who supervised Armstrong's treatment, said,
such survivors may go back to work behind desks, but not behind
handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   When first stepping space boot onto the bald surface of the
Moon, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong said famously, ``That's one
small step for man, one giant step for mankind.'' He spoke of the
breaking of barriers of what was heretofore deemed implausible, if
not impossible. And opened up new avenues of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong broke barriers, too. He seemed to put to rest
talk that he had taken performance-enhancing drugs _ such scandals
had marred that race and other cycling races in previous years _
when it was determined that medication he had used was for
treatment of his cancerous condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of talk, it makes me sick,'' he said of the drug
rumors. ``But when the race is over, that stuff doesn't live. The
victory and the people that I touch and the story that I can tell _
that lives. I'm proud to be a cancer survivor and I'm proud to do
this, I really am. This race and my performance here are going to
affect a lot of people in a positive way, in a wonderful, fantastic
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lived with the devastation of cancer in my own immediate
family, the idea of hope _ as remote as it may sometimes seem _ and
symbolized in Armstrong's spectacular accomplishment, cannot be
minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are miracles, sometimes not. I interviewed Neil
Armstrong some 10 years after his Moon walk. He said he was
disappointed that mankind seemed no more united after the Moon
landing than before. ``I had hoped the Moon shot would take our
minds away from the more mundane and temporal problems that have
face us,'' he told me. ``But we still appear to be tied up with
today's problems.'' However, Lance Armstrong's message exactly 30
years and 5 days after Neil Armstrong's is that we must keep
trying. Lance Armstrong's message is that there is the decided
possibility that mind _ and heart _ can win out over pure matter.
</P>
<P>
   After Lance Armstrong's race was won, he was checked for
unsuitable properties. When Neil Armstrong returned to Earth, he
was quarantined for possibly carrying lunar germs. Both were
cleared, and have entered the pantheon of honored conceivability,
of, by courage and pluck, making dreams come true. &QL;

RESEARCHER TO OFFER PLAN TO CUT DRUG PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Boston researcher plans to present a proposal to a
congressional task force Tuesday that calls for government
intervention in bringing US pharmaceutical prices down to a level
comparable to those in other developed countries. US prices are
among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 million people, or a quarter of the US
population, have no prescription drug coverage, according to Alan
Sager, a Boston University School of Public Health professor, who
is to testify before the US House Prescription Drug Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a great crisis is unfolding here,'' said Sager. And
for those without insurance to cover prescription drugs, ``the
crisis is already upon them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Sager and BU colleague Deborah Socolar compare US
drug prices to those in other developed nations such as Canada and
Australia, and found that wholesale prices here are 25 percent to
68 percent higher than prices paid elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Total US expenditures for prescription drugs will reach an
estimated $120 billion this year, making it the second most
expensive part of the nation's health care budget, behind physician
services and ahead of hospital care, according to Sager.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States were able to negotiate prices down to
the level paid by Canadians, for example, this country would save
about $16.2 billion this year, or 13.5 percent, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Some government agencies in the United States already negotiate
lower drug prices, such as Medicaid and some state public health
departments. Legislative efforts are under way in Massachusetts and
Vermont to give state government the ability to negotiate drug
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Various bills have already been filed in Congress, including one
that calls for international parity on drug prices, and another
that would allow pharmacies to buy drugs at low prices for Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled, does
not cover prescription drugs, although beneficiaries who can afford
it buy supplemental insurance for their medication needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sager said the report does not propose or support specific
legislation. ``We're trying to identify some principles that good
legislation should follow. There is a lot of good in many of the
bills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), said any effort at a
government mandate or price control will hurt research and,
ultimately, patients. Instead, the industry group supports Medicare
reform so that prescription drugs are covered for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to expand drug coverage without harming the
industry and innovation,'' said Cottrell, who cited other recent
reports, including one done for PhRMA by a Brandeis University
researcher, which found price controls would stymie the development
of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Cottrell pointed out that the Clinton administration has also
come out against price controls.

IN MOROCCO, TOO, A YOUNG KING FOR A NEW GENERATION
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASABLANCA, Morocco _ King Mohammed VI of Morocco, the latest
Arab prince to be thrust into kingship, has long been regarded here
as something of an enigma, little known even to his future
subjects, and only recently allowed to share the public spotlight.
Yet the 36-year-old appears to have ascended smoothly to the
throne, the third young Arab leader to take power in six months.
</P>
<P>
   The new leaders are being welcomed across the Arab world, even
by those who mourn the ones who have been lost, as vital signs of
generational change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to have to say this so soon after a royal funeral,''
said a shopkeeper here, ``but it was time for some new blood _ not
just here but all around. I can't know for sure what kind of a King
Mohammed will be, but it was time for a younger man to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world did not get its first look at the new king
until Sunday, as he led the cortege carrying the body of his
father, King Hassan II, who ruled for 38 years until his death on
Friday at age 70.
</P>
<P>
   The new king walked dry-eyed and upright in his white robe and
scarlet fez, a model of royal decorum and of centuries of Moroccan
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Among his few known official functions as Crown Prince Seti
Mohammmed, the most important was to coordinate the 200,000-member
Royal Armed Forces. His father promoted him in 1994 from major
colonel to four-star general.
</P>
<P>
   But if the crown prince was ``coordinator,'' his father remained
the dominant force as supreme commander.
</P>
<P>
   Within Morocco, the crown prince gained a reputation as a
playboy during the years he spent waiting in the wings, showing a
fondness for fast cars and nightclubs. And he had never married _ a
source of puzzlement and not a little gossip in a country where a
man of his age and means is widely expected to have begun a family.
</P>
<P>
   But a new wrinkle was added Monday by conflicting reports about
whether the new monarch had been married on Friday night, within
hours of his father's death. An official quoted by The Associated
Press said the new king had taken the step to heed a Moroccan
tradition that a king be married before he ascends the throne.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters news agency, which first reported the same account,
later quoted what it said was a more senior palace official denying
that any marriage had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Neither news agency said who the bride might have been, and none
of the officials were reported to have said whether any female
guest of the king was present at a state dinner he held for
President Jacques Chirac of France after the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Across Morocco Monday, mournful Islamic verses sounded from the
mosques in a continuing sign of respect for the late king, who died
after four years of deteriorating health. Morocco has declared an
official 40-day mourning period.
</P>
<P>
   But life otherwise seems to have returned to normal _ in
contrast to stunning scenes on Sunday, when stores and businesses
across Morocco were closed and hundreds of thousands of people
surged into the streets of Rabat, the capital, to pour out their
grief.
</P>
<P>
   Like his son, King Hassan was known when he was crown prince for
sowing wild oats, but he later adopted a quieter life. King
Mohammed may well follow the example set by his father, who, after
becoming king, famously declared, ``The man you knew as Prince
Moulay Hassan no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and Moroccan officials said the new king's interests
range well beyond military matters. One Moroccan official said he
had been educated in French and Arabic and also spoke some English
and Spanish, had earned a law degree from a French university
(which he did not name) and had written a thesis on relations
between the European Union and North African countries.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he had been allowed greater duties, and was
known to have attended events that focused on the needs of the
poor. The new king had also begun quietly to forge a bond with King
Abdullah of Jordan, one year his senior and his predecessor by just
six months on the throne. Abdullah was also plucked from relative
obscurity to succeed his father, King Hussein, in February.
</P>
<P>
   That is an example of the kind of network that will become
increasingly important for the new generation of Middle Eastern
monarchs. Others are Sheik Hamad bin Issa, 49, who succeeded his
late father as emir of Bahrain in March, and Sheik Hamad bin
Khalifa, also 49, who toppled his father as emir of Qatar in a
bloodless coup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For now, young Arab rulers are still an exception. The most
influential figures are still leaders like President Hafez al-Assad
of Syria, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt, all of whom are at or nearing 70. Among the
monarchs of the Persian Gulf, the average age also hovers around
70, and rules of succession make it likely that those countries
will be ruled by aging men for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The latest whirl of leadership changes is the fastest since the
chaotic days of 1969 and 1970, when Moammar Gadhafi took power in
Libya, Assad in Syria and Saddam Hussein in Iraq after a series of
violent coups.
</P>
<P>
   Given the turmoil that surrounded other political handovers,
including the assassinations of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia in 1975
and of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt in 1981, the smoothness of
the current transitions provides quite a contrast.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even in some nonmonarchies, Arab rulers have begun to
hint that their sons should take over. Apparently their view is
that whatever opposition such a plan might meet is preferable to
the risk of a new struggle for power.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have signaled an interest in such arrangements include
Assad, Saddam and Gadhafi _ all of whom took power by force.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's son Bashar, who is just 34, has no official position.
But in recent months he has begun play a higher profile role that
has included diplomatic trips to Saudi Arabia and Jordan, including
extensive meetings with Abdullah.

 &HT;    South Carolina flag flap may include tourist boycott
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The South Carolina coast from Hilton Head to North Myrtle Beach
broils under nearly 100-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   For Gov. Jim Hodges, it's even hotter than that in Columbia as
he tries to cool calls from the NAACP for an economic boycott of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state with the Confederate battle
flag waving atop its Capitol dome and the NAACP wants it removed.
Twice in the last five years the General Assembly wrestled with the
issue and both times kept the flag flying. Former Gov. David
Beasley angered his conservative Republican base by supporting the
flag's removal. The issue, in part, led to his loss last November
to Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP has ratcheted up the rhetoric and is threatening to
squeeze the state's $14.5 billion tourist industry _ which includes
$6.7 billion in direct purchases of hotel rooms and the like.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's NAACP state conference proposed the boycott
earlier this month, recommending it start Jan. 1. Delegates to the
national convention recently approved the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution still needs approval by the NAACP's national
board to become official, but already three major civil rights
groups _ the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta,
the National Urban League and the National Council of Negro Women _
have endorsed the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hodges met with NAACP representatives and agreed to
poll members of the Legislature in an attempt to find the votes to
bring down the battle flag. The governor warned that boycotting the
state would affect everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``An economic boycott has an impact on not only white but
African-American South Carolinians,'' said Hodges, propelled into
office by an overwhelming turnout of black voters. ``My concern is
the impact it has on Charleston and other communities _ both black
and white.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, other Southern states struggled over the
Confederate flag or its emblem on their state flag. Alabama flew
the battle flag over its Capitol dome until a state judge ruled in
1993 that it violated state law. In 1993, the General Assembly
rebuffed Georgia Gov. Zell Miller when he appealed to Legislators
to remove the Confederate emblem from Georgia's flag.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP challenged Mississippi's use of a state flag with the
Confederate insignia six years ago. An official with the state
attorney general's office argued last week the case should be
thrown out of court because the statute of limitations expired near
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Back in South Carolina, at least one convention already has been
lost, and state tourism officials fear professional associations
unconnected to civil rights will cancel meetings in the state to
avoid the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking advice, the state tourism department has contacted areas
boycotted in the past. One state is Arizona, which ultimately lost
the 1993 Super Bowl because voters rejected Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday as a state holiday (the outcome since has been
reversed).
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina does not recognize King's birthday as a state
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the convention business is (affected) because you
have an association of members in that organization that has to be
sensitive to their members, be they African-Americans, minority or
otherwise,'' said Moke McGowan, senior director of marketing for
South Carolina's tourism department. ``That's where you would
typically find the greatest immediate economic impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The SCLC cancelled its national convention in Charleston, which
would have ended Wednesday. The area lost at least $321,000,
McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the right thing to do not to spend our dollars here
as long as this state flies that flag,'' SCLC national president
Martin Luther King III said at a Charleston rally.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Ravenel, a 72-year-old Republican state senator from
Charleston, claimed most people in his city were ``amused'' at the
thought of a tourism boycott by blacks, who represent only seven of
every 100 tourists each year in South Carolina, according to state
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Charleston area is such a popular place to come,'' Ravenel
said Monday. ``Everybody is just coming here. I think the consensus
is that, you know, hopefully, maybe it will lighten the load so the
lines won't be as long and there'll be more rooms available and you
won't have to wait as long to get into a restaurant. The consensus
is maybe the NAACP has done us a favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges said the flag flap generates anything but consensus and
worried the boycott ``would tend to divide us more than bring us
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of the Confederate flag is a very decisive and
painful issue for South Carolina,'' Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight C. James, executive of the NAACP state conference in
Columbia, said the group is concerned that Hodges has not flexed
enough political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we communicated to him our expectations that he would
provide some leadership on the matter and not just stay in the
middle of the road,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   James said wants Hodges to ``actually making a concerted attempt
to influence those allies that are in the House and the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only commitment Hodges has made is to canvass the
Legislature. One vote he's certain not to get is Ravenel's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Ravenel, who first served in the
statehouse in 1953. ``We're not going to pull that flag down.
That's probably the safest icon in South Carolina.''

U.S. ANTI-DRUG CHIEF ARRIVES IN COLOMBIA, CITING REGIONAL
`EMERGENCY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The Clinton administration's top
anti-narcotics official arrived here Monday to assess what he
described as a deepening regional crisis, one that Latin American
governments fear will lead to American intervention.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived as a search continued for a plane with five American
soldiers and two Colombian military officers who had been on a
counter-drug reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, who was accompanied by
State Department and military officials, comes 10 days after the
Colombian government asked the United States for $500 million in
additional aid over the next two years. The money would be used to
combat left-wing guerrilla groups that, both governments say, are
deeply involved in cocaine and heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, scheduled to receive $289 million in assistance from
Washington this year, is already the third-largest recipient of
American aid, after Israel and Egypt. McCaffrey recommended this
month that $1 billion in ``emergency drug supplemental assistance''
be made available to Colombia and other American allies in the
Andes and the Caribbean as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has paid inadequate attention to a serious
and growing emergency in the region,'' McCaffrey said at a news
conference here Monday, after meeting with President Andres
Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey begins his visit, which is scheduled to take him to
Ecuador and Curacao later this week, at a time of mounting American
concern about the military and political situation here and growing
Latin American concern about the United States' intentions. At a
news conference last week, President Clinton said he recognized
that vital American interests were at stake in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``very much in our national security interests to do what
we can, if we can be helpful in ending the civil conflict so that
Colombia can be about the business of freeing itself of the
narco-traffickers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's declaration of support for Pastrana was not in itself
new. But after recent gains here by guerrillas, it has been
interpreted in Latin America as a possible prelude to increased
American involvement in Colombia. The governments of Peru, Brazil
and Venezuela have responded in recent days with statements
condemning any outside interference here.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently seeking political gain, spokesmen for the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's main
guerrilla group, have also brandished the specter of American
military intervention. Pastrana, already on the defensive because
of his inability to check the rebels or bring them to the
negotiating table, responded by playing down both the degree of
U.S. assistance he is seeking and the danger the guerrillas
represent to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as I am President of Colombia, I will never accept nor
permit the intervention of other countries in the internal problems
of our nation,'' he said in a speech over the weekend. ``I want to
be clear: Colombia is not and will never be a threat to any
country. Those who want to sell incorrect stories about the
security of the region are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public remarks Monday, McCaffrey did not directly address
the Latin American reservations. But he emphasized at every
opportunity that there were no plans for American military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Colombian question and a Colombian strategy,'' he
said. The role of the United States, he added, is limited to
providing ``support in a regional crisis,'' only for counterdrug
operations, not for counterinsurgency efforts, and always ``in
absolute deference to the national sovereignty of our partners.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the risks of American involvement here,
Colombian police and army units were trying, despite a heavy fog,
to reach the wreckage of a plane that went off radar screens early
Friday while flying a counterdrug reconnaissance mission over a
guerrilla-held area. The rebels often fire at crop-dusting planes
in territory they control, but there are no indications that the
seven-man crew is in rebel hands or that it was brought down by
anything other than an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to have any conclusions about the flight until
Colombian police forces are at the site,'' McCaffrey said Monday.
But he added, ``The evidence so far would indicate that the five
brave American aviators and two Colombian Air Force officers have
probably lost their lives in a fatal accident.''

LARRY KENT, 86, MARKETER WHO POPULARIZED NFL MERCHANDISE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kent, who as the first president of NFL Properties, the
licensing and marketing arm of the National Football League, lived
to see it grow from gross revenue of $36,647 in 1963 to $3 billion
in 1998, died July 14 in his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pete Rozelle became the league's commissioner in 1960,
the professional teams sold their program advertising individually,
and no one sold clothing or other items with league or team
insignia. Wellington Mara, the president and co-owner of the
Giants, said Rozelle had come up with the idea of centralized
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not to promote a moneymaker,'' Mara said, ``but to
further the image of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Rozelle hired Kent to run NFL Properties. Kent had been the
manager of marketing for Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, spending 12
years on the road with Roy, Dale, Trigger and their singing group,
the Sons of the Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Kent conceived the idea of installing Roy Rogers Corrals in
major department stores around the country, selling children's
cowboy clothes and toys. He applied the same ideas to NFL
Properties, although it took time before jackets and T-shirts were
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Spadea, a former president of the San Francisco 49ers and
now president of the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame, recalled those
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We formed NFL Properties to sell program advertising,'' he
said. ``We hired Larry Kent as the first president and he did a
fine job getting the league and team logos on T-shirts, lunch
pails, anything. His goal was to get a page of NFL items in the
Sears, Roebuck catalog, and he did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was back in the days when no one put anything on a
T-shirt. I think our equipment man was the first to put something
on them. Our players were stealing them, so he stenciled ``49ers''
on them so it would show through their shirts. One guy got around
that by wearing the T-shirt backward, so our equipment guy
stenciled both front and back.''
</P>
<P>
   From that beginning sprang NFL Properties, which charges a
licensing fee of less than 10 percent of an item's sales price. The
profits are shared equally by the 30 teams. The first year, each of
the 14 teams earned $2,600. Last year, each of the 30 teams earned
more than $5 million from centralized licensing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Kent was born and raised in Los Angeles and graduated from UCLA.
He retired from NFL Properties in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife died in 1979. He is survived by his second wife,
Lisa; a daughter from his first marriage, Judy Carney of Darien,
Conn.; two grandchildren, and a great-grandson. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last day of the last Checker Cab in New York
should have been full of nostalgia and romance, the storied
retirement of a much-loved icon integral to the city's lore and its
lure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was filled with hassles.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the gnawing pain in Earl Johnson's left knee, a
bout of gout that made it wrenching to fold his 6-foot-1 frame into
the driver's seat of the 1978 classic, and even more agonizing to
get out. Then, there was the awkward moment, after Johnson stopped
abruptly in front of a Jamaican restaurant, when his fare _ a woman
late for work _ followed him inside to find out what he was doing
(every cab driver has his favorite pit stops).
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps inevitably, there were the special hassles that
come with owning a rolling New York City institution at the end of
its era. Having decided that the cab had become too expensive to
fix to the city's standards, Johnson spent the day juggling
interviews so that each journalist had a solo ride-along, artfully
avoiding questions about how much money he had made in the Checker
_ or might make selling it _ and even having one of the
photographers in the caravan following him through Central Park get
stopped by the police for a broken brake light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing so much money today,'' Johnson, 61, complained as
he declined a fare for fear of missing yet another appointment with
the press. ``I'm willing to go along with everybody, but I am just
one person.''
</P>
<P>
   These were, of course, the low points. There were lovely
moments, too.
</P>
<P>
   The fares who shared poignant childhood memories. The drivers
who leaned out of their windows to shout good luck and God bless.
The comrade cabbie who stopped at three successive stoplights to
take her own snapshots of history.
</P>
<P>
   And two hours with Roberta Horton and James Donnelly, social
workers who rode in Johnson's Checker to their wedding and
celebrated their second anniversary Monday by reliving the moment
in the back of the cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Checker is the ultimate urban luxury,'' Ms. Horton, 47,
said as she held her beloved's hand. ``It's such a grand car. It's
a vehicle that belongs to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxi and Limousine Commission says Johnson's Checker, which
is on its third engine and nearing 1 million miles on the odometer,
needs a new chassis. Johnson's mechanic says that would cost $6,000
or more. Johnson says the car is fine and the commission's
standards are too strict, but that it seems like the time to fold
up his jump seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for handouts. I'm finished,'' he said Monday
as he limped around, shaking hands and posing for pictures. ``I'm
ready. Ready, ready, ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities still have Checker Cabs, the bulbous vehicles
reminiscent of the 1920s, when they were first manufactured in
Kalamazoo, Mich. There are Checkers around the city that are no
longer cabs, painted pink or purple or maybe checkered all over.
There are companies called Checker Cab, even if their cars are
Dodges and Fords.
</P>
<P>
   But as of Tuesday morning, pedestrians can no longer hail the
ultimate symbol of New York City streets on New York City streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's retiring,'' a concierge told a doorman at The Mark hotel,
gesturing and gawking at Johnson and his cab as they dropped off
Ms. Horton and Donnelly for their anniversary lunch. ``I think
that's him. This is the last one. He's been in the news for like
three days now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has a tuft of white hair above his forehead and a
few gray whiskers in his beard, started driving a Checker in 1973,
when some 5,000 of the classic cars made up most of New York's
yellow taxi fleet. Jamaica-born, he had been in this country for a
dozen years, and started driving a cab after dreams of opening a
restaurant fell apart for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The riding public likes the Checker and it lasts longer,'' he
said, though the first car lasted only five years before it was
felled by a mechanical problem. ``There's more room for myself and
the passengers. You're sitting up above all the other cabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, after 26 years behind the historic wheel, he has learned
that the police rarely stop Checkers, which sits high above the
traffic, with enough leg room in the back for a couple of
pro-basketball player, plus a pair of adorable little jump seats.
Doormen at fancy hotels pull them up to the front of cab lines. And
while the fare on the meter is exactly the same as in any other
cab, the tips tend to be better.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as on most mornings, Johnson left his home in the
Rosedale section of Queens at about 7 a.m. and went to John F.
Kennedy Airport. He picked up a passenger at Delta and took him to
midtown Manhattan, which was convenient, because he had to meet a
television crew on the East Side for a live interview.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took a woman across town to Times Square, whereupon he
found a trio of gentlemen heading to a show for mens clothiers at
Pier 94 on the West Side, after which he picked up Tina Landau, a
writer and director who was heading downtown to the Papp Public
Theater near Astor Place.
</P>
<P>
   It started out well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a girl growing up in New York, we used to look for
them purposely _ they were  &UR; the  &LR; cab,'' Ms. Landau said as she
stepped into the cab. ``I saw you coming, and I almost didn't get
in. I haven't seen one of these in so long, I thought, is this
real?''
</P>
<P>
   But then Johnson pulled over on Ninth Avenue at Jam's Jamaica
Restaurant and said he would be back in a minute. After a minute,
Ms. Landau went inside to check. She came back quickly, Johnson on
her heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you it's a second, you just wait a second,'' the driver
snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get in a cab to stop midway,'' Ms. Landau retorted.
``I could call the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Empty threats for a man headed for retirement, scheduled to be
feted by the taxi commission next week.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By summer's end, Johnson plans to be back in his native Montego
Bay, where he and his wife run a bed and breakfast called Grace
Villa.
</P>
<P>
   The Checker, which originally cost about $9,000, will probably
stay behind. A German museum has made inquiries, but Johnson wants
the car he nicknamed Janie after a long-ago sweetheart to remain in
the United States, preferably New York. He is talking to Sotheby's,
and dreaming of numbers with lots of zeroes. As for taxi medallion
111 _ the equivalent of a permit to operate a cab in New York _
Johnson plans to lease it and is counting on the retirement income
of about $1,400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   What he will keep are the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at her Fifth Avenue
apartment (he didn't even recognize her at first) and taking her to
Elizabeth Arden. Walter Cronkite riding for a dozen blocks down
Broadway (``I was kind of excited to look up and see the same guy I
see on the TV.''). Getting yanked out of a taxi line a couple of
years ago at the Pierre hotel to drive Muhammad Ali down to the
Citicorp building (``I just said, `Hi, champ.''').
</P>
<P>
   There was the $500 fare to Boston, and the $700 trip to upstate
Ithaca _ a 225 miles trip _ when a business man with a pending deal
could not get a flight out of Kennedy airport because of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young and strong and didn't think about anything,''
Johnson said, laughing the laugh of a man now much wiser and older.
``If there was 10 feet of snow it didn't mean anything. Now I'm
scared to go from here to Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also dozens of weddings and sight-seeing tours,
actors whose names he can never remember and appearances _ for the
Checker, not the driver _ in movies he never saw. And, once, a $20
tip on a $7 fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got out of one cab and got into my cab because that guy
didn't know where he was going,'' Johnson said of the banker in a
rush to go from a midtown hotel to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Monday there were no celebrities except Johnson himself, who
first came to public attention in 1993, when there were only 10
Checkers left in New York. He has been featured in numerous
articles since then, and it is no accident that he outlasted Johann
Struna, the second-to-last Checker cabbie, who retired in December
because he, too, could not afford the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson smiled for the tourists from Cleveland, shook hands
with the teacher out for a walk on the Upper West Side and waved
happily to numerous fellow drivers beeping their well-wishes as he
passed.
</P>
<P>
   It was all he could do to get to Queens by mid-afternoon to
refill a prescription for his aching knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even move from the seat, it's all swollen,'' he said.
``The only reason why I'm out here now is because it's my last
day.''

EDITORIAL: KOSOVO'S INCOMPLETE PEACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, July 27:
</P>
<P>
   The ambush murder of 14 Serbian farmers in the Kosovo village of
Gracko last week is a grim sign that six and a half weeks after the
first NATO soldiers began entering the province, basic security has
not yet been established. With the international peacekeeping force
now nearing full strength, NATO's first order of business must be
creating a climate of civil peace.
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy. Serbia's stranglehold has ended, leaving
the province without police or civil administration. The temporary
U.N. trusteeship that will replace Serbian rule, including more
than 3,000 armed international police, is just gearing up. For now
that leaves NATO's 35,000 troops in charge of everything from
controlling road traffic to protecting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is most intense among Kosovo's Serbs. Close to half of the
200,000 Serbs present at the end of the war have now fled to
Serbia. But armed thugs have been attacking Kosovo's Albanians and
Gypsies as well. Some of the violence may be coming from rogue
elements of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Top KLA leaders, who have
pledged to cooperate with NATO, now have a responsibility to try to
curb any members carrying out such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 murders have been reported in Kosovo during the last
six weeks, and the number of ethnic Albanian victims nearly equals
the number of Serbian ones. Scores of Gypsies also have been killed
and hundreds burned out of their homes in apparent retaliation for
Gypsy collaboration in the mass expulsion of ethnic Albanians last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The international community cannot tolerate such violence. While
murder, arson and looting have been declining since early July, all
are still unacceptably high. NATO forces must move more
aggressively to protect Serbs and Gypsies as well as ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The man in charge of the U.N. effort, Bernard Kouchner, arrived
in Kosovo less than two weeks ago. He must now quickly build up the
new international police force, establish emergency courts and help
returning refugees rebuild before the onset of another winter, just
three months away. More than 700,000 Kosovar Albanians have come
back since June, many to find their homes reduced to ruins.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the United Nations's role will be crucial. Its
job is not just to provide temporary civil administration but also
to help the people of Kosovo build the impartial and accountable
governmental and law enforcement institutions they were denied
under Serbian rule. But this job of civic reconstruction cannot
really begin until NATO establishes a more satisfactory peace. &QL;

RAUL MANGLAPUS, 80, DIES; POWER IN POST-MARCOS ERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Raul S. Manglapus, the former Philippine
foreign secretary who embodied his country's mixture of defiance
and love for the United States, died on Sunday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   A former World War II guerrilla, Manglapus was both a senator
and foreign secretary before and after the 20-year rule of
President Ferdinand E. Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   From Marcos' declaration of martial law in 1972 until his ouster
in 1986, Manglapus was a political exile in the United States,
where he organized overseas opposition to Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   After his return, Manglapus, with his crew cut, American
education and American slang, coined the catch phrase of the final
chapter in his country's ``special relationship'' with its former
colonial master, before it evicted American military bases in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must slay the American father image,'' Manglapus said,
``and cut him down to brotherly size.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that occurred, he said, the Philippines could not be truly
mature and independent of the nation that had ruled it, with a
mixture of benevolence and exploitation, from 1898 to 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain amount of thinking that if all goes wrong
we can go running to Uncle Sam to fix it, and this is something
that is not useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those words, as foreign secretary under President
Corazon C. Aquino he reached an agreement with Washington to extend
the lease on the bases. But the Philippine Senate rejected the
pact, and the bases closed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, America's ``father image'' in the Philippines has
indeed faded. Externally, Manila has begun to strengthen ties with
its regional neighbors, moving away from its single-minded focus on
the United States. At home it has worked to build a more
independent national identity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Philippines is still the largest source of legal
immigrants to the United States, and the waiting list for some visa
categories is years long.
</P>
<P>
   Manglapus expressed those mixed feelings about the United States
when he returned from exile on Feb. 28, 1986, two days after Marcos
had been forced to flee to Hawaii by Mrs. Aquino's ``people power''
uprising. He noted that the United States had been instrumental in
giving one last ``shove'' to Marcos, but that for the previous 20
years it had supported his repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I suppose we should thank them,'' Manglapus said, ``we
could also ask, `What took so long?'''
</P>
<P>
   Manglapus' family said he would be cremated on Saturday.
Surviving are his wife, Pacita La'O, and five children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a politician, Manglapus was a writer, a
playwright, a linguist and a musician, playing piano and drums.
</P>
<P>
   As a prisoner of the Japanese in World War II, he wrote songs to
cheer up his fellow inmates. In recent years, he led a jazz band
called the Executive Combo that jammed with President Clinton, on
saxophone, at a summit meeting in 1996 in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   While doing postgraduate work at Harvard and Cornell, he decided
to write his thesis, about the American role in the Philippines, in
the form of a musical comedy, ``Manifest Destiny: An Evening of
Yanky Panky.''
</P>
<P>
   In 16 songs, Manglapus roasted the United States for its
swagger, condescension and bullying in the Philippines. But as his
political opponents pointed out gleefully, its music was American
in style, rather than indigenous, and its lyrics were not in
Filipino, but in English.

FOR THEATER, NOT THEATRICS  
 DESIGNED IN THE BACK ROOM, SOLD OUT FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many of the haute couture styles shown last week in
Paris were extravagant enough to be termed theatrical, which is
funny considering that there's nothing theatrical about the styles
in an exhibition of clothes designed for the theater in the first
half of the 20th century. Most could have stepped off the stage and
into the audience without looking at all out of place _ unlike,
say, John Galliano's black leather number with a chain-link tunic
for Dior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion on Stage: Couture for the Broadway Theater,
1910-1955'' opened over the weekend at the Museum of the City of
New York, Fifth Avenue at 104th Street. It includes work by such
illustrious designers as Coco Chanel, Mainbocher, Valentina and
Mariano Fortuny, worn by stage legends like Katharine Cornell,
Ethel Barrymore, Billie Burke, Lillian Gish, Judy Holliday and
Gertrude Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were street wear worn onstage, not theatrical costumes,
so they haven't been on exhibition before, though they've been with
us for decades,'' said Phyllis Magidson, the museum's curator of
costumes and textiles. ``The exhibition illustrates the selling
power of the stars of those days. Many of them were considered the
best-dressed women in the world. They were photographed in the
clothes and influenced the way women dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25 outfits include two Chanels: a knitted day suit in brown
and beige (1929) with her typical open-front jacket and pleated
skirt, and a bare-top, all-over-beaded evening dress worn by Ina
Claire in ``The Royal Family of Broadway'' (1931) that any actress
would covet for an awards ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also includes sketches, photographs and
memorabilia, including two honey brown curls snipped from Irene
Castle's hair when she bobbed it in 1914 and started a craze for
short hair.
</P>
<P>
   From the Back Room
</P>
<P>
   What's a young designer to do when store buyers like her clothes
but don't know where to put them? Open her own store, of course.
The latest example is Fiona Walker, who showed her fall collection
in April with the South of Seventh contingent and was told by
buyers that her clothes were too expensive for their young-designer
areas. So she opened a shop on Friday in the front of her
workrooms, at 451 W. 46th St.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, Hell's Kitchen, is a bit off the boutique
trail, but Ms. Walker lives two blocks away with her husband, Mark
Dieffenbacher, an architect, who designed the new shop with one
wall of hot pink and one of bare brick. An iron chandelier on the
ceiling and a flowered rug on the floor give it a homey look.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our neighborhood,'' Ms. Walker said, as her husband
walked by with a ladder. ``And it's down the street from Restaurant
Row. We hope that people walking by on their way to the theater
will stop in.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do, they will find some unusual designs, especially the
fall knitwear, which includes a handmade yarn-fringed tube top in
shades of gray ($350); a tweedy pullover with a kitten-ear hood in
gray or russet ($450); an ombre turtleneck with yarn-fringed hem
and cuffs in gray, plum or russet ($650), and a hand-knit
popcorn-stitched turtleneck ($650).
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up knitting in Ireland and studied textiles and fabric
there,'' said Ms. Walker, who moved to New York 10 years ago and
studied at the Parsons School of Design. ``The sweaters are being
knitted in New York now, but I hope to have them made in Ireland
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been doing some special orders, too, and will continue
to take orders for some pieces, like flocked chiffon or tulle
dresses and laser-cut Ultrasuede skirts that can be made with
different-colored linings.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most summer clothes have been marked down, but a new
shipment of swimsuits, labeled Preview 2000, is in stores now, just
in time for August vacations. The newest styles are in two tones or
in solid colors with contrasting-color trimming. The favored style
is the bikini.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein has a black bikini with white piping ($76) and a
tankini in black with white, in turquoise with blue piping and in
deep berry with red trimming ($90) at Bergdorf Goodman. La Perla
Sport's red bikini with a molded bra trimmed in white ($148) and
Eres' black bikini with a color-blocked bra ($270) can also be
found at Bergdorf's, along with Missoni's zigzag pattern in shades
of pink and red with white ($235).
</P>
<P>
   The bikinis at Barneys New York include Blau Mar's two-tone
suits with orange bras and yellow bottoms or turquoise bras and
teal bottoms ($128), 1ere de Verseau's garnet with red trimming
($155), TNA by Lisa L.'s navy with lilac ($123) and Letarte's lime
and white check with white straps ($98).

RUSH IS ON IN EUROPE FOR WIRELESS DATA SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ After 24 years as lead singer for the
Leningrad Cowboys, Finland's most popular home-grown rock band,
Mato Valtonen figured it was time for something new.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing that Finnish teenagers were perpetually tapping out
messages on their cellular phones, Valtonen set up a business last
year that transmits jokes and horoscopes for about 30 cents apiece.
He was soon drawing thousands of requests a day so he added a
half-dozen other quirky services, including a dictionary that
translates words into 10 different languages and wireless chat
rooms that attracted about 7,000 visitors on a recent Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, he plans to start what amounts to a
wireless Internet site, using a new class of phones that have
highly simplified Web browsers. Based on a slimmed-down, text-only
Web format, the site will offer bus schedules, restaurant listings,
stores and games. If all goes as he hopes, people will eventually
make restaurant reservations and hair appointments _ and pay his
company, Wapit Ltd., a few pennies every time they do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think up ideas and see whether they catch on,''
Valtonen said. ``But I'm convinced that companies will see this as
an important opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Improbable as it may seem, Valtonen is part of a very serious
rush across Europe into wireless data services that is keeping the
Continent, along with Japan, well ahead of the slower-moving United
States. Teenagers in Italy already use their cell phones to tap out
millions of short messages every day. Germany's top-selling
tabloid, Bild, offers scores of news and sports bulletins through
short messages. Here in Finland, it is possible to tap out an order
for a taxi or a take-out pizza.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the impending start of wireless Web transmission,
European cellular carriers are gearing up for a huge increase in
the speed and ease of transmitting wireless data. As a result, the
gap could widen further.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, history may be repeating itself. In the early 1990s,
European wireless companies jumped ahead of their American
counterparts by adopting a single technical standard for digital
cellular. As a result, digital phones with built-in paging and
message functions arrived years earlier in Europe than in the
United States. They also worked anywhere in Europe, long before
American phones worked throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe has always been about one or two years ahead of the
United States in wireless technology, and they still are,'' said
Herschel Shostek, an industry analyst in Wheaton, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, cellular phone carriers from Scandinavia
through Germany and down to Italy plan to start the text-only
wireless Web sites for mobile phones. And next year, most European
carriers plan to offer a technology called general packet radio
service, or GPRS, which will allow people with newly equipped
wireless phones to transmit data fast enough to browse the Internet
in full color.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond offering speed, the new service is designed to let
customers stay connected all day long. Many companies plan to
charge only for the data customers send or receive instead of for
each minute they are connected.
</P>
<P>
   European governments are also setting the stage for even faster,
``third generation'' wireless networks. Most plan to hand out or
auction off new radio licenses for so-called wideband networks that
will be able to carry videoconferences.
</P>
<P>
   Finland, where wireless phones now outnumber traditional ones,
has already issued its new licenses; Germany, Britain and other
European countries plan to do so next year.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is quite sure what kinds of features customers
will actually want.
</P>
<P>
   And the third-generation systems will not be ready in Europe for
at least two years, slightly behind Japan's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. carriers are pushing wireless data as well. But Americans,
who first got digital phones only a few years ago, have barely
begun to use them for two-way data transfer and messaging.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the absence of a common standard delayed the ability of
Americans to use their phones anywhere in the country, it is
slowing down the rollout of more-advanced services. AT&AMP;T and other
wireless carriers are pushing a third-generation technology called
EDGE. Other big players, including Sprint and Bell Atlantic, are
pushing a rival approach called wideband CDMA, or code division
multiple access.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting standards ``have slowed things down
considerably,'' said Mark Lowenstein, an analyst at the Yankee
Group, a research firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the technology is coming out of Silicon Valley, but
in terms of actually using it, the early adopters are in Europe,''
Lowenstein said. ``They have a much bigger base of digital users,
they have one harmonious technology and particular countries are
doing more to market new services.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States also faces a more difficult chore in getting
from here to there. The American carriers do not have a middle-term
technology comparable to GPRS in Europe, and the third-generation
services are not expected to reach the market for a few years.
Moreover, the Federal Communications Commission is insisting that
carriers use existing radio frequencies, which are likely to become
overloaded if customers transmit video and graphics on top of voice
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, much of the inspiration for new wireless data
services comes straight from the United States. Yahoo Inc. is
setting up wireless Internet gateways in Germany. Phone.com, a
small California company, developed the simplified browsers and
servers _ known as wireless access protocol, or WAP _ that European
wireless carriers are now embracing. Meanwhile, the Microsoft Corp.
is locked in a fierce competition with a European consortium called
Symbian over establishing a global standard for personal digital
assistants _ hand-held devices _ that would use these wireless
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big cell phone manufacturers are rolling out
Web-ready phones designed for GSM, or global system for mobile
communication, the dominant second-generation wireless standard in
Europe. Nokia of Finland, which will probably be first to the
market, plans to start selling its version in August. The Nokia
phone is about the same size as an ordinary cell phone. It offers
no graphics or pictures, but it has a small screen to display text.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Mannesmann AG, the country's largest mobile phone
operator, has signed contracts with the main television networks to
deliver news, sports and weather over a wireless network.
Handelsblatt, Germany's biggest financial newspaper, will provide
business news and stock-market information. Customers will also be
able to reserve airline tickets with Lufthansa and train seats with
Deutsche Bahn, the national railway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not interested in niche markets,'' said Dirk
Wierzbitzki, director of product marketing at Mannesmann's mobile
telephone unit in Dusseldorf. ``We see this as a mass-market
business.''
</P>
<P>
   An exuberant talker who sprinkles his sentences with American
phrases like ``killer app'' and ``Internet value chain,''
Wierzbitzki has reason to be bullish. Mannesmann customers already
tap out 100 million messages a month, and the volume is climbing 20
percent a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is definitely ahead'' in the use of cell phones as an
interactive device, said Fabiola Arredondo, managing director for
Yahoo Europe, which recently teamed up with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   For Wierzbitzki, the next big shift will come with the start of
GPRS next year.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which will require new handsets, has a theoretical
top speed of about 114,000 bits of data per second. Since the
airwaves will inevitably be bogged down by congestion, the real
speeds may be significantly slower. Even so, they would be far
higher than those of Europe's current cell phones, which have a top
speed of 9,600 bits per second _ the top speed of most American
cell phones, too.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more important is the way it will work. The system
is designed to charge customers based on the amount of data
transmitted rather than by the minute. That can be a major change
from customers who can pay, say, $1 a minute during business hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always connected, always on line _ that's our vision,''
Wierzbitzki said. Though Mannesmann has not yet announced a pricing
plan, Wierzbitzki envisions deals along the lines of 10 megabytes
for about $10. For an ordinary consumer using the wireless Web
format, that would amount to almost unlimited browsing and e-mail
for a month.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the only point of these systems. The idea is
sell ``mobility services'' _ traffic and shopping information,
banking, full-time access to e-mail. ``You need to forget about
traditional Web surfing,'' said Ilkka Raiskinen, vice president for
business development at Nokia Mobile Phones. ``If you're walking
around Helsinki, you don't want to browse the Web. You want to know
where a restaurant is, where you can buy clothes and how do you get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann already has a separate subsidiary, Autocom, that
provides navigation aids through wireless networks. Executives are
now looking at services that would warn drivers about traffic jams
and recommend other routes, as well as automatic SOS buttons that
would call for help if an accident occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge pent-up demand for data over wireless phones,
but the barriers have always been reliability, speed and cost,''
said Anders Thulin, a consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Company in
Stockholm. ``All those barriers are reduced now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most enthusiastic wireless bulls caution that the third
generation networks to deliver all this stuff fast and efficiently
are still several years away. Though carriers have agreed on the
design of the system, the advanced technology is by no means ready
for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Raiskinen of Nokia predicted that at least 10 percent of
wireless phones will be Internet-ready by the end of next year. He
cautioned that speed itself will not usher in overnight change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success will be based more on content,'' he said. ``It's
not a revolution. This is very much about evolution.''

BANKERS TRUST IS ORDERED TO PAY $60 MILLION FINE TO GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bankers Trust Corp., which pleaded guilty earlier
this year to criminal charges that it had illegally diverted
unclaimed funds from its customers into the bank's accounts, was
sentenced Monday in federal District Court in Manhattan to pay a
$60 million fine to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing by Federal District Judge John G. Koeltl was in
keeping with the plea agreement the New York bank had entered in
March when it admitted that senior bank officers and employees had
illegally misappropriated about $19.1 million in unclaimed checks
and other credits. The bank had also agreed to pay a $3.5 million
fine to New York state banking regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, which was acquired in June by Deutsche Bank, has
returned about $17.85 million of the money to its customers, and
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will oversee the return of the
remaining funds. The sentencing was announced by Mary Jo White, the
U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the remedial measures taken by Bankers Trust
prior to the acquisition, combined with Deutsche Bank's culture and
controls, assure that the conduct which was the subject of the
proceeding will not occur again,'' said the bank in a prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, three former executives at Bankers Trust
were indicted on federal criminal charges involving the diversion
of unclaimed customer money. Prosecutors say that these individuals
regularly used the unclaimed funds to meet forecasted revenue and
profit levels. All three are contesting the charges, and the case
is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Banks typically have control over unclaimed money when customers
do not cash checks for payment of dividends, interest or principal
on securities or do not collect distributions from benefit and
pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   An internal investigation by Bankers Trust' accountants
identified about $55.1 million in irregular transactions, $19.1
million of which the bank illegally recorded as income and
reserves, according to federal prosecutors. To date, about $45.1
million has been returned, and the Fed- eral Reserve is overseeing
the return of the rest. &QL;

WOODSTOCK ON TV: THE BARE MAXIMUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technically speaking, Woodstock '99 came to you from an old Air
Force base in Rome, N.Y. For all intents and purposes, however _ at
least for the millions tuned into the three-day, 65-hour
pay-per-view _ it had the look of a biker rally in Laconia, N.H.
(Well, except for the Harleys.)
</P>
<P>
   Had Beavis and Butt-head been watching, they would have been in
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sprawling, multiband rock 'n' roll event with the
bands at center stage, but the audience was very much part of the
telecast, with a lot of that audience sporting skimpy variations of
their birthday suits. You might think of the music _ by Metallica,
Red Hot Chili Peppers, DMX, Alanis Morissette, and others _ as the
main dish, but the hors d'oeuvres and dessert were the myriad of
partially or totally naked bodies strutting about for the benefit
of fellow members of Woodstock nation and, one surmises, the
titillation of Woodstock Couch Potato nation, which got to look at
more flesh than you would during a daylong loop of ``Porky's.'' It
was a voyeur's delight . . . and, perhaps, a parent's nightmare.
(We heard stories of parents hastily ushering the littler ones out
of the room; then, again this $60 three-day event was advertised as
uncensored.)
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the exposure was provided by women, though
more than a few men bared all as they paraded past cameras. Never
one to be outdone, Red Hot Chili Pepper bassist Flea spent his
entire time on stage in the altogether. Sheryl Crow resisted the
crowd's urging that she shed her top, saying, ``You'd have to pay
way more than you paid to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, there is abundance of things, sometimes there is a
lack,'' noted Dave Matthews, sagely from the stage. ``Today,
there's an abundance'' of breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the women in the crowd were perched on men's shoulders;
others showed their stuff on small, makeshift stages, dropping
thongs as well, behaving like exotic dancers. Sexuality is
certainly a large and welcome part of rock 'n' roll culture, but
some of this seemed gratuitous exhibitionism, with the
Woodstockians and the cameras mutually cozying up to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Did the folks flash because the cameras were there or did they
flash because, ``it's Woodstock, man, it's tradition''
</P>
<P>
   There were 33 cameras, five directors, and 65 hours of
transmission produced by Jeff Rowland for Metropolitan
Entertainment Group, a company owned by the concert promoter. ``My
instructions were consistent and simple,'' said Rowland, Monday.
``I wanted to capture every aspect both good and bad. This is the
main record. I expected a lot of mud and exposed flesh, and I
actually felt there was so much (nudity) it was unavoidable. It was
nothing we were tyring to add. I'm still amazed at that. But in
this media age, it's a way of assuring you get the camera to focus
on you. Why you crave it so much, that's for the sociologists. But
(the nudity) was ubiquitous and pervasive. One of the things that
makes Woodstock attractive is the sense of freedom and anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   He says there was much X-rated material they didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   We logged more than 30 hours watching this TV rock 'n'
roll/strip show, and many acts extolled baring the flesh, including
Jamiroquai, Wyclef Jean, and Sheryl Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Voice of reason: Offspring's Dexter Holland who said bare
breasts didn't ``give you the right to molest them.'' Wit,
subtlety, songcraft . . . nah, not much. Maybe a bit from the
misplaced Elvis Costello (acoustic guitar and piano did not make a

brought a strong voice to an event that mostly featured barkers.
Musically, the rap/funk/metal brood (Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Korn,
Rage Against the Machine, Insane Clown Posse) went up against the
hippie noodling collective (Dave Matthews Band, Guster, Rusted
Root, Counting Crows, moe., the Roots) with just a few acts
(Morissette, Offspring, Chemical Brothers) not in either camp. The
ruling band? Metallica, which started with the perfect anti-peace
and love anthem by Anti-Nowhere League.

   ``Woodstock '99'' was beamed across the world, to Europe,
Australia, Latin America. A spokesman said final figures on how
many TV viewers signed up weren't yet available.

<P>
   As to the headline-making bonfires and destruction at the close
of the event Sunday night? The pay-per-view showed bonfires, but
they looked relatively benign. Then they cut from live coverage
into repeats of earlier performances. The destruction happened soon
after. A spokeswoman for PK Network Communications, the
pay-per-view publicists, said they did not cut away because of any
fear of what people might see. ``We had a scheduled amount of time
that was live,'' she said.

NEW RED SOX ACQUISITION HUSKEY BIG AT BAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Make way for Butch Huskey. He's big. He's strong. He
swings a mean bat and if the Red Sox had acquired him during the
winter meetings in Nashville, there would have been a lot fewer
complaints about the loss of Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette finally got around to
correcting that flaw in his offseason bartering Monday, acquiring
the 6-foot-3-inch, 244-pounder from the Seattle Mariners for minor
league prospect Robert Ramsay, a lefthander who was 6-6 with a 5.35
earned run average in 20 games for Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey is no prospect. The Sox consider him a professional
hitter with power to all fields. Duquette thought that when he was
working for the Montreal Expos and scouted Huskey as a minor
leaguer in the New York Mets organization. Duquette said that since
1994, he has closely watched Huskey in hopes of bringing him to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets turned down Duquette in December. Then they moved him
to Seattle Dec. 14 in a trade for righthander Lesli Brea. The Sox
contacted the Mariners and were told the same things: No deal.
Seattle wouldn't move Huskey this spring, even though all three
outfield positions were filled.
</P>
<P>
   But things began to change when Seattle began dropping in the
standings, chiefly because of pitching. Trailing by 11 games in the
American League West, the Mariners finally pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a team point of view, we don't like to trade young
lefthanded pitchers who are close to the major leagues,'' said
Duquette. ``But we have a need for another professional hitter, and
that's what we're getting in Butch Huskey. We made this trade on
the merits. It gives us an additional righthanded hitter who has
good experience and good power. The trade was not made to make any
other trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's versatile and can play a number of positions. This is a
good addition for this year and the years to come. He's made good
strides as an RBI man and should be an asset to the team. He can
play first base, left field, right field, and designated hitter. He
came up as a third baseman with the Mets. He's worked very hard to
make himself an effective major leaguer at each of those positions.
I think he will be an effective RBI man in our lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners vice president of baseball operations Woody Woodward
was equally enthusiastic about the addition of Ramsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Brian Hunter returning from the disabled list (today) we
were heavy on outfielders,'' Woodward said. ``Huskey did a good job
for us while (Jay) Buhner was out, but our outfield is Hunter, Ken
Griffey Jr., and Buhner. This move makes room for Hunter on the
roster and allows us to add a quality young lefthander to our
system. We believe Ramsay could be ready to contribute to our big
league club as early as next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have contractual control of Huskey, 27, for the next
two years. He started the year with 3 years 71 days of service.
Huskey had a ..264 average and 55 home runs and 214 RBIs in five
seasons with the Mets. New York loved his offense but worried about
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had better success using him all over the place.
Huskey is hitting .290 with 15 home runs and 49 RBIs this season,
and is batting .383 (23 for 60) with a .683 slugging percentage
against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get traded, it obviously means someone wants you
to play for their team,'' said Huskey. ``I was a little shocked
because Seattle had traded for me over the winter. But it became a
little crowded in the outfield and my time started to diminish.
I've happy going to a team that wants me to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenway is going to be an exciting place to play. I've enjoyed
it the last few years I've been coming there. Now, I can make it my
home park. I'm going to come there and do pretty much what I was
doing in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey said he has no idea where he will play. He plans to talk
it over with manager Jimy Williams Tuesday when he joins the team
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, like any other athlete, I'd like to be in there
every day,'' said Huskey. ``But there are certain situations that
dictate what you can do. I'm all for the team and if that means
playing every day, I'm all for that. If I have to sit and come in
late innings or DH, I'm all for that also. It's not about me being
the best. It's about what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said the Red Sox may not be through trading. The
deadline is Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to explore other trade opportunities to address some
other needs,'' he said. ``We'd like to get our team stabilized and
playing winning baseball again. Our pitching is still the strength
of the team. I'm hopeful we will return Pedro Martinez to the team
next week. I'm encouraged that Juan Pena pitched a good game at
Triple A and he will be able to return. We'll see how that
develops. No one move takes care of all the team needs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Huskey has no problem playing several positions, he does
have one regarding his uniform number. As a Met and Mariner, he
wore No. 42. Like Vaughn, he was among a handful of players who
were authorized to wear it despite the fact that Major League
Baseball has officially ``retired'' the number in honor of Jackie
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it all day since I heard I got traded,''
said Huskey. ``It's something I have to figure out. I really want
to wear the number. But Mo Vaughn was here and Jackie Robinson wore
it. It may be that I will have to get my own identity. So I may not
wear it. I'm glad to be playing baseball. I love the game. Boston
has a great tradition.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIP COVE, Newfoundland _ The thought of escaping this sweet and
miserable land has long tempted Stan Tobin. Once or twice over the
years he has even slipped off to Ireland _ where his brogue makes
him sound home-grown _ with no intention of coming back.
</P>
<P>
   But the hardy ground in Ship Cove _ population six when his
whole family is here _ will not let him go. Tobins have lived here
since the start of the last century and now the land's gotten to
him too, he says, and made him sort of crazy.
</P>
<P>
   He raises calves and sells them, and he and his wife, Dolores,
run a creamery. But his real passion these days is the squat
building on the edge of one of his fields where he and other
volunteers wash and clean sea birds that have been contaminated by
oil. It is one of the only animal rehabilitation centers in
Atlantic Canada, and when birds start to come ashore, Tobin and
other volunteers clean them and nurse them back to health.
</P>
<P>
   These volunteers know their limitations, especially when it
comes to what the Canadian Coast Guard calls mystery spills that
occur more than 100 miles offshore when a commercial ship empties
its oily bilge water, in violation of regulations requiring that it
be treated and disposed of onshore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the carcasses of the oiled birds wash out to sea or
sink. A small number _ government researchers estimate it at
one-tenth or fewer of the total number of sea birds contaminated by
oil _ wash to shore and they are usually the first clues that there
has been a spill.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100,000 puffins, murres and other sea birds will die
in the icy waters off Newfoundland this year after landing in oil
from ``mystery spills.'' That will equal about 40 percent of the
250,000 birds that died in the Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska a
decade ago, but the kill will attract little attention here because
as many birds have died just about every year for the last few
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin says that as little as half a teaspoon of oil can kill a
bird. Feathers absorb the oil and then cannot keep out the cold
ocean water. Even a tiny spot can be fatal, like a small tear in a
diver's wet suit. The birds get cold, develop hypothermia and
eventually become too weak to find food or fly away.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal and provincial authorities have known for years that
some maritime crews try to skirt regulations and cut costs by
emptying their bilges offshore, where no one sees them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a polluter is caught in the act, as happened last
year when a ship bound for England was fined $25,000 (U.S.) after
being spotted dragging a sheen of oil five miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Coast Guard now runs aerial surveillance flights
looking for spills. But they must cover an enormous area, and many
spills can never be traced. Even when the polluters are found and
prosecuted, officials say, the fines imposed are too low to provide
real deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the courts,'' said Brian Tobin, premier of the
province of Newfoundland and Labrador and a former federal
fisheries minister but no direct relation to Stan Tobin. ``The
fines that are imposed are laughable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canada Shipping Act, which regulates commercial shipping, is
now under review and amendments have been offered to increase fines
and make them mandatory in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the founders of the Newfoundland and Labrador
Environmental Association, Stan Tobin has done all he could to help
wildlife _ everything from keeping oiled sea birds in his bathtub
while they recover to serving on several commissions that have
documented the effect of ``mystery spills.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 50, Tobin, a former fisherman and, he confesses, former bird
poacher as well, said authorities that are supposed to be
protecting the province's environment have shown they are willing
to gloss over environmental issues to keep from antagonizing
businesses that provide jobs. Unemployment in Newfoundland hovers
around 17 percent, more than twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Terry Harvey, director of the Canadian Coast Guard's Prevention
of Oiled Wildlife Project, also believes that the province caters
to commercial interests without fully assessing the effect of such
decisions on natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The province has been crying out for industrial development
for some time, and that probably has driven us to make radical and
uninformed decisions,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, Newfoundland's premier, said the province has proved it
will reject projects that harm the environment, like a proposal to
reopen an asbestos mine, even though they mean jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the environment,'' he said, ``perhaps
like no one else on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the province's economy was linked to the bounty
of the North Atlantic, in particular the Grand Banks fishing
grounds. But earlier this decade the cod seemed to disappear and
the Canadian government closed the commercial cod fishery, throwing
thousands of Newfoundland fishermen out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Projects, like the Hibernia offshore oil platform, bring
thousands of new jobs. A joint venture of several oil companies,
including Mobil and Petro-Canada, Hibernia received financial
support from the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   Hibernia officials reported 21 small spills last year that
dumped a total of about 600 gallons of oil into the ocean, not much
against more than 130,000 barrels of oil the platform pumps up
every day.
</P>
<P>
   But, experts say, it does not take much oil to kill a sea bird.
</P>
<P>
   Hibernia received no fines for any incident. Harvey of the Coast
Guard says he believes that there were many other unreported
spills.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its environmental impact statement, Hibernia said the
possibility of spills occurring was nearly nil,'' he said. ``Yet we
have oil in the water almost every week. ``
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Zapatka, environmental and safety manager for
Hibernia, said the company strictly follows all environmental
guidelines. ``We've never seen any wildlife damaged or impacted,''
near the platform, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say sea birds are loath to come to land, and only
something as awful as being coated with oil will bring them to
shore. The irony isn't wasted on Stan Tobin, who is loath to leave
this land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put my finger on it, exactly,'' he said, watching
waves break on the gravelly beach of Ship Cove. ``You develop this
great attachment for the land. A guy could almost die for it.''

FATAL HEART ATTACK ENDS WOODSTOCK DREAM COME TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ AND S.I. ROSENBAUM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. _ Thirty years after witnessing Jimi Hendrix's
wailing guitar solo of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' at the original
Woodstock, Scott L. Stanley really wanted to share the vibe and
experience of the festival's reprise with his teenage foster son.
</P>
<P>
   He was so overcome with the generational bridge when he reached
Woodstock '99 Friday in Rome, N.Y., viewing the massive stage and
swaying masses of all ages, he broke down and cried at a dream
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in tears, he was so happy to be where he was,'' said
Tim Roy, Stanley's 16-year-old foster son. ``He said he remembered
waking up to Hendrix playing the national anthem at the first one.
He had hitched 6 miles to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   But within a day, Stanley, 44, had become the festival's only
casualty, dead of an apparent heart attack 11 days after undergoing
angioplasty surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He died Saturday morning before the weekend of peace, love, and
rock 'n' roll degenerated into riot. Roy said that authorities
asked him if Stanley had been doing drugs before his collapse; the
foster son said he answered quickly: No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott didn't believe in pot or alcohol and he definitely
didn't believe in anything else worse than that, like acid,''
Joshua, a friend of Stanley's who once lived in his house, said
Monday. He declined to give his last name.
</P>
<P>
   While it was not clear whether Stanley left behind immediate
family members, the death of the Cape Cod job counselor was an
emotional blow to those who considered him closer than blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only guy I could ever talk to about anything,'' Roy
said. ``He was my best friend. Any time I had any type of problem,
he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and co-workers gathered at Stanley's home in Hyannis
Monday, remembering the man who ``made his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it was with Scott. He treated us like family,''
said Joshua, who said he moved in with Stanley a few years ago to
stop drinking. He left recently, sober, moving into a home with his
new bride.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had big holes in your ears or blue hair, Scott would
see the person inside,'' said Joshua, who sports arrow-like chest
piercings and large metal earrings. ``He would take you for who you
really are.''
</P>
<P>
   While some may question Stanley's choice to attend the mammoth
concert _ braving 250,000 fans and oppressive 90-degree weather
fewer than two weeks after being hospitalized, friends and
co-workers said that resolve was simply part of his nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had (heart) problems, but they weren't supposed to be a big
deal,'' said Roy, who had been living with Stanley for more than
three years. ``He was also taking care of himself, drinking lots of
fluids. He had all of his medications in a little box marked in
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley had come a long way since thumbing a ride to Woodstock
'69 as a 14-year-old, friends said. For years he had been taking in
roommates, offering shelter to foster youths and troubled friends.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago he offered a permanent bed to a middle-aged man
with mental disabilities, said Stanley's boss, Jeffrey McCarthy,
associate executive director of Nauset Inc. in Hyannis. The
nonprofit group provides vocational and residential services to
developmentally disabled adults across the Cape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a great guy. Always ready, willing, and able to
assist,'' McCarthy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley started out at Nauset two years ago as a maintenance
worker, McCarthy said, but quickly advanced, being promoted to a
job where he could work directly with the group's clients. As a job
coach, he helped clients negotiate the working world, training them
on some occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very capable guy. He could do just about anything,
from plumbing to electricity to working on computers,'' McCarthy
said. ``He was always upbeat, a person who's very patient, always
willing to troubleshoot what seemed to be a difficult situation.
Scott always had a solution. He said, `I can do that, I can do
this,' and he did. He was an amazing guy.''

MARKET PLACE: INVESTORS RE-EVALUATE POSITIONS TO AVOID Y2K
GLITCHES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Treasury bill that matures the first week of
January fetched significantly more than one that matures just a
week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of the anomalies popping up in financial
markets as fears take hold about potential problems when computers
turn over their internal dates to the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of these signals, money managers, underwriters,
strategists and analysts are re-evaluating their positions and
trying to anticipate how investors and others will react to the
possibility of computer glitches at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a made-for-TV disaster with a meteorite hitting the
U.S.,'' said Neil M. Soss, the chief U.S. economist at Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``But it is big.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, investing is all about the trade-off between reward
and risk.
</P>
<P>
   And investors have determined that it is worth paying a little
more to avoid Year 2000 risk. In the first week of July, the
government auctioned the first six-month Treasury bills that will
mature in the new millennium. Investors paid considerably more for
them than for comparable bills that will mature at the end of 1999.
So the government was able to issue the new bills at a 4.58 percent
rate (the yield moves in the opposite direction of the price), down
a third of a percentage point from the rate at auction a week
earlier on six-month bills that mature Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable, the newer six-month bills carried the same rate
as simultaneously issued three-month bills, though people
customarily expect a higher return for locking up their money
longer. The reason: many investors apparently do not want to be
cashed out of investments in the final days of the year because
they might have very few options.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipated events are often priced into the market before the
events themselves occur. But the long lead-up and the uncertainty
about the impact of Year 2000 has made specific dislocations nearly
impossible to predict.
</P>
<P>
   The core concern is that investors worried about computer
disruptions everywhere from banks to pharmacies will look for the
safest place for their money: the Treasury market. If this flight
to safety happens, what Wall Streeters call liquidity, a measure of
how easy it is to trade large amounts of securities without
distorted price moves, will disappear in much of the rest of the
fixed-income market. That happened last fall in the midst of the
global financial crisis. Losses mounted for owners of many
securities that are considered more risky than Treasuries, and
trading these securities all but ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture are the contradictory needs of various
investors, companies and money managers. Some need to have cash on
hand near the end of the year, while others do not want to be
caught with cash to invest in an uncertain climate. Still others
have to get loans that carry their businesses over the turn of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one knows what the market environment will be like in
November and December, many decisions about buying and selling that
would otherwise be made at the end of the year are being moved into
the third quarter, just to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that issue commercial paper, asset-backed securities
and bonds want to sell early to be sure they find buyers. As much
as $20 billion could be added to the normal sales of asset-backed
securities in the third quarter, predicts Paul Jablansky, head of
research in this sector at Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of
Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond Market Association, which represents the fixed-income
industry, has advised its members to curtail the issuance of
short-term debt securities that mature at the end of December and
the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
   So money managers are buying early to make sure they get enough
to satisfy their needs. David Sylvester, who runs the Stagecoach
and Norwest Advantage money market funds for Wells Capital
Management, began planning for his year-end mix of securities and
cash in May, instead of October, when he normally would. He wants
to be sure that he can meet withdrawals if investors decide they
want extra dollars around the first of the year. He now has about 8
percent of his funds invested in commercial paper that will mature
and be ready cash in December and the first two weeks of January.
Normally, it would be just 1 percent to 2 percent of his
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually strong demand has sent up the price _ and
depressed the yield _ on commercial paper maturing early in 2000
compared with commercial paper maturing later in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the fixed-income market, analysts are trying to
anticipate which stocks could be vulnerable. Computer fears could
cause investors to sell smaller company stocks and move into the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks that are considered a better
haven, though there is no sign of such activity yet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, stock mutual funds are recalculating their exposure.
Money managers at T. Rowe Price are reviewing Year 2000 compliance
efforts of all the companies whose shares are held in their stock
mutual funds. So far, they have examined about 500 American
companies, said Steven Norwitz, a vice president. Of those, he said
15 to 20 had been ``flagged'' and put on a watch list because of
Year 2000 concerns. Of those, he said, ``a handful'' had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts suggest investors might shun some utility
stocks for fear that some companies will experience service
disruptions, cutting into profits. Kevin A. McCarthy of Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette expects a decline in spending on information
technology later this year will reduce earnings at personal
computer and hardware companies, pushing profits below consensus
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Year-end fears could also make it harder for investors to short,
or bet on declining prices of stocks or bonds. A short seller
borrows a stock or bond and sells it hoping to buy it back later a
lower price. If the price does fall, he returns the stock or bond
to the lender and pockets the difference between his selling price
and buying price as profit. Because detailed computer records are
needed for those transactions, the big lenders of securities might
curtail their business near the end of the year, some industry
analysts suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and money managers are expected to be especially wary
of securities so complex that much computer power is required to
create, price and trade them. This category includes many
derivatives, which are securities whose performance is based on the
performance of an underlying security, like a stock, bond or
currency. Also on the list are many mortgage-backed securities
(MBS), which are bundles of mortgages, and asset-backed securities
(ABS), which can be bundles of credit card or other loans, that are
packaged and sold to the investing public.
</P>
<P>
   In recommendations to market participants, the Bond Market
Association notes that Year 2000 issues are magnified in the
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities markets ``because of
the extent to which data processing and computer-to-computer system
communication is essential to effectuate securitization, trading,
confirmation and timely payment of principal and interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with complex securities, foreign securities could be a
target of fear. For even if computer problems at the turn of the
year proved to be minimal in the United States, the perception is
that they will be worse in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether there is a rational basis to it or not, no one will
want to hold big risk positions in emerging markets in the fourth
quarter,'' said Desmond Lachman, the director of emerging markets
research at Salomon Smith Barney. The question, he said, is whether
money managers will sell well before the fourth quarter in
anticipation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Making money on all these market swings ought to be easy if you
believe that the fears are exaggerated. Just buy mortgage-backed
securities when they are being shunned and profit when Year 2000
fears diminish and they rally.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hackel, head of mortgage-backed and asset-backed research at
Merrill Lynch, predicts that ``by the end of the third quarter and
early in the fourth quarter, people will realize this is a buying
opportunity.'' But, he said, ``the risk-taking mentality is pretty
subdued right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The options market, in which speculators can make big bets, is a
logical place for gambling. ``It is not easy to say that the option
market is looking for a tremendous event,'' said Eric Gould, the
over-the-counter Treasury options trader at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``But it is not easy to say it isn't. It will be easier to
say one way or the other on Dec. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Money managers also seem reluctant to take on risk. N. Graham
Allen, the managing director of global fixed-income at Wells
Capital Management, said he will probably not stray far from the
index that his performance is compared with. If something goes
wrong, his return will at least be no worse than his benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to limit the fallout from Year 2000 fears, Federal
regulators have advised institutions to be prepared to meet unusual
demands for cash near the end of the year. The Federal Reserve has
also set up a special unit to make loans to banks from Nov. 1
through April 7. The loans will help assure that banks have the
resources, the Fed said, ``to confidently commit to supplying loans
to other financial institutions and businesses through the rollover
to the new century.'' The Fed is also increasing its available
currency by $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists and analysts have said these initiatives have helped
calm market participants. But the unusual steps have also put more
pressure on the normal order and pace of financial practices at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Galvin, as the chief investment officer at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, says his approach is to get investors to look
beyond Jan. 1 into 2000. ``After it is over, despite the dawn of a
new millennium, our daily lives will be much the same and so will
investing principles,'' he wrote in a new Year 2000 analysis. ``We
can't view this as the end of the investment horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admits to having trouble winning this argument right now.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities
who has forecast that a recession will be triggered by Year 2000
behavior, said financial markets are prepared for a moderate year
2000 disruption, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even a plausible worst case scenario plays out, that is not
in the market,'' he said.

MARTIN AGRONSKY, LEADER OF EARLY NEWS-PANEL PROGRAM, DIES AT 84  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Agronsky, a veteran broadcast news correspondent who
worked for all three major networks and PBS, died on Sunday at his
home in Washington. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   Agronsky helped develop one of the first ``talking heads'' news
programs, featuring reporters talking among themselves rather than
interviewing news makers. The program, ``Agronsky &AMP; Company,''
nationally syndicated from 1969 to 1987, was consistently one of
the top-rated weekend news programs and frequently attracted
comments and complaints from presidents and other top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter or
their news secretaries often called Agronsky during the program.
</P>
<P>
   One notable exchange, Jonathan Agronsky said, took place during
the Iran hostage crisis. The commentator George Will, a guest on
the program, said that ``the Iranians want to go back to the Dark
Ages,'' adding, ``President Carter ought to help them by bombing
out all their hydroelectric facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter later called Agronsky from Camp David, asking him _ and
emphasizing with a four-letter word _ to tell Will that he would
bomb the Iranians into submission as soon as Will exchanged places
with the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Zama Agronsky was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 12, 1915,
the son of immigrants from Minsk, Russia. He graduated from Rutgers
University in 1936 and began his career as a reporter on The
Palestine Post, an English-language daily newspaper published in
Jerusalem and owned by his uncle. Shortly afterward, he started
freelance writing in Europe, covering the final days of the Spanish
Civil War for British and American newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Agronsky joined NBC as its Balkans correspondent,
reporting on the British army fighting the Wehrmacht in Libya.
</P>
<P>
   He rode along as Royal Air Force bombers flew missions over
Italy. In the Far East, he took the last plane out of Singapore
before the Japanese arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Agronsky joined ABC as its Washington correspondent, a
job he held until he rejoined NBC in 1957. In the early 1960s,
preparing to be the first news team to submerge in a Polaris
submarine, he and his camera crew had to make practice ascents in a
60-foot water tower in preparation for possible emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Agronsky worked for CBS from 1964, first in Washington and then
in Paris, until 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he won a George Foster Peabody Award for his radio
coverage of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. In 1961, he received the
Alfred I. duPont Award for his coverage of what he considered his
most important story, the trial in Jerusalem of the Nazi war
criminal Adolf Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
   Agronsky's first wife, the former Helen Smathers, died in 1969.
His second marriage, to Sharon Agronsky, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Jonathan, of Washington, he is survived
by his children from his first marriage, Marcia Agronsky of Fort
Worth, David Agronsky of Alexandria, Va., and Julie Romansky of
Lexington, Mass.; a daughter from his second marriage, Rachel
Agronsky of New York, and four grandchildren.

STUDY SHOWS A BIG ASTHMA RISK FOR CHILDREN IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS

 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first study of its kind of the nation's urban
asthma epidemic, researchers have found the rate of hospitalization
from the disease far greater among children in poor, predominantly
minority neighborhoods of New York City than experts suspected.
</P>
<P>
   A team at the Center for Children's Health and the Environment
at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine has determined that hospitalization
rates were as much as 21 times higher in poorer, minority areas
than in the hardest-hit areas of the more affluent communities.
High rates of hospitalization are one of the most accurate
indications of the widespread severity of the disease, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there were discrepancies, but we had no idea they were
that large,'' said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, director of the center
and a member of the research team. ``And I have to suspect that
other large urban areas where conditions are similar are going to
find similar kinds of patterns emerge as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors said the new study, based on a wide range of
demographic data supplied by the Census Bureau, provides strong
evidence of the degree to which economic and social factors
influence the way people are afflicted with the disease and at what
age.
</P>
<P>
   The Mt. Sinai study revealed stark differences in the rates
between the poor and the richer neighborhoods for all age groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhoods of lower East Harlem (in the 10029 ZIP
code, bordered by East 116th Street, East 96th, Fifth Avenue and
the East River), the rate of hospitalization was 222.28 per 10,000,
per year. In five high-income ZIP codes _ in the Wall Street and
Trinity sections of Manhattan, two in the Glen Oaks section of
eastern Queens and one in the Rockaways _ the rate was zero. That
is, no one was hospitalized over a period of one year.
</P>
<P>
   The average household income in south East Harlem was $18,732.
In the 11695 ZIP code in the Rockaways, where the hospitalization
rate was zero, the average household income was $103,125.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcomes in the poor Latino and African-American areas,
especially among children, are tragic,'' said Dr. Luz Claudio, an
assistant professor in the division of environmental and
occupational medicine and the division of neuropathology at Mt.
Sinai, and the principal author of the report. ``But the outcomes
in the richer neighborhoods presents strong illustration that, with
resources, the disease can be very well controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudio said that much more study is needed to establish a
definite causal link between asthma and many environmental factors.
But she said that work in various projects at the Center for
Children's Health seems to make it clear that poor housing in New
York often exposes residents to highly toxic pollutants that are
making the condition worse. Both indoor and outdoor pollutants,
like pesticides and auto emissions, are among the chief suspects,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the study, which appears in the current issue of
the Journal of Asthma, Dr. Jonathan Samet of the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health, a leading respiratory epidemiologist, said
the findings showed ``a striking range of rates.'' He said the
study should provide medical researchers with a ``tremendous
opportunity to further explore the causes of this disease and the
factors that exacerbate it to help us out of what has become a
pubic health-crisis emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of acute asthma attacks among children has
increased 100 percent in the past decade, despite the development
of medications that are highly effective if taken properly,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta. Asthma is now the most common cause of hospitalization
among American children, affecting 5 million of them. Deaths among
children with the condition rose by 78 percent from 1980 to 1993,
according to the CDC's latest analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC recently reported that the disease is most concentrated
in the heavily populated areas of the Northeast, in Chicago and
Denver and in Los Angeles and Oakland, but it did not break the
affected areas down by income, minority groups or age, as the Mt.
Sinai group did.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is a chronic disease that requires careful, long-term
treatment and close monitoring in the home. The authors of the Mt.
Sinai report cited previous studies suggesting why poor, black and
Latino children are suffering at such high rates. Poor people often
rely on care in emergency rooms, where doctors have little time to
educate families on how to control the disease, and where there is
little follow-up care, researchers have found. Studies also have
shown that substandard care is often given to members of minority
groups. Finally, several environmental factors found in poor areas,
like dirt and dust, the presence of roaches and some of the
pesticides used to kill them, have been found to worsen the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Without receiving adequate care and medication, the asthma
victims eventually begin suffering attacks that so restrict their
ability to breathe that they wind up needing immediate
hospitalization.

BID TO RESCUE CITY'S SCHOOL BUILDINGS WAS HARD-WIRED TO FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN, JACQUES STEINBERG and CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fire that was touched off by a welder working in a
Brooklyn vocational school briefly trapped 150 students last March.
The construction work was not supposed to begin until school was
done for the day, but school administrators and construction
officials could not agree on when classes were actually over.
</P>
<P>
   A new elementary school opened in upper Manhattan in 1995 with
problems ranging from loose floor tiles to a broken elevator. It
took three years to fix all the problems, while officials at the
New York City Board of Education and the School Construction
Authority argued about whose job it was to make the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the state Legislature created the construction
authority and joined it in a shotgun marriage with the city's
school board, the breakdown in their relationship has been a major
obstacle to reaching the goal that was set for them: mending and
expanding the nation's largest school system by century's end.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators were hoping to rescue a school system whose building
division was taking 10 years, and often a few bribes, to build a
single school, but in their haste to solve the problem they
effectively hard-wired the new arrangement for failure. They made
the board the client and the new authority its builder, but they
never specified where one agency's job ends and the other's begins.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as city and state officials are beginning to pour $7
billion into school construction and repairs over the next five
years, they have done little to fix the broken partnership. The
board is slow to plan, and the authority is lax in policing
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   An almost unfathomable amount of work must be done. An analysis
of the city's most recent school-by-school engineering survey by
The New York Times shows that at least 40 percent of the 1,100
schools are plagued by porous roofs, disintegrating facades or
windows that do not open or shut.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the board and the authority were overwhelmed by
the job of rebuilding a deteriorating system in which half the
school buildings were built before 1940.
</P>
<P>
   And the construction process became infected by the very
politics that had eaten at the schools for generations. The
construction apparatus is overseen by one appointee each of the
governor, the mayor and the city schools chancellor. Any top
official can take credit for successes, but no one is directly
responsible for failures.
</P>
<P>
   Since the construction budget ultimately has to be approved by
the mayor and the City Council, horse-trading is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report on the five-year plan that just expired included
hundreds of projects on 43 single-spaced pages _ many for critical
wall, window and roof work _ that had been promised, only to be
deferred. They were replaced by 35 pages of other projects, most
picked by the mayor and the Council.
</P>
<P>
   The changes make for dashed hopes at schools like John Bowne
High School in Queens. In the fall of 1997, the board informed
Bowne administrators that its laboratories would be renovated,
welcome news since three of its labs are 35 years old and the
fourth is a home economics classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But in March 1998, after the new labs were already designed, the
board suspended the project indefinitely, deciding instead to
repair the exteriors of other schools.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the project died matters little at a school where the
advanced placement environmental sciences class is held in an old
kitchen. There, 22 students share two sinks and cannot light Bunsen
burners on the counter tops for fear of setting the wooden cabinets
on fire. Instead, they hold the burners in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the authority and board are quick to point
out that whatever the shortcomings of the last decade, they have
produced classroom space for 115,000 students, 76,000 within the
last five years. Schools are now erected in as little as three
years, much quicker than the average of 10 years it took in the
1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet fewer than half of the new classroom seats, about 53,500,
are in new, permanent buildings. More than a third, about 42,000,
sit in leased commercial spaces, in makeshift classrooms
partitioned from existing classes and locker rooms, or in factories
and other buildings that the board now owns. The remainder, about
20,000, are in trailers and other portable buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A recent survey by the board found that almost a third of the
city's schools had their windows or roofs replaced, their exterior
masonry shored up or some combination over the last five years. But
that yearlong survey also found that one out of four city schools
had seriously deteriorated roofs or exterior walls, and two out of
five had deteriorated windows.
</P>
<P>
   In a more disturbing finding, the survey highlighted significant
problems in a number of schools that were either built or repaired
by the authority within the last five years. Those deficiencies,
often in the very roofs or set of windows that were to have been
fixed, point to any number of shortcomings in the system, from
sluggish contractors to a maintenance budget so paltry that it
allows for little maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this leaves teachers and students waiting, people
like Karina Constantino, the principal of P.S. 22 on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The authority spent $2 million putting a new roof on the school
and sealing its brickwork from 1995 through 1997. But almost two
years later, the roof leaks in seven places, she said, pointing out
the wide, wet blotches on the ceilings of a number of classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Constantino is hardly surprised, since she said it was often
up to her to bound up to the roof to scrape her fingernails against
freshly set mortar to determine its consistency or to check whether
the chimney was in danger of falling _ tasks, she says, the
authority should have been doing.

SUSPECT IN THREE YOSEMITE MURDERS ADMITS A FOURTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A motel handyman who was quietly dismissed as a
suspect in the deaths last February of three sightseers at Yosemite
National Park, but who is now the prime suspect in that case, has
confessed to the decapitation last week of a park naturalist, the
FBI said in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner, 38, who worked as a janitor at the Cedar Lodge in
El Portal, has confessed to the decapitation of Joie Ruth
Armstrong, 26, and has provided details about the crime that only
the killer could have known, according to the affidavit, filed
Monday in U.S. District Court in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit made for another dramatic day in a prominent case
that has FBI officials publicly wondering whether Ms. Armstrong's
death could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence obtained after Ms. Armstrong's death, the FBI announced
Sunday, links Stayner to the deaths of the three Yosemite
sightseers whose disappearance from the Cedar Lodge in February set
off a massive search, national headlines and numerous arrests of
ex-convicts whom the FBI has called unofficial suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was arrested Saturday at a nudist resort near
Sacramento, and charged with one count of murder on Monday
afternoon in federal court in Sacramento. At his brief court
appearance, Stayner, a muscular, clean-cut man dressed in an orange
prison uniform, said nothing but nodded repeatedly as Judge Peter
Nowinski asked him if he understood the charge and read him his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other residents living near the Cedar Lodge, Stayner
was questioned at the time of the sightseers' disappearance. The
speculation is that he was dismissed as a suspect, at least in part
because authorities believed that the slayings could not have been
committed by one person, said a law-enforcement official who would
speak only on the condition of not being named.
</P>
<P>
   While Stayner has not yet been charged with the deaths of Carole
Sund, her daughter Juli Sund, 15, and their friend Silvina Pelosso,
the FBI said it now believes that he is most likely the only person
responsible for their deaths, said James Maddock, the agency's
special agent in charge of Sacramento. The agency expects to charge
him with the murders ``as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest, and the FBI's announcement regarding the other
deaths, has also prompted officials in Merced, the Sierra Nevada
town where Stayner lived until moving to El Portal in 1997, to
announce that they were re-examining the unsolved 1990 killing of
Stayner's uncle, Jerry Stayner, who was shot to death with his own
gun in what authorities had considered a botched burglary attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has refused to discuss details of the links among the
four slayings that it says Stayner committed, but The Modesto Bee,
quoting unidentified sources, reported Monday that incriminating
evidence was found in his room, and that Juli Sund's throat was
slashed almost to the point of beheading, like Ms. Armstrong's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carole Sund and Ms. Pelosso were found burnt beyond recognition
in the trunk of their charred rental car more than a month after
they disappeared. Juli Sund's body was found a few days after the
others, dumped off a little-traveled road midway between El Portal
and where the rental car had been left.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armstrong's body was found on Thursday, one day after she
was last seen near the small cabin where she lived with her
boyfriend and another roommate, both of whom were away at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Until then the FBI had maintained that it believed all the
people responsible for the Sund-Pelosso deaths were in custody,
though on unrelated charges. Numerous ex-convicts with ties to
either El Portal or Modesto, where Carole Sund's wallet was found
three days after the trio disappeared, have been held for months
for various offenses while officials have tried to gather enough
evidence to charge them.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was questioned about Ms. Armstrong twice on Thursday, a
day after his sport utility vehicle was spotted near Ms.
Armstrong's small cabin about an hour after she was last seen
alive.
</P>
<P>
   He became a suspect after he disappeared from El Portal, where
he has rented a room at the restaurant adjacent to the motel for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   His family made national headlines when Stayner was 11 years old
and his younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped. Steven was held as
a prisoner by a convicted sexual offender for more than seven
years, until he escaped and went to the police after his abductor
brought home another kidnapped young boy. Steven died in 1989 in a
motorcycle crash.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing in his first murder case was scheduled for
Aug. 6 in federal court in Fresno, but John Balazs, an assistant
federal defender, said that the hearing will likely be postponed.

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Customers are in for some surprises when Coach opens
its redesigned flagship in September at the high-profile corner of
57th Street and Madison Avenue here. There will still be bags, but
there will also be leather jackets and pants, shoes, watches,
bracelets, scarves, hats, luggage and furniture. The bags won't be
only Coach's familiar sporty shoulder bags, but sleek clutches and
small-handle styles, some in shiny leather and others in fabrics
and exotic skins like python and alligator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is what drives our business now,'' said Reed Krakoff,
the company's creative director for the last two and a half years.
``People want fashion. So we have fabric travel bags and paisley
bags with leather trim and animal prints on raffia. Coach never had
anything nonleather until a year and a half ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he thought people would want more leather apparel
than the classic outerwear Coach has been offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing a ready-to-wear collection,'' Krakoff said,
``but more items for men and women. We'll do the perfect leather
peacoat, the perfect trench, the perfect leather pants, the perfect
T. And there'll be a suede poncho and a suede shirt, and it will
all relate to the handbags.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach, one of the top makers of status handbags in the United
States, is engaged in the balancing act that many classic brands
are facing: how to attract a new breed of shopper while continuing
to cater to old faithfuls. Krakoff, formerly a senior vice
president of Tommy Hilfiger, is the man responsible for the new
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recruited Reed to bring a fresh perspective,'' said Lew
Frankfort, the company's chief executive. ``We have to appeal as a
life-style accessories brand to keep in tune with our changing
consumer's expectations. We used to be known for robust handbags.
We've expanded to cover all accessories categories, and then some.
We're contemplating more licensed products like fragrances and
writing instruments, and we'll probably move into office
furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankfort, the architect of Coach's growth, has been with the
company since 1979, when it was a small family-owned business with
offices and a factory in a loft building. The offices are still
there, greatly expanded, but the former factory is now a sample
room (one of five) and the manufacturing is done in far-flung
locations as sales have expanded to more than $500 million
annually. The company grew tremendously after it was acquired in
1985 by the Sara Lee Corp., a $20 billion consumer packaged-goods
company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Coach faces many challenges in its bid for global
recognition as a fashion force. A lot depends on how well Krakoff
can shape Coach's image as a leader and not just a follower. So
far, although he is updating the company's image, he has broken no
new ground in terms of design.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, there are leather pants cut like men's oversize
khakis, a calfskin sweatshirt-style jacket, a streamlined version
of a bomber jacket in lightweight glossy leather, a shearling
jacket and a pony (really hair calf) shirtlike jacket with a fly
front. The leathers and suedes come in classic shades of beige and
brown, plus black. Crusher hats coordinate with the jackets.
</P>
<P>
   To expand beyond the expected, Coach has licensed companies to
make ties, watches, shoes, eyeglasses and furniture for it.
</P>
<P>
   Scarves for fall include cashmere mufflers in colors like apple
green, red and hot pink. Footwear includes motorcycle boots and
Mary Janes on a chunky rubber sole. In coming seasons, there will
be mules, thongs, sandals and ballerina flats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring shoes will be the first collection that looks like our
new concept,'' Krakoff said. ``They'll be very American, colorful
and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel bags and totes in fabric trimmed with leather will come
with contrasting linings, like pink with a green lining, natural
with yellow or black with blue. There are duffels and book bags,
overnight bags and men's briefcases in leather-trimmed fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The full range of products will be sold in the three-story 57th
Street store, which has been designed by Peter Marino as a
prototype for Coach's other stores throughout the world, as well as
in its boutiques in department stores. The 1940s and '50s
industrial-loft look of the original 34th Street headquarters
provided the inspiration for the brick walls, ebony-stained wood
floors, ribbed glass shelving, cast aluminum-and-steel banisters
and poured concrete stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some of Coach's 167 stores in this country and 160
abroad will have the updated products. To show off the new range,
there is a new advertising campaign shot by Mario Testino, with
black-and-white photographs of celebrities like Candice Bergen,
Leelee Sobieski, Alek Wek and Eddie, the ``Frasier'' dog (for a
collection of pet accessories) facing a page with the product shown
on a brightly colored background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our previous campaign showed different kinds of people we
aspired to attract,'' Krakoff said. ``We're still going with a
different mix of ages and ethnics, usually with a second person to
create a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspiration behind all we've done, from store design to
product to materials, is to go back to the beginnings of Coach,
that 1940s industrial style. I collect 40s and 50s modernist
furniture. The inspiration for a lot of what I've done here is my
collecting, my own interests. The surprise was that it really fit
with Coach. It allowed us to create our own point of view. It's not
nostalgic; it's not minimalist. It's functional.''
</P>
<P>
   The person who goes back to the very beginnings of Coach is
Miles Cahn, who sold the company to Sara Lee. He recently
reminisced about the early days of Coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was founded in 1941,'' he said. ``It was originally a
wallet company named Gail making private-label billfolds. I came in
after the Army, in 1945 or '46, as an employee. When I turned 40, I
felt this pressure to have my own business. That was 38 years ago.
When I took over I thought we should have something to sell
directly to stores, so we came up with bags.''
</P>
<P>
   He renamed the new company Coach, and the Coach bags, mostly
made of saddle and bridle leathers in sporty shapes modeled after
feed bags and saddlebags, became the everyday bag of choice for
thousands of working women in the 60s, 70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made about a dozen styles, year after year,'' Cahn
recalled. ``We had to set a limit. We were allocating our
production, because we were at capacity. We were making everything
on 34th Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we were negotiating with Sara Lee, we were doing
$20 million a year. I explained how they could go from $20 million
to $50 million, and they challenged me. I had to prove they could
do it. Look where they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Look where Cahn is now. Far from retired, he and his wife,
Lillian, raise 1,000 goats on a farm in upstate New York and
produce, under the name Coach Farm, a top goat cheese.

POWER

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ One of the nicest things the United States ever did for
Japan, it seems, was to force it, kicking and screaming, to open
its market for cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   That was five years ago. At the time, Japan was aghast at the
idea of freeing up a market that was a groggy backwater. Japanese
citizens were not even allowed to own cellular phones _ just rent
them _ and Japanese companies were afraid that they were going to
lose business to American rivals like Motorla.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Japan buckled, and now, under the pressure of competition,
has leapfrogged to the front of the global pack. The country now
has a higher concentration of cellular telephones _ including ones
colored pink, pale blue or tea-green _ than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More astonishing, Japan has caught up with Europe, the early
pace-setter, and plans to move ahead by introducing in early 2001
the ``third generation'' of cellular phone technology, which
promises much greater clarity and ability to transmit data and
video.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Japanese cell phones, which used to be second-rate and
expensive, have evolved into devices to buy and sell stocks,
reserve tickets for trains and airplanes, transfer funds between
bank accounts and send and receive text messages and simple
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as in Europe, they have leaped into the digital era
under the umbrella of common connection standards _ unlike in the
United States, where competing technologies have actually stifled
the advance of seamless and ubiquitous communication.
</P>
<P>
   The latest mobile phone to draw oohs and aahs here has a tiny
camera that sends a shaky TV-style color image to a small screen on
the other party's telephone _ assuming that it too is a video
phone.
</P>
<P>
   That cellular video phone will be introduced by the Kyocera
Corp. this month, for about $335, and it is as tiny as any other
mobile phone, easily fitting into a shirt pocket. Meanwhile,
another company has merged phones with personal digital assistants
like the Palm Pilot, creating a unit that is both phone and diary
has color capability.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Japan's economy still staggers along, one of the
brightest opportunities in this country of 126 million people is a
shimmering milky way of 50 million twinkling and tinkling portable
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Trials have already begun on an advanced wideband wireless
transmission technology, and some say that Japan may drive the
global standard and become a leader in the next generation of
mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, we are at a turning point,'' said Jun Murai, a
professor at Keio University and the leading cheerleader here for
the Internet. Japan lags significantly behind the United States in
information technology, he said, but with regard to potential
technical power, ``Japanese companies are not behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, at stake is Japan's pride at being a leader in a
pivotal technology _ enormously important in a nation that has been
economically wounded for the entire decade.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is betting that mobile phones will enjoy explosive growth
as they become a key accessory, as common as wrist watches, that
people take when they leave home. Japanese companies are betting
that mobile phones, rather than computers, will connect people here
to E-commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Japanese researchers are collaborating with American
companies, like Sun Microsystems, so that they may also become a
major link in controlling home appliances. Their goal, ultimately,
is to transform mobile phones into the crucial digital device of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   They see a vast market not just in the industrialized world but
also in nations like China, where many consumers' first phone is
cellular.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's gamble, though, is by no means a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next question is whether they take it from a cell phone to
a full PC or whether it makes sense to browse the Net on the phone,
for simple point-and-clicking,'' said Vinton G. Cerf, senior vice
president for Internet architecture and technology at MCI Worldcom.
``Japan is good at size, power and bringing the cost down. There's
no better country to do it than Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   One big problem, though, is that few Japanese are plugged into
the computing world. As recently as a few years ago, Japan was in
the personal-computing dark ages, a nation where corporate offices
were big rooms filled with paper-laden desks and where desktop
computers were rare.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, on average, only one person in four here uses a
personal computer. And so far, only about 14 percent of Japan's
population is plugged into the Internet, compared with 40 percent
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers have not been a bigger hit in Japan for
several reasons. For one thing, keyboards intimidate many
middle-aged Japanese, and tapping in the Japanese language _ with
two alphabets and several thousand Chinese characters _ requires
combinations of strokes that are far more complex than in English.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another is that many homes are cramped, and PC's take up a fair
amount of space. But that aversion to bulky computers and keyboards
may actually serve to spur the development of mobile phones as a
more compatible alternative.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the high cost of traditional phone services
may help advance cell phone technology even more. Hefty telephone
costs, including a mandatory $580 start-up fee for a telephone and
charges that add up by the minute, currently make Internet surfing
very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Initial costs for cell phones are so much cheaper than for a
regular phone line that young Japanese, especially students, often
have only a cell phone in their apartments. And the prospect of a
transformation in mobile-phone technology, along with the hope of a
new kind of gateway to the Web, is beginning to create a sense of
optimism that Japan may be able to catch up in the Internet
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge penetration of mobile telephones in Japan,''
said Junichi Saeki, director of systems solutions at the
International Data Corporation in Tokyo. ``This will lead to the
next generation of information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The push has been driven by NTT's Mobile Communications Network,
known as NTT DoCoMo, a cellular operator that commands more than 50
percent of the market in Japan. NTT DoCoMo is now working with
American and Japanese companies to develop a new wireless
transmission technology, called wideband C.D.M.A. _ short for code
division multiple access _ that is supposed to ultimately enable
people around the world to transmit data and video rapidly through
a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Many mobile phone operators here now use a fairly narrow band,
which can send data at speeds as fast as 32 kilobits a second,
faster than Europe's first-generation digital phones but slower
than the interim standard expected next year. True wide band offers
much more space and speed _ a potential of as fast as 2 megabits a
second, 65 times the capability of existing phones.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from around the world have settled on a format to
move toward a wideband CDMA for the next generation of telephones,
so that the same cellular phone could be used in almost any
country. But carriers in the United States are still fighting over
standards.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the latest craze in Japan is a cell phone called the
I-mode, which NTT DoCoMo started selling in February. As many as
10,000 of the phones are sold every day; already 779,000 owners use
them to send e-mail, check news headlines, buy stocks, make bank
transfers or plane reservations. They can gain access to specially
formatted World Wide Web sites and even see simple graphics.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo is betting that Japanese consumers will get hooked on
electronic commerce through I-mode phones, which rely on current
technology. Once they get used to e-commerce, then the new wide
band CDMA should begin, scheduled to commence in Japan in March
2001, probably several years before it will arrive in the United
States and at least a few months ahead of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I-mode is like black-and-white TV,'' said Keiichi Enoki, a
director at DoCoMo who spearheaded the I-mode project. ``CDMA is
like color TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyocera is working on a competing product that would let users
gain access to the Internet through a different Web protocol. In
the meantime, Kyocera is promoting the notion that telephone
partners will want to see each other.
</P>
<P>
   Video phones have flopped in the past, and Kyocera officials
admit they have not yet figured out how to market the new model.
Still, when they introduced the product in May, they got some
unexpected responses.
</P>
<P>
   A professional matchmaker inquired about using the phones for
clients on first-time dates, and a security company asked how the
phones could be used to keep tabs on where its guards were
patrolling.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a mobile ``spy phone,'' though, is precisely what
may scare off customers, even those directly involved in the
business. The video phone is one of the pet projects of Kazuo
Inamori, Kyocera's iconoclastic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But at a marketing strategy session this winter, not one in a
crowd of 60 employees raised his hand when asked who would buy one.
The reason? No one wanted to talk to the boss on a video phone.
Kyocera went ahead anyway with the product, mainly to keep up with
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Masahiro Inoue, Kyocera's director of product development for
the phone, is crossing his fingers that the public will respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is inside the home, a lady might not want to use it is
because she might not have her make-up on yet and she wouldn't want
to reveal her naked face,'' Inoue said. ``But if she's outside,
she's well prepared to be seen. So such an application is right for
the market.''

EGYPTIAN LIBEL SUIT AGAINST CLINTON IS TOSSED

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Cairo, a libel suit against  &UR; President Clinton &LR;  has been
thrown out of court because the alleged infringement did not occur
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by lawyer  &UR; Mohammed Baddy &LR; , who claimed that
his dignity was wrecked when Clinton named his dog Buddy. The
similarity in names caused people to make fun of the lawyer and
compare him to the dog, said his suit.

   &UR; _ Charlton &LR;  and  &UR; Lydia Heston &LR; , appearing in London in A.R.
Gurney's ``Love Letters'' _ the play for which actors don't need to
learn lines or even stand up _ have received terrible reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which requires two stars to sit opposite each other
and read aloud love letters, often has been performed by other
couples. In this version, said one critic, who was quoted in the
New York Post, audience members may have been tempted to ``rush up
on stage and pinch (the actors) to check they were still alive.''
</P>
<P>

EGYPTIAN LIBEL SUIT AGAINST CLINTON IS TOSSED

<P>
   In Cairo, a libel suit against  &UR; President Clinton &LR;  has been
thrown out of court because the alleged infringement did not occur
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by lawyer  &UR; Mohammed Baddy &LR; , who claimed that
his dignity was wrecked when Clinton named his dog Buddy. The
similarity in names caused people to make fun of the lawyer and
compare him to the dog, said his suit.
</P>

   Baddy was claiming $5 million in compensation.

<P>
   The play, which requires two stars to sit opposite each other
and read aloud love letters, often has been performed by other

AS BAND MARKS 30 YEARS, GREGG ALLMAN MARKS SOBRIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Allman Brothers Band may be on its 30th anniversary tour
this summer, but Gregg Allman has other milestones on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also my 2 1/2-year anniversary of being sober and it's my
5 1/2-month anniversary of not smoking,'' the legendary
singer-pianist drawls over the phone from his northern California
home.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire band, which is touring through early
September, has left its hard-partying ways behind. ``Everybody's
sober,'' Allman says.
</P>
<P>
   Allman's voice reveals some regret as he recalls the days of
drug and alcohol abuse:
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to mention the damn chemicals to keep us going, keep us
awake or sleeping or whatever. What's really amazing is that we're
still alive. Most of us _ any of us. A lot of us aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to go out flaming, but I kept trying ...
. I went in about 20 rehabs.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, living as ``somewhat of a hermit'' in a San Rafael
canyon with ``my lady and our dogs,'' Allman says he'll stay clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no problem. ... Hey, I don't care if it means going to
church eight times a day and wearing a monkey suit on Sunday _ a
real one. If that works, if that keeps you sober, man, do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allman, 52, has paid the dues to sing such gritty Southern rock
classics as ``Whipping Post.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list was the death of his brother, Duane, a
slide-guitar maestro killed in a 1971 motorcycle accident. A year
later, bassist Berry Oakley died in a similar fashion. An ill-fated
marriage to Cher added to Gregg Allman's grief.
</P>
<P>
   He's enjoyed good times, too. The group's 1995 induction into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ``was the peak. ... The Hall of Fame
means everything you do has turned on enough people to ...
immortalize you.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's shows at the closing of New York's Fillmore East,
caught on the landmark 1971 ``At Fillmore East'' album, also marked
a high point: ``I'd say two, possibly all four (of the shows), were
just incredibly magic nights in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its 30th anniversary, Allman admits the group has lost
some of the spirit that moved it to name one album ``Brothers and
Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, all I can tell you is money changes everything. Ain't
it a damn shame?
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in California, they live in Florida. Once we get
onstage, it's just like you see in the picture (in the ``Brothers
and Sisters'' LP). But offstage we don't see much of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice brightens as he shifts subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing with my (solo) band, too. It's a total
turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans a tour in December and January to showcase his six solo
albums' worth of work. With his last solo effort, ``Searching For
Simplicity,'' 2 years old, Allman says he's been ``writing like
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Allman also has continued to pen new songs for the Allman
Brothers with lead guitarist Dickey Betts and others. The band's
latest disc, ``Mycology: An Anthology,'' holds highlights from this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   With a catalog including ``Ramblin' Man,'' ``In Memory of
Elizabeth Reed,'' ``Melissa,'' ``Dreams and ``Midnight Rider,'' do
any tunes still send a chill up Allman's spine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Please Call Home'' still kind of gets me, still does. And
``Dark End of the Street'' with my (solo) band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some nights you might be singing a song and it throws you back
to a memory. It might be a little happy-sad, it might be a little
sweet and sour, and it might be all sweet. If it's all sour, you
just sing on and forget about it.'' &QL;

STOCKS LED LOWER BY TECHNOLOGY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks moved broadly lower Monday, led by big
technology and Internet issues, as concerns about the sudden drop
in the dollar and a possible future increase in interest rates
provided an excuse to take profits.
</P>
<P>
   Selling was most pronounced on the NASDAQ stock market, where
the composite index, which fell 6 percent last week after hitting a
high on July 16, declined an additional 2.7 percent on Monday.
Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon.com and Cisco Systems were among the
biggest decliners. The index was down 73.21 points to close at
2,619.19.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extended decline, the NASDAQ composite is still up
more than 19 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NASDAQ is correcting for the excesses it recorded over the
past month,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential
Securities. ``All in all, the market is in pretty good shape, but
it needs to take a pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Canelo, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, suggested that technology stocks might fall out of favor
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been my thesis that good second-quarter earnings would
help technology stocks, but that after those numbers were reported
worries about Y2K and the like would cause the market to rotate
back to areas like energy, cyclical and financial services
stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The market needs a shift in leadership to keep
advancing, and I think that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the NASDAQ, the drop in other averages was more
modest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.80 points, or
four-tenths of 1 percent, to 10,863.16. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index slipped 9.18 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent,
to 1,347.76. And the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks
dropped 5.51 points, or 1.2 percent, to 442.87.
</P>
<P>
   Trading activity was unusually light, even for a summer Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 616.2 million shares changed
hands, the third-lowest total so far this year. Stocks that fell in
price outnumbered those that rose by a ratio of more than 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was the most active issue on the Big Board
Monday, slumping 7 13/16 to 100 1/8, on news that top executives at
the leading online service company sold 4 million shares Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, volume on the NASDAQ market was 837.4 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see this sort of trading pattern,'' said
William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of portfolio managers are taking profits and
putting on longer-term hedges, particularly in technology stocks,
which despite their terrific long-term prospects are very pricey
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse
First Boston, said in a research report released Monday that stock
prices could remain in an ``extended'' trading range for some time
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk-reward status of the S&AMP;P 500 at levels above 1,300
will remain poor for most of the second half,'' Ms. Callies wrote.
``Investors should not chase rallies but should use trading bounces
to re-balance portfolios and raise modest amounts of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   High valuations and worries that the Federal Reserve Board might
raise interest rates again took a toll on technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 2 5/8, to 87 5/8. Hewlett-Packard, a Dow
component, lost 2 1/16, to 105 11/16; Cisco Systems fell 1 7/8, to
61 1/16, and Lucent Technologies shed 1/2, to 64 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a bad day for energy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which is also in the Dow, dropped 1 7/16, to 92 3/8.
Royal Dutch Petroleum, which is in the S&AMP;P 500 index, fell 1 11/16,
to 59 1/16. And BP Amoco lost 2 5/16, to 111 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer-oriented stocks that have been battered in recent
months did better Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney, down about 29 percent in the past 12 months, rose
11/16, to 27 1/2. Coca-Cola, which has declined more than 6 percent
this year, gained 13/16, to 63 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Wal-Mart Stores rose 11/16 to 45 5/8 after the
European Union approved its $10.8 billion purchase of Asda Group
PLC, the British supermarket chain.

SUSPECT IN THREE YOSEMITE MURDERS ADMITS A FOURTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes age of suspect from 38 to 37 in 2nd graf.)  (lb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A motel handyman who was quietly dismissed as a
suspect in the deaths last February of three sightseers at Yosemite
National Park, but who is now the prime suspect in that case, has
confessed to the decapitation last week of a park naturalist, the
FBI said in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Stayner, 37, who worked as a janitor at the Cedar Lodge in
El Portal, has confessed to the decapitation of Joie Ruth
Armstrong, 26, and has provided details about the crime that only
the killer could have known, according to the affidavit, filed
Monday in U.S. District Court in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit made for another dramatic day in a prominent case
that has FBI officials publicly wondering whether Ms. Armstrong's
death could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence obtained after Ms. Armstrong's death, the FBI announced
Sunday, links Stayner to the deaths of the three Yosemite
sightseers whose disappearance from the Cedar Lodge in February set
off a massive search, national headlines and numerous arrests of
ex-convicts whom the FBI has called unofficial suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was arrested Saturday at a nudist resort near
Sacramento, and charged with one count of murder on Monday
afternoon in federal court in Sacramento. At his brief court
appearance, Stayner, a muscular, clean-cut man dressed in an orange
prison uniform, said nothing but nodded repeatedly as Judge Peter
Nowinski asked him if he understood the charge and read him his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other residents living near the Cedar Lodge, Stayner
was questioned at the time of the sightseers' disappearance. The
speculation is that he was dismissed as a suspect, at least in part
because authorities believed that the slayings could not have been
committed by one person, said a law-enforcement official who would
speak only on the condition of not being named.
</P>
<P>
   While Stayner has not yet been charged with the deaths of Carole
Sund, her daughter Juli Sund, 15, and their friend Silvina Pelosso,
the FBI said it now believes that he is most likely the only person
responsible for their deaths, said James Maddock, the agency's
special agent in charge of Sacramento. The agency expects to charge
him with the murders ``as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest, and the FBI's announcement regarding the other
deaths, has also prompted officials in Merced, the Sierra Nevada
town where Stayner lived until moving to El Portal in 1997, to
announce that they were re-examining the unsolved 1990 killing of
Stayner's uncle, Jerry Stayner, who was shot to death with his own
gun in what authorities had considered a botched burglary attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has refused to discuss details of the links among the
four slayings that it says Stayner committed, but The Modesto Bee,
quoting unidentified sources, reported Monday that incriminating
evidence was found in his room, and that Juli Sund's throat was
slashed almost to the point of beheading, like Ms. Armstrong's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carole Sund and Ms. Pelosso were found burnt beyond recognition
in the trunk of their charred rental car more than a month after
they disappeared. Juli Sund's body was found a few days after the
others, dumped off a little-traveled road midway between El Portal
and where the rental car had been left.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armstrong's body was found on Thursday, one day after she
was last seen near the small cabin where she lived with her
boyfriend and another roommate, both of whom were away at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Until then the FBI had maintained that it believed all the
people responsible for the Sund-Pelosso deaths were in custody,
though on unrelated charges. Numerous ex-convicts with ties to
either El Portal or Modesto, where Carole Sund's wallet was found
three days after the trio disappeared, have been held for months
for various offenses while officials have tried to gather enough
evidence to charge them.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was questioned about Ms. Armstrong twice on Thursday, a
day after his sport utility vehicle was spotted near Ms.
Armstrong's small cabin about an hour after she was last seen
alive.
</P>
<P>
   He became a suspect after he disappeared from El Portal, where
he has rented a room at the restaurant adjacent to the motel for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   His family made national headlines when Stayner was 11 years old
and his younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped. Steven was held as
a prisoner by a convicted sexual offender for more than seven
years, until he escaped and went to the police after his abductor
brought home another kidnapped young boy. Steven died in 1989 in a
motorcycle crash.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing in his first murder case was scheduled for
Aug. 6 in federal court in Fresno, but John Balazs, an assistant
federal defender, said that the hearing will likely be postponed.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Having amassed a campaign fund of more than
$500,000 and having won his last race with 74 percent of the vote,
Willie Herenton, the first black mayor in this predominantly black
city, might seem to have little to worry about in his run for a
third term.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that would not be reckoning with the Ford family.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 16 challengers the mayor will face in the Oct. 7 vote
is the city council president, Joe Ford, perhaps his most
formidable opponent. Ford's strength comes not so much from his own
record on the council, but from his family name.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is a brother of former Rep. Harold Ford Sr., who was
Tennessee's first black congressman and served 11 terms before his
son, Harold Jr., replaced him. Another Ford brother serves on the
county commission, and another is a Tennessee state senator. Yet
another Ford brother is running to replace Joe Ford on the City
Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Herenton was first elected in 1991, it was by only 142
votes and with the tacit support of Harold Ford Sr. By 1995, when
the mayor handily won his second term, he had no real support from
the Fords.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Herenton, 59, runs for a third term, the kind of
offhanded bickering that he and Harold Ford Sr. _ who is managing
his brother Joe's campaign _ have engaged in for years as they
struggled for political supremacy is out in the open. And this race
is shaping up as a showdown between the two strongest political
factions in this city of 650,000, 55 percent of whom are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first real test for the Ford family,'' said
Herenton. ``They are trying to put control and political dominance
in the hands of one or a few, and I am the only one preventing that
from happening. I don't know of any other city in America where the
linkage between city, county, state and national government is in
the hands of one family. It is not healthy for the body politic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Pohlmann, a political science professor at Rhodes
College, a small liberal arts college in Memphis, said, ``Harold
Ford is the closest thing to a political boss that a big American
city in the late 1990s is likely to see.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, that kind of characterization is especially
sensitive, since for much of the first half of this century E.H.
Crump, or Boss Crump as he is more commonly called, ran this city,
appointing its leaders while actually serving as mayor for only a
few years. Crump encouraged black voters to support him at a time
when most Southern cities did all they could to discourage black
voting rights. But he was noted also for setting up the political
landscape so black voters could not gain power.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ford Sr. responds to the comparison with Crump bluntly.
``This is a machine,'' he said, referring to his family's power.
``But the definition of that machine is public service. We have all
been legislators and have had no jobs to give in return for votes,
only public service. If I were a Boss Crump, I would just appoint
my brother mayor and we wouldn't go through with this race. But
every one of the Fords has been elected by the voters.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Fords call Herenton's approach to governing ``hands off,''
contending, for example, that he has lost state and federal housing
grants for the poor by not actively overseeing the grants process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have a hands-on approach,'' said Joe Ford. ``I will
work with all parts of government for the good of all the people of
Memphis.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Ford, 45, has had to face criticism himself lately about
legal troubles. The local daily newspaper, The Commercial Appeal,
recently discovered at least five arrests through 1991 that had
been expunged from official records. The charges ranged from drunk
driving to assaulting his wife. Ford said all of those charges had
been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also reported that he is required to pay child support
after a paternity suit, and that he is a recovering alcoholic. Ford
answered those revelations swiftly by saying all of that is in the
past, and that voters will forgive him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There have been no independent polls to gauge how the field of
17 is truly playing out. Yet, beyond the front-runners, if
publicity is anything to go on, another candidate seems to be
emerging from the pack, Jerry Lawler, the World Wrestling
Federation wrestler and color commentator, who came to national
fame in 1982 for slapping comedian Andy Kaufman on the ``Late Night
With David Letterman'' television show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also in the race are the former football coach, Pepper Rodgers,
who led Memphis' unsuccessful National Football League bid and once
coached UCLa and Georgia Tech; the lawyer, Jack McNeil, who helped
James Earl Ray in his failed bid to exonerate himself in the 1968
assassination of Martin Luther King, and the used car salesman and
ex-con Ernest Lunati, who served time for running a prostitution
ring in the early 1980s.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the ballot are three longtime city council and
county commission members, and eight lesser-known candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Ford family fielded a candidate this year,'' said
Michael Nelson, another Rhodes College political science professor,
``suddenly white candidates saw the black vote splitting down the
middle and they got ideas they could win with just 25 to 30 percent
of the vote.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pohlmann thinks that is unlikely. ``I still think this is
Herenton's race to lose. In the old days, you often had two strong
white candidates, and the black community was the moderating
factor. Now it is the opposite. But I don't see any white candidate
emerging with enough support to beat a Ford or a Herenton.'' &QL;

   MIAMI _ For decades, the hard part for drug agents stalking
Florida's marijuana growers was finding their crop. The growers
weave their plants among corn stalks and even tomato vines to foil
aerial searches. In swamps, growers make berms out of muck and
chicken wire and plant their crop, leaving fat, black water
moccasins to stand guard.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in Florida's lush landscape, the camouflaged marijuana
plants often foiled the small army of law officers, helicopters and
drug-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new head of the state's Office of Drug Control hopes to
kill Florida's lucrative marijuana business in the very ground in
which it thrives, by someday dusting suspected areas with a
marijuana-eating, soil-borne fungus called Fusarium oxysporum.
</P>
<P>
   It is a plan that has some politicians and Florida drug
enforcement officials excited, and some environmentalists worried.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, a bioherbicide engineered specifically to attack
plants like marijuana, is otherwise harmless, said the Montana
company, Ag/Bio Con., that developed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it safe, and does it work?'' asked Jim McDonough, who was
hired by Gov. Jeb Bush earlier this year to head Florida's Office
of Drug Control. ``I've heard some of the top scientists in the
country say `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   But McDonough, who served as director of strategy for Barry
McCaffrey, the White House drug czar, said the fungus will not be
used here until it is tested in rigidly controlled conditions at a
Florida test site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with science, you deal with the cost of
advancing and what is the cost of not advancing,'' said McDonough,
who pointed out that 47 percent of all marijuana seized in the
United States is taken here _ much of it home-grown. Most years,
drug agents destroy more than 100,000 plants, and one year _ in
1992 _ they destroyed more than 240,000 plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With prudence and with care, make your choices,'' he said.
``We'd be no place if we put our head in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said he has not yet presented the plan to the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida has seen its environment ravaged again and again by
supposedly harmless plants that thrived so well in a damp, hot
climate that they overwhelmed indigenous plants. So some
environmentalists say introducing the fungus is risky, that it
could mutate and cause disease, not only in wild plants but in
crops as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally do not like the idea of messing with Mother
Nature,'' said Bill Graves, senior biologist at the University of
Florida Research Center in Homestead. ``I believe that if this
fungus is unleashed for this kind of problem, its going to create
its own problems. If it isn't executed effectively, it's going to
target and kill rare and endangered plants and I feel that this can
lead to a much bigger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   David Struhs, secretary of the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection, spelled out the dangers in a letter to
McDonough in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusarium species,'' he wrote, ``are capable of evolving
rapidly. Mutagenicity is by far the most disturbing factor in
attempting to use a Fusarium species as a bioherbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult, if not impossible,'' he wrote, ``to control
the spread of Fusarium species.''
</P>
<P>
   The mutated fungi can cause disease in a large number of crops,
including tomatoes, peppers, flowers, corn and vine crops, he
wrote, and are ``normally considered a threat to farmers as a pest,
rather than as a pesticide. Fusarium species are more active in
warm soils and can stay resident in the soil for years. Their
longevity and enhanced activity under Florida conditions are of
concern, as this could lead to an increased risk of mutagenicity.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means, say environmentalists, is that living things
behave differently in Florida than almost anywhere else in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, I am very supportive of using biological agents
against narcotic plants,'' said Raghavan Charudattan, professor of
plant pathology and weed science at the University of Florida, but
``this needs to be researched well or it could lead to great
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials have agreed to quarantine testing of the fungus
_ at a facility outside Gainesville usually used for, among other
things, studying citrus canker _ and for now any implementation of
the fungus is probably years away.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonough already has the back of some powerful allies,
including U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum, a Republican from Longwood.
McDonough is planning to try to obtain part of a $23-million
congressional allocation for research in eradicating plants like
the poppy, used in heroin, and having an ally like McCollum could
be very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, angry farmers have recently accused the United States
of using a soil fungus to destroy coca in the Upper Huallaga
Valley, saying that the fungus has spread to banana, yucca,
tangerine and other food crops, according to the Miami Herald.
American officials, while acknowledging in June that they had spent
$14 million on research to develop such biological agents against
poppy, coca and marijuana, denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Florida, history has taught scientists to be cautious of
introducing any foreign, living thing into the environment. While
pythons as long as pickup trucks have occasionally been found under
houses in South Florida, most of the problems have been with
vegetable matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu, a Chinese vine that has grown rampant in the South since
its introduction in the 1920s to thwart soil erosion, has swallowed
houses and acres of roadside in Florida, growing a foot a day.
Melaleuca trees, planted decades ago to help drain the Everglades
because they suck up so much water, has infested hundreds of
thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brooks, assistant director of the state Department of
Environmental Protection's Division of Water Resources, said the
difference between those plants and the fungus is that the state
has learned to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes made in the past,'' Brooks said, ``make sure proper
precautions are being taken. It's been agreed that any testing
needed to be done in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not tested,'' he said of the infamous plants.

CHAMPAGNE ON CHAMPS-ELYSEES FOR ARMSTRONG
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ To the victors belongs the party, and Lance Armstrong
and his U.S. Postal Service teammates got to celebrate in style
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred of their closest friends and sponsors filled two
rooms of the renowned Musee d'Orsay only a few hours after
Armstrong became the second American to win the Tour de France and
took a victory lap with his teammates on the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My baby,'' Armstrong's mother, Linda, greeted him as he
arrived at the museum. Like many others at the celebration, she had
a few T-shirts she wanted him to autograph. In fact, everybody
found a T-shirt on the chairs at the sitdown dinner that followed
the champagne reception. It said ``1999 Tour de France Champions''
and had an American flag on it. There were also yellow caps,
similarly inscribed, for each guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planned to have a party for 70, but it grew,'' said Thom
Weisel, the president of the team's management staff. The former
head of Montgomery Securities, Weisel had sponsored a
Subaru-Montgomery team earlier in the decade that had as its goal a
place in the Tour de France. When it was offered half a berth, with
the other half going to a German team, Weisel rejected the offer
and vowed to go back to France with a team that would get a full
share.
</P>
<P>
   He looked triumphant, as well he should. After all, he had
overseen the hiring of Armstrong last year, when there were no
other takers because of his treatment for testicular cancer in 1996
and a subsequent season off his bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Armstrong was customarily gracious at the party,
signing autographs and posing for photographs with his wife,
Kristin, who is expecting their first child in October. For all his
ease, however, and for all the satisfaction of getting a
congratulatory phone call from President Clinton after the race,
Armstrong acknowledged that he had just spent three weeks as
demanding on his mind as on his legs. The man in the leader's
yellow jersey is supposed to have time during the race to relax and
yet Armstrong constantly had to fend off suspicions, doubts and
innuendos about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, this was the Tour of Renewal that wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't quite make it,'' said Jean-Marie Leblanc, the Tour
de France's director, shortly before the finish Sunday in Paris.
``We closed a lot of back doors, but we accomplished only part of
what we hoped to do.'' Other officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   One early way to measure whether the Tour recovered luster with
its millions of fans after last year's drug scandal was to check
the size of the crowds that turned out to watch the three-week
race. By that standard, the results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Although immense numbers stood as usual at the sides of most
roads, they were people from villages and cities the riders were
passing through. In other words, they merely had to step out of
their homes to watch the riders pass swiftly on the flat.
</P>
<P>
   Where the crowds thinned out was where they are customarily
thickest: atop the mountain passes, where die-hard fans often camp
for days beforehand to watch the action unfold for an hour far down
from the peak.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the turnout on the fabled Galibier climb in the Alps,
where fans usually pick out favorite riders' names with stones in
the yearlong snowfields, was about a third that of last year. On
the ascent to Alpe d'Huez, which is usually two long lines of
trailers on either side of the 21 hairpin curves, there was plenty
of room. In the Pyrenees, the crowds were even sparser, with the
Tourmalet climb, often on the verge of a riot, strangely quiet. The
Piau-Engalay stage was a study in bucolic calm.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the spectators were there, perhaps the real fans were
sitting home or at the beach, disenchanted.
</P>
<P>
   They would have had much to be further disenchanted with this
year. An atmosphere of mistrust was prevalent. ``Everybody was
waiting for a bomb to explode,'' an official of French television
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the drug scandal and subsequent rider revolt against
police investigatory methods last year, the Tour de France
attempted to avoid trouble this year by having the International
Cycling Union, which governs the sport, increase blood tests that
hint at the use of such illegal performance-enhancing drugs as the
artificial hormone EPO. The Tour also conducted its customary
urinalyses of the daily stage's winner and runner-up, the overall
leader and two riders selected at random.
</P>
<P>
   To a general lack of surprise, the Tour's tests caught nobody
using drugs _ only one rider has been detected by them in this
decade. The blood tests also caught nobody, even though they
detected three riders, including Marco Pantani, the winner of the
previous Tour, in the Giro d'Italia in May.
</P>
<P>
   Did this mean the riders were clean? Not according to a segment
of the news media, which reckoned that the riders were being more
careful to beat the tests. Some newspapers, especially in France,
were full of daily doubts.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, Armstrong overcame it all. And on Sunday
night, the glasses were full of Champagne. &QL;

SOME THINGS MURDOCH'S MONEY CAN'T BUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When it comes to power and influence, Rupert
Murdoch ranks among the mightiest business moguls in the world.
</P>
<P>
   His holdings are vast, from movie studios to television networks
to newspapers to satellite broadcasting outlets to weekly magazines
to various other holdings too numerous to mention.
</P>
<P>
   His authority is so feared in England, where he owns the Times
of London and the racy tabloid, The Sun, that Tony Blair sought
</P>
<P>
   and received Murdoch's backing before the current Great Britain
Prime Minister even officially became the Labor Party's candidate
for the office.
</P>
<P>
   He's a person accustomed to achieving his goals, but, like a lot
of other fabulously wealthy men, he's finding the American athletic
landscape to be treacherous and fraught with frustration and
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the Murdoch-owned Dodgers wallow haplessly in the
lowest depths of the N.L. West Division, Murdoch is discovering
that allowing his administrative courtiers to spend mindless sums
of his money the team now has a staggering $84 million payroll
doesn't equate to success.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's Dodgers, to put it mildly, have been the biggest busts
in major league baseball this summer despite their immense
off-season expenditures in which they handed over a seven-year,
$105 million contract to the pitcher, Kevin Brown, and also
lavishly gifted people like Devon White, Carlos Perez, Jeff Shaw
and Alan Mills.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that the Dodgers have been artistic failures,
but what has to be even more galling to Murdoch is that the team,
the Atlanta Braves, owned by his bitter media rival, Ted Turner, is
once again doing quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch is known for his savage business practices he totally
gutted the incumbent staff at TV Guide
</P>
<P>
   when he took over that publication and you can be sure a noggin
or two or three will roll in the Dodger front office in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   But massive changes won't necessarily result in the Dodgers
suddenly turning into serious contenders again.
</P>
<P>
   To his mortal distress, Rupert Murdoch might in the upcoming
years find out what a lot of his rich brethren have across the
decades that there is no direct corollary between entrepreneurial
prosperity and athletic good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry could have informed him of such a curious phenomenon.
Everything Autry touched radio stations, TV stations, hotels, etc.
turned to gold for late cowboy movie star until he decided to
venture into major league baseball in 1961 with an expansion
franchise called the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   He would try everything during his lengthy tenure with the
Angels sign high-priced free agent players, sign big-named
managers, squander millions and million of dollars to bring
talented personnel to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   His Angels never were able to win an American League pennant,
and Autry would die without achieving what he desired most an
Angels' World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Autry's disillusionment had to be mild compared to that
suffered by the redoubtable owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, Mr.
Donald T Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   It is Sterling's noble distinction to own more apartment units
in Beverly Hills than any other real estate magnate. And he
routinely publicizes his ability to secure a high seven figure line
of credit from banks in newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who knows how to maneuver when it comes to making
money, but he has fallen haplessly on his wallet when it comes to
fielding winning basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling just might be the worst owner in NBA history, although
a strong case could be made for one Ted Septien, who once tore
apart the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   The high profile New York real estate whiz, Donald Trump, made a
big splash into the sports orbit in the mid 1980s when he was one
of the prime movers behind a fledgling summer enterprise called the
United States Football League.
</P>
<P>
   But after a couple of seasons, the owner of the New Jersey
Generals meekly threw in the towel, figuring casinos in Atlantic
City and high rises in New York City had more alluring virtues to
offer him than Herschel Walker carrying the football.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Wrigley might have made a mint on chewing gum, but he
never came close to matching such fiscal achievement with the
Chicago Cubs, who were doormats throughout most of Wrigley's long
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch is a compelling figure unaccustomed to failure,
but there is no guarantee that he will enjoy the same fruits of
success that he has in his other corporate endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   For one miserable year, at least, he certainly hasn't.

U.S. EARMARKS $500 MILLION FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's national security adviser said
Monday that the United States would pledge up to $500 million in
relief aid for Kosovo at a conference in Brussels this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations here, the
adviser, Sandy Berger, said the contribution was part of the
administration's effort to speed up the rehabilitation of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the war, but it will be a hollow victory if we lose the
peace,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing what is expected to be the largest donation at the
conference, to be held on Wednesday, the United States hopes to
demonstrate that it will take the lead on aid. The money will be
devoted to food, housing, health care and sanitation, as well as to
clearing land mines, setting up human rights programs, establishing
a police force and assisting refugees who remain in camps in
Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the administration would decide whether to spend the
entire $500 million after receiving a final assessment of needs and
getting ``confirmation that other donors will do their part.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the European Union has promised to assume the main
responsibility for the costs of rebuilding the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration calculated that by pledging a large
sum before the conference began, the 49 other countries attending
the session might reach deeper in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to raise the ante,'' said Mike Hammer, a White House
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although congressional leaders were consulted about the
donation, there is no need to receive approval from Congress for
the outlay, officials said, because money was already earmarked in
the supplemental budget for building refugee camps in case the war
had dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million will be given to international organizations
and private relief groups based on assessments by the United
Nations and other organizations, said James Dobbins, the special
adviser to the president who will lead the American delegation in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Monday, Berger softened some of the criticism
voiced last week by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen of the speed
of the United Nations in setting up its civilian offices in Kosovo.
The United Nations ``is moving'' towards establishing an
``effective international administration'' in Kosovo, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins also defended the United Nations at a news conference
Monday, saying that unlike the military, it did not have ``a ready
pool of reserves that it is able to dispatch when these
peacekeeping operations arise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth noting,'' he said, ``in evaluating the pace at
which civilian implementation is establishing itself, that all 700
of these people six weeks ago had other jobs, doing other things
and had to be taken away from other things to be moved to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, a Pentagon official said Monday that Cohen was not
criticizing the United Nations but ``gently prodding'' it to move
faster to assume its responsibilities to establish a civil
administration and police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we feel we're doing things so well that we
can take pot shots at other organizations,'' the official said.
``It's that the military is not the answer, even though now it's
acting like the de facto constabulary. It makes us look like an
occupation force and not the evenhanded force we're meant to be.``
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Berger cited the weekend massacre of 14 Serbian
farmers by Kosovo Albanian forces, saying that while ``this act of
violence is not the same as the massive, systematic campaign that
was unleashed'' by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, ``it
is profoundly wrong and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America did not fight in Kosovo for one ethnic group and
against another,'' Berger said. ``We fought for a stable, peaceful
Europe and for the principle that no people should be singled out
for destruction because of the ethnicity and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton will join other heads of state at a
far larger conference in Sarajevo to plan the political and
economic rehabilitation of the Balkan region. But Serbia will not
benefit from any international reconstruction effort, Berger said,
``so long as an indicted war criminal rules in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has spent $500 million on Balkan relief work
so far this year, and officials there asked for more money Monday
to finance their work in Kosovo. The U.N. emergency relief
coordinator said his agency needed $434 million if it was to
continue its work in the Balkans for the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billions of dollars have been spent to pay for military
interventions, which finally brought peace to the Balkans, the
coordinator, Sergio Vieira de Mello, said in Kosovo. ``We are now
asking for a fraction of that to do the necessary humanitarian
work.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mello said the additional money was needed for Kosovo and
also for Serbian refugees now in Serbia and Montenegro, who have
fled from Kosovo and from earlier wars in Croatia and Bosnia.

MEXICAN OPPOSITION RUNS ITS OWN CLEAN ELECTION  
(MS)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The opposition party that made its reputation by
denouncing skulduggery has shown, on the second try, that it can
hold a clean election of its own.
</P>
<P>
   After voting on Sunday for president of the left-of-center Party
of the Democratic Revolution, Sen. Amalia Garcia Medina was ahead
in a preliminary count, with 54 percent of the vote. Her victory
did not appear to be in doubt. Her closest rival had 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The first election for party president, on March 14, was
annulled after Ms. Garcia and another contender, Jesus Ortega, a
member of congress, had finished within a few dozen votes of each
other, and both sides charged fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of its first internal election to choose a leader
was acutely embarrassing to the party, which has based much of its
appeal on exposing the rigging of elections by its main rival, the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans are convinced that Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
Solorzano of Mexico City, the strongest leader of the Party of the
Democratic Revolution, won the presidential election in 1988 but
had it snatched from him by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Ms. Garcia ran on a unity slate that included
Ortega's followers, as well as her own.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that relations in the party remain scratchy, the
runner-up, Sen. Felix Salgado Macedonio, stayed away from the news
conference Monday where Ms. Garcia discussed her victory.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Garcia had the backing of Cardenas, her victory
virtually assures that the party will choose him as its candidate
for the presidential election next year. But the election on
Sunday, in which 500,000 of 2 million registered party members
voted, showed that Cardenas has much work to do to unite his party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garcia said she strongly supported negotiations to forge an
alliance between her party and the other big opposition group, the
National Action Party, to run a single candidate. Polls and recent
election results indicate that the opposition has little chance of
winning if it does not form a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But to judge by the polls, Cardenas may be the likely candidate
to make way for the candidate for the National Action Party,
Vicente Fox Quesada. In a poll published Monday by the Reforma
newspaper, Cardenas had 12 percent of the voters' preferences.

<P>
   Put a sock in it, Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what Peter Brown, the new chairman of AMC
Entertainment Inc., wanted to say to some analysts the day after
his mentor, Stan Durwood, died. Durwood's death triggered a $2
surge in AMC's stock on speculation the industry's fourth-largest
movie exhibition company would be sold.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown's too much of a gee-whiz nice guy to say that.
</P>
<P>
   What he does say is that because of astute estate planning,
Durwood gave the overseers of a stock voting trust the tools to
control the destiny of AMC.
</P>
<P>
   And the destiny Brown sees for AMC is not to be the hunted, but
the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks, as Durwood did, that remaining an independent, public
company is best for AMC, its employees and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   AMC, he said, has an excellent foundation on which to build, and
if shareholders will just be patient, they will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of ideas and I'm interested in a lot of
opportunities, to think outside the box,'' Brown said. ``But I
don't want to suggest we're going to take our eye off the ball, off
the golden goose, the goose that lays the golden egg. Our first
goal is to make sure our core business is as strong as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   What prompted some Wall Street analysts to speculate on an AMC
buyout?
</P>
<P>
   A few of the elements were Durwood's reluctance to raise ticket
prices, bloated operations and a multitude of desirable megaplex
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had served as co-chairman with Durwood, started
addressing those issues even before Durwood's death on July 14.
</P>
<P>
   In May, AMC started raising ticket prices to be more in line
with the competition, such as Loews Cineplex. Loews has an average
ticket price of about $6, compared with $4.70 for AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also admits to some flabbiness in operations that will be
tightened. He wouldn't elaborate on what he'll do, but one analyst
said AMC could pare down its real estate department and perhaps
become partners with another entity for future overseas expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the fact that AMC, with 60 megaplexes accounting
for more than half of its nearly 2,800 screens, probably has the
best megaplex presence in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It's this element that makes the sharks swim.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Durwood's death, Daniel O'Neill of Credit Suisse
First Boston raised his AMC rating to a ``strong buy'' solely on
the news of Durwood's passing. The thinking was that with Durwood
gone, there's no one to protect AMC as he did.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill speculated that someone, perhaps Regal Cinema or Loews,
would offer as much as $31 a share for AMC. That would represent an
almost 70 percent premium over AMC's closing of 181/4 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Wang of Salomon Smith Barney also thinks AMC will be put
into play.
</P>
<P>
   Based on recent acquisition activity in the industry, AMC could
bring between $25 and $30 a share, Wang said. The buyer could be an
investment firm such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., which has a
huge stake in Regal, or a competitor, such as Loews.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said certainly someone could make AMC an offer, and board
members would have a legal and fiduciary duty to consider one. But
he resists the notion that the company could be easily bought.
</P>
<P>
   That's because long before Durwood was diagnosed with cancer in
January 1997, he set up a seemingly airtight way to keep the
company from being bought after his passing.
</P>
<P>
   The Durwood Voting Trust gives the two trustees, Raymond F.
Beagle Jr. and Charles J. Egan Jr., control of 75 percent of AMC's
board.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 100 percent of the class B stock, more than 4
million shares now residing in the trust, is supervoting stock.
That means each share of B stock has 10 votes for each share of
class A, or common, stock.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, Beagle and Egan control 67.5 percent of the votes
of AMC.
</P>
<P>
   That gives them tight control over Durwood's legacy and wish
that AMC remain an independent, publicly owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Beagle was Durwood's personal attorney for many years, while
Egan has been an AMC board member for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts see a problem in Egan's dual role as an AMC
board member and trustee if someone approaches the company with an
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Would Egan be beholden to the shareholders or to the trust? The
trust directs Egan and Beagle ``to exercise their best judgment in
the interest of the company to assure proper, stable and continuous
management of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Beagle said the law of Delaware, where AMC is incorporated,
clearly states no conflict exists. And, he said, if an issue came
up that presented an appearance of a conflict, Egan would abstain
from voting.
</P>
<P>
   The primary beneficiary of the trust is the Stanley H. Durwood
Foundation, which will be administered by the Greater Kansas City
Community Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock in the trust were converted to common stock,
transferred to the foundation and liquidated at Monday's closing
stock price, its value would be about $73.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't happen, at least not soon, because of the way
Durwood set up the trust and the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the beneficiaries of the foundation may issue
instructions to the trustees. ``However, the trustees shall not be
bound to vote the shares in accordance with the vote or
instructions of the beneficiaries,'' according to the Durwood
Voting Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, unlike the foundation that Royals owner Ewing M.
Kauffman set up before he died, there is no timetable under which
the stock must be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that the whole legal structure has been set up is such
that it diminishes the likelihood in a change of ownership,'' Brown
said. ``And even if somebody made an offer, we would evaluate the
offer. But that doesn't mean (it) would be pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite AMC's attractiveness as a takeover candidate, it does
have problems.
</P>
<P>
   But so do its competitors. Mostly, the industry has become
overscreened.
</P>
<P>
   The number of tickets sold each year since 1988 has grown 40
percent to 1.4 billion a year. But at the same time, the number of
screens has increased 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also pinching AMC and others is the cost to build megaplexes. It
costs AMC about $1 million per screen.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many potential investors are sitting on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   While AMC may have the best presence in the industry, its new
megaplexes have cannibalized business at its smaller, outdated
multiplexes more than it had originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   That's eating into AMC's bottom line and keeping its stock
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   But again, AMC is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Brown said, some competitors have dropped out of the
rescreening race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're in a marathon,'' Brown said. ``Are we at mile
six or are we at mile 10? I'm not so sure, but I do know that there
are some competitors who have been running with us and are starting
to say, `I can't keep up the pace.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of the four largest publicly owned theater circuits _
AMC, Loews, Carmike and General Cinema _ are experiencing losses
and depressed stock prices. But AMC shares have suffered less than
the others.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of the four, as of Monday's close, AMC was the only one
with a positive one-year return, 3.55 percent. Loews was off 26.87
percent, Carmike was off 48.54 percent and General Cinema was down
24.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Depressed stock prices often make for good buying opportunities,
but ING Barings analyst Stewart Halpren sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Halpren says large numbers of screens in the United States are
owned by financial investors such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and
Hicks Muse Tate &AMP; Furst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial groups are not in the business of holding
investments for 10 years,'' Halpren said. ``They're looking to get
their returns in three to five years, and we've seen some `For
Sale' signs on ones largely owned by investment-oriented
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was in the leveraged-buyout business in New York in
the mid- to late 1980s, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Brown said, one large stakeholder in Loews, Universal
Studios, has said publicly it wants out. Another large shareholder,
Sony Corp., is reportedly considering the same move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a very deep market for exhibition companies
at this time,'' Brown said. ``But that's all peripheral to our plan
right now, anyway. We just want to put our heads down and solidify
our position, and that's what we've started to do.''

BRIEF LAWLESSNESS LEAVES WOODSTOCK FUTURE IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ The Woodstock '99 site looked like a war zone
Monday: twisted metal from a sound tower lay on the ground, litter
blew in the wind, the charred remains of 12 storage trailers still
smoldered. And the ideals of a generation _ peace and love through
music _ were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters stopped short of calling it a riot Monday, but the
Sunday night melee, at the end of the four-day music festival, left
five people injured, seven under arrest, and caused thousands of
dollars in property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Police and promoters attributed the violence to a relatively
small group of rowdy concert-goers. As they surveyed the damage and
pondered the aftermath, promoters openly debated whether there
would be another Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I would want to do it again, unless there is a
way we would feel completely confident and that controls were in
place to prevent something like this,'' said co-promoter John
Scher. ``It could have been a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a very small group of people who were determined to
screw this up,'' said Michael Lang, another co-promoter. ``There
has been discussion of holding another Woodstock here five years
from now. We'll see. But I predict there will be another
Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance brought a firey end to the mostly peaceful,
well-run music festival, which drew 220,000 fans to the dusty
runways of the decommissioned Griffiss Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great weekend and we were in the home stretch,'' said
co-promoter Ossie Kilkenney, ``but everything went sour in 10
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern student Jordan Gulas, who was caught in the fracas,
said it was a case of ``mob mentality'' started by youths who
mostly hadn't slept in several nights and were angry at the high
prices charged by some vendors, who asked up to $4 for a bottle of
water.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the disturbance took place near the main festival
stage, the violence spread to the adjacent campgrounds, where a
telephone company truck was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a `Lord of the Flies' situation in the campground,''
said Elizabeth Chanley, who had come from Los Angeles for the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   To try and avoid confrontations between fans and police,
promoters reached an agreement with New York State Police: the
Woodstock ``Peace Patrol'' _ peer volunteers in yellow T-shirts _
would handle most of the security inside the concert, while
troopers would guard the perimeter and stand by if needed.
</P>
<P>
   But the promoters admitted Monday that the volunteers were not
trained to handle the outburst of violence. And some inside the
venue said the Peace Patrol had taken a lax attitude towards drug
use, drinking and nudity by the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The violence occurred after the Red Hot Chili Peppers, an
intense, high-energy band and the concert's final act, concluded
their set with a Jimi Hendrix song, ``Fire,'' whose refrain is,
``Let me stand next to your fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Concert officials had planned to end the show on a more
reflective note. In 1994, vocalist Peter Gabriel's finale was
``Biko,'' his tribute to slain South African anti-apartheid
activist Steve Biko; the crowd then lighted candles distributed by
PAX, a group which promotes non-violence.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters had hoped that other rock acts would join in a tribute
to Hendrix to wind up this year's event. They invited Prince and
Carlos Santana but neither showed up.
</P>
<P>
   PAX had also handed out thousands of candles to concertgoers for
Sunday's finale, but the producers saw no connection between the
candles and the fires.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chili Peppers finished their last song, the concert
then officially ended with a short video of Hendrix playing his
famous version of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' at Woodstock '69.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, bonfires had already been started at the
overflowing trash cans dotting the site. At first, promoters
thought they were harmless; Scher was even asked if he wanted to
toast marshmallows over one.
</P>
<P>
   But Kilkenny said the mood quickly turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw a tent being taken down, I knew it was a serious
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Police Superintendent James McMahon said a large
group of vandals, estimated at between 200 and 500, began the riot.
They trashed three ATM machines, one of which is still missing. A
white Mercedes was also tipped over and trashed.
</P>
<P>
   A group of youths then set a tent on fire and pushed it under
one of 12 tractor trailers parked side-by-side about 150 yards from
the stage. The trucks had been used as storage by vendors, and some
fans had sought refuge from the heat by sitting under them.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks ``started exploding and all caught fire like
dominos,'' said Scott Lootens, a news cameraman from WIXT-TV in
Syracuse. ``And some kids would cheer every time they heard an
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said that 500 police officers rushed to the main stage
to quell the disturbance. The fires raged for more than two hours
as police in a containment line drove the crowd back, stopped the
rioting and ended the confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at them and they looked at us, and finally, they
decided they were tired and went to bed,'' said McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous rioters were arrested, including one man
who threw objects at the police, and another who scuffled with
police. David S. Hyyti, 28, of Revere, Mass., was charged with
rioting, posession of marijuana and mushrooms and larceny for
allegedly looting camping equipment from one of the trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a heavy rainstorm hit just ten miles south of Rome
on Sunday night, but passed by the concert site. ``If it had
rained, everything would have gotten wet and the fires wouldn't
have been able to get started,'' Scher said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Scher dismissed the notion that the Chili Peppers were
too raucous and intense to end the show. One member of the band,
Flea, performed naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chili Peppers were the heaviest band of the day at that
stage, but it was a lighter overall lineup than the day before,''
he said. ``And we did that deliberately.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang said he believes the violence was not an anti-Woodstock
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the kids were making an anti-Woodstock
statement,'' said promoter Lang. ``I think it was an
anti-Establishment, anti-everything statement.''

MAKING LIVING FROM FOUL LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LONG BEACH, Calif. _ While too many basketball players
continue dragging their coaches toward the back door of a 12-step
program, Dr. Tom Amberry offers an end to this insanity in five
fewer steps.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's crisis time for free-throw shooting, a hoop art that
has been vandalized by the graffiti of the crossover dribble and
the slam dunk. As entertainment value, the free throw is as
mesmerizing as ball four. To the conventional player, its
application seems inexplicably unsatisfying, but to the scoreboard,
the free throw remains fiercely efficient. Remember, Al Capone was
defeated by the tax man.
</P>
<P>
   So into this free-throw apocalypse rides Amberry, who - at the
age of 71 - booked a record-cutting session on Nov. 15, 1993 at the
Rossmoor Athletic Club in Seal Beach. Twelve hours later, the
retired podiatrist had made 2,750 free throws in a row, eclipsing
the old standard by more than 700. His support staff was begging
for mercy, so Amberry stopped without a miss.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of that performance, he has gone to the line for
David Letterman and was immortalized by The Wall Street Journal.
While the shelf life of fame may be 15 minutes, Amberry has reached
celebrity from 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Now he provides practical demonstration of what can be imparted
by his book (written by highly regarded mystery novelist Philip
Reed) ``Free Throw: 7 Steps to Success at the Free Throw Line.''
</P>
<P>
   He also is self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the best free throw coach in captivity,'' Amberry admits.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been a frequent halftime exhibit at the Summer Pro
League, an unintentionally ironic symbol of what the sport has
lost. After today's players - many of whom shun fundamental
fidelity -- have retreated to the locker room, Amberry begins to
shoot free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, as SPL fans postponed their charges to the Pyramid
hot dog line, he shot 50 and made 50.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping the faith of his seven steps (sorry, you gotta buy
the book), Amberry's shots flop into the net like so many
impressionable salmon. The success of this procedure is as
automatic as morning breath. The repetitive beauty is matched only
by the generous flow from an ATM. The guy could wipe out a carnival
booth in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To Amberry, it's all pretty simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Envision that your arm is 15 feet long,'' he says, ``and you
reach out and drop the ball right in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   While that doesn't read like mind-bending philosophy, Amberry -
whose next tentative SPL date is Thursday -- does incorporate the
assistance of Zen in a pre-free-throw mantra.
</P>
<P>
   His buzz words are ``focus'' and ``concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you think about it,'' he said, ``you miss.''
</P>
<P>
   This mental mojo, of course, reminds us of new Lakers coach Phil
Jackson and eventually leads to the broken free-throw percentage of
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   What is Shaq's fundamental flaw, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets 120 million bucks,'' Amberry said, issuing the comment
with equal parts humor and logic. ``That's not an incentive to make
free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Incentive, eh? We suddenly are interrupted by the segue police.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Amberry is the Jedi of free-throwing shooting. What
you're probably wondering is the why of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of doing the dishes,'' said Amberry, who only
simulates retirement at Leisure World in Seal Beach. ``I didn't
have a hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   He also didn't have a healthy lifestyle. So free throwing
shooting became recreation and therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, I couldn't shoot 50 in a day,'' he said.
``Then I started entering masters competitions. But I couldn't make
35 in a row and I wondered why. So I read everything I could about
free-throw shooting, all the literature.''
</P>
<P>
   While ingesting the information and gaining notoriety, he lost
50 pounds. At 6-foot-7, he now checks in at 210 pounds - his
fighting weight while playing for the University of North Dakota,
Long Beach City College and a couple of semipro teams.
</P>
<P>
   The credit for Amberry's need to shape up goes to a 40-year
career in podiatry and the abandonment of hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I touched a lot of feet,'' he said, ``but never a
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But in less than two years after his hoop resurrection, Amberry
was the greatest free-throw shooter in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring me anybody,'' he said, ``and I can teach 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   When the style-over-substance attitude of today's player is
considered, that first step will be the longest.

BRIEF LAWLESSNESS LEAVES WOODSTOCK FUTURE IN DOUBT

<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ The Woodstock '99 site looked like a war zone
Monday: twisted metal from a sound tower lay on the ground, litter
blew in the wind, the charred remains of 12 storage trailers still
smoldered. And the ideals of a generation _ peace and love through
music _ were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters stopped short of calling it a riot Monday, but the
Sunday night melee, at the end of the four-day music festival, left
five people injured, seven under arrest, and caused thousands of
dollars in property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Police and promoters attributed the violence to a relatively
small group of rowdy concert-goers. As they surveyed the damage and
pondered the aftermath, promoters openly debated whether there
would be another Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I would want to do it again, unless there is a
way we would feel completely confident and that controls were in
place to prevent something like this,'' said co-promoter John
Scher. ``It could have been a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a very small group of people who were determined to
screw this up,'' said Michael Lang, another co-promoter. ``There
has been discussion of holding another Woodstock here five years
from now. We'll see. But I predict there will be another
Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance brought a firey end to the mostly peaceful,
well-run music festival, which drew 220,000 fans to the dusty
runways of the decommissioned Griffiss Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great weekend and we were in the home stretch,'' said
co-promoter Ossie Kilkenney, ``but everything went sour in 10
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern student Jordan Gulas, who was caught in the fracas,
said it was a case of ``mob mentality'' started by youths who
mostly hadn't slept in several nights and were angry at the high
prices charged by some vendors, who asked up to $4 for a bottle of
water.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the disturbance took place near the main festival
stage, the violence spread to the adjacent campgrounds, where a
telephone company truck was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a `Lord of the Flies' situation in the campground,''
said Elizabeth Chanley, who had come from Los Angeles for the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   To try and avoid confrontations between fans and police,
promoters reached an agreement with New York State Police: the
Woodstock ``Peace Patrol'' _ peer volunteers in yellow T-shirts _
would handle most of the security inside the concert, while
troopers would guard the perimeter and stand by if needed.
</P>
<P>
   But the promoters admitted Monday that the volunteers were not
trained to handle the outburst of violence. And some inside the
venue said the Peace Patrol had taken a lax attitude towards drug
use, drinking and nudity by the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The violence occurred after the Red Hot Chili Peppers, an
intense, high-energy band and the concert's final act, concluded
their set with a Jimi Hendrix song, ``Fire,'' whose refrain is,
``Let me stand next to your fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Concert officials had planned to end the show on a more
reflective note. In 1994, vocalist Peter Gabriel's finale was
``Biko,'' his tribute to slain South African anti-apartheid
activist Steve Biko; the crowd then lighted candles distributed by
PAX, a group which promotes non-violence.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters had hoped that other rock acts would join in a tribute
to Hendrix to wind up this year's event. They invited Prince and
Carlos Santana but neither showed up.
</P>
<P>
   PAX had also handed out thousands of candles to concertgoers for
Sunday's finale, but the producers saw no connection between the
candles and the fires.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chili Peppers finished their last song, the concert
then officially ended with a short video of Hendrix playing his
famous version of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' at Woodstock '69.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, bonfires had already been started at the
overflowing trash cans dotting the site. At first, promoters
thought they were harmless; Scher was even asked if he wanted to
toast marshmallows over one.
</P>
<P>
   But Kilkenny said the mood quickly turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw a tent being taken down, I knew it was a serious
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Police Superintendent James McMahon said a large
group of vandals, estimated at between 200 and 500, began the riot.
They trashed three ATM machines, one of which is still missing. A
white Mercedes was also tipped over and trashed.
</P>
<P>
   A group of youths then set a tent on fire and pushed it under
one of 12 tractor trailers parked side-by-side about 150 yards from
the stage. The trucks had been used as storage by vendors, and some
fans had sought refuge from the heat by sitting under them.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks ``started exploding and all caught fire like
dominos,'' said Scott Lootens, a news cameraman from WIXT-TV in
Syracuse. ``And some kids would cheer every time they heard an
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said that 500 police officers rushed to the main stage
to quell the disturbance. The fires raged for more than two hours
as police in a containment line drove the crowd back, stopped the
rioting and ended the confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at them and they looked at us, and finally, they
decided they were tired and went to bed,'' said McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous rioters were arrested, including one man
who threw objects at the police, and another who scuffled with
police. David S. Hyyti, 28, of Revere, Mass., was charged with
rioting, posession of marijuana and mushrooms and larceny for
allegedly looting camping equipment from one of the trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a heavy rainstorm hit just ten miles south of Rome
on Sunday night, but passed by the concert site. ``If it had
rained, everything would have gotten wet and the fires wouldn't
have been able to get started,'' Scher said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Scher dismissed the notion that the Chili Peppers were
too raucous and intense to end the show. One member of the band,
Flea, performed naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chili Peppers were the heaviest band of the day at that
stage, but it was a lighter overall lineup than the day before,''
he said. ``And we did that deliberately.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang said he believes the violence was not an anti-Woodstock
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the kids were making an anti-Woodstock
statement,'' said promoter Lang. ``I think it was an
anti-Establishment, anti-everything statement.''

ACCEPTING A KILLER'S APOLOGY

   &QL; 
Early last May, Marilee Cross received a friendly three-paragraph
note from Douglas Gretzler, who murdered four members of her
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Marilee,'' it began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write to you a separate letter, apart from the one
I sent to your entire family, to just thank you for your kind
thoughts over the years. It was amazing to me that anyone would
even write to me at all, much less a relative of some of my
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine how difficult that was for you. It is, I
think, a statement of your strong faith, and it sets and example
not lost on me _ of a true Christian in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``My time grows short and I have much yet to do so I'll say
good-bye and God Bless you Marilee.''
</P>
<P>
   It's signed, ``Doug Gretzler,'' and postmarked Florence, Az.,
where Gretzler spent 25 years in prison. He was executed a few days
later.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gretzler had been on death row longer than anyone
in the state. He was responsible for more killings _ 17 _ than
anyone in Arizona's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Gretzler and partner Willie Steelman went on a robbery
and killing spree in California and Arizona. They murdered two men
in Mesa. A hitchhiker near Apache Junction. A couple they believed
had seen them with the Mesa men. A hitchhiker in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   They then killed Michael and Patricia Sandberg in their
apartment in Tucson _ the murders that put them on death row.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the farming town of Victor, Calif., they left nine dead
in a single home. including Marilee's aunt and uncle, Wanda and
Richard Earl, her cousins Debra Jean and Richard Jr., and Debra's
boyfriend, Mark Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Marilee was a sophomore in high school at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in shock,'' she says. ``This was my father's only
brother. It was unreal, horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting caught, Gretzler and Steelman confessed and were
sentenced to death for the Sandberg murders. Appeals kept them
alive for years. Steelman, an escapee from a mental institution
when he met Gretzler, died in prison of liver disease. Gretzler
waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I ever would have contacted Doug if hadn't
gone through another family trauma,'' Marilee says.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Marilee's baby boy went into the hospital for
a hernia operation. He died on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the doctors made mistakes,'' she says. ``All I wanted
was to have them tell me the truth about what went on, to say they
were sorry. But lawyers told them not to talk. We live in a society
where no one is allowed to say they're sorry anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family sued and won. Afterwards, Marilee contacted the
doctors again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we talked, and they said they were sorry,'' she
says, ``and we all came away feeling a little better, a little more
human.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided to give Douglas Gretzler the same chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote him to say I forgave him,'' she says. ``And said he
could write me if he wanted to. People can do evil things and still
be human. A lot of people don't understand what I was trying to
accomplish by contacting Doug. It was only to give him a chance to
say he was sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience with Gretzler led Marilee, who now lives in
Idaho, to try to contact death row inmates throughout the country,
and give them the same chance to apologize to families of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resistence from authorities has been intense,'' she says.
``The popular view is, `They're animals, who cares what they say?'
I understand that, but they're human, too. Before we put them to
death, we should encourage them to do something human again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even something small.
</P>
<P>
   Like wne Gretzler, on the gurney before the poison flowed, said,
``From the bottom of my soul I am so deeply sorry and have been for
years for murdering Patricia and Michael Sandberg. Though I am
being executed for that crime, I apologize to all 17 victims and
their families.''

N.E. JOURNAL EDITOR REJECTED PLAN TO RECYCLE ARTICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the wake of Dr. Jerome Kassirer's firing as editor
of the New England Journal of Medicine, sources say one of the
issues that led to his downfall was his refusal to go along with a
plan to spin off a slew of ``New England Journals'' _ of
cardiology, gastroenterology, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the spin-off journals was to make more money for
the Massachusetts Medical Society, which owns the journal, by
recycling some of the studies not deemed worthy of publication in
the 187-year-old New England Journal, the Mount Olympus of medical
periodicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Journal of Rejects,'' was how one editor at
the journal's Boston offices described the proposed spin-offs.
``Jerry (Kassirer) told them no right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer and his colleagues protested that the junior journals
would dilute the prestige of the New England Journal's matchless
``brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   There may yet be other key departures. At a July 7 meeting,
described be one insider as ``very angry,'' the journal's
half-dozen associate editors _ internationally respected experts in
their specialties _ threatened to resign en masse upon learning
that Kassirer would be let go.
</P>
<P>
   Such a departure of editorial is still a possibility, some said
Monday, if the Medical Society does not appoint executive editor
Dr. Marcia Angell as interim editor and promise the next permanent
editor the same independence that Kassirer enjoyed in his
employment contract.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer's contract specifically granted him final say over how
the New England Journal's name is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say that the Medical Society and I are in preliminary
talks about my becoming interim editor-in-chief, but nothing is
settled,'' Angell said Monday. ``You can also say that I'm sorry
the Society took this course in not renewing Jerry's contract. He's
a superb editor and a man of uncommon wit and warmth and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   An exodus of associate editors and consultants ``would be an
almost mortal blow'' to the venerable journal, said one staffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they don't think so, but the Medical Society has an
enormous amount to lose,'' said Dr. Robert J. Mayer, a Harvard
cancer specialist and associate editor of the journal. ``The brand
name and the franchise are only the people who produce it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry L. Greene 2nd, the Medical Society's executive vice
president, did not respond Monday to a request for an interview.
The society's office is in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In all the recent conflicts involving the Journal, the divide is
between those who see the New England Journal as a sacred trust and
those who view it as product _ a priceless marketing opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say none of the ``philosophical differences'' cited in
the Medical Society's statement about Kassirer's departure involved
challenges to Kassirer's decisions to print one study, reject
another, or take editorial stands. All the disputes involved
various schemes to make more money for the New England Journal
franchise, which already generates a profit in excess of $20
million a year for the state medical society _ at least five times
more than the organization reaps in annual dues from its 17,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my colleagues would question how much revenue the
Medical Society needs. Where is it going? We don't get an
accounting of it,'' Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money-making schemes were minor, but they offended
the sensibilities of the fiercely independent editors in Boston.
For instance, the Waltham executives wanted to put a Barnes &AMP; Noble
advertising strip on the book-review page of the New England
Journal's web page. Every time a subscriber ordered a book through
barnesandnoble.com, the Medical Society would ring up a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thin edge of the wedge,'' said one New England
Journal editor.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society also wants to brand several ventures with
the premier journal's name and logo, such as a publication for
physicians called Hippocrates that the organization recently
purchased from another publisher.
</P>
<P>
   At the New England Journal, editors consider Hippocrates a
``throwaway,'' the term for a periodical that is merely a vehicle
for lucrative advertising rather than a repository of medical
knowledge meant to be archived.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, sources said, Greene and his staff in Waltham are
motivated by a fear that print journals are dinosaurs at the
beginning of a big media climate change. ``They want to leverage
the New England Journal's prestige while they can to start many
other ventures, as a hedge against the day when the New England
Journal won't be so profitable,'' said one insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Print is in mortal danger long-term, but not short-term,''
said Dr. George Lundberg, who was fired earlier this year as editor
of the Journal of the American Medical Association over issues of
editorial independence and now is editor of Medscape, an Internet
journal. Against this backdrop, he added, ``it's not hard to figure
out who's going to win'' in a battle between business ethics and
medical journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner wins,'' Lundberg said.

FONDA BACKS OUT OF ABA CONVENTION SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A possible political skirmish in the American Bar
Association was averted when actress Jane Fonda canceled plans to
speak to the group, citing scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Fonda as keynote speaker for the Silver Gavel
Awards, scheduled for Aug. 10 in Atlanta, stirred heated criticism
from some ABA members and veterans who disagreed with her antiwar
views during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Fonda said Monday that the Academy
Award-winning actress's cancellation was ``nothing more than a
scheduling conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's never canceled any speaking engagements before,''
spokeswoman Robin Holtson said. ``Ms. Fonda really needs to attend
an event with her husband during the time of the award ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtson said the complaints filed by the ABA members ``have
absolutely nothing to do with Ms. Fonda's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Weixl, an ABA spokeswoman, said the complaints received
shortly after the June announcement that Fonda would be speaking at
the awards ceremony prompted ABA President Philip S. Anderson to
issue a brief statement defending an ABA board's choice of Fonda as
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Anderson said the Silver Gavel award
recognizes talent in the media, not politics, and Fonda was invited
``because of her contributions to the arts and her important work
with young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Weixl said it was ``not uncommon'' for members to write in and
complain over the choice of speakers. In the past, the association
has invited a wide range of speakers, including columnist William
Safire, former Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, movie critic Gene
Siskel and political consultant James Carville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all draw some sort of objection one way or another,''
Weixl said. In the case of Fonda, Weixl said, ``I remember seeing
some letters of complaint, but not an overwhelming amount.''
</P>
<P>
   ABA member Charles White, 53, a Vietnam War veteran from
Amarillo, Texas, said that in the past six weeks he had recruited
as many as 100 lawyers and members of veterans groups to protest
the choice of Fonda by sending e-mail or letters or calling the ABA
headquarters in Chicago. White said some members also had written
to Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jane Fonda is an insult to the soldiers who have given their
lives in Vietnam,'' White said. ``She's an insult to the veterans.
She's an insult to the POWs. She's an insult to America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Silver Gavel Award recognizes achievements in the media and
the arts relating to the law or judicial system. CNN Anchor Judy
Woodruff is now scheduled to speak in Fonda's place.

WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL LEAVES A BAD HANGOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ For almost three days, Woodstock '99 was exactly
what its promoters had hoped for: hundreds of thousands of peaceful
young people listening to music under sunny skies, untouched by
incident or scandal. The problems that had plagued the 1969 and
1994 Woodstock shows _ hordes of gate crashers, miles of traffic
jams, pouring rain and mud _ were gone, as the police monitored
local roads like classroom proctors, and storm clouds thundered but
steered clear.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just as the three-day concert wound down to its final
act Sunday night, John Scher, his partner, Michael Lang, and Mayor
Joseph A. Griffo of Rome were high-fiving one another for what they
saw as a virtually flawless weekend, Scher said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, without warning, a Mercedes went up in flames.
</P>
<P>
   That fire, coming as the Red Hot Chili Peppers were finishing
their show on Woodstock's east stage, gave way to a violent and
frightening rampage by thousands of young people who looted and
burned truck trailers filled with T-shirts and other souvenirs,
toppled giant towers that held the concerts' sound system and
hammered their way into ATM machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mortified that this happened,'' Scher, crestfallen and
sleep-deprived, told reporters at a makeshift briefing at 5 a.m.
Monday. ``Of course we blame ourselves to a degree,'' he said, but
he called the four-hour melee ``an aberration'' created by a few
``bad kids.''
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke Monday, dozens of weary New York State Police
troopers kept vigil on the scorched grounds as Woodstock's
promoters and Rome and Oneida County officials searched for reasons
for what went wrong. Some concertgoers said the violence was
directed at the high prices promoters charged for food, water and
merchandise. Others questioned why it took more than an hour for
platoons of state troopers to move in.
</P>
<P>
   The state police estimated that several hundred people
participated in the rampage while thousands more looked on. Only
seven fans were arrested, on charges that included rioting, petty
larceny and disorderly conduct. Seven people were injured,
including two state troopers, Supt. James W. McMahon of the state
police said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most serious injury was to a man who suffered a
broken leg when a trailer was tipped over onto him. There was no
dollar estimate from police of the total damage done by the crowd,
though several tents were razed and 12 truck trailers on the
grounds were torched after their contents _ giant soft pretzels and
bottles of Coca-Cola that had been selling for $4 each _ were
looted.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, the police were still searching for one of
three cash machines that were smashed and then hauled away by
frenzied bands of young men, McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn, long after firefighters put out at least 12 large
bonfires that had roared to life in the grass field near the east
stage, a few concert fans remained in the 260-acre campground,
where state troopers wearing riot helmets and wielding thick wooden
batons had steered them.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began around 10 p.m., when concertgoers, using
``peace candles'' that had been distributed with the consent of
Woodstock organizers, overturned and torched the Mercedes-Benz, to
the right of the east stage. ``At that point, we assessed that
these fires were not a danger to the crowd,'' McMahon said,
speaking to reporters Monday morning. Rather than risk driving a
fire truck into the crowd near the stage, he said, police officials
believed the fires would simply die out.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after the first bonfire was lit, a fire truck from
the on-site fire department drove within yards of it, only to turn
around and leave the flames burning, said Scher, one of Woodstock's
three main promoters. But the fires did not die out. As the
concert's flood lights turned off, around 10:30 p.m., the blazes
quickly multiplied, illuminating silhouettes of men and women
running and dancing around them, sometimes through them.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m., with no police in sight, some people had razed a
canvas tent, but not before looting the booty: Woodstock 99
T-shirts. Unchallenged, they grew bolder, feeding the bonfires with
large tables, plywood, even portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, groups of men were repeatedly slamming three cash
machines onto the Griffiss Air Force Base runway, hoping to see a
spray of $20 bills. ''Back up, everyone will get money!'' shouted
one beefy man, pulling smaller revelers off a dogpile that had
formed around one broken cash machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sheer fun,'' said Meghan MacIver, 21, of Toronto.
``There was looting and lots of damage _ but not to anyone's
tents,'' she said. ``As riots go, it was a very friendly riot.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In all, the melee went on unchecked for at least an hour before
hundreds of State Police troopers, who had not been a presence
inside the Woodstock grounds all weekend, finally barreled onto the
concert site to restore some order at 11:40 p.m. Corralling the
revelers and putting out the fires they had set, however, required
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crowd was deemed to be under control, around 5 a.m.,
concertgoers had looted a stand filled with hardware and camping
supplies for sale, torched the 12 trailers, smashed into a local
radio station's truck and burned a telephone company truck in the
campground, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the delayed response, McMahon said the police needed
time to marshal enough force to combat the thousands of shouting,
often angry fans. ``When you go into a situation where there's a
potential for violence against people that work for you,'' he said,
``you want to go in with sufficient numbers. We felt there was a
danger to both the fire service and the state police.''
</P>
<P>
   Troopers were rushed by some revelers and repeatedly pelted with
stones and bottles by others, McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody Monday _ the police, the mayor or the organizers _ could
offer an explanation for the violence. But there seemed to be a
mood of revenge among some of the participants. As rampaging young
men _ and they were mostly shirtless men _ flung bottles of stolen
soda and ripped open boxes of pilfered giant pretzels, they
sarcastically blamed it all on Woodstock's organizers for selling
$4 bottles of spring water and $6 hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But Scher said such excuses were bogus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $4 bottle of water doesn't cause a kid to start a fire or
turn over a car,'' he said with some irritation early this morning.
``I don't think there's any excuse for that behavior. It shouldn't
be tolerated by their peers, it shouldn't be tolerated by
society.''
</P>
<P>
   For $150 a ticket, he said, ``This was the bargain of the
decade. They got $4 a band. There was free water everywhere,'' he
added, though some of the free water was hundreds of yards away or
tainted by leaking toilet sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woodstock was not supposed to be just another concert
but a summoning of 1969, when the 500,000 people gathered in
Bethel, N.Y., did not leave early and did not rampage when the
music stopped.
</P>
<P>
   While Griffo, the mayor, hedged on an invitation for Woodstock
to return here for another concert, Lang predicted a fourth
Woodstock concert, sometime, somewhere. ``The event for three days
was perfectly peaceful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he reflected on the two Woodstocks, 1969 and 1999. ``Right
up until the end,'' he said, ``there were not that many
differences.''

THE ISSUE MAY BE ARCANE, BUT THE DEBATE WAS HEATED
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear many Democratic senators on Monday, the
very fate of the Senate, if not of the Republic itself, suddenly
seemed imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut warned that the Senate
had fallen prey to ``a tyranny of the majority'' that the Founding
Fathers so feared. Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia declared
that the Senate was ``losing its uniqueness'' and becoming a more
``dog-eat-dog'' place like, Heaven forbid, the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Senate Republicans, Monday was simply a chance to
right a procedural wrong mistakenly made in a moment of passion
four years ago. ``It's time we bring this process under control,''
said Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Monday's debate was over restoring Rule 16, a
byzantine parliamentary edict that bars writing policy into
spending bills on the Senate floor. But senators from both sides
used the issue as a stage to cast themselves as the true defenders
of Senate rights, responsibilities and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a subject that is said to be arcane, to be
incomprehensible, to be something on the margin,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, of New York, one of only two Democrats to break
ranks and vote for restoring the original rule. ``Well, the
Constitution of the United States was a bit arcane.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the final vote was 53 to 45, nearly along
party lines, to turn the clock back to a precedent that had stood
since 1868 before it was abruptly reversed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most Democrats opposed the change in 1995, both
parties have since exploited it successfully, tacking provisions
onto must-pass spending bills. In the short run, the change may
prove more a hindrance to Democrats, like the effort by Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy of Massachusetts to attach to a spending bill a
legislative rider raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the House, which has strict rules on the germaneness of
amendments to underlying bills, the Senate historically had
permitted riders on all bills except spending measures. Policy
could still be written into bills by the House or Senate
Appropriations committees.
</P>
<P>
   But on March 16, 1995, shortly after the Republicans regained
control of the Senate, Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, offered an
amendment to a spending bill to prohibit the Interior Department
from making a final decision on new endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately objected and their parliamentary point of
order was upheld. But Hutchison requested a vote to overrule the
precedent. Republicans rallied to her side and the measure
prevailed, 57 to 42, setting a new precedent that stood until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The broader effect of Monday's vote will not streamline the
deliberative pace of the Senate. More likely, it means that the
minority party will rely on the obstructionist tactics it used
before 1995 _ like filibusters and holds on nominations _ to assert
the position of the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans are saying by this vote on Monday is
they've been hurt a lot more in the last four years than we have,''
Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who opposed the change four years ago said the Senate
Republicans had clamped down so aggressively on their rights to
speak or offer amendments, they had no choice but to support the
current precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot debate anything on this floor that the majority does
not want to debate,'' said Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoffed at the Democrats, implying that they were a
bunch of whiners who used the same tactics when they were in the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that the minority delays the work of the
majority, then at a time of electioneering, they accuse the
majority of not getting anything done,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lott came to the floor to ``defend his honor'' against
the Democrats' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when you're in the minority you're not always happy
with the way you're treated,'' Lott said in spirited exchange with
Byrd. ``But I've been a little bit shocked by the tone of the
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott complained that spending bills were typically laden with
such extraneous measures as studies on tomato wilting, litter as
possible fuel, removing computer games from government computers
and green snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had the last say all around. Senators defeated, by a
vote of 51 to 47, a separate Democratic amendment to prevent
conference committees from adding measures not approved by either
the House or Senate.

EPA TO PROPOSE REDUCING USE OF GAS ADDITIVE THAT POLLUTES WATER 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Del., Ill., Ind., Iowa, Ky., Mass., Md.,
N.H., N.J., Pa., R.I., Texas, Va., Wis.) (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency will propose
that Congress no longer require oil companies to add an ingredient
to gasoline that is meant to make the air cleaner, because it
pollutes water.
</P>
<P>
   A panel appointed by the EPA is set to report on Tuesday that
use of the ingredient, MTBE, should be ``reduced substantially''
because it dissolves easily in water and turns up in tap water when
gasoline has leaked or spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the report was made public, EPA Administrator Carol
Browner said Monday that Americans should have ``both cleaner air
and cleaner water _ and never one at the expense of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner, whose agency in the past has defended MTBE mandates
to critics who said it posed health problems, said that she would
urge Congress to change rules passed in 1990 that require oil
companies to put an ``oxygenate,'' a chemical that incorporates an
oxygen atom, to promote more thorough burning in engines. Most oil
companies chose the ingredient known as MTBE, for methyl tertiary
butyl ether.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress required an oxygenate in nine big metropolitan
areas _ those with the dirtiest air, including New York _ other
communities voluntarily embraced the use of MTBE, which not only
cuts carbon monoxide, as it was designed to do, but dilutes toxic
components of gasoline, like benzene and toluene.
</P>
<P>
   Experts differ on how much it has done to control carbon
monoxide and smog, but they agree that it has cut air poisons from
gasoline by about 30 percent where it has been used.
</P>
<P>
   But when fuel is spilled or leaks from underground tanks or
pipelines, MTBE dissolves easily in water and flows faster than
other components of gasoline into wells. And microbes in soil that
digest natural hydrocarbons, making them harmless, do not like
MTBE, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the EPA panel's findings calls for Congress to drop
the federal requirement that gasoline sold in the big cities
contain MTBE, and that its use be ``reduced substantially.'' A
summary of the draft did not define substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The draft has been widely circulated and its contents were
confirmed Monday by the panel's chairman, Dan Greenbaum, who is
also president of the Health Effects Institute, a non-profit study
group financed by the EPA and the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said that MTBE ``has been better
for reducing toxics than anybody thought it would be,'' and has
also helped cut carbon monoxide emissions from cars. But newer cars
control carbon monoxide without MTBE, he said, and ``you have to
stack that up against the potential water risk.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows just how many spills there have been, but the panel
report estimates that in places where oxygenates are used, 5 to 10
percent of drinking water supplies show detectable amounts of MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE makes up 3 percent to 5 percent of the national gasoline
supply. If refiners had to make up that volume suddenly with other
components, shortages and price spikes would result, the MTBE
producers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans can be paying more for dirtier air,'' said Terry
Wigglesworth, executive director of the Oxygenated Fuels
Association. A better approach, she said, would be to take steps to
stop leaks and spills, which would protect drinking water from
MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts, noting that MTBE costs significantly more per
gallon than gasoline, say that if the change is made slowly, the
cost of fuel could drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which require oxygenates,
also require a 15 percent reduction in poisons in gasoline. When
the oil companies turned heavily to MTBE, because it contains
oxygen and boosts octane, the result was an unexpected dividend, a
30 percent drop in toxics.
</P>
<P>
   But MTBE has been shown to cause cancer in animals, even though
it is not clear to researchers if those findings are applicable to
people. People can smell MTBE at very low concentrations, and it
makes water smell so bad that most will refuse to drink it.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why California in March ordered oil companies
to phase out the chemical by 2002. Under the Clean Air Act, subject
to the veto of the EPA, California can develop its own clean air
policies because pollution in Los Angeles is worse than in the rest
of the country. The panel will also recommend that Congress clarify
the right of the EPA and the states to regulate gasoline for
environmental reasons that may not add up to a public health
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner said the recommendations ``are expected to confirm
EPA's belief that we must begin to significantly reduce the use of
MTBE in gasoline as quickly as possible, without sacrificing the
gains we've made in achieving cleaner air.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies used MTBE before the Clean Air Act required
oxygenates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, clean octane,'' said Jason Grumet, executive
director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management. ``MTBE is low toxicity and high exposure,'' but is ``a
pesky molecule,'' said Grumet, whose organization comprises the air
pollution commissioners of the six New England states, plus New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress required oxygenates, oil companies turned to MTBE
for 85 percent of their needs. Ethanol or its derivative, ETBE,
which stands for Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, make up most of the
rest. The study to be released Tuesday calls for further study of
those ingredients, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner said that she would like to preserve ``the important
role of renewable fuels like ethanol.'' But experts said that
ethanol production, which is mostly from corn, is far too small to
replace MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol producers have strong political support, including
presidential candidates who want to do well in the farm belt,
including in the important primary state of Iowa.

<P>
   When oxygenates were first required by Congress, in 1990,
proponents said that putting oxygen into the liquid fuel would
insure that engines produced more carbon dioxide, and less carbon
monoxide. In the intervening years, most cities have reduced their
carbon monoxide problems, though, and a study by the National
Academy of Science released in May found that neither Ethanol nor
MTBE make much difference in controlling the bigger air pollution
problem from cars _ ground-level ozone, or smog.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey recently won permission from the EPA to stop using
extra MTBE in gasoline in wintertime, because it had solved its
winter carbon monoxide problem, according to Peter K. Page, a
spokesman for the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection.
People complain about the smell of MTBE at the pump, he said, and
``the complaints seemed to correlate with the introduction of
wintertime gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   The winter-time gas had been 2.7 percent oxygen, by weight; the
summertime standards, which the state continues to use, is 2
percent oxygen by weight. Asked about EPA support for dropping the
mandate, Page said, ``That's fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Jennifer K. Post, a spokeswoman for the Department
of Environmental Conservation, said, ``We like it but obviously we
have concerns about it. It's a balancing act.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither New York nor Connecticut has sought to drop MTBE. Maine
has, though, because of concerns about water.
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated gasoline is required to be sold in all or part of
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA panel and Ms. Browner said they do not want MTBE
replaced by toxic components.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything is going to be introduced that replaces MTBE, we
want it to be researched, so we don't get the kind of surprises ...
that we got with MTBE,'' said Page, of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that hardly anything in gasoline was desirable.
``Some day people will look at us driving gasoline-powered cars the
way we look at our ancestors throwing chamber pots out the
window,'' Page said.

   KASHMIR: INDIA SAYS INVADERS LEFT
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi _ The Indian military said it had pushed the last
Pakistan-based forces from Indian-held territory in Kashmir. Most
infiltrators had withdrawn earlier this month after Pakistan's
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, had called on them to do so, but
Indian officials said a few pockets of fighters had remained close
to the so-called Line of Control, which divides the portions of
Kashmir that are held by India and Pakistan.

   INDONESIA: VOTE RESULTS DELAYED, AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta _ In what one election official called ``a very unfunny
political joke,'' an announcement of the final results of the June
7 general election was postponed once more when representatives of
losing parties refused to endorse the count. A supervisory
committee will now review the results and officials said the delay
could set back Indonesia's timetable for naming a new president by
the end of the year. &QL;

   INDONESIA: MILITARY ACCUSED IN SUMATRA
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta _ As violence continued in Aceh, on Sumatran, human

confirming the number, said the dead were guerrillas killed in an
early morning attack on a rebel base. &QL;

   Buenos Aires _ President Carlos Saul Menem will run for
president in 2003 even if it means running in a party primary this
year against Eduardo Duhalde, the governing Justicialist party
candidate, Menem's chief of staff said. The comments by Alberto
Kohan came as Duhalde is struggling to recover from slipping polls.
Menem is prohibited under the Constitution from running for a third

   Madrid _ The Socialist Party chose Joaquin Almunia, 51, the

due by next year. He replaces Jose Borrell, who resigned in May as
the candidate, a year after his upset defeat of Almunia in party
primaries prompted furious infighting. Polls show the Socialists

 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two congressional investigations, launched from
different starting points, are examining Citibank and the
confidential world of private banking, a growing and highly
lucrative service.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations, led by lawmakers who rarely find common
cause, are examining how Citibank _ and a handful of other
institutions _ handle the private accounts of foreign officials and
their relatives. The investigations are likely to result in the
closest scrutiny yet by Congress of private banking.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations are led by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., a
conservative, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Burton is looking at allegations of Chinese involvement in the
financing of the 1996 American election campaign, including
$300,000 in Chinese government money for the Democratic Party that
was wired from Citibank's Hong Kong branch.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, aides say, wants to know how half a dozen American banks
managed sensitive foreign accounts, including Citibank's work for
powerful families in Asia, Africa and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank, a unit of Citigroup Inc., entered the private-banking
business in the 1970s, taking some business away from the highly
secretive Swiss banks. Citibank is a leader in global finance, and
while its private bank is relatively small, it has attracted elite
clients.
</P>
<P>
   But some customers have come under intense law enforcement
scrutiny, and so too has the private bank.
</P>
<P>
   First came Raul Salinas de Gortari, who is the brother of
Mexico's former president and who is currently in jail in Mexico.
Raul Salinas secreted millions in a Citibank account, money that
investigators suspect came from illicit activities.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the husband of Pakistan's former prime minister, who
is also in jail for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   More recently there was Liu Chaoying, the daughter of China's
former top military official and the reported paymaster for
$300,000 in Chinese military money intended for the Democratic
Party in 1996, according to testimony from a participant in the
payment.
</P>
<P>
   The Salinas investigation has caused Citibank to tighten its
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Salinas episode, the bank's policy on accepting
public figures as customers has toughened,'' said Tom Lahiff, a
vice president and lawyer for Citibank. ``Public figures are not a
target market,'' he said, adding that public figures who do become
clients are reviewed annually by top executives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Citibank Private Bank accepted Salinas as a client and
then helped him move tens of millions of dollars out of Mexico.
Other banks refused to do business with the Salinas family but
Citibank, then the only American bank licensed in Mexico, opened
the account with what investigators later found was scant review.
</P>
<P>
   That case prompted a federal criminal investigation of Citibank.
No charges have been brought against Citibank and the bank denies
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators and federal bank regulators,
however, are continuing to investigate Citibank's handling of other
politically prominent foreign clients, examining whether Citibank
has been more concerned with protecting the clients than
cooperating with inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Burton, chairman of the House committee on government
reform, complained in a letter to Citibank about ``undue delays''
and a ``seeming lack of compliance'' with a committee subpoena for
records on the $300,000 wired to a Democratic fund-raiser. Bank
records list the sender as Ms. Liu, a Chinese military officer and
aerospace executive whose father was then China's senior military
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been quite responsive to the committee in a short time
frame,'' Lahiff said. ``We sent an additional document today and by
the end of the week we will have given them everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu's Citibank transfer came a few days after the head of
Chinese military intelligence told Ms. Liu and the fund-raiser,
Johnny Chung, that he would soon have Ms. Liu forward $300,000 to
Chung to support President Clinton and the Democratic Party,
according to Chung's testimony last May before Burton's committee.
Chung pleaded guilty to campaign-related charges, and was sentenced
to probation after cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter last week, Burton also questioned the lack of
authorized signatures for Citibank accounts held by the People's
Bank of China, the country's central bank. Last year federal bank
regulators had similar questions about these accounts as they tried
to trace tens of millions of dollars from the central bank to an
account at Citibank Private Bank that was controlled by the
daughter of one of the Communist Party's old guard, government
documents show. The woman is the sister-in-law of Ms. Liu and a
former official at a small California bank that served the Chinese
business community.
</P>
<P>
   Lahiff said the incomplete documentation stemmed from banking
laws, common in some countries, including China, that ``prohibit
our production of certain information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, where Levin is the ranking Democrat, are looking at
Citibank from a different angle, asking whether offshore private
banks, in their desire to offer clients extra confidentiality, may
leave themselves vulnerable to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   A primary focus of the Senate panel is how Citibank Private Bank
handled accounts for top foreign officials and their relatives, and
whether advising foreign leaders about their investments affects
Citibank's business dealings with those foreign countries,
committee aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Lahiff said Citibank had turned over ``a lot of documents'' to
the Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Senate inquiry intensified after a General Accounting Office
report last December found that executives at Citibank Private Bank
ignored one of the bank's own safeguards in helping to move up to
$100 million for Raul Salinas while his brother, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, was president of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lahiff said the GAO report contained ``a lot of errors,'' but he
declined to specify them.
</P>
<P>
   Another case under review by the Senate committee, aides said,
involves Pakistan's corruption investigation of Benazir Bhutto, the
former prime minister of Pakistan, and her husband, Asif Ali
Zadari. The two were convicted of corruption earlier this year in
Islamabad, Pakistan. Documents show that Citibank Private Bank in
Geneva handled tens of millions of dollars for Zadari.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank was not cited for any wrongdoing and the corrupt
proceeds at issue in the trial did not involve Citibank, one lawyer
familiar with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Private banking, a Citibank official testified in 1994, is a
``white-gloved kind of environment'' for wealthy clients who
``usually come from countries that are in turmoil of some sort''
and seek to shelter their money.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of all these investigations lies a banking practice
termed ``know your customer.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a GAO report last year on money laundering and
offshore private banking, federal banking regulators ``consider
`know your customer' policies one of the most important components
of an institution's measures for understanding whom it is doing
business with, recognizing unusual transactions and detecting
illegal or suspicious activities.''
</P>
<P>
   When American bank regulators investigated possible money
laundering involving the People's Bank of China and Ms. Liu's
sister-in-law at the California bank, they raised questions about
whether some American banks knew enough about their customers,
according to a lengthy report last year by the comptroller of the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the People's Bank of China flowed through a number of
American financial institutions, but the comptroller pushed for
more information about the Citibank accounts because that bank
handled a significant part of the total. But Citibank gave the same
explanation offered by Lahiff: Chinese law prohibited disclosure of
much information.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the laws in some other countries, like Switzerland,
American regulations do not require banks to ``know their
customer'' __ but most banks do. Still, there remains the question
of whether pushing too hard for more disclosure will scare
customers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma becomes: How far down the line do you push the
customer?'' said Peter Sperling, a former Citibank executive who
helped set up Citibank's private international bank in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   According to one GAO report, ``Citibank made no attempt to
investigate Salinas' background before accepting him'' as a
customer in 1992. Salinas, who was referred to the bank by a
prominent Mexican businessman, was arrested in 1995, and his
Citibank accounts were later closed.
</P>
<P>
   For prosecutors to show that a bank violated money-laundering
statutes, they have to prove that the money was derived from an
unlawful source and that the bank knew or should have known this.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal inquiry into the tens of millions of dollars in
transfers by China's central bank in the mid-1990s _ like the
inquiry into Citibank's handling of Salinas' wealth _ has produced
no charges.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the China trail is cold or incomplete. But Burton
continues to press the matter beyond where federal investigators
have gone.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to trace the $300,000 that Ms. Liu wired to Chung,
a small fraction of which wound up with the Democratic National
Committee. A select House committee concluded the payment was an
attempt by Ms. Liu to ``better her position in the United States to
acquire computer, missile and satellite technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's next stop will be Ms. Liu's account at Citibank Private
Bank in Hong Kong.

EDITORIAL: A SPECIAL AMERICAN TAKES PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, July 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cycling world venerates the Tour de France, a race that
generally covers about 2,500 miles, including a climb through
mountains that makes this one of the most challenging events in all
of sport. Most cyclists live to win even a single segment, or
``stage,'' of the tour. But this year an American wearing the
colors of the United States Postal Service led for 14 of the 20
stages and cruised into Paris more than seven minutes ahead of his
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong is only the second American to win the race. His
performance would have been remarkable in any case, but seems
miraculous given that he was diagnosed just three years ago with an
aggressive form of testicular cancer that had reached his abdomen,
lungs and brain. He sat out 1997 after surgery and chemotherapy.
But the cycling world treated him like a pariah when he returned to
competition. No team seemed to want him _ until the Postal Service
picked him up.
</P>
<P>
   The French press expected him to be a non-factor and reacted
with suspicion when the former cancer patient surged to the front
of the pack, suggesting that he was using performance-enhancing
drugs. In actuality he was using an ordinary cortisone cream to
treat saddle sores, which produced legal trace amounts of the drug
in his urine.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed again and again about how he could perform at such
a high level so soon after so grave an illness, the 27-year-old
Texan said: ``You have to believe in yourself. You have to fight.
You have to hold the line.'' Few champions have applied those words
more vividly in sports, and in their lives.

EDITORIAL: WHEN STOCK MARKETS GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financial world is changing rapidly, with advances in
technology making it much easier for competitors to challenge
established stock markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and
NASDAQ. It is in part because those markets need money to invest in
new technology to meet that competition that both of them are now
planning to sell shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Before those plans are allowed to proceed, however, it is
important that the Securities and Exchange Commission sort out how
the changes in the way stock markets operate and compete with each
other are starting to affect their self-regulatory roles.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the principal markets dominated trading in the
stocks that were listed on them _ and they were responsible for
policing that trading and the conduct of the brokerage firms that
placed the trades. The fees the stock markets got for executing
trades subsidized their regulatory work.
</P>
<P>
   But as more and more competition arrives from electronic markets
for executing trades, there are two threats. One is that there will
be a multiplicity of self-regulatory organizations _ one for each
competing stock market. Some of them will be underfunded and weak,
and there will be unnecessary duplication.
</P>
<P>
   The other threat is that the new stock markets will find ways to
avoid much or all of the cost of such regulation, giving them a
competitive advantage over the existing markets, which will be
tempted to cut costs by cutting regulatory corners.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC must deal with those threats before it approves plans
for either NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange to sell shares to
investors. One idea it should consider is a separation of
functions, with self-regulatory organizations no longer part of
stock markets. Such a separation is part of the NASDAQ plan, but
not of the stock exchange's.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it would probably be best to separate the
self-regulatory operations and then combine those of NASDAQ and the
Big Board, both to promote efficiency and to assure adequate
funding. In any case, it is up to the SEC to assure that
competition for stock trades does not endanger the continued
protection of investors.

ARMSTRONG'S ENCOURAGEMENT INSPIRES YOUNG COMPANION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Weak from chemotherapy and dozing on
pillows, Kelly Davidson nearly missed the greeting her friend Lance
Armstrong shouted to the cameras as he whirred through the final
stretch of the Tour de France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old girl's fever was nearly 103 degrees. Her worried
parents were already preparing to take her back to Cook Children's
Medical Center from her great-grandmother's place at Possum Kingdom
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he (Armstrong) was finishing, I was packing a suitcase,''
Kelly's mother, Jamie Davidson, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say hello to Kelly Davidson in Fort Worth,'' called
out Armstrong, a 27-year-old bicycling superstar from Austin,
Texas. ``We've been thinking about you. Stay strong!''
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France champion finished treatment for testicular
cancer just two years ago. By the time Armstrong's cancer was
diagnosed, it had spread to his lungs and his brain. He had several
operations and chemotherapy before he was declared cancer-free in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon in the hospital, the memory of Lance's greeting
brought a smile to Kelly's face.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was 8 when doctors diagnosed her illness as a rare form
of cancer called neuroblastoma. In the years since, she has had
surgery, chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant. Partway through
yet another chemotherapy treatment, Kelly is weak. She has
virtually no white cells to fight off infection.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she was mostly quiet, holding a stuffed animal that
accompanies her to every medical treatment and adding just a word
here and there as her parents talked about her close bond with
Armstrong and his wife, Kristin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks into the hospital, and she lights up,'' Jamie
Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly met Armstrong in 1997 when he was signing autographs at a
sub shop in Austin where the Davidsons lived. Kelly and her mother,
returning from one of many doctor's appointments, decided to stop
by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had him sign a poster for us,'' Jamie Davidson said. ``She
didn't have any hair, and he didn't have any hair. And there was a
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, they learned, Armstrong tracked her down by calling the
local children's hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `There is a little bald-headed girl who came to one
of my autograph signings. I need to know her name,' '' Jamie
Davidson recounted.
</P>
<P>
   On a chain around her neck Monday, Kelly wore the ring Armstrong
sent after learning of Kelly's relapse last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bicyclist, in Europe when he heard the news, asked his wife
to deliver the ring and other gifts from Austin to the Fort Worth
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent this ring that he wore through his own chemotherapy
and said it had special powers,'' Kelly's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Christmas, Armstrong visited the unit, sporting a
Santa Claus hat.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's sports performance inspires Kelly in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he did most people would consider is
impossible,'' said Dr. Jeff Murray, one of Kelly's physicians, who
used to bicycle competitively.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is inspired by his performance as an athlete. She is
inspired by his being a very normal person besides being a
superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her cancer was diagnosed, Kelly was an occasional bike
rider, sometimes making the trip up to school. But she started
getting too tired for the trek, Kelly's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, her fatigue and stomach pains only worsened, Kelly's
father, John, said. At first, physicians said the problem might be
the flu. Or maybe asthma.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, Kelly's parents learned that a 15-centimeter tumor
was sitting on one of their daughter's kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroblastoma can spread anywhere in the body. By the time it
was diagnosed in Kelly, it had spread into her abdominal area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told her she had a tumor on Wednesday, and she was in
surgery at 9 a.m. the next morning,'' Jamie Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Kelly has enjoyed one year of respite; her
cancer went into remission from mid-1997 to mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then late last year, Kelly had a bone-marrow transplant at Cook
Children's.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her daughter's prognosis, Jamie Davidson responded
simply, ``We're fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   And Armstrong, she said, is ``proof that everyone gets a second
chance and you can be better than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives kids hope.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ For decades, the hard part for drug agents stalking
Florida's marijuana growers was finding their crop. The growers
weave their plants among corn stalks and even tomato vines to foil
aerial searches. In swamps, growers make berms out of muck and
chicken wire and plant their crop, leaving fat, black water
moccasins to stand guard.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden in Florida's lush landscape, the camouflaged marijuana
plants often foiled the small army of law officers, helicopters and
drug-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new head of the state's Office of Drug Control hopes to
kill Florida's lucrative marijuana business in the very ground in
which it thrives, by someday dusting suspected areas with a
marijuana-eating, soil-borne fungus called Fusarium oxysporum.
</P>
<P>
   It is a plan that has some politicians and Florida drug
enforcement officials excited, and some environmentalists worried.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, a bioherbicide engineered specifically to attack
plants like marijuana, is otherwise harmless, said the Montana
company, Ag/Bio Con., that developed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it safe, and does it work?'' asked Jim McDonough, who was
hired by Gov. Jeb Bush earlier this year to head Florida's Office
of Drug Control. ``I've heard some of the top scientists in the
country say `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   But McDonough, who served as director of strategy for Barry
McCaffrey, the White House drug czar, said the fungus will not be
used here until it is tested in rigidly controlled conditions at a
Florida test site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with science, you deal with the cost of
advancing and what is the cost of not advancing,'' said McDonough,
who pointed out that 47 percent of all marijuana seized in the
United States is taken here _ much of it home-grown. Most years,
drug agents destroy more than 100,000 plants, and one year _ in
1992 _ they destroyed more than 240,000 plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With prudence and with care, make your choices,'' he said.
``We'd be no place if we put our head in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said he has not yet presented the plan to the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida has seen its environment ravaged by supposedly
harmless plants that thrived so well in a damp, hot climate that
they overwhelmed indigenous plants. So some environmentalists say
introducing the fungus is risky, that it could mutate and cause
disease, not only in wild plants but in crops as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally do not like the idea of messing with Mother
Nature,'' said Bill Graves, senior biologist at the University of
Florida Research Center in Homestead. ``I believe that if this
fungus is unleashed for this kind of problem, its going to create
its own problems. If it isn't executed effectively, it's going to
target and kill rare and endangered plants and I feel that this can
lead to a much bigger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   David Struhs, secretary of the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection, spelled out the dangers in a letter to
McDonough in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusarium species,'' he wrote, ``are capable of evolving
rapidly. Mutagenicity is by far the most disturbing factor in
attempting to use a Fusarium species as a bioherbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult, if not impossible,'' he wrote, ``to control
the spread of Fusarium species.''
</P>
<P>
   The mutated fungi can cause disease in a large number of crops,
including tomatoes, peppers, flowers, corn and vine crops, he
wrote, and are ``normally considered a threat to farmers as a pest,
rather than as a pesticide. Fusarium species are more active in
warm soils and can stay resident in the soil for years. Their
longevity and enhanced activity under Florida conditions are of
concern, as this could lead to an increased risk of mutagenicity.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means, say environmentalists, is that living things
behave differently in Florida than almost anywhere else in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, I am very supportive of using biological agents
against narcotic plants,'' said Raghavan Charudattan, professor of
plant pathology and weed science at the University of Florida, but
``this needs to be researched well or it could lead to great
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials have agreed to quarantine testing of the fungus
_ at a facility outside Gainesville usually used for, among other
things, studying citrus canker, a catastrophic plant disease that
has ruined whole orchards _ and for now any implementation of the
fungus is probably years away.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonough has the back of some powerful allies, including
U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum, a Republican from Longwood. McDonough is
planning to try to obtain part of a $23-million congressional
allocation for research in eradicating plants like the poppy, used
in heroin, and having an ally like McCollum could be very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, angry farmers have recently accused the United States
of using a soil fungus to destroy coca in the Upper Huallaga
Valley, saying that the fungus has spread to banana, yucca,
tangerine and other food crops, according to The Miami Herald.
American officials, while acknowledging in June that they had spent
$14 million on research to develop such biological agents against
poppy, coca and marijuana, denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Florida, history has taught scientists to be cautious of
introducing any foreign, living thing into the environment. While
pythons as long as pickup trucks have occasionally been found under
houses in South Florida, most of the problems have been with
vegetable matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu, a Chinese vine that has grown rampant in the South since
its introduction in the 1920s to thwart soil erosion, has swallowed
houses and acres of roadside in Florida, growing a foot a day.
Melaleuca trees, planted decades ago to help drain the Everglades
because they suck up so much water, has infested hundreds of
thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brooks, assistant director of the state Department of
Environmental Protection's Division of Water Resources, said the
difference between those plants and the fungus is that the state
has learned to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes made in the past,'' Brooks said, ``make sure proper
precautions are being taken. It's been agreed that any testing
needed to be done in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not tested,'' he said of the infamous plants.

   SEC CHIEF SAYS MARKETS MUST MAINTAIN REGULATION
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top stock-market regulator warned the New York
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ market that any proposal to convert
themselves to for-profit public companies must adequately provide
for self-regulation that is ``zealous, adequately funded, and
imbued with the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the heads of the two markets, Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, also said the
two bodies must make sure that the views of the members and the
public are reflected on the corporate boards they form.
</P>
<P>
   NTL EXPANDS BRITISH CABLE HOLDINGS
</P>
<P>
   NTL, a telecommunications company, moved to become the biggest
cable television concern in Britain with a $13 billion deal to buy
the consumer divisions of Cable and Wireless Communications. The
proposed acquisition received financial backing from France
Telecom, led by Michel Bon, and immediately increased speculation
about further consolidation in Britain, where telephone, Internet
and television are quickly converging.
</P>
<P>
   $60 MILLION FINE FOR BANKERS TRUST
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, which pleaded guilty earlier this year to
criminal charges that it had illegally diverted unclaimed money
from its customers into the bank's accounts, was sentenced in
federal court to pay a $60 million fine to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOLOGY LEADS MARKET LOWER
</P>
<P>
   Stocks moved broadly lower as concerns about the sudden drop in
the dollar and a possible future increase in interest rates
provided an excuse to take profits. Big technology stocks and
Internet issues led the main market gauges lower. The NASDAQ
composite index fell 73.21 points, or 2.7 percent, to 2,619.19. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.80 points, to 10,863.16. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 9.18 points, to 1,347.76.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell for a fourth session as record home resales and
more than $22.5 billion of expected debt offerings reduced demand
for Treasuries. The yield on the 30-year issue rose to 6.03 percent
from 6.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   TEXACO AND ARCO BEAT FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Texaco said that its second-quarter earnings fell 15 percent as
profits on gasoline sales plunged. At the same time, though, rising
pump prices in California made Arco the only major U.S. oil company
to have higher earnings in the period, up 37 percent. The results
of both companies beat analysts' expectations. Shares of Texaco
fell $1.50, to $60.875, while Arco fell $1.8125, to $87.625.
</P>
<P>
   HOME RESALES HIT RECORD IN JUNE
</P>
<P>
   Sales of existing homes soared to a record rate in June as
buyers rushed to take advantage of low mortgage rates, the National
Association of Realtors said. Existing home sales rose 10.6
percent, to an annualized rate of 5.53 million units, up from 5
million units in May.
</P>
<P>
   DAEWOO GROUP RECEIVES NEW LOANS
</P>
<P>
   Creditors of Daewoo Group released new loans to South Korea's
second-largest conglomerate, and the central bank said it was ready
to support financial markets in an attempt to avert the nation's
biggest bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN EXPRESS PROFIT RISES 12 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   American Express said that its second-quarter profit rose 12
percent, above expectations, as consumers spent more with its
signature green charge cards and invested more with its financial
planners.
</P>
<P>
   GTE EARNINGS MATCH EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   GTE, the phone company that is set to be acquired by Bell
Atlantic, said that its second-quarter earnings rose 15 percent on
sales of data, Internet and wireless services. The results matched
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS INSTRUMENTS TO BUY UNITRODE
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments agreed to acquire Unitrode, a maker of
semiconductors for managing battery life in portable electronics,
for $1.2 billion in stock.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last day of the last Checker Cab in New York
should have been full of nostalgia and romance, the storied
retirement of a much-loved icon integral to the city's lore and its
lure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was filled with hassles.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the gnawing pain in Earl Johnson's left knee, a
bout of gout that made it wrenching to fold his 6-foot-1 frame into
the driver's seat of the 1978 classic, and even more agonizing to
get out. Then, there was the awkward moment, after Johnson stopped
abruptly in front of a Jamaican restaurant, when his fare _ a woman
late for work _ followed him inside to find out what he was doing
(every cab driver has his favorite pit stops).
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps inevitably, there were the special hassles that
come with owning a rolling New York City institution at the end of
its era. Having decided that the cab had become too expensive to
fix to the city's standards, Johnson spent the day juggling
interviews so that each journalist had a solo ride-along, artfully
avoiding questions about how much money he had made in the Checker
_ or might make selling it _ and even having one of the
photographers in the caravan following him through Central Park get
stopped by the police for a broken brake light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing so much money today,'' Johnson, 61, complained as
he declined a fare for fear of missing yet another appointment with
the press. ``I'm willing to go along with everybody, but I am just
one person.''
</P>
<P>
   These were, of course, the low points. There were lovely
moments, too.
</P>
<P>
   The fares who shared poignant childhood memories. The drivers
who leaned out of their windows to shout good luck and God bless.
The comrade cabbie who stopped at three successive stoplights to
take her own snapshots of history.
</P>
<P>
   And two hours with Roberta Horton and James Donnelly, social
workers who rode in Johnson's Checker to their wedding and
celebrated their second anniversary Monday by reliving the moment
in the back of the cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Checker is the ultimate urban luxury,'' Ms. Horton, 47,
said as she held her beloved's hand. ``It's such a grand car. It's
a vehicle that belongs to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxi and Limousine Commission says Johnson's Checker, which
is on its third engine and nearing 1 million miles on the odometer,
needs a new chassis. Johnson's mechanic says that would cost $6,000
or more. Johnson says the car is fine and the commission's
standards are too strict, but that it seems like the time to fold
up his jump seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for handouts. I'm finished,'' he said Monday
as he limped around, shaking hands and posing for pictures. ``I'm
ready. Ready, ready, ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities still have Checker Cabs, the bulbous vehicles
reminiscent of the 1920s, when they were first manufactured in
Kalamazoo, Mich. There are Checkers around the city that are no
longer cabs, painted pink or purple or maybe checkered all over.
There are companies called Checker Cab, even if their cars are
Dodges and Fords.
</P>
<P>
   But as of Tuesday morning, pedestrians can no longer hail the
ultimate symbol of New York City streets on New York City streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's retiring,'' a concierge told a doorman at The Mark hotel,
gesturing and gawking at Johnson and his cab as they dropped off
Ms. Horton and Donnelly for their anniversary lunch. ``I think
that's him. This is the last one. He's been in the news for like
three days now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has a tuft of white hair above his forehead and a
few gray whiskers in his beard, started driving a Checker in 1973,
when some 5,000 of the classic cars made up almost half of New
York's yellow taxi fleet. Jamaica-born, he had been in this country
for a dozen years, and started driving a cab after dreams of
opening a restaurant fell apart for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The riding public likes the Checker and it lasts longer,'' he
said, though the first car lasted only five years before it was
felled by a mechanical problem. ``There's more room for myself and
the passengers. You're sitting up above all the other cabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, after 26 years behind the historic wheel, he has learned
that the police rarely stop Checkers, which sits high above the
traffic, with enough leg room in the back for a couple of
pro-basketball player, plus a pair of adorable little jump seats.
Doormen at fancy hotels pull them up to the front of cab lines. And
while the fare on the meter is exactly the same as in any other
cab, the tips tend to be better.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as on most mornings, Johnson left his home in the
Rosedale section of Queens at about 7 a.m. and went to John F.
Kennedy Airport. He picked up a passenger at Delta and took him to
midtown Manhattan, which was convenient, because he had to meet a
television crew on the East Side for a live interview.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took a woman across town to Times Square, whereupon he
found a trio of gentlemen heading to a show for mens clothiers at
Pier 94 on the West Side, after which he picked up Tina Landau, a
writer and director who was heading downtown to the Papp Public
Theater near Astor Place.
</P>
<P>
   It started out well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a girl growing up in New York, we used to look for
them purposely _ they were the cab,'' Ms. Landau said as she
stepped into the cab. ``I saw you coming, and I almost didn't get
in. I haven't seen one of these in so long, I thought, is this
real?''
</P>
<P>
   But then Johnson pulled over on Ninth Avenue at Jam's Jamaica
Restaurant and said he would be back in a minute. After a minute,
Ms. Landau went inside to check. She came back quickly, Johnson on
her heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you it's a second, you just wait a second,'' the driver
snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get in a cab to stop midway,'' Ms. Landau retorted.
``I could call the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Empty threats for a man headed for retirement, scheduled to be
feted by the taxi commission next week.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By summer's end, Johnson plans to be back in his native Montego
Bay, where he and his wife run a bed and breakfast called Grace
Villa.
</P>
<P>
   The Checker, which originally cost about $9,000, will probably
stay behind. A German museum has made inquiries, but Johnson wants
the car he nicknamed Janie after a long-ago sweetheart to remain in
the United States, preferably New York. He is talking to Sotheby's,
and dreaming of numbers with lots of zeroes. As for taxi medallion
111 _ the equivalent of a permit to operate a cab in New York _
Johnson plans to lease it and is counting on the retirement income
of about $1,400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   What he will keep are the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at her Fifth Avenue
apartment (he didn't even recognize her at first) and taking her to
Elizabeth Arden. Walter Cronkite riding for a dozen blocks down
Broadway (``I was kind of excited to look up and see the same guy I
see on the TV.''). Getting yanked out of a taxi line a couple of
years ago at the Pierre hotel to drive Muhammad Ali down to the
Citicorp building (``I just said, `Hi, champ.''').
</P>
<P>
   There was the $500 fare to Boston, and the $700 trip to upstate
Ithaca _ a 225 miles trip _ when a business man with a pending deal
could not get a flight out of Kennedy airport because of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young and strong and didn't think about anything,''
Johnson said, laughing the laugh of a man now much wiser and older.
``If there was 10 feet of snow it didn't mean anything. Now I'm
scared to go from here to Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also dozens of weddings and sight-seeing tours,
actors whose names he can never remember and appearances _ for the
Checker, not the driver _ in movies he never saw. And, once, a $20
tip on a $7 fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got out of one cab and got into my cab because that guy
didn't know where he was going,'' Johnson said of the banker in a
rush to go from a midtown hotel to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Monday there were no celebrities except Johnson himself, who
first came to public attention in 1993, when there were only 10
Checkers left in New York. He has been featured in numerous
articles since then, and it is no accident that he outlasted Johann
Struna, the second-to-last Checker cabbie, who retired in December
because he, too, could not afford the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson smiled for the tourists from Cleveland, shook hands
with the teacher out for a walk on the Upper West Side and waved
happily to numerous fellow drivers beeping their well-wishes as he
passed.
</P>
<P>
   It was all he could do to get to Queens by mid-afternoon to
refill a prescription for his aching knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even move from the seat, it's all swollen,'' he said.
``The only reason why I'm out here now is because it's my last
day.''

 &HT;    Season over for Lopez, Perez
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves, who had problems, now have a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a related frenzy of personnel moves Monday, catcher Javy
Lopez will undergo season-ending surgery within the week to repair
a torn anterior cruciate ligament on his right knee, just 12 days
after being activated.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Odalis Perez's season has ended, the left-hander to
undergo surgery for a partial tear of the ulnar ligament in his
left elbow. Right fielder Brian Jordan will miss all of the
Milwaukee series and perhaps more after being diagnosed with a
pinched nerve in his neck that was causing numbness in his right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up the catching situation, the Braves acquired San
Diego's (and ex-Brave) Greg Myers for Class A pitching prospect
Doug Dent.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez had been awaiting the arrival of general manager John
Schuerholz, who was still in transit from Cooperstown, N.Y., before
finalizing a decision. An MRI and subsequent exam by team
orthopedist Joe Chandler determined that while the knee was not
injured further Saturday, it would not stand up to further play.
Lopez had been hitting .317 with 45 RBIs and 11 homers in 65 games.
He is expected to be fully ready for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've got is something very serious,'' said Lopez. ``If I
keep playing, it might affect me. The injury will take too long to
heal up or it will take surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez (4-6, 6.00) had suspected he had tendinitis and was
stunned by the news. His place in the rotation will be taken by
rookie Bruce Chen.

EDITORIAL: HIGH GRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been a rare grass year in parts of north-central
Wyoming, in the drainages east of the Bighorn Mountains. As one
rancher put it, ``you couldn't have dialed the rains in better.''
The rain fell, the grass grew, the sun came out, the grass cured,
and in the early weeks of July there was a kind of tonsorial fever
on the hayground watered by Piney Creek, Clear Creek and Prairie
Dog Creek _ men and women neatly scissoring the grass with
machine-driven sickle blades. The windrows, long lines of cut grass
drying in the sun, stood almost laughably high. If all the profits
of ranching lay in good grass instead of the vagaries of the cattle
market, these ranchers would have been rich, their prosperity
numbered in round bales, square bales and enormous loaves.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seemed to feel the abundance. At the Sheridan
Fairgrounds a ranch roping took place one Sunday morning, a
leisurely horseback competition based on the work cowboys do when
branding or doctoring cattle. Once a steer was roped, head and
heels, it became another rider's job to step off his horse and lay
the steer down and release the ropes. But this summer the yearling
steers were so fat that they had no flanks to lie down upon. They
lolled and bellowed and showed their great grass-fed bellies to the
small crowd in the grandstand, then trotted nimbly away to rejoin
the herd. Outside Sheridan, a band of riders on newly broken colts
rode through an uncut field of grass, the seed-heads brushing
against chaps and saddles and raising the sound of the wind. Riders
began to sneeze and the colts to fidget, not yet broken to the
sound of sneezing.
</P>
<P>
   Along every road, every path, a fringe of opulent grasses grew,
ligules shading into lacquered purple, blades into the blue of
dusk, awns into an almost roan-like coloration. In the waste
clearings, beside the more vertical species, grew foxtail barley _
supple, iridescent. Sagebrush rose along the fencelines in glaucous
thunderheads. South of Sheridan, near Ucross, the hayfields are
edged with sloughs, and in every uncut pasture, red-winged and
yellow-headed blackbirds hovered momentarily before settling onto
grass heads that dipped slowly beneath their weight. A buckskin
horse given liberty in one of the unmowed fields showed only his
back and ears, an island of contentment.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever there is haying there is also the abrupt
transfiguring of the landscape. From the time the dew dried in
midmorning till full dark, the windrowers moved across the fields,
following the curves of the creek bottoms and the sidehills, laying
the grass out in narrow rows like the isobars on a weather map. The
balers followed once the grass had dried, and for a few days birds
gathered on the tops of the round bales lying in the fields,
looking out over a terrain that had lost its softness. Then the
machines came again _ bale stackers for the small bales, farm
trucks and tractors with hay forks for the round bales. On nearly
every ranch, the hay was laid in stacks and rows where it would
serve as a windbreak, a levee, in more ways than one, against
winter, which suddenly seemed that much nearer once the fields were
bare.

   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge assistant football coaches
Craig Wall and Keith Borges will be paid this season even though
they aren't returning, creating a smaller staff and a hole in the
team's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Wall, CSUN's defensive coordinator, and Borges, the
running-backs coach, earn a combined $87,372 in annual salaries,
according to the CSUN personnel department. Together, Wall and
Borges will be paid about $30,000 during a season in which they
will not coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step would be for me to call (Wall and Borges) in and
discuss with them their role in the department,'' Northridge
Athletic Director Dick Dull said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall and Borges haven't been seen working in the football office
since mid-May. Several players said last week they didn't want them
to come back and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Interim head coach Jeff Kearin said the other five coaches from
former coach Ron Ponciano's staff are returning.
</P>
<P>
   With the team's first practice on Aug. 10 and the season opener
on Sept. 4 against Western Oregon, CSUN has just six full-time
coaches: Kearin, Foster Andersen (defensive coordinator), Bobby
Connelly (offensive line), Aaron Flowers (quarterbacks), Armando
Gonzalez (tight ends/wide receivers) and Terrance Johnson
(linebackers).
</P>
<P>
   The eight other teams in the Big Sky Conference average nine
coaches per staff. Montana, picked to win the Big Sky by coaches
and media, has 11 coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're a little behind,'' Kearin said last Friday in the
press conference announcing his hiring. ``(But) these guys have
been working pretty hard. A lot of the stuff is done. It's not
rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff was barred from the football office for 10
days in June and is trying to compact what would normally be three
months' work into two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working 20 days straight,'' Flowers said last week.
``It's all football from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said he was happy to promote Andersen, who coached the
Matadors' defensive backs last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between (Andersen) and Ron (Ponciano), they've been the heart
and soul of the defense the past couple years,'' Kearin said.
``Foster wants this team to do well and have some continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the staff is set, with Kearin also taking on the
title of offensive coordinator. But Andersen and Johnson aren't
enough to coach the defense, and Kearin said he plans to talk with
Dull today about hiring a defensive-line coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Names have been floating around,'' Kearin said. ``I even got a
call from Charlie White.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearin admits hiring White, the former Heisman Trophy winner at
USC and San Fernando High star, would be a luxury the school
doesn't seem to be able to afford.

EDITOR FORCED TO RESIGN IN DISPUTE OVER MARKETING OF MEDICAL
JOURNAL'S NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top editor of The New England Journal of Medicine is
resigning under pressure in a dispute with its owners, the
Massachusetts Medical Society, over the marketing of the journal's
prestigious name as part of an expanding publishing empire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, 66, will step down as editor on Sept. 1
and then begin a seven-month sabbatical until his contract expires
on March 31, he and Dr. Jack T. Evjy, the society's president, said
in interviews Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer and Evjy declined to provide specifics of the dispute
beyond saying it involved sharp differences in ``administrative and
publishing issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But other editors said the dispute reflects tensions generated
as the society, like other traditional nonprofit medical
organizations, seeks to generate more revenues to expand its
influence in an increasingly competitive and political world of
health care.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1812, the Boston-based journal has a circulation of
240,000 and is widely regarded as one of the world's most
rigorously edited scientific publications. In recent years, though,
the Massachusetts Medical Society has added other publications for
doctors and health newsletters aimed at the general public.
</P>
<P>
   The society also recently built a plush headquarters in suburban
Waltham and hired more staff to deal with health and political
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer resisted this trend. ``Does the society want to become
a business?'' Kassirer asked in his annual report last year. The
report described ``a perceptible change in the nature of internal
discussions about the Journal'' and criticized what it called
proposals for the society to ``brand'' the journal by using its
logo and name in creating new publications.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer has earned high praise for his stewardship as the
journal's editor-in-chief since 1991. Kassirer was credited with
appointing larger numbers of foreign scientists to the journal's
editorial board and attracting a larger number of papers from
foreign scientists.
</P>
<P>
   He also expanded the number of reviews and other features to
lessen its esoteric nature and broaden its appeal to practicing
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer said he ``expected to stay a longer time, but it is not
in the cards.'' His resignation had nothing to do with the content
of journal and that he never felt constrained in expressing his
opinion, he said, and ``the medical society never tried to
interfere.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer's departure was due to be announced Monday but was
reported by The Boston Globe in Monday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The forced resignation has caused several members of the
society's publications committee, charged with guarding the
integrity of the journal, to consider resigning in protest. One,
Dr. John T. Harrington, the dean of Tufts University School of
Medicine, said he resigned because the dispute and its resolution
``were not brought to the committee's attention until they were
presented as a fait accomplis'' at a meeting on July 14. Kassirer
was a Tufts faculty member before becoming editor.
</P>
<P>
   Another member, Dr. Leonard J. Morse of Worcester, said the
publications committee ``was told the matter was irreconcilable''
and ``the committee did not vote on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Evjy acknowledged that the society's membership and its
11-member committee on publications were excluded from the decision
not to renew Kassirer's contract. He said the dispute was handled
by another committee because it was an administrative and
management issue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Mayer, who works at the Dana Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston and who is an associate editor of the journal,
said that members of the staff had discussed resigning but chose
not to do so because they wanted the journal to keep running
without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``To resign en masse would have crippled the journal,'' Mayer
said, ``but the journal would then suffer because you can't
replace'' the editorial group quickly. Mayer also said that if he
was a member of the publications committee, he would have resigned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Staff members spoke of months of tense relations between the
editorial office and the society's headquarters. One editor who
spoke on condition his name not be used described the situation as
``a tinder box'' with fears that ``with one spark the journal could
go.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake are huge revenues generated by the journal's
publication of findings from largely taxpayer-supported research.
Although the Massachusetts Medical Society once published figures
on the journal's finances, it has refused to do so in recent years
as its profits have soared from $386,540 in 1979 to estimates of
more than $20 million each of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Evjy said he could not explain why the society refuses to
disclose the journal's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have experienced financial success,'' Evjy said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said ``The New England Journal of Medicine is the
ultimate cash cow'' and ``the journal built the society's glorious
new building'' in suburban Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   The building that Mayer described as ``posh,'' others called The
Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   In declining to state its cost, Evjy said ``This building is our
members' home'' and ``a symbol of strength, solidarity and
endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The society needed the building in part to house its
publications division which aims to provide ``the best medical
knowledge and information in an age where much misinformation and
disinformation,'' Evjy said. ``We cannot do it not on a grand
scale, but can on a quality scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer, like his predecessors, have fought the society's
desire to move the journal's editorial offices from a library on
the Harvard Medical School campus to the new building in Waltham
because it feared jeopardizing its editorial independence if its
staff worked there.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said that the editors had opposed a proposal that the
society had floated at one meeting to create spin-off journals to
publish many of the rejected papers.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors familiar with the dispute who declined to be named
contended that for the first time in recent history the society's
finances had gone into the red because it had overspent for the new
building and hired a larger administrative staff, in part for
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Although Evjy declined to provide figures, he said the
organization's finances were in the black. ``We are a good strong
organization,'' Evjy said.
</P>
<P>
   The journal's profits also help the society lobby in
Massachusetts and in the country for a variety of issues it
believes are for the benefit of patients. The society also supports
programs in continuing medical education and supports eight
scholarships for medical students, Evjy said.
</P>
<P>
   Evjy said the society expects to name an interim editor by Sept.
1 and is discussing the position with Dr. Marcia Angell, now the
journal's number two editor. Dr. Angell said she was discussing the
position but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The journal rejects the overwhelming majority of manuscripts
submitted to it. But the overwhelming majority of the rejected
manuscripts are published by other journals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the journal's main competitors, the Journal of the
American Medical Association, is also searching for a new top
editor. In January, Dr. George Lundberg was dismissed as editor for
timing publication of a survey on attitudes toward sex during the
impeachment hearings of President Clinton.

PHILIP MORRIS SPENDS HEAVILY BEHIND SCENES TO COURT ALBANY
LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its largely successful campaign to defeat anti-smoking
measures in Albany, the world's biggest cigarette maker has engaged
in a lavish behind-the-scenes effort to win favor in the New York
Legislature, spending tens of thousands of dollars in recent years
on gifts for lawmakers, according to internal company documents and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 115 current and former members in the 211-person
Legislature have accepted gifts from the company, Philip Morris,
ranging from meals at fine restaurants to seats at the men's final
of the U.S. Open tennis tournament to hotel reservations and
tickets for the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   The largess has not gone unnoticed among lawmakers, who last
approved a significant anti-smoking measure in 1993, even as
politicians elsewhere have taken more aggressive stances against
the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your kindness and generosity,'' Assemblyman
James Gary Pretlow, a Democrat from Westchester County, wrote to
the chief lobbyist for Philip Morris in 1996 after receiving
tickets worth $148 to an Alvin Ailey dance performance. ``Please do
not hesitate to call on me if I may be of any assistance to you.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is no secret that lobbyists in Albany use expense
accounts to garner support, the practice has largely escaped
scrutiny because state lawmakers have declined to require
disclosure of all gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But buried in the mounds of documents that Philip Morris has
submitted in lawsuits filed against tobacco companies are records
with itemized lobbying expenses from 1993 through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several lawmakers who accepted gifts acknowledged
that the records for those years reflect Philip Morris'
longstanding and continuing lobbying strategy. The lawmakers said
there was nothing untoward about such favors, many of which would
be illegal in some states and in Congress. Representatives of
Philip Morris declined to discuss the company's lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators of both major parties received the gifts: 85 or so
current members and an additional 30 members who have since left
office, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts and campaign contributions have helped make Philip
Morris one of the most influential corporations in Albany. The
company has been so adept at heading off new statewide smoking
restrictions that localities have moved on their own, including New
York City, which has banned smoking in most restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to determine the legality of many of the gifts
bestowed by Philip Morris because the legislative ethics rules are
murky and barely policed. Legislators are barred from accepting
gifts of more than $75 if they are intended as a reward or to
influence decisions. But such intent is difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Since the legislative ethics rules were approved in the late
1980s, no lawmaker has been punished for receiving illegal gifts,
said Nancy S. Davenport, counsel to the Legislative Ethics
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has resisted following the lead of Congress and
other states that have tightened gift restrictions. The House of
Representatives, for example, approved rules in 1995 that bar
members from accepting virtually all gifts, including meals from
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Philip Morris, K. Richmond Temple, said he would
not respond to questions about lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our participation in the political process is in full
compliance with applicable state and Federal laws,'' Temple said.
``Like many corporations, we participate in the hopes of getting
good government and fair government.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents indicate that Philip Morris lobbies just as
aggressively in other states, though details of its expenditures
elsewhere were not available.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several lawmakers in New York who frequently
received gifts said they did not influence official duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if there is a friendly relationship between a
lobbyist and a lawmaker, it is bound to have some positive effect
for the company,'' a former Senate majority leader Ralph J. Marino
said. ``But lawmakers generally do not vote based on the fact that
somebody bought them a meal or took them to the event.''

SUSPECT IN THREE YOSEMITE MURDERS ADMITS A FOURTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes 1st 3 grafs and graf that begins ``While Stayner has
not ....'')  (lb)

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A motel handyman who was dismissed as a suspect
in the deaths last February of three sightseers at Yosemite
National Park, but who is now the prime suspect in that case, has
confessed to the decapitation last week of a park naturalist, the
FBI said in an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman, Cary Stayner, 37, has also confessed to killing
the three sightseers, said a law-enforcement official who would
comment only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said in its affidavit that Stayner, who worked as a
janitor at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, has confessed to the
decapitation of Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, and has provided details
about the crime that only the killer could have known, according to
the affidavit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit made for another dramatic day in a prominent case
that has FBI officials publicly wondering whether Ms. Armstrong's
death could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence obtained after Ms. Armstrong's death, the FBI announced
Sunday, links Stayner to the deaths of the three Yosemite
sightseers whose disappearance from the Cedar Lodge in February set
off a massive search, national headlines and numerous arrests of
ex-convicts whom the FBI has called unofficial suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was arrested Saturday at a nudist resort near
Sacramento, and charged with one count of murder on Monday
afternoon in federal court in Sacramento. At his brief court
appearance, Stayner, a muscular, clean-cut man dressed in an orange
prison uniform, said nothing but nodded repeatedly as Judge Peter
Nowinski asked him if he understood the charge and read him his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other residents living near the Cedar Lodge, Stayner
was questioned at the time of the sightseers' disappearance. The
speculation is that he was dismissed as a suspect, at least in part
because authorities believed that the slayings could not have been
committed by one person, said a law-enforcement official who would
speak only on the condition of not being named.
</P>
<P>
   While Stayner has not yet been charged with the deaths of Carole
Sund, 42, her daughter Juli Sund, 15, and their friend Silvina
Pelosso, 16, the FBI said it now believes that he is most likely
the only person responsible for their deaths, said James Maddock,
the agency's special agent in charge of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's arrest, and the FBI's announcement regarding the other
deaths, has also prompted officials in Merced, the Sierra Nevada
town where Stayner lived until moving to El Portal in 1997, to
announce that they were re-examining the unsolved 1990 killing of
Stayner's uncle, Jerry Stayner, who was shot to death with his own
gun in what authorities had considered a botched burglary attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has refused to discuss details of the links among the
four slayings that it says Stayner committed, but The Modesto Bee,
quoting unidentified sources, reported Monday that incriminating
evidence was found in his room, and that Juli Sund's throat was
slashed almost to the point of beheading, like Ms. Armstrong's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carole Sund and Ms. Pelosso were found burnt beyond recognition
in the trunk of their charred rental car more than a month after
they disappeared. Juli Sund's body was found a few days after the
others, dumped off a little-traveled road midway between El Portal
and where the rental car had been left.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armstrong's body was found on Thursday, one day after she
was last seen near the small cabin where she lived with her
boyfriend and another roommate, both of whom were away at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Until then the FBI had maintained that it believed all the
people responsible for the Sund-Pelosso deaths were in custody,
though on unrelated charges. Numerous ex-convicts with ties to
either El Portal or Modesto, where Carole Sund's wallet was found
three days after the trio disappeared, have been held for months
for various offenses while officials have tried to gather enough
evidence to charge them.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner was questioned about Ms. Armstrong twice on Thursday, a
day after his sport utility vehicle was spotted near Ms.
Armstrong's small cabin about an hour after she was last seen
alive.
</P>
<P>
   He became a suspect after he disappeared from El Portal, where
he has rented a room at the restaurant adjacent to the motel for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   His family made national headlines when Stayner was 11 years old
and his younger brother, Steven, was kidnapped. Steven was held as
a prisoner by a convicted sexual offender for more than seven
years, until he escaped and went to the police after his abductor
brought home another kidnapped young boy. Steven died in 1989 in a
motorcycle crash.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing in his first murder case was scheduled for
Aug. 6 in federal court in Fresno, but John Balazs, an assistant
federal defender, said that the hearing will likely be postponed.

STRATEGIES STYMIED, UMPIRES' UNION SUES LEAGUES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With its resignation strategy encountering opposition from
within and a stonewalling response from without, the umpires' union
went to court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Umpires Association filed a lawsuit in United
States District Court in Philadelphia alleging that the
commissioner's office had improperly usurped the authority of the
National and American League offices and had created ``internal
political turmoil'' in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The union additionally asserted that the commissioner's office
and the American League had tried to coerce umpires into ousting
Richie Phillips, the union's chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most interestingly from a strategic standpoint, the
lawsuit asks the court to give the umpires a way out of their mass
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   With Major League Baseball indicating that it will soon accept
the resignations of all of the umpires who have not rescinded their
resignations, the union asked the court to declare that the umpires
have until the effective date of Sept. 2 ``to decide whether to
actually abandon their positions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the court were to grant that request, the umpires would have
until that date to decide if they really wanted to resign. If their
resignations were to be accepted now, they would have to to leave
their positions Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two umpires, 33 from the National League and 9 from the
American, have held to the letters of resignation that were
submitted to the league offices July 15, a move aimed at pressuring
Major League Baseball to open negotiations on a new labor contract.
Baseball officials have not responded to the letters but have hired
new umpires to replace those who are resigning.
</P>
<P>
   The AL hired 12 new umpires last week, effective Sept. 1, and
the NL hired 8. A Major League Baseball official said Monday that
the NL was hiring four or five more umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig said he had not seen the lawsuit but
would have no comment on it even after receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the union's suit, which was filed against the
leagues and not the commissioner's office, deals with a plan to
have all the umpires report directly to the commissioner's office,
altering the current structure under which they report to the
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The union alleges that Major League Baseball had wanted to
impose the plan this season but backed off when officials realized
they would have to negotiate it with the union because a labor
contract is in effect. Baseball officials, the lawsuit said,
``professed publicly to have halted the implementation of the plan,
but surreptitiously began its implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged, for instance, that Roberto DuPuy,
baseball's executive vice president for administration, sent a
memorandum Feb. 8 to the league presidents saying that umpiring
matters should be decided in consultation with Sandy Alderson,
executive vice president for baseball operations in the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, DuPuy wrote in the memo, ``is responsible for
coordinating the umpire program going forward, including the 1999
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit offers no specifics but does raise publicly for the
first time the behind-the-scenes fight over centralization of the
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Leagues and the League Presidents,'' the suit says, ``have
privately opposed the Commissioner's Office's attempts to assume
responsibility for umpires which has created internal confusion and
upheaval regarding the umpires and the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The internal turmoil, the suit went on, has resulted in
baseball's failure to initiate negotiations for an agreement to
replace the one that expires Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also refers to assorted other grievances umpires have
raised this year, including a dispute that began when Alderson
directed umpires to change the strike zone from that used in recent
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the suggestion that has been raised that the umpires'
mass resignation is a thinly veiled method of skirting the existing
contract's ban on striking, the union asks the court to declare
that the resignations are not a strike ``or, in the alternative, if
the resignations are tantamount to a strike, that the strike is, or
has become, a protected strike over serious unfair labor
practices.'' &QL;

CLINTONS' VACATION WILL INCLUDE FIVE DAYS NEAR THE FINGER LAKES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have added a second
New York stop to their summer vacation schedule: five days in the
state's Finger Lakes region, White House officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a race for U.S.
senator from New York, will spend seven days of vacation in the
state, and nine on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their time in the Finger Lakes _ in Skaneateles,
about 20 miles southwest of Syracuse _ the Clintons are planning a
weekend in East Hampton, N.Y., at the end of August, devoted both
to recreation and to fund-raising on behalf of the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's associates said Monday night that she had no
plans for campaign appearances during her stay in Skaneateles
(pronounced skany-AT-less). But a number of her advisers, concerned
about Republicans' criticism of Mrs. Clinton for considering a run
for office in a state where she has never lived, have been urging
her to spend at least some of her vacation in New York State, as
part of a continuing effort to establish a presence there.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are known for putting off vacation plans until the
last possible moment. An associate said they decided on this phase
of the vacation over the weekend. As of now, and Mrs. Clinton will
be on Martha's Vineyard _ their favored vacation spot _ from Aug.
19 through 27. They will go to East Hampton the weekend of Aug. 28
to take part in what has become an annual series of Democratic
National Committee fund-raisers there. They will then fly to the
Finger Lakes, where they will stay from Aug. 30 through Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has made a particular effort to spend time in
upstate New York, a part of the state that is more Republican and,
her advisers believe, less receptive to the notion of her
candidacy. She is to visit Ithaca and Elmira later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Mrs. Clinton said the First Family would stay at a
private home in Skaneateles. They declined to identify the owner of
the home.  &QL;

ON NIGHT MUSIC DIED, MANY TO BLAME FOR RAMPAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Let's begin with the ``how'' before we get to the
``why.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night at the former Griffiss Air Force Base, as what
seemed like an enjoyable but uneventful Woodstock '99 drew to a
close, 100,000 candles from a charity organization called Pax were
distributed to concertgoers to promote peace.
</P>
<P>
   As the Red Hot Chili Peppers performed, audience members used
the candles to start bonfires, stoking them with giant pieces of
the plywood perimeter fence, flammable trash in the area and even
their own clothing. Naked men and women danced around and jumped
through the flames, thinking that perhaps fire would be to this
year's Woodstock what mud was to the last two.
</P>
<P>
   Everything still could have ended without incident. But then the
festival violated a basic show-biz tenet and delivered a sloppy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   When the finale, a Jimi Hendrix tribute, began, concertgoers
actually stepped away from the bonfires to watch a video of the
guitarist playing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' at Woodstock '69.
They gasped as a virtual image of Hendrix appeared on stage and
then rose up into the sky. And then they looked around, confused,
when they realized that was it, the show was over. The special
guests rumored to be performing _ the Rolling Stones, Bruce
Springsteen, Prince _ never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if the show had ended as it had the night before, with
Metallica playing a boring set with three encores that slowly
dissipated the audience, the flames could have been extinguished by
the fire station on the base while the audience watched the stage.
Instead, not only did the music on the main stage stop but a
scheduled all-night rave was canceled by panicked promoters.
</P>
<P>
   So the crowd turned its attention back to its bonfires, tipping
giant speaker towers into the flames and setting tents ablaze. When
security fled and police officers had not yet arrived, the crowd
carried on: burning trucks, overturning trailers, smashing ATM's
and raiding concession stands and even a first-aid tent. The melee
carried over into the campground, where phone trailers were burned
and Ace Hardware trucks were smashed open, liberating countless
tents, sleeping bags and glow-in-the-dark sticks.
</P>
<P>
   As concertgoers marauded, the reason for the violence many kids
gave was not the show's ending, but the high price of concession
items, like the $4 bottles of water. ``I think they were asking for
it,'' said Randy Voytas, 26, a warehouse worker from Connecticut
who was carrying a South Vietnamese flag through the flames. ``They
were charging people so much money for everything. A 12-inch pizza
was $12. It wasn't Woodstock. It was Commercialstock.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems likely that even if Ogden Entertainment, the food
and beverage company that not only owns most of the concessions but
also owns Metropolitan Entertainment, the company that promoted the
concert, had charged lower prices, the melee still would have
occurred. Perhaps the best evidence of this was that until the
police and fire trucks arrived, an hour into the melee, some
intrepid concession stands on the periphery of the action continued
to sell bottled water for $4 and were not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were selling subs for $2 or $3 during the riot,'' said a
sandwich vendor, J.P. Kidwell. ``In a half-hour's time, we probably
made $5,000. We didn't stop selling until we saw the propane tanks
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   So who or what else can we blame?
</P>
<P>
   Let's blame the kids, because that's always who's blamed first.
Mark Szczerbiak, 20, a body piercer from New Hampshire, walked away
from the flaming trucks in a gas mask he had brought to the
festival. ``Our generation isn't about peace and love anymore;
they're all about destruction and hostility,'' he said. ``This is
to show everybody that we're young and we don't care, just burn
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, let's blame the bands, because popular entertainment has
always been one of society's favorite scapegoats. Throughout the
festival, some bands felt a successful show meant inciting the
crowd to the brink of violence. The shock-rap group Insane Clown
Posse stirred up its audience by throwing hundred-dollar bills at
them and staged a violent fight with a man dressed as a police
officer. The rap-rock group Limp Bizkit repeatedly urged audience
members to expel their pent-up energy and break things. And a Rage
Against the Machine song provided an anthem for the rebels without
a cause, who chanted defiantly as the police closed in around them,
``I won't do what you tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's blame the promoters. During the destruction and
looting, audience members had the following complaints: expensive
food, expensive tickets, expensive water combined with no tap water
at certain hours on the campsites, minimally trained security,
uninformed volunteers, short sets by bands, the near-absence of
trash receptacles or toilet cleaning, and a bad layout that had
them walking great distances to get to concessions, tents or
stages.
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to live like animals but spend money like
kings, said Beverly Clayton, 47, as she maneuvered through the
rampage with her teenage son and a stroller containing her
2-year-old granddaughter. ``I didn't start a fire,'' she said,
``but I have total sympathy for anyone who did.''
</P>
<P>
   Even disgruntled volunteers and security staff working at the
festival engaged in their own looting and destruction on Sunday
night in the barracks where they were housed, breaking windows and
even throwing a fire extinguisher at a passing shuttle bus for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference at 5 a.m., John Scher, one of the
event's three producers, denied any mishandling on their part. He
said the food prices were competitive and the ticket prices were a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the blame list is usually the media. Teenagers clustered
around the phone trucks that hadn't been destroyed, calling home
and telling their parents to watch them on the news. They flocked
toward the few television cameras on site, standing on garbage cans
with freshly made signs to get attention. The entire incident
sometimes seemed staged, escalating with the notion that the whole
world was watching them but hardly ever getting so out-of-control
that they were hurting one another or one another's property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get home to watch this on TV and see what it
looked like,'' said Alan Crampton, 26, a plumber from Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, let's blame the whole notion of Woodstock itself.
Perhaps if this had not been called Woodstock, if there had not
been a historical legacy to live up to (or to subvert), there
wouldn't have been such destruction. There was a pervasive idea
that if this generation has a Woodstock and nothing memorable
happens, then it is not a memorable generation. So, with an acute
self-consciousness, they made this Woodstock memorable. But what
did they make their generation memorable for?

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Weak from chemotherapy and dozing on
pillows, Kelly Davidson nearly missed the greeting her friend Lance
Armstrong shouted to the cameras as he whirred through the final
stretch of the Tour de France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old girl's fever was nearly 103 degrees. Her worried
parents were already preparing to take her back to Cook Children's
Medical Center from her great-grandmother's place at Possum Kingdom
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he (Armstrong) was finishing, I was packing a suitcase,''
Kelly's mother, Jamie Davidson, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say hello to Kelly Davidson in Fort Worth,'' called
out Armstrong, a 27-year-old bicycling superstar from Austin,
Texas. ``We've been thinking about you. Stay strong!''
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France champion finished treatment for testicular
cancer just two years ago. By the time Armstrong's cancer was
diagnosed, it had spread to his lungs and his brain. He had several
operations and chemotherapy before he was declared cancer-free in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon in the hospital, the memory of Lance's greeting
brought a smile to Kelly's face.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was 8 when doctors diagnosed her illness as a rare form
of cancer called neuroblastoma. In the years since, she has had
surgery, chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant. Partway through
yet another chemotherapy treatment, Kelly is weak. She has
virtually no white cells to fight off infection.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she was mostly quiet, holding a stuffed animal that
accompanies her to every medical treatment and adding just a word
here and there as her parents talked about her close bond with
Armstrong and his wife, Kristin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks into the hospital, and she lights up,'' Jamie
Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly met Armstrong in 1997 when he was signing autographs at a
sub shop in Austin where the Davidsons lived. Kelly and her mother,
returning from one of many doctor's appointments, decided to stop
by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had him sign a poster for us,'' Jamie Davidson said. ``She
didn't have any hair, and he didn't have any hair. And there was a
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, they learned, Armstrong tracked her down by calling the
local children's hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `There is a little bald-headed girl who came to one
of my autograph signings. I need to know her name,' '' Jamie
Davidson recounted.
</P>
<P>
   On a chain around her neck Monday, Kelly wore the ring Armstrong
sent after learning of Kelly's relapse last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bicyclist, in Europe when he heard the news, asked his wife
to deliver the ring and other gifts from Austin to the Fort Worth
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent this ring that he wore through his own chemotherapy
and said it had special powers,'' Kelly's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Christmas, Armstrong visited the unit, sporting a
Santa Claus hat.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's sports performance inspires Kelly in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he did most people would consider is
impossible,'' said Dr. Jeff Murray, one of Kelly's physicians, who
used to bicycle competitively.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is inspired by his performance as an athlete. She is
inspired by his being a very normal person besides being a
superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her cancer was diagnosed, Kelly was an occasional bike
rider, sometimes making the trip up to school. But she started
getting too tired for the trek, Kelly's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, her fatigue and stomach pains only worsened, Kelly's
father, John, said. At first, physicians said the problem might be
the flu. Or maybe asthma.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, Kelly's parents learned that a 15-centimeter tumor
was sitting on one of their daughter's kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Neuroblastoma can spread anywhere in the body. By the time it
was diagnosed in Kelly, it had spread into her abdominal area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told her she had a tumor on Wednesday, and she was in
surgery at 9 a.m. the next morning,'' Jamie Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Kelly has enjoyed one year of respite; her
cancer went into remission from mid-1997 to mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then late last year, Kelly had a bone-marrow transplant at Cook
Children's.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her daughter's prognosis, Jamie Davidson responded
simply, ``We're fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   And Armstrong, she said, is ``proof that everyone gets a second
chance and you can be better than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives kids hope.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It's tough enough trying to repair all the
nation's computer systems without having to worry about Y2K
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers, police and businesses are beginning to turn their
attention to those with sinister motives. Criminals, they fear,
could either take advantage of the enormous attention being focused
on fixing the Y2K problem or capitalize on Y2K chaos in January.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments across Kansas and Missouri, along with the
Mid-America Regional Council, are planning for problems. Some
counties are conducting elaborate response drills that include
terrorist scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's starting to worry about terrorism-type
situations,'' said Don Eatherton, Kansas City's Y2K coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Senate committee has scheduled a hearing for Thursday to
address high-tech threats linked to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Those threats include terrorism _ both international and
domestic _ and theft. In fact, one leading worldwide research firm
goes so far as to predict a $1 billion electronic theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K experience has opened our eyes as a society to how
vulnerable we are,'' said Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican who is
chairman of the U.S. Senate's Special Committee of the Year 2000
Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Y2K) can cause this kind of disruption by accident, what
kind of disruption could we have if someone sought to do us harm on
purpose?''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Year 2000
Conversion Council, both have said the time for crisis management
is now, and agencies are beginning to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Big business is also alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to worry about the threat of domestic terrorism,''
said Doug Morgan, vice president for information and development
with Kansas City Power &AMP; Light. ``We live in a crazy world.''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies and businesses are hesitant to outline their specific
plans for fear of tipping off criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is assessing the
threat of domestic terrorism on or around Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced Y2K will ignite a wave of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Kazim Isfahani, an analyst with Giga Information Services in
Cambridge, Mass., said warnings about such Y2K crime in the United
States and other countries amount to ``fear-mongering.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett concedes he has no information that any terrorist group
is planning an attack on the United States. But, he says,
experience shows terrorists often seek to exploit chaotic
situations.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his committee on Thursday will hear testimony about
threats from cyberterrorists _ who could range from individual
hackers to international groups.
</P>
<P>
   Others speculate that chaos caused by Y2K could create an
atmosphere ripe for the old-fashioned type of terrorism, such as
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who would like nothing more than to try to do
something showy, if not dangerous, toward the end of the year,''
said Dave Higgins, a computer analyst with the Ken Orr Institute in
Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, Higgins and others see domestic threats from
millennialist and survivalist groups that have fixated on the
advent of the year with three zeros. Some of those groups may want
to tear down institutions so they can begin rebuilding society
according to their own design, experts speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also fear Y2K thefts, including a startling prediction
from the world's leading Year 2000 firm, the Gartner Group of
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Gartner predict that within five years there will
be a $1 billion electronic heist directly attributable to Y2K. They
base those predictions on the study of more than 1,000 of their
worldwide clients.
</P>
<P>
   By making Y2K fixes with off-the-shelf software rather than
software unique to a corporation, researchers say, a company runs
the risk of theft. Hostile programmers could exploit unintended
bugs in standard software and clandestinely control a company, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms also are relying on outside contractors to make fixes
to sensitive systems. Some of those programmers leave behind ``trap
doors'' for easy access to a company's programming code, an
accepted practice that could be abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K remediation, by definition, creates and increases the
opportunity for theft and fraud,'' said analyst Joe Pucciarelli
with the Gartner Group. ``When you ask the king's soldiers to
rebuild the king's castle, the royal army has more opportunity to
steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that such thefts are not likely to occur in
community banks or small and midsize businesses, only large
companies that transfer big sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, too, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are
investigating whether crime groups, terrorists and others are
taking advantage of the Y2K crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the threat that could be posed by
terrorism-extremism, organized crime or criminal sponsors of civil
unrest,'' said Sgt. Chuck Waring, who heads Project Solstice, a
team of intelligence officers and high-tech sleuths.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've thought of it, why wouldn't they?''

MARGUERITE W. CULLMAN, 94, AN INVESTOR IN BROADWAY HITS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marguerite W. Cullman, a longtime theatrical investor
who was also an author, died Monday in her Manhattan apartment. She
was 94, and her main residence was in Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After working as an editor of the old Stage magazine, Mrs.
Cullman began investing with her husband, Howard S. Cullman, who
was chairman of what was then called the Port of New York Authority
and was prominent in the tobacco industry, serving on the board of
Philip Morris Inc. He died in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The couple began investing in Broadway productions in the 1930s
because, as their children said Monday, while Mrs. Cullman worked
at Stage she liked to be sure that a play the magazine wrote about
would not fold before the next issue appeared.
</P>
<P>
   As a family story has it, Mrs. Cullman proved prescient in
guessing on behalf of the magazine which plays would prove durable.
When her husband learned that, he proposed that she read the
scripts of forthcoming Broadway productions and he study the
financial prospectuses issued by their producers.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Cullman left the magazine, the couple began their
investing, which continued into the 1970s and brought them renown
for their shrewdness and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Whitehead, the theatrical producer, recalled last night,
``I could see that she got a kick out of the theater and a kick out
of being associated with it through investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the hits that the Cullmans helped bring to the stage were
``Life With Father,'' ``Oklahoma!,'' ``Carousel,'' ``Brigadoon,''
``South Pacific,'' ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof,''
``Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ``Death of Salesman'' and ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s and 1950s, their children said, the couple's
success rate was so high that their participation in a forthcoming
show was enough to guarantee its full funding.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Sanders, as she then was, was born and reared in
Manhattan, attended Columbia University, worked as a writer and
editor for the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate and contributed
articles to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker and other
publications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she wrote two books, ``Occupation Angel'' (1962),
about Broadway, and ``Ninety Dozen Glasses'' (1960), about her life
with Cullman in 1958, when he was the United States commissioner
for the World's Fair in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   She was also vice chairman of the Lighthouse for the Blind and
served on the board of the Spence-Chapin Home for Adoption.
</P>
<P>
   An early marriage was annulled. She married Cullman in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Marguerite P. Cullman of Severna
Park, Md.; a son, Brian Henry Cullman of Manhattan; two stepsons,
Hugh Cullman of Beaufort, N.C., and Paul T. Cullman of Ferndale,
Wash.; 12 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.

NTL TO BUY CABLE AND WIRELESS UNIT IN $13 BILLION DEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ NTL Inc. moved to become the biggest cable- television
company in Britain Monday with a $13 billion deal to buy the
consumer divisions of Cable and Wireless Communications PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition by NTL, a New York-based
telecommunications company founded six years ago that operates
mainly in Britain, received financial backing by France Telecom and
increased speculation of further consolidation in the British
communication services industry, where telephones, the Internet and
television are converging.
</P>
<P>
   NTL would double its size to control about two-thirds of the
British residential cable-television market with the acquisition,
with a total of 2.8 million customers, vaulting from No. 3 to No. 1
over Cable and Wireless and Telewest PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move had been anticipated since last week, when NTL
signed an exclusive negotiating agreement with Cable and Wireless
that blocked a rival offer from Telewest. Cable and Wireless had
been trying to sell its residential cable unit for some time to
focus on business services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms announced Monday, NTL will pay 6.3 billion
pounds ($10 billion) in cash and securities and assume 1.9 billion
pounds ($3 billion) in debt. France Telecom will invest $5.5
billion in NTL, increasing its stake in the company from 10 percent
to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the acquisition would help NTL compete in
the burgeoning high-speed Internet services business against
British Telecommunications PLC. The acquisition would also
strengthen NTL's position in the pay and interactive television
field as it fends off British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good move,'' said Sharon Armbrust, a senior
analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a media consulting firm in
Carmel, Calif.She said NTL's managers ``have really put themselves
on solid financial ground with the investment by France Telecom.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is contingent upon the approval of the Bell Atlantic
Corp., which owns 18.5 percent of Cable and Wireless
Communications. Bell Atlantic's board was expected to meet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by two American money managers, Barclay Knapp and George
Blumenthal, NTL began in 1993 as a spin-off of Cellular
Communications Inc. Knapp, chief executive, and Blumenthal,
chairman, sold Cellular Communications to Airtouch Communications
Inc. for about $2 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   NTL's shareholders include the Microsoft Corp. and the Comcast
Corporation and funds managed by Goldman Sachs Group L.P.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NTL guys are big salesmen,'' said Ms. Armbrust. ``They
don't stop here. It's a little like an Internet company. They get
momentum by creating more momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   NTL was one of the first companies to bundle telephone service,
cable television and Internet access into a single service, much
like AT&AMP;T is trying to do with its acquisition of TCI. ``These guys
are ahead of the US,'' Ms. Armbrust said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also is a potential boon to France Telecom, which
gets a piece of a major business outside its French domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a unique opportunity for France Telecom to participate
in the development of innovative and convergent services combining
telephony, digital TV and the Internet with one of the largest
alternative telecom companies in the UK,'' Michel Bon, chairman and
chief executive of France Telecom said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   NTL, which is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, said it would
seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange six months after the
aquisition is completed. NTL shares rose 56.25 cents, to $99.8125
on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless shares fell 2.6 percent to 745.5 pence
($11.78). France Telecom shares rose 4.7 percent, to 69.55 euros
($74).

FOR SALE: A STARTER. BUYER MUST BE READY TO GAMBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a pitcher to get you to the playoffs? Check out this
classified ad that emanates from the West Coast:
</P>
<P>
   Available, left-hander, only 28 years old, good bloodlines
(latest in line of pitching family).
</P>
<P>
   Oops, almost missed the tiny print: 1999 record: 2 victories, 10
losses, 7.43 earned run average; contract: two years left for $12.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Los Angeles Dodgers have not received a ton of inquiries
about Carlos Perez even though they would love to trade him and
even though a bunch of contenders and would-be contenders, as
usual, seek pitching help before the Saturday midnight deadline for
non-waiver trades.
</P>
<P>
   How can the Dodgers expect another team to relieve them of their
Perez burden with the record he has compiled and the contract they
inexplicably gave him, especially now that they have yanked him
from the rotation and recalled Robinson Checo from the minor
leagues to start in his place against Cincinnati this week?
</P>
<P>
   But there are other pitchers with losing records who will be
traded this week because that's what happens at this time of year
when teams desperately grab for pitchers to bolster their
undermanned staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Atlanta Braves, the team that invented pitching in the
90s, has scrutinized designated pitchers as it considers the
possibility of trying to acquire one to bolster a suddenly
vulnerable rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the quest for pitching help is the absence of a
Randy Johnson, a No. 1 starter, an impact pitcher who could
dominate teams for the last two months of the season and, if
necessary, carry a team into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros probably would have won the division
championship anyway last season, but Johnson clinched it for them,
overwhelming their opponents with 10 victories in 11 decisions, 116
strikeouts in 841/3 innings and a 1.28 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The premium pitchers teams wish were available this week are
Curt Schilling of Philadelphia and David Wells of Toronto, but they
aren't available because the Phillies are in the National League
wild-card race and the Blue Jays lead the American League wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the available-pitcher list has names like Juan Guzman
of Baltimore, Rolando Arrojo of Tampa Bay, Kevin Appier of Kansas
City, Steve Trachsel of the Chicago Cubs, Darryl Kile of Colorado,
Chuck Finley and/or Omar Olivares of Anaheim, Pat Hentgen of
Toronto and possibly Jeff Fassero of Seattle and Darren Oliver of
St. Louis. The Yankees may still trade Andy Pettitte, and the
Milwaukee Brewers may decide to trade the resurgent Hideo Nomo if
they can't sign him to a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and the San Francisco Giants beat the last-minute rush
with deals late last week, picking off probably the two best
available pitchers. The Mets obtained Kenny Rogers from Oakland and
the Giants acquired Livan Hernandez from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants paid the steeper price, giving up a pair of young
pitchers (Jason Grilli and Nathan Bump) who were their No. 1 draft
choices in 1997 and 1998 and beating out other teams to Hernandez,
the most valuable player of the 1997 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted him pretty bad; we just didn't have Grilli or
Bump,'' said Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, who is a
veteran of late July trades. ``It's a big price, but it made sense
for both teams. We had a lot on the table for Hernandez. I'm sure
other people did, too. It's disappointing from our perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hernandez had only a 5-9 record for the Marlins,
some general managers believe he will, in the words of one, ``step
it up in the pennant race.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, Hernandez's fellow Cuban, could be on the move, too. In
his second year in the major leagues, he isn't even eligible for
salary arbitration, but the Devil Rays have other reasons for
trading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 35, not 31,'' a general manager of another team said,
citing the age issue that most Cuban players present. ``They're
rebuilding, and he'll bring some value. He's also got some shoulder
problems. There's a risk on the shoulder and his age.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo has a 2-6 record and 6.34 ERA. Among the other available
pitchers, Kile is 5-10, 6.34; Hentgen 6-7, 5.57; Fassero 4-11,
6.86; Appier 8-9, 5.00, Finley 5-9, 5.68 and Trachsel 3-14, 6.55.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies would love to trade Kile, whose contract calls for
an $8 million salary next year, but a general manager said: ``I
don't think anyone will touch Kile. If you saw him pitch, you
wouldn't touch him either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Trachsel's record and the fact that he can become a free
agent after the season, the Braves scouted him in his start against
the Mets last Saturday. John Schuerholz, the Braves' general
manager, was traveling Monday and not available for comment, but an
executive of another club said, ``I hear the Braves are looking for
pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have some concern about John Smoltz's elbow, which
has knocked him out twice this season; Odalis Perez will undergo
elbow surgery and miss the rest of the season and, the executive
said, the Braves aren't comfortable with Bruce Chen in their
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But a general manager said he didn't think Trachsel would be the
answer for the Braves or anyone else this season. ``He might be a
worthwhile gamble for next year,'' the general manager said, ``but
I'm not sure that you can correct his problem this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Finley is an intriguing one. Although the Angels
would probably rather trade Olivares, there is greater interest in
Finley. The Cleveland Indians, looking to the post-season, want him
because he has a good record (16-8) against the Yankees. The
Yankees are talking to the Angels about him just in case they want
to keep the Indians from getting him. The Texas Rangers, also with
an eye on the playoffs, hope the Yankees get the left-handed Finley
because they have a good record against him (8-17).
</P>
<P>
   The intrigue will end in the next several days.  &QL;

OTHER CITIES STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP ON SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-SCHOOL-REPAIR-II) 
(mk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The construction pressures bearing down on the New York City
public schools are hardly unique.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, districts are scrambling to patch together
an aging collection of schools, with at least one out of three
buildings approaching the end of its useful life, which is about 50
years, according to the Association of School Business Officials.
Meanwhile, enrollment nationwide has been growing at a rate of
500,000 to 700,000 students a year, according to the federal
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The money has hardly kept pace: School districts invested $18.7
billion in school construction in 1996, the latest year for which
census figures are available, but the estimated cost of needed
repairs and new schools is $112 billion, according to the General
Accounting Office of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the New York City Board of Education, almost every other
school board in the country oversees its own building program, from
planning to construction, said Thomas Kube, executive director of
the Council of Educational Facility Planners, a professional
association.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort to compare New York's school building practices with
other cities' must carry this caveat: Only one other school system,
in Los Angeles, comes close to being even two-thirds the size of
New York's. New York has 1.1 million public school students, Los
Angeles has 697,000, and Chicago, the third-largest system, has
433,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, whose buildings are as old as New York's, has built
nearly as many new, permanent classroom seats in the last three
years as New York _ 16,000, compared with 19,600 in New York. It
has accomplished this despite having a system slightly more than
one-third the size of the New York system and having constructed
space for only a few hundred seats in the years immediately before
this period.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago's system, unlike New York's, the mayor bears ultimate
responsibility for the school system and the success of its
construction program.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing our mayor doesn't tolerate is infighting,'' said Tim
Martin, the chief operating officer of the Chicago public schools.
``I do not have the luxury of saying, `Mayor, this is not my
fault.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even critics have had difficulty arguing with the results since
the mayor was given control of the Chicago schools by the state in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have deep, deep differences with the chief operating
officer over educational policies,'' said Suzanne Davenport, the
acting executive director of Designs for Change, an education
research and advocacy group. ``But it is very clear that the
commitment to repair schools, and to build additions and new
schools, has helped revive our schools as centers of learning in
their communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District has hardly fared as
well. Nearly one out of two students there takes classes in schools
that run on staggered, year-round calendars because crowding is so
pronounced. Over the last two decades, the system's board of
trustees has built only one high school and middle school.
</P>
<P>
   The trials of a high school under construction near the city's
downtown are telling. Believed to be the most expensive public
school in American history, with a cost approaching $200 million,
the building may well have to be abandoned because it is situated
on an idle oil field still burbling with oil and methane gas.
</P>
<P>
   In search of a new apparatus to build schools, state officials
recently turned to New York for guidance. But at a hearing at a Los
Angeles elementary school, a top construction official for the New
York City Board of Education, Josh Mazess, declined to endorse the
New York model.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been any cure,'' said Mazess, the assistant to
the chief executive of the facilities division, speaking to an
array of state and city officials about New York's experience with
the School Construction Authority. ``Many people still don't know
who is responsible for what.''

 &HT;    Season over for Lopez, Perez
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves, who had problems, now have a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a related frenzy of personnel moves Monday, catcher Javy
Lopez will undergo season-ending surgery within the week to repair
a torn anterior cruciate ligament on his right knee, just 12 days
after being activated.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Odalis Perez's season has ended, the left-hander to
undergo surgery for a partial tear of the ulnar ligament in his
left elbow. Right fielder Brian Jordan will miss all of the
Milwaukee series and perhaps more after being diagnosed with a
pinched nerve in his neck that was causing numbness in his right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up the catching situation, the Braves acquired San
Diego's (and ex-Brave) Greg Myers for Class A pitching prospect
Doug Dent.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez had been awaiting the arrival of general manager John
Schuerholz, who was still in transit from Cooperstown, N.Y., before
finalizing a decision. An MRI and subsequent exam by team
orthopedist Joe Chandler determined that while the knee was not
injured further Saturday, it would not stand up to further play.
Lopez had been hitting .317 with 45 RBIs and 11 homers in 65 games.
He is expected to be fully ready for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've got is something very serious,'' said Lopez. ``If I
keep playing, it might affect me. The injury will take too long to
heal up or it will take surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez (4-6, 6.00) had suspected he had tendinitis and was
stunned by the news. His place in the rotation will be taken by
rookie Bruce Chen.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three Houston medical institutions have created the
world's first center for cell and gene therapy, a treatment option
that is expected to become the future of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The center _ a partnership teaming Baylor College of Medicine,
Texas Children's Hospital and Methodist Hospital _ will use new
knowledge about the molecular basis of disease to revolutionize
therapy for illnesses from cancer and AIDS to cardiovascular
disease and diabetes. The start-up cost is estimated at about $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centers like this will be at the forefront of a coming shift
in the way disease is treated,'' said Dr. Malcolm Brenner, director
of the center. ``Not tomorrow, not 5 years from now, but 20 years
from now, medicine won't be something you take in a bottle. It will
be like surgery was going to be 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The center was established in January 1998, but formally
launched Monday, a couple weeks before the opening of a
state-of-the-art, 25,000-square-foot, 15-bed inpatient adult stem
cell transplant unit at Methodist. Texas Children's Hospital is
currently constructing a similar unit that will be another part of
the center.
</P>
<P>
   Cell and gene therapy, simply defined, is the placement of
beneficial genes or cells into patient cells. Much heralded in the
early 1990s, then stalled by scientific setbacks, it is finally
starting to live up to its promise, thanks mostly to the Human
Genome Project, the mammoth effort to locate and sequence all
100,000 genes on the 46 human chromosomes. Baylor is currently
sharing an $80 million grant to complete the genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy is ultimately expected to be used on embryos, first
to prevent disease, later to enhance physical or mental
characteristics. But Brenner said although such controversial work
with embryos will happen, ``at this stage'' he doesn't plan to
pioneer such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The center will combine basic science and clinical research with
comprehensive pediatric and adult cell-and-gene therapy transplant
units. During the first five years, said Brenner, the focus will be
on cancer therapy _ bone marrow transplants _ and AIDS protocols.
In the next 10 years, added Brenner, treatment will move on to
central nervous system disorders like Parkinson's and multiple
sclerosis, where progress will likely come more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said he envisions cell and gene therapy as treatment
options to complement, but not replace, surgery, pharmaceuticals
and radiation. He said these therapies might initially draw
patients who have exhausted other forms of treatment, but
ultimately will be best used as preventive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner currently supervises a staff of 20 clinical and research
faculty members. Over the next five years, plans call for adding 30
more faculty and 300 support staff.
</P>
<P>
   Facilities housed at the International Center for Cell and Gene
Therapy are the Pediatric Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant
Unit, the Gene Vector Laboratory, the Transitional Research
Laboratory, the Cell and Molecular Therapy Laboratories, the Flow
Cytometry Core Laboratories and the Shell Center for Gene Therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of possible cell and gene therapy include research on
the ability of stem cells to regenerate and change function, said
Dr. Helen Heslop, director of the adult stem cell program at
Methodist. Given the right circumstances, she said they may be used
for brain or muscle cells, thus holding promise in the treatment of
muscular dystrophy or degenerative multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Heslop said another promising treatment is the development of a
gene that would block HIV at an early stage. Aimed at stopping HIV
patients from getting AIDS disease symptoms, it will likely be
brought into clinical practice in the next couple years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Heslop, Brenner and other leaders stressed that the center,
like all of medicine, will advance by tiny steps, not giant
breakthroughs. They also said the flow of steady progress will
justify the early 1990s hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking of something like this for a long time,''
said Dr. Ralph Feigin, president and chief executive officer of
Baylor. ``I hope in 20 years it's known not only for treating
patients in new ways, but also for training people who export this
knowledge so patients around the world can benefit.''

IN NEW YORK REGION, CONCERN GROWS OVER EFFECTS OF ADDITIVE

<P>
   The gasoline additive known as MTBE came into widespread use in
and around New York City in 1992, where it is added to gasoline in
the fall and winter to improve the burning of fuel in car engines
and thus reduce some kinds of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, questions have been raised in many
communities about possible health problems from the chemical, which
has been found both in the air and the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, in Connecticut and in some communities in
upstate New York, MTBE began showing up in well water, usually from
leaks in underground gasoline tanks at service stations. The
chemical, methyl tertiary butyl ether, was found to move through
underground water supplies far faster than other ingredients of
gasoline, and it had a noticeable odor, similar to paint thinner,
that often provided the first clue that a leak had occurred,
according to New York State environmental officials.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, most opposition to the MTBE additive has come
from people who say they have fallen ill after breathing it. A
national organization devoted to banning the chemical, OxyBusters,
was founded in 1993 by Barry Grossman, a resident of Plainsboro,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said that a sharp rise in asthma cases around New
Jersey and New York City in recent years had coincided with the
introduction of elevated levels of MTBE in gasoline. ``Nothing else
new was added to the environment at the time, but you've had all
these new asthma cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a decision by a federal advisory panel to recommend
reducing its use was overdue and encouraging. ``The blue-ribbon
panel appears to have come to its senses,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the additive still has its boosters, including the American
Lung Association of New York state, which sees the health threats
as unproved while the health benefits of cleaner air are clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Iwanowicz, director of environmental health for the group,
said that before the additive was increased in the early 1990s, New
York City routinely violated federal standards for carbon monoxide,
a harmful pollutant. ``Every winter, the city used to have a carbon
monoxide problem,'' he said. ``But we haven't seen that in more
than five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Iwanowicz said the supposed hazards from MTBE in drinking water
were something of a red herring, with the real hazard being the
whole soup of ingredients in gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline is a dangerous compound whether or not you have MTBE
in it,'' Iwanowicz said. When MTBE is detected in water, that
simply means that worse things are still en route, he said, adding:
``What this all really points to is the need to step up efforts to
seek alternatives to gas-powered vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in state legislatures nationwide the pressure
remains high to ban MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is
chairman of the New York State Assembly Environmental Conservation
Committee, said a bill was being considered by the committee to ban
the compound in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's growing data and enormous anecdotal evidence that the
stuff is dangerous, and that argues for a conservative position on
public health,'' he aid. ``We don't want to find out it's bad after
the fact.''

McCAIN RALLIES VOTES FROM LATINO ORGANIZATION 
 
By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Republican presidential candidate John McCain told
2,000 Latinos meeting Monday in Houston that he may be the only GOP
politician to win a majority of the Hispanic vote in two statewide
campaigns, a margin unmatched by front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won over 55 percent in my last election,'' Sen. McCain,
R-Ariz., told members of the National Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud, but I'm not satisfied with that number. I want all
their votes. Their support is my honor. Those Arizonans believe in
me, and I believe in them. I want their help, and I want your help,
to build a better country, a bigger country, and I intend to get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain made no direct reference to Bush, the Texas
governor was notably absent, ending a long La Raza tradition of
always drawing the governor of its host state to its annual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the governor of every state come to our conferences
so it's not only the presidential race factor of it,'' said La Raza
President Raul Yzaguirre, who described conferees as disappointed
and worried that Bush was taking their votes for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been bipartisan, too. We've had Gov. Tom Ridge from
Pennsylvania, Gov. John Engler from Michigan, both strong
Republicans, along with (Democratic) Gov. George Ryan of Illinois
and Colorado Gov. Bill Owens.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has campaigned in Michigan, California and Iowa, he
recently also passed up invitations to address the annual meetings
of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials in Philadelphia and the League of United Latin American
Citizens in Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did send a greeting to welcome their members to Texas,''
said Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. ``Unfortunately, he
receives hundreds of invitations, and is just not able to attend
every single event he's invited to.''
</P>
<P>
   La Raza spokeswoman Lisa Navarrete said Bush cited scheduling
conflicts in declining the invitation. But the governor, who
received about 40 percent of the Latino vote in November, on Monday
began a vacation in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, made a
lengthy address at the NALEO conference last month, and is
scheduled to make his presidential appeal to La Raza members
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also addressed the recent Unity 99 conference of minority
journalists in Seattle for more than an hour. Bush, after initially
rejecting an invitation to speak even though he was already in
Seattle, finally made a last-minute, hurried walk-through.
</P>
<P>
   During McCain's address to La Raza, he repeatedly complimented
Latinos, who already comprise 5 percent of the national electorate
and will soon overtake blacks as America's largest minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic Americans are honest, hard-working patriots, who want
and deserve the equal opportunity that is our nation's promise.
Hispanics have distinguished themselves in every walk of life,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many have vested their hopes in the American dream and the
free enterprise system. You are the backbone of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has been honored by LULAC for his support of the
Latino community and its causes, also made his familiar pitch for
campaign finance reform, a cornerstone of his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is co-sponsor of legislation to ban so-called ``soft
money,'' the unregulated contributions from unions and corporations
to political parties that are used indirectly to help candidates.
The bill has been stalled by the GOP leadership, which just this
week agreed to allow debate on the measure this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look down the list of soft money donors, I see
corporate giants. I see large labor unions. I see the Fortune
500,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the name of my friend Victor Floes, who started a
small bakery in the town of Guadalupe, Arizona, who for years
labored hard to free the community and support his family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Victor's name or, frankly, the majority of
Americans who deserve the attention, access and priority
representation that only a select few can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has already amassed an intimidating and
record-breaking $37.3 million campaign fund, McCain refrained from
attacking his Republican rival directly. Instead, he evoked the
traditional GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a proud member of the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy
Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan,'' said McCain, who received a standing
ovation. ``I believe in the politics of addition.''
</P>
<P>
   La Raza is the nation's largest Latino advocacy group.

SEC HEAD WARNS MARKETS OVER PROPOSALS TO GO PUBLIC
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's top stock-market regulator warned the
New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market Monday that any
proposal to convert themselves to for-profit public companies must
adequately provide for self-regulation that is ``zealous,
adequately funded, and imbued with the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns were raised in a letter sent by Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to Richard A.
Grasso, chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock
Exchange, and Frank G. Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns the Nasdaq
market.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission will be open to ownership changes that
foster the competitiveness of the traditional exchanges, Levitt
said, ``I want you to understand that approval of these changes
will depend upon investors' interests taking precedence over all
others as we move toward the market of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter reflects Levitt's concern that ``the issue is picking
up steam, both in public and behind the scenes,'' an aide to Levitt
explained Monday night. ``The chairman wanted to make sure that he
had clearly established his priorities and concerns at the
outset.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso confirmed on Friday that the New York exchange plans to
explore a change in its ownership structure that would transform it
from a member-owned nonprofit entity _ its format for the last 207
years _ into a for-profit corporation, with publicly traded stock.
If certain tax questions can be resolved, Grasso said last week,
the exchange could be ready to sell shares to the public by
mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb is said to envision a slower timetable, but senior market
officials expect that the organization could spin off the Nasdaq
market as a freestanding for-profit company with public
shareholders as early as next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Both markets say they are trying to streamline their management
structure to better enable them to compete with upstart electronic
communications networks, or ECNs, that have been nibbling away at
the nation's stock-trading business.
</P>
<P>
   Those rivals range from Instinet, a unit of Reuters PLC that has
been an alternative trading forum for two decades, to smaller
start-up networks like Island ECN, a subsidiary of Datek Online
Holdings, and Archipelago, whose backers include some of Wall
Street's biggest financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, in his letter Monday night, acknowledged that the market
landscape is changing in ways that are ``nothing short of
revolutionary.'' He continued, ``I want to assure you that I am
committed to promoting the competitiveness and viability of the
traditional securities exchanges in the face of these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that Grasso and Zarb, as they consider the
potential advantages of a for-profit structure, ``must also
consider the impact of such changes on the effectiveness of your
self-regulatory functions.'' Besides ensuring that self-policing
efforts are strong and public-spirited, he said, the institutions
must also make sure that the views of the members and the public
are reflected on the corporate boards they form.
</P>
<P>
   The two markets envision different approaches to the
self-regulatory responsibilities that each carries. Grasso has said
that the New York exchange's regulatory unit would likely remain
part of a new for-profit exchange. The NASD proposal envisions
retaining the organization's current free-standing regulatory unit
under the parent organization's non-profit umbrella, while the
Nasdaq market is spun off as a for-profit corporation. Some
substantial portion of the proceeds from Nasdaq's sale would be
used to assure adequate financing for the regulatory unit, senior
NASD officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Levitt seemed to favor the NASD approach, saying
one way of insuring that the securities industry's self-policing
efforts remains strong would be ``more formally separating the
self-regulatory role from the role of exchanges as trading
venues.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Levitt said the chairman ``has not ruled out'' the
possibility of public hearings on the issue, once the two markets
have formally applied for the rule changes necessary to change from
a member-owned to an investor-owned institution, a process known as
demutualization.

COLLINS READY TO BRING SHUTTLE BACK TO EARTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With Columbia's short but drama-tinged
mission drawing to a close, the first female shuttle commander has
one more milestone to go.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran astronaut Eileen Collins must bring Columbia home,
steering the shuttle and its five astronauts through the darkness
and onto the runway at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I was anything but really excited about the
chance to land the space shuttle. A night landing will be
especially challenging,'' Collins, a 42-year-old Air Force test
pilot, told reporters. Hers will be only the 12th night landing in
95 shuttle missions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Collins command, pilot Jeff Ashby, flight engineer Steve
Hawley, mission specialist Catherine ``Cady'' Coleman and French
astronaut Michel Tognini weathered a rocky launch to successfully
deploy the $1.55 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is to land at 11:20 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the Kennedy
Space Center , with Collins and Ashby at the controls. There is a
backup landing opportunity at 12:55 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of her return to Earth, Collins discussed her
experiences as the first woman to lead a team of space travelers in
a news conference and with television stations from her native New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say it's been a challenging situation, but the
whole crew has been up to it,'' said Collins.``I can't wait to get
back home and get back to a normal life again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to a Mexican restaurant,'' she confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those awaiting her return is husband, Pat Youngs, a Delta
Air Lines pilot, and the couple's 3-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daughter, Bridget, is looking forward to spending a little
time with mom. She's had enough with dad,'' Youngs said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shuttle engineers awaited Columbia's return to verify
photographic evidence of a hydrogen fuel leak and an electrical
short. Both occurred as Columbia lifted off early Friday and either
could have forced the shuttle crew to attempt an unprecedented,
risky emergency landing in Florida or West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was delayed three times by problems with the $1.55
billion Chandra observatory and Columbia's launch was scrubbed
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after Friday's launch, an electrical short tentatively
traced to a computerlike controller threatened to shutdown two of
Columbia's rocket engines in flight. Then Sunday, the space agency
disclosed photographic evidence of a small hydrogen leak from the
nozzle of the right rocket engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared for that,'' Collins said of the prospect of
an emergency landing. ``We were listening for the (engine)
performance calls (from mission control) on ascent. This crew would
have been ready to do whatever was needed.''

COLUMN: QUICK DRAW WINS AGAIN IN ALBANY  (ms) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all the wrong reasons, Albany managed to get it
right. That's what state Sen. Frank Padavan of Queens figured four
months ago when Quick Draw, the keno-style game that the senator
once termed ``video crack,'' faded unexpectedly into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   All right, its demise had nothing to do with a sudden twinge of
social conscience on the part of legislative leaders and the
governor. It was a result of the interminable deadlock over the New
York state budget.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 law creating Quick Draw required that the game be
renewed by March 31 of this year. But it got caught up in the
budget battle, becoming another weapon that Albany's masters could
use to club one another. While they fiddled, the deadline came and
went, and the game died.
</P>
<P>
   Padavan, a conservative Republican, was not one to look a gift
horse in the mouth. As far as he is concerned _ and he is not
alone, even if a legislative majority does not agree _ government
has no more business running numbers games than it has operating
brothels. If Quick Draw expired for less than noble reasons, that
was just fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   The game, which gave the state $120 million or more in annual
profits, was problematic from the start because of its rapid
action, with a new round played every few minutes on video monitors
in 3,200 bars and delis. Critics condemned it as addictive,
especially for problem gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   So when it suddenly disappeared, Padavan said good riddance.
Similar sentiments were expressed by groups like the nonprofit New
York State Council on Problem Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what has happened to Quick Draw? It's baaaack.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are about to flash again on barroom screens, perhaps
as soon as Sunday. The only question now is who has become the
bigger Quick Draw addict: the fellow struggling with a gambling
monkey on his back, or New York's top politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and leaders of the Legislature decided that
they could not get by without this cash cow, even though they are
rolling in a budget surplus of $2 billion. In fairness, they are
not alone in yielding to temptation. Politicians across the country
have had trouble resisting gambling's lure. A good example is the
solution to the entrenched poverty and social dislocation suffered
by American Indians. The preferred political response has been to
turn them into croupiers and blackjack dealers.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to Quick Draw, the governor led the way for
restoration, and Senate and Assembly leaders went along.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that without these revenues, they won't be able to do
what they want to do,'' Padavan said. ``It's all nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   What galls him is that an important development took place after
the game died in early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission
released a long-awaited report on the consequences of the gambling
boom in the United States. Among its conclusions was that forms of
``convenience gambling,'' like Quick Draw, create ``potentially
greater social costs'' than they do economic benefits. The
commission's recommendation:
</P>
<P>
   ``States should not authorize any further convenience gambling
and should cease and roll back existing operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Where is New York headed? The other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the benefit of all this input, and we're just ignoring
it, which to me is unconscionable,'' Padavan said. ``With a $2
billion surplus, there is no justification to further victimize
people in this way, many of whom can least afford to lose their
money to a numbers game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another point he and others raise is that, by law, the New York
state lottery was supposed to have finished a thorough evaluation
of Quick Draw's effects on compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public still waits for the study,'' the state comptroller,
H. Carl McCall, complained in a letter sent this month to
legislative leaders. ``Why would we reauthorize and expand Quick
Draw,'' McCall asked, without first finding out what its impact has
been thus far?
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot for Padavan is that the governor did not get his
way on increasing the number of Quick Draw outlets. His expansion
plan, a response to pressure from bars and restaurants, is on hold
_ for now. But the senator predicted that the pro-gambling forces
would be heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people never give up,'' he said.

 &HT;    Maddux completes 6-1 win
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If winning is the best tonic, the Braves gargled with
the stuff Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux performed about as well as he can while his
teammates slapped Milwaukee around in a five-run fifth inning as
the Braves opened a six-game home stand with a 6-1 drubbing of the
Brewers. The Braves won consecutive games for just the second time
since the All-Star break, became the first team in the majors to
reach 61 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux threw his second consecutive complete game of the year to
improve to 11-6, allowing six hits and striking out seven. He lost
a shutout in the ninth on Geoff Jenkins' RBI double, but posted his
fifth win in his past six decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee finally fell apart in the fifth, a four-hit, two-error
exercise that left the Braves ahead 6-0 after batting through the
order. Bret Boone, coming off a 4-for-38 trip, opened the
festivities with an 8-foot RBI, his tap back toward the mound
driving in Walt Weiss from third. Brewers starter Scott Karl helped
out by throwing the ball to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   With men on first and second, Milwaukee manager Phil Garner
decided to walk Chipper Jones to load the bases so that Karl could
pitch to Andruw Jones with one out. Jones, batting clean-up for the
injured Brian Jordan, lofted a soft RBI single into left for his
fourth RBI in three games and a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter, who entered the game hitting just .103 in his past
17 games, next bounced a ground-rule double over the lelt-field
wall for two more RBIs. Ryan Klesko followed with a hard groundout
to second which Mark Loretta had to dive to snag, allowing Andruw
Jones to score for the six-run lead. Maddux was handed a 1-0 lead
in the first and it was the product of third-base coach Ned Yost's
aggressiveness. After Boone singled, catcher Brian Banks gave him
second on a passed ball on a routine fastball that popped from his
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones next drove a ball deep into the left-center gap
that center fielder Marquis Grissom was able to run down on the
warning track. But Grissom glanced off left fielder Geoff Jenkins
as he gloved the ball, sending Grissom to the ground. Boone, who
was tagging up on the play, never stopped running. Yost waved him
home before Grissom's throw sailed over shortstop Jose Valentin's
head.

U.S. VOWS DRUG WAR MUST GO ON DESPITE DEADLY CRASH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over second n in Narino) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Although the escalating war on drugs in
Colombia appears to have claimed the lives of five American
soldiers, a top U.S. official insisted Monday that Washington's
commitment to this troubled nation would not waver.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, who heads the White House's anti-drug office,
confirmed that a U.S. Army de Havilland RC-7 reconnaissance plane
crashed in the cloud-shrouded mountains of southern Colombia during
an anti-drug mission Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have located the wreckage site,'' said McCaffrey, who is
on a four-day trip to Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and the
Caribbean islands of Curacao and Aruba. ``The evidence so far would
indicate that these five brave young Army aviators as well as two
Colombian air force officers have probably lost their lives in a
fatal accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans include two Army captains, a warrant officer, and
two enlisted men who were based at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties, if confirmed, would be the first U.S. military
personnel to have died in Colombia. About 300 U.S. troops serve as
advisers in Colombia. U.S. officials insist that they were sent
here to assist the Bogota government's war against drug traffickers
_ not to support the government's struggle against Marxist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian anti-guerrilla units Monday tried to seal off parts of
the Cerro de Patascoy mountain range on the border between Putumayo
and Narino states where the plane's wreckage was spotted by
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds, fog, and the presence of rebels of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, prevented ground searchers from
reaching the crash site, located about 7,000 feet up in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   RCN television of Bogota reported that the aircraft had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no survivors,'' said Colombian air force chief Gen.
Hector Fabio Velasco. ``We hope to be able to start the recovery in
the coming hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Jane Campbell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command
in Miami, said that helicopters got within a few hundred yards of
the crash site but were unable to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is is incredibly mountainous, rugged terrain,'' she said.
``It is on a slope that appears to be at a 45-degree angle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, several modified Army Blackhawk helicopters equipped
with extra fuel tanks and night-vision capabilities left a U.S.
base in Puerto Rico to join the search. Meanwhile, the Southern
Command, to which the downed aircraft was attached, insisted that
there has still been no confirmation that the spotted plane
wreckage is the missing RC-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still searching the entire area. That's a
drug-producing area so it's possible that it's a crashed drug
aircraft. We don't know yet,'' said Steve Lucas, another spokesman
for the command.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. and Colombian crews flew about 2,000 joint
anti-drug missions. Three private pilots, contracted by the State
Department to fumigate coca plantations, have been killed in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the danger to U.S. military personnel,
McCaffrey said that Colombia ``must carry the burden of this
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has clearly always been an enormous threat to Drug
Enforcement Administration and other U.S. personnel operating in
support of our allies,'' McCaffrey said. ``This must not be a U.S.
effort. We are very proud to be supportive, but this is a Colombian
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who is making his third trip to Colombia this year,
also sounded the alarm about the growing threat that drugs pose to
Colombia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia supplies about 80 percent of the cocaine and heroin
that enters the United States, while cocaine production in Colombia
has doubled over the past three years, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug trade has fueled Colombia's civil war by providing easy
profits for left-wing guerrillas and rightist paramilitaries who
work side-by-side with traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey estimated that the guerrillas and paramilitaries earn
between $215 million and $600 million annually from drugs, allowing
these groups to buy more arms and to pay recruits twice the salary
of government troops. The FARC now has more than 15,000 fighters
spread across much of Colombia while the paramilitaries count about
5,000 gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a democratic regime in trouble,'' McCaffrey said,
referring to Colombia. ``Drugs are the heart and soul of many of
these problems. The United States has paid inadequate attention to
a serious and growing emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, McCaffrey said he supports what is already a huge
U.S. aid commitment to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian police and army will get about $289 million in aid
this year, making Colombia the third largest recipient of U.S. aid
after Egypt and Israel. Colombian officials have asked for another
$500 million in U.S. anti-drug aid over the next two years, and
some members of the U.S. Congress have called for up to $900
million.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCaffrey plans to visit a elite 1,500-member
anti-drug army battalion that is being trained by U.S. military
advisers.

WOMEN PLAYING SOCCER FOR THE LOVE OF A GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were career professionals who were also soccer
moms, sideline boosters content to watch smaller versions of
themselves scurrying about soccer fields. They did not fit the
profile of the typical frustrated jock.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every time they helped their children don their jerseys and
strap on shinguards or watched them score a goal and beam in joyous
celebration, the more consumed they were with a desire to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always proud to watch my two sons play soccer,'' said
Joan Madden-Peister, a state Supreme Court judge whose sons, Evan,
18, and Kyle, 14, play in a youth league in the city. ``One day, I
realized I wanted to get a soccer ball and I wanted to have a
uniform and I wanted to score goals. I never had that opportunity
when I was growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, she was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Madden-Peister and her teammates on the Parlour Moms,
a recreational women's team she helped found three years ago, will
travel to Ireland to play four amateur women's teams in Dublin and
Galway. Their first match is Saturday against the Irish Allied Bank
team. Three more games will be played next week against opponents
they know little about, except that the team in Galway is known as
Castle Celtic.
</P>
<P>
   And after the tournament, there will be no news-media frenzy or
promotional trips to Disneyland for the Americans, as there were
for the U.S. women's team that won the World Cup two weeks ago.
There's nothing more at stake than bragging rights over beer and,
perhaps, a shared sense of personal satisfaction for a group of
women who have come to discover that it is never to late to score a
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little scared, but this will be fun,'' said Jane
Kenney, a magazine editor who is leaving the children behind with
her husband, John.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was arranged by Maggie Bradley-Cook, a physical
therapist and mother of two soccer-playing teen-agers, after she
was feeling a bit jealous last summer that her 13-year-old daughter
got to play soccer in Sweden and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself: `What's this? Our kids get these
opportunities and we sacrifice,''' Bradley-Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The Parlour Moms were formed after a youth soccer dinner, when
Madden-Peister had a sign-up sheet asking if there might be other
women interested in playing. More than 100 women signed up.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the days before the U.S. women's national team,
mostly pony-tailed and unified in team spirit, put the sport into
the national spotlight. Through attrition _ injuries, frustration,
other responsibilities _ nearly 60 dropped out. What was left was a
ragtag team that became known as the Parlour Moms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly invigorating,'' said Wendy Hollender, 44, a
home-furnishing designer who continued to play during recent
chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer. ``I see some of my
neighbors walking around half asleep, and I'm coming in after
playing two hours and my adrenaline is pumping.''
</P>
<P>
   The team plays under the auspices of the Bronx Irish League.
Started 10 years ago by newly arrived Irish immigrants, the adult
recreational league sponsors interleague play between teams from
Queens, the Bronx and the only Manhattan-based team, the Parlour
Moms. The name was taken from The Parlour, the Irish pub and
restaurant on the Upper West Side, where members of the team
gathered on Monday and Thursday evenings after practice at Turf
Soccer Field in Riverside Park.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine of the Parlour Moms will be making the trip to
Ireland. Among the missing will be the team's three goalies. To
bolster their roster and their chances of winning, the team
recruited players from a rival team, the Harps, this season's Bronx
Irish league champions. They are younger and more skilled players.
</P>
<P>
   Katie McNeil, an architect, who plays defense for the Harps,
learned that the Parlour Moms were looking for volunteers to make
the trip to Ireland. She changed her vacation plans and persuaded
Karen Rice, a forward, Allison Kaye, who played for Dartmouth
College, and Hillary Potkewitz, a central midfielder, to put aside
interleague rivalry and become a Parlour Mom, even though all four
are single and childless.
</P>
<P>
   The Parlour Moms know they will have to play their best to wrest
a victory from their Irish opponents. For one thing, the teams in
Ireland play regulation 90-minute games, as opposed to the
70-minute games in the Bronx Irish League. In addition, the fields
are expected to be bigger than the ones at Van Cortlandt and
Dykeman Parks and those on Randalls Island where the Parlour Moms
play on Saturday afternoons. And, the amateur leagues in Ireland
are said to be highly organized and the players far more
experienced than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday evening, John Kelly, co-owner of the Parlour, was
standing on the sideline of Turf Field watching the team practice
and reminiscing about the women in the knee-high socks, T-shirts
and shorts, who dragged themselves into his bar one evening two
years ago shortly after it opened and commiserated about how
terrible they were as players. One year later, with Kelly as their
sponsor, the team won the league's championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude has completely changed,'' Kelly said. Asked in
what way, he replied, ``Oh, they're cutthroat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley-Cook, a tall, athletic-type who played basketball in
high school and finished the 1979 New York City marathon in 4 hours
4 minutes, said that she and the other women on the team _ which
has an average age of 45 _ have no illusions about the level of
their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt eager to ingratiate whatever experience we could
create for ourselves,'' she said. ``I'm 50 years old. It doesn't
seem like a valid thing to seem so important to me because it seems
very selfish and separate from my family and my work. But it's
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The players say that soccer has become their saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   Hollender said she might have let cancer get the better of her.
As a soccer player, however, she is used ``to taking blows and the
aches and pains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After I had my surgery, once the anesthesia wore off, I
climbed off the table and was ready to go,'' said Hollender, the
speedy striker who credits her teammates with helping her maintain
her psyche throughout her chemotherapy treatments. ``Heck, I was
bruised up more on the soccer field. Instead of focusing on the
cancer and living in fear, my question to my doctor was when could
I play soccer again.''
</P>
<P>
   By their own admission, they will never play as well as their
children. But at least they will know what it feels like to use
your head to block a shot or to catch a pass on the inside of your
foot, then kick it to another woman streaking down the field, who
steadies it for a moment and sends it sailing toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all we need are ponytails,'' Bradley-Cook said.

 &HT;    Foundation benefits from Armstrong's Tour winBy Gary Estwick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The phone lines at the Lance Armstrong
Foundation haven't stopped ringing since Austin cyclist Lance
Armstrong started the Tour de France on July 3 and finished it as
champion on Sunday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been crazy over here all morning,'' said foundation
director Karl Haussman, while receiving another call as one of the
foundation's three-member staff. ``But that's a good thing, that's
an awesome thing. The beauty of all that is happening is that we're
getting our name out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about exposure for the foundation spreading our
message,'' Haussman said. ``Those are all great things for the
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 27, overcame his own life-threatening bout with
testicular cancer after being diagnosed in 1996. He did not compete
in 1997, taking the year off to recuperate from extensive
chemotherapy. He raced a limited schedule last year and this on
Sunday showed the world his comeback was complete by becoming the
first American to win the Tour since Greg LeMond in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Haussman sees Armstrong as more than the newly crowned Tour de
France champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance really sees this as more than a victory on the Tour and
for the foundation but also the cancer community,'' he said.
``Anyone surviving cancer, this is a victory for them, too. You can
come back from the lowest of the lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take the opportunity and fight for your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation Board member Scott Gidley said people can relate to
Armstrong's never-say-die attitude. ``I think people with diseases
and disabilities can look to him and the way he attacked the
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's win has benefited the foundation, a non-profit
agency founded in 1997 to support patients and survivors of
urological cancer. Foundation officials said the organization has
raised approximately $40,000 over the last two months, totaling
roughly $1,000,000 in donations since its inception. In 1998, total
donations were approximately $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation supports cancer patients and survivors through
education, awareness and research.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's Web site has also been a source of information,
receiving about 50,000 visitors since May. Because of limited
television coverage, the Internet also was a favorite place for
Tour fans to find race results.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's success has meant corporate sponsorships for the
foundation. Nike Inc., a regular LAF supporter, recently donated
$25,000. Haussman said the foundation hopes Armstrong's success
will mean more local and national corporate partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Leonetti, ACG (all-conditions gear) communication manager
of Nike, said the donation was designed to motivate other companies
and individuals to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really see Lance as the epitome of the `just do it' athlete
that Nike has,'' Leonetti said. ``We think Lance transcends to
people around the world as a symbol for cancer survivors and people
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Nike has donated $55,000 to the LAF and its
primarily fund-raiser, the Ride for the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Haussman said the foundation hopes to get more local and
national corporate partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, composed of business and medical leaders
throughout the country, funds clinical research, educational
projects and fellowships for urological cancer. Haussman said
before the LAF was formed in 1996, little medical research was done
for testicular cancer. Haussman added the LAF plans to address
additional forms of cancer next year.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
</P>
<P>
   The Lance Armstrong Foundation accepts donations that fund
research projects, awareness campaigns and educational programs
related to fighting and preventing cancer. The foundation also
sponsors the annual Ride for the Roses Weekend in Austin, which
raises hundreds of thousands of dollars.

 &HT;    Camp opens without Sanders, Lett
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The good-timing award will be shared by
rookies Wane McGarity and Dat Nguyen, who beat the clock by signing
contracts with the Dallas Cowboys on the eve of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   When camp opens at 8:45 a.m. today on the campus of Midwestern
State University, the Texas receiver and Texas A&AMP;M linebacker will
be in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies, free agents and assorted veterans report to camp today.
The majority of veteran players will join them Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, the record-breaking tackler for A&AMP;M, signed a
three-year, $1.1 million deal early Monday. He is expected to be a
backup linebacker and special teams player in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity came to terms on his contract late Monday. The big-play
receiver might be used as a kick returner this season. Terms of the
contract were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The only other drafted rookies to sign a contract are tight end
Mike Lucky of Arizona (three years, $800,000) and defensive end
Peppi Zellner of Fort Valley State.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the team's top two picks, defensive lineman
Ebenezer Ekuban of North Carolina and Solomon Page of West
Virginia, remains unclear, but they are not expected to be in camp
today.
</P>
<P>
   At the team's first press briefing, team owner Jerry Jones and
Coach Chan Gailey were upbeat about the players Dallas signed this
spring. Among them are wide receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail,
center Mark Stepnoski and linebacker Quentin Coryatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocket is someone who can turn a five-yard pass into a 30-yard
pass,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail is the biggest catch the Cowboys made in the off-season.
Coryatt will fill a need at outside linebacker and Stepnoski still
is regarded as one of the league's best centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most aggressive we've been in 11 years of free
agency,'' Jones said. ``We have enjoyed our most productive
off-season in 10 years. We have a mixture of youth and experience,
and that's how we designed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although veterans are not required to be in camp today, some
have decided to come early. Receiver James McKnight, who played
last season in Seattle, was encouraged to learn Gailey's complex
offense early. Veterans Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin have arrived,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's role with the Cowboys has been the source of mystery. He
will continue to be a starter, but he will not be Aikman's primary
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smart for us to try to rest him more, which means he'll
be fresh at the end of the season,'' Gailey said. ``We said the
same thing about Emmitt (Smith) last year, and we were somewhat
successful with that. ... He's a very hard worker and he needs to
be smart about this. If he can take care of himself, he can still
be a valuable player throughout the whole year. But if he goes out
and plays unbelievably great, it will be hard to take him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players who will not be in camp are defensive tackle Leon
Lett and cornerback Deion Sanders. Lett has been suspended
indefinitely for repeatedly failing the NFL's policy and drugs, and
Sanders is coming off surgery on his big left toe.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Lett's status is in Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's
hands. One published report had Lett serving a four-game
suspension, but the commissioner said the penalty has not been
determined.

NFL OWNES WILL SEE L.A.'S UNIFIED BID
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ NFL owners get their first look at the new unified
Los Angeles franchise bid _ including stadium, site and financing
plans _ tonight in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles contingent is hopeful after the expansion
committee views the plan and the full membership is given a
presentation on Wednesday, they will win league approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we'll either have an agreement or we won't,'' said
Bill Chadwick, Gov. Gray Davis' point man. ``But I think we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick has worked tirelessly with league representatives, the
competing Michael Ovitz-Ron Burkle and Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr.
groups and various city and agency officials, since Davis made him
the state's designated deal-maker six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Chadwick's first exposure to most NFL owners, which
could prove a learning experience. League owners have a habit of
doing things their way and taking their time about it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the hopeful Southern California contingent geared up for
the latest presentation to owners, word came from the leader of the
Houston group _ scheduled to be awarded the 32nd league franchise
should Los Angeles stumble by its Sept. 15 deadline _ he had been
told by several owners his city was favored to get the expansion
team.
</P>
<P>
   In the expansion game, everyone seems to have someone to tell
them what they want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen in Chicago,'' Broad said.
``I'm more optimistic than I was two months ago, but I can't
predict what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was originally awarded a conditional franchise in
March, with Houston identified as the backup. The next month the
Coliseum was selected as the franchise stadium. Ovitz, who
originally wanted to build a stadium in Carson, presented his plans
for the Colisem, and Broad-Roski an update of their plans, to
owners in Atlanta in May.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chadwick has scrambled to bring the two competing Los
Angeles groups together to make one bid. He released the new
Exposition Park site plan on Friday, showing two parking structures
with approximately 14,000 new spaces. He has yet to release plans
for a refurbished Coliseium, expected to be closely modeled after
Ovitz's Roman Coliseum design, or the details of his proposed
financing package.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick hopes to have bonds issued from various agencies to pay
for the anticipated $150 million cost to build the new parking
structures. Estimates to rebuild the Coliseum have ranged from
$300-400 million.
</P>
<P>
   League officials, apparently encouraged by progress made under
Chadwick's direction, have indicated a willingness to contribute
between $125 million and $150 million to help rennovate the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to show a unified Los Angeles effort, Chadwick, NFL
vice president Roger Goodell and the Coliseum Commission negotiated
a proposed stadium-lease agreement that was unanimously approved by
the commission at a special meeting Monday and will also be
presented to league owners tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lists the deal points _ lease, who's responsible for what,
terms,'' said Sheldon Sloan, president of the commission. ``It's an
exclusive negotiating agreement, a nonbinding prelude to a
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite any headway made in Los Angeles, Bob McNair, who leads
the Houston effort, said he believes the odds are in his city's
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told the chances are better than 50-50 that we would
wind up with the team,'' McNair told Houston TV station KRIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is whether they will have a financing plan
put together that is going to be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair apparently based his optimism on conversations with a
pair of NFL owners, Jacksonville's Wayne Weaver and Denver's Pat
Bowlen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne's feeling is similar to all of the owners I've talked to
and that is very little progress has been made in Los Angeles and
they don't think sufficient progress is going to be made by Sept.
15,'' he said. ``They think we're in a very favorable position.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said he believes Los Angeles has met all conditions the
league established last March and wondered how some could react
negatively to a financing plan they had yet to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even presented it,'' Broad said. ``We hope we
satisfy them, but far be it from me to predict how they're going to
act. We think we've met all their conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're there to show we have a plan, we're united, we want you
in Los Angeles, the ducks are all pretty much in order _ now let's
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if owners do approve the Los Angeles plan, they have to set
a franchise fee and select one of the ownership groups.

BLACK SOUTH AFRICA FINDS VOICE IN FREEDOM FOLLOWING APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVIN IN ``A'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; It was night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the starry sky seemed so large to Lionel Davies until
that instant in 1964 when he was no longer free.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South Africa's Robben
Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the freedom of the
world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him with their
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would be in prison for the next 11 years, put there for the
``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of hundreds of black people
imprisoned during the 44 years of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Davies only hoped that one day he would again stand under that
sky as a man equal to the world, and not as a black South African
activist imprisoned by cultural fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We were the pariahs of our world,'' Davies says. ``It was
humiliating to be black at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, apartheid has ended, Davies and others have
been released and South Africa's art world is waking from its long
night's sleep of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and the country's other black artists, realizing they're
no longer limited by their country's horizon, are celebrating with
an outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally destroyed by apartheid and prison,'' says
Davies, now 63. ``But I searched for direction, and I discovered
making art. I learned to paint and to draw, and that transformed my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the idea of an African renaissance is all about:
the divine human gift of creation and the right of a person,
regardless of color, to share the product of that creation with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's about excavating a culture strangled by years of white
colonial rule and nourishing and encouraging the remains.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a country that has always hugged tight to the Cape of
Good Hope, dreaming of discovering itself, finding ''fortitude and
soul in time to accompany the world into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It was once merely about survival. Now it is about claiming
space. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TODAY'S BUZZWORD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``African renaissance'' has been a buzzword in today's South
Africa since newly inaugurated president Thabo Mbeki and former
president and national hero Nelson Mandela adopted it as a mantra
of their administrations.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted South Africa to experience an economic renaissance,
a rebirth into the global economy. They cited it in their speeches,
formed committees to chronicle it and whispered it into the ears of
their citizens until the idea became national ideology, and it
spread to the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Africans, we are the children of the abyss, who have
sustained a backward march for half a millennium,'' said Mbeki in
his inaugural address June 17. ``We have been a source for human
slaves. Our countries were turned into the patrimony of colonial
powers. We have been victim to our own African predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being certain that not always were we the children of the
abyss, we will do what we have to do to achieve our own
renaissance.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRATING FREEDOM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance's dawn is fragmented and still dim in the far
reaches of the country, parts of which are just now receiving
electricity, paved roads, and other modern standbys.
</P>
<P>
   These settlements, where art is chiefly the beadwork of the
Xhosa tribes (an adopted practice fueled by tourism dollars) or the
brightly painted homes of the Ndebele and Venda tribes, are just
poised to enter this century as the rest of the country prepares
for the next.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in juxtaposition, metropolitan South African cities, such as
Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg (where bars even serve a mixed
drink called the ``African renaissance''), are basking in freedom,
experimentation and a celebration of space.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the end of apartheid is evident in the art community,
where contemporary black art increasingly flows: sensory, personal
and free.
</P>
<P>
   Black artists are again sharing exhibition space with white
artists, art supply stores are welcoming patrons of all colors, and
public arts education is again available to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a culture is being reclaimed and revealed through art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid was a politics of space more than anything,'' says
black Johannesburg painter and curator David Koloane. ``Much of the
apartheid legislation was denying people the right to move.''
</P>
<P>
   During apartheid, blacks were not allowed into museums outside
the company of a white, so Koloane never saw the inside of a museum
until he was in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming art is also reclaiming space,'' he says. &QL; 
CAN ART HEAL? &QL; 
The millennium will be a tough time for this quivering country, a
place of 11 official languages; a national anthem sung for the
first time in 1995; and two primary cultures, one black, one white,
each adept at avoiding a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yet folks in and out of the country are looking to art as a
beginning way to make this divide become, instead, a tightly woven
seam.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lydia Puccinelli, curator for the Smithsonian Institution
exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming art in its broadest sense, Koloane sees that black
artists as well as white artists have a way to counteract the
restrictions of the past and deal with each other from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art then provides a place for South Africans to construct
their new, complex and diverse society together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work coming out now is still politically charged.
South Africans such as Koloane and Willie Bester and his
captivity-themed ``The Notorious Green Car'' simply aren't finished
telling the world of how they suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gavin Jantjes and his starscapes, are more
thoughtful and retrospective of apartheid; his work is just sheer
celebration of unlimited, uncontrolled space.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Kay Hassan, whose ``First Time Voters'' is featured at
the Smithsonian exhibit, is writing the post-apartheid history
books with her artwork. She has captured the spirit of a country so
excited about democracy that its citizens are willing to travel for
days and wait in line for hours to exercise the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white South Africans, who always have been the minority,
are left wondering where they stand inside the country's borders;
it is nearly a case of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the black artists, many of the white artists, Sue
Williamson, for example, are fighting to come to terms with the
civil rights movement and are producing work equally critical of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel they've lost their heritage in the new world order.
The African National Congress, Mandela and Mbeki's party, isn't
saying otherwise. At Mbeki's June inauguration celebration in
Pretoria, the memorial statues of white-minority leaders such as
Barry Hertzog and Louis Botha on the grounds of the Union Building
were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, South African art on both sides of the racial divide
is seeping out of Africa, as evidenced by the Smithsonian's
exhibition. Also, plays by South African Athol Fugard have long
been in the world's consciousness; white artist Norman Catherine is
starting to gain acclaim; and as a filmmaker/playwright, William
Kentridge is a buzzword in and of himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual arts front, another black South African exhibit is
planned for the African museum in New York next year, and bits of
art by promising artists are sneaking their way into world-class
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa has yet to have a space at the Venice Biennalle
(basically the Cannes Film Festival of the art world), and,
according to South African National Gallery curator Marilyn Martin,
the government has yet to provide adequate funding for this
renaissance to occur on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That freedom remains as empty as the notion of the
renaissance, until the conditions are created for (black artists)
to fully participate,'' she says. ``And with a funding crisis, how
are we going to close the gap between the haves and the have
nots?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, South Africa on many fronts still has
leagues to cover, but it has progressed far from the days of
ignoring black South African art. &QL; 
TROUBLED PAST &QL; 
During the apartheid regime, this art was given only sympathetic
attention, rarely exhibited, and certainly not encouraged with
publicly funded education. School cost dearly, and that was money
black South Africans didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate social engineering,'' says Davies, now
chiefly a painter, ``a way to keep the black person in his place.
We were not given education that would allow us to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black South Africans were not allowed to leave the
country without special permission during apartheid, the only
available training was found in workshops like Koloane's, called
``Thupelo'' in South Africa, which means ``teaching by example.''
His workshop has now spread throughout the continent, reaching
would-be artists hungry for training, and even into India.
</P>
<P>
   At clinics like these, artists were trained to create art from
limited means, as finding supplies was a hefty undertaking. During
apartheid, blacks had to use different entrances to art supply
shops, pay at different counters, and were often not allowed inside
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the cost of supplies, which were largely not
affordable by any standard to blacks, most of whom were herded into
large concentration camplike structures on the edges of the cities
called townships: basically large dormitories that cleared the
white cities of those they saw as less than human.
</P>
<P>
   Township residents were bused to jobs in mines or factories and
paid beggars' wages, barely enough for clothing and food, let alone
oil and canvas. Yet the black South African culture triumphed even
over this, using industrial, cast-off material that was nothing
more than urban trash to create a genre called township art that
emerged in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children twisted spent soda cans into miniature
antique vehicles, wove frayed telephone wires into baskets, braided
plastic shopping bags into rugs, and sold them in the cities to
tourists to bring in extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Painted murals decorated the seedy township walls _ one of the
less censored ways many of those inside had to express their
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Theater troupes wrote and performed plays about white government
officials being tortured and killed. A movement called Soweto
poetry emerged that chronicled the horrors of living in townships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this politically charged artwork was either confiscated,
censored or destroyed, but not before people saw it, and not before
the government heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, the township art played a key role in
overthrowing apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was so passionate, so threatening, so overtly
political and hard to ignore, that the white culture, lead by the
National Party's F.W. de Klerk, either began to understand that
black oppression was a crime against man, or became so apprehensive
about the impending civil war intoned in the work and political
climate that they gave in. With this idea in their minds (or gun to
their heads) the National Party dismantled apartheid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, a country breathed. &QL; 
`NO LONGER ASHAMED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go now into the art world and know I no longer have to
bypass my color,'' says Davies, who spent many of his 11 years in
Robben Island's infamous jail at the side of Nelson Mandela. ``I
can express myself as a person, not just as a a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Koloane, who also was once imprisoned, his crime was not
carrying the card that dictated his access into white-only areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can embrace what my African brothers are doing. I no
longer have those doors closed for me. I can wake up and know that
there's nobody watching me. I can walk in any shop without being
told that I have to use a separate entrance; I am no longer ashamed
to say that I am South African, and that has changed my art.'' &QL;

ROADWAY REPRESENTS PROGRESS FOR SOME, HEARTACHE FOR OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Rita Hinson sat on her front porch nursing a
cold drink in central Kansas City. She had the day off from work.
In years past, she had spent a day like this visiting her aunt
several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   But not anymore. Not with Bruce R. Watkins Drive dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, another stretch of the long-planned, long-delayed,
north-south roadway is scheduled to open, this one from 47th to
31st streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some urban dwellers nearby can hardly wait. They'll be able to
zip south and back quicker. They'll be able to reach jobs a lot
easier by car.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some like Hinson, living just east of the roadway, are
experiencing an unexpected side effect of Watkins Drive. They're
feeling boxed in, trapped, isolated. They're not traveling west as
much as before. They're losing touch with the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas City, it may be a case of history repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, interstate highways cut through and divided
neighborhoods here and across urban America. The highways created
detached, disconnected and ``devalued'' districts, in the words of
Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some residents east of the opened and unopened stretches of
Watkins Drive are sending similar signals of distress. All because
of a three-block-wide gouge through the middle of Kansas City's
urban fabric.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gouge with bridges or crossroads about every four blocks
and dead-end streets in between. It's a gouge that presents
physical barriers and mental boundaries _ all while Kansas City is
trying to reconnect neighborhoods with endeavors such as community
policing and new streetlights.
</P>
<P>
   Hinson doesn't have a car. She used to walk west on 45th Street
across her Ivanhoe neighborhood to her aunt's house. Now it's
across the Watkins divide. Getting there means going a half-mile
out of her way. So she doesn't go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm less connected to that side and more oriented toward
Prospect now,'' Hinson said.
</P>
<P>
   What she's experiencing is not what state transportation
officials had in mind when Watkins Drive was devised as a more
direct connection between downtown and the south part of town. It
was intended for commuters and for better police and ambulance
response times.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees the roadway has fulfilled those promises,
even in its uncompleted state. Its side effect, though, is not so
easily measured. It's not documented in any government studies or
the subject of any community meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But residents say it's there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing people speak of Bruce Watkins Drive in similar
tones that were spoken about I-70, that I-70 came in and disrupted
the community,'' said former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, pastor of a
central-city church originally displaced by that interstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resentment I hear is that every major roadway is planned
through the black community for the convenience of suburbanites,
who are mostly white. It adds to the paranoia of the black
community that things are always planned to damage us.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Like steak trimmings  &LR; tx:Look at a map of urban Kansas
City, stretching from the Missouri River to roughly 75th Street,
and you'll see interstates carved along the edges like trimmings on
a steak.
</P>
<P>
   What was mostly carved, though, were hardy neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 35 ran through the West Side. To the north, the
downtown loop and Interstate 29 cut into Columbus Park. To the
east, Interstate 70 snaked along the edge of Northeast and
Washington Wheatley. And on the south, Interstate 435 veered past
Eastwood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, spanning from the 1950s through the 1970s, the new
roads disturbed the neighborhoods' cohesiveness, their sense of
community.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the West Side. Walter Roseburrough has lived there
since World War II. At the time groceries, pharmacies, even shoe
repair shops dotted the neighborhood, but not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   A lot changed in a half-century _ suburbanization and urban
decline, primarily _ but Roseburrough also pinned some of the blame
on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the interstate went through, it cut up the neighborhood
pretty bad,'' said Roseburrough, 79. ``It kind of isolated us as
being a small group of homes in this area, and there weren't many
streets going through to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of lonely down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Mary Therese Carroll heard similar sentiments for
years in Northeast and Columbus Park. Limited access across the
highway. A sense of separation from the city's vitality. And the
perception that city services slacked off as a result of the
artificial barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that happen ..., like freeways, that
people don't realize what has happened until years go by, and by
then the damage is done,'' said Carroll, whose family has operated
a funeral home on Independence Avenue since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1961, urban sociologist Jane Jacobs recognized in
/{The Death and Life of Great American Cities/} that ``frequent
borders,'' such as highways, could ``tear a city to tatters.'' And
just last year, Milwaukee's Norquist observed in /{The Wealth of
Cities/} that ``instead of enhancing cities, freeways devalue
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins Drive was supposed to be different.
</P>
<P>
   At first, however, when the City Council in 1968 narrowly
approved an inner-city route instead of one adjacent to the Country
Club Plaza, then-Mayor Ilus Davis called it ``a monumental piece of
bad planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Then inner-city residents tied up the project in court. Their
lawsuit finally was settled in 1985, with residents gaining a voice
in the planning process. Those residents, that is, who remained and
weren't among the roughly 10,000 people displaced in the roadway's
10-mile path.
</P>
<P>
   So design adjustments were made. Stoplights were added at some
intersections. The speed limit was set at 45 mph instead of 55 mph
through the center city. Limestone and wrought iron dressed up the
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But even the neighborhoods' ombudsman, Mamie Hughes,
acknowledged ``the mission of the highway department is not to
build boulevards.'' Indeed, the roadway retained the look and feel
of a highway _ ribbons of concrete with a grassy median, access
drives along the sides, green signage on poles and, of course,
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me that 30 years later we haven't learned the
lessons of the mistakes made in the '50s and '60s,'' said Robert
Lake, an urban land-use professor at Rutgers University. ``Highways
that go through cities cut off the lifeblood of a lot of
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical barrier is very real. What was a unified urban
street pattern with easy access becomes chopped up. Kids can't move
around as easily as before, and retail loses part of its market.
Those are very real consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those real consequences is something noted by Margery
Austin Turner of the Urban Institute think tank in Washington:
``The minority neighborhoods get increasingly distant from where
the action is,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Changing habits  &LR; tx:One recent morning, Johnnie Dillard
bounded out of his house on South Benton.
</P>
<P>
   It's around the corner from 52nd Street, where three
diamond-shaped red signs form the street's dead-end on the east
side of where Watkins Drive opened earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard and his mother, Doshie Moore, climbed into their car.
They were headed east.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do more stuff out east more,'' Dillard said. ``We still go
west, but we don't go as much anymore. You can't get over there.
53rd Street used to go over. I doesn't anymore. 54th Street used to
go over. It doesn't anymore. And on 55th Street, there are so many
(traffic) lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go that way for grocery shopping. Now we go to 63rd
Street in Raytown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot more difficult to get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   On another day, in a different neighborhood, along the same side
of Watkins Drive, 17-year-old Glenn Thomas walked home toward 44th
Street and Garfield Avenue. He was coming from the east.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and his buddies used to follow 44th Street farther west
to buy fast food along Troost Avenue. Now they have to cross one of
the bridges instead. It takes longer. So they don't go over there
as often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing more stuff on this side than that side,'' Thomas
said. ``We'll go to the fast-food store on Prospect and the park on
Brooklyn. Instead of going all the way around, we just go over
here.''
</P>
<P>
   While these residents change habits and shift directions, nearby
businesses hardly notice.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the hamburger joint Thomas now frequents on
Prospect reports stable sales. The manager of a neighborhood
grocery along Swope Parkway by Dillard's home reports the same
thing. It's a stable area, after all, long past the ravages of
suburban flight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other residents and entrepreneurs near Watkins Drive
eagerly await the rest of the roadway opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more convenient for me,'' said Alan Young, a home
remodeler who uses the roadway to reach building material stores to
the north and south.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something new and different for Kansas City,'' said Sarah
Mitchell, whose home on 30th Street overlooks another set of
diamond-shaped signs denoting a dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any facility like this is a benefit when you allow increased
mobility, when people can get around better. It boosts the
economics of the region,'' added Dale Ricks, assistant district
engineer for the Missouri Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   For all those hailing the roadway's progress, however, there are
others lamenting its mere presence, such as Rita Hinson on her
front porch in Ivanhoe.
</P>
<P>
   Her 17-year-old son burst out of the house and said goodbye,
followed by her 10-year-old daughter. They were headed out to catch
a bus and watch a movie on the Country Club Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the front walk, though, the two stopped and turned
back toward the house. It was 4:03 p.m. The bus came at 4:09 p.m.
Because of Watkins Drive, the bus stop moved a few blocks farther
from the house _ and the two weren't going to get there in just six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, that's just what I was talking about,'' Hinson said. ``By
the time they'd have walked to the bus, they'd have missed it. Now
they're not going to go. I guess it's the Plaza's loss.''

BLACK SOUTH AFRICA FINDS VOICE IN FREEDOM FOLLOWING APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVING IN ``E'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; It was night in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Never had the starry sky seemed so large to Lionel Davies until
that instant in 1964 when he was no longer free.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the heavens from his cell on South Africa's Robben
Island, this prisoner of apartheid could see the freedom of the
world reflected in the stars, almost taunting him with their
inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would be in prison for the next 11 years, put there for the
``crime'' of protesting apartheid, one of hundreds of black people
imprisoned during the 44 years of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Davies only hoped that one day he would again stand under that
sky as a man equal to the world, and not as a black South African
activist imprisoned by cultural fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We were the pariahs of our world,'' Davies says. ``It was
humiliating to be black at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years later, apartheid has ended, Davies and others have
been released and South Africa's art world is waking from its long
night's sleep of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and the country's other black artists, realizing they're
no longer limited by their country's horizon, are celebrating with
an outpouring of art that is being heralded as an African
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The awakening is evident not only in their own country, but
globally; the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., opened
an exhibit this summer, the first significant exhibit in America
ever to be dedicated solely to South African art. That in itself is
an illustration of the renaissance's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally destroyed by apartheid and prison,'' says
Davies, now 63. ``But I searched for direction, and I discovered
making art. I learned to paint and to draw, and that transformed my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the idea of an African renaissance is all about:
the divine human gift of creation and the right of a person,
regardless of color, to share the product of that creation with the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It's about excavating a culture strangled by years of white
colonial rule and nourishing and encouraging the remains.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a country that has always hugged tight to the Cape of
Good Hope, dreaming of discovering itself, finding ''fortitude and
soul in time to accompany the world into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It was once merely about survival. Now it is about claiming
space. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TODAY'S BUZZWORD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``African renaissance'' has been a buzzword in today's South
Africa since newly inaugurated president Thabo Mbeki and former
president and national hero Nelson Mandela adopted it as a mantra
of their administrations.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted South Africa to experience an economic renaissance,
a rebirth into the global economy. They cited it in their speeches,
formed committees to chronicle it and whispered it into the ears of
their citizens until the idea became national ideology, and it
spread to the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Africans, we are the children of the abyss, who have
sustained a backward march for half a millennium,'' said Mbeki in
his inaugural address June 17. ``We have been a source for human
slaves. Our countries were turned into the patrimony of colonial
powers. We have been victim to our own African predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being certain that not always were we the children of the
abyss, we will do what we have to do to achieve our own
renaissance.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRATING FREEDOM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renaissance's dawn is fragmented and still dim in the far
reaches of the country, parts of which are just now receiving
electricity, paved roads, and other modern standbys.
</P>
<P>
   These settlements, where art is chiefly the beadwork of the
Xhosa tribes (an adopted practice fueled by tourism dollars) or the
brightly painted homes of the Ndebele and Venda tribes, are just
poised to enter this century as the rest of the country prepares
for the next.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in juxtaposition, metropolitan South African cities, such as
Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg (where bars even serve a mixed
drink called the ``African renaissance''), are basking in freedom,
experimentation and a celebration of space.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the end of apartheid is evident in the art community,
where contemporary black art increasingly flows: sensory, personal
and free.
</P>
<P>
   Black artists are again sharing exhibition space with white
artists, art supply stores are welcoming patrons of all colors, and
public arts education is again available to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a culture is being reclaimed and revealed through art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid was a politics of space more than anything,'' says
black Johannesburg painter and curator David Koloane. ``Much of the
apartheid legislation was denying people the right to move.''
</P>
<P>
   During apartheid, blacks were not allowed into museums outside
the company of a white, so Koloane never saw the inside of a museum
until he was in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming art is also reclaiming space,'' he says. &QL; 
CAN ART HEAL? &QL; 
The millennium will be a tough time for this quivering country, a
place of 11 official languages; a national anthem sung for the
first time in 1995; and two primary cultures, one black, one white,
each adept at avoiding a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Yet folks in and out of the country are looking to art as a
beginning way to make this divide become, instead, a tightly woven
seam.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lydia Puccinelli, curator for the Smithsonian Institution
exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming art in its broadest sense, Koloane sees that black
artists as well as white artists have a way to counteract the
restrictions of the past and deal with each other from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art then provides a place for South Africans to construct
their new, complex and diverse society together,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work coming out now is still politically charged.
South Africans such as Koloane and Willie Bester and his
captivity-themed ``The Notorious Green Car'' simply aren't finished
telling the world of how they suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Gavin Jantjes and his starscapes, are more
thoughtful and retrospective of apartheid; his work is just sheer
celebration of unlimited, uncontrolled space.
</P>
<P>
   Artist Kay Hassan, whose ``First Time Voters'' is featured at
the Smithsonian exhibit, is writing the post-apartheid history
books with her artwork. She has captured the spirit of a country so
excited about democracy that its citizens are willing to travel for
days and wait in line for hours to exercise the right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Now, white South Africans, who always have been the minority,
are left wondering where they stand inside the country's borders;
it is nearly a case of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the black artists, many of the white artists, Sue
Williamson, for example, are fighting to come to terms with the
civil rights movement and are producing work equally critical of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Others feel they've lost their heritage in the new world order.
The African National Congress, Mandela and Mbeki's party, isn't
saying otherwise. At Mbeki's June inauguration celebration in
Pretoria, the memorial statues of white-minority leaders such as
Barry Hertzog and Louis Botha on the grounds of the Union Building
were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, South African art on both sides of the racial divide
is seeping out of Africa, as evidenced by the Smithsonian's
exhibition. Also, plays by South African Athol Fugard have long
been in the world's consciousness; white artist Norman Catherine is
starting to gain acclaim; and as a filmmaker/playwright, William
Kentridge is a buzzword in and of himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the visual arts front, another black South African exhibit is
planned for the African museum in New York next year, and bits of
art by promising artists are sneaking their way into world-class
museums.
</P>
<P>
   But South Africa has yet to have a space at the Venice Biennalle
(basically the Cannes Film Festival of the art world), and,
according to South African National Gallery curator Marilyn Martin,
the government has yet to provide adequate funding for this
renaissance to occur on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That freedom remains as empty as the notion of the
renaissance, until the conditions are created for (black artists)
to fully participate,'' she says. ``And with a funding crisis, how
are we going to close the gap between the haves and the have
nots?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Martin, South Africa on many fronts still has
leagues to cover, but it has progressed far from the days of
ignoring black South African art. &QL; 
TROUBLED PAST &QL; 
During the apartheid regime, this art was given only sympathetic
attention, rarely exhibited, and certainly not encouraged with
publicly funded education. School cost dearly, and that was money
black South Africans didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate social engineering,'' says Davies, now
chiefly a painter, ``a way to keep the black person in his place.
We were not given education that would allow us to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black South Africans were not allowed to leave the
country without special permission during apartheid, the only
available training was found in workshops like Koloane's, called
``Thupelo'' in South Africa, which means ``teaching by example.''
His workshop has now spread throughout the continent, reaching
would-be artists hungry for training, and even into India.
</P>
<P>
   At clinics like these, artists were trained to create art from
limited means, as finding supplies was a hefty undertaking. During
apartheid, blacks had to use different entrances to art supply
shops, pay at different counters, and were often not allowed inside
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the cost of supplies, which were largely not
affordable by any standard to blacks, most of whom were herded into
large concentration camplike structures on the edges of the cities
called townships: basically large dormitories that cleared the
white cities of those they saw as less than human.
</P>
<P>
   Township residents were bused to jobs in mines or factories and
paid beggars' wages, barely enough for clothing and food, let alone
oil and canvas. Yet the black South African culture triumphed even
over this, using industrial, cast-off material that was nothing
more than urban trash to create a genre called township art that
emerged in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children twisted spent soda cans into miniature
antique vehicles, wove frayed telephone wires into baskets, braided
plastic shopping bags into rugs, and sold them in the cities to
tourists to bring in extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Painted murals decorated the seedy township walls _ one of the
less censored ways many of those inside had to express their
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Theater troupes wrote and performed plays about white government
officials being tortured and killed. A movement called Soweto
poetry emerged that chronicled the horrors of living in townships.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this politically charged artwork was either confiscated,
censored or destroyed, but not before people saw it, and not before
the government heard the message.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, the township art played a key role in
overthrowing apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was so passionate, so threatening, so overtly
political and hard to ignore, that the white culture, lead by the
National Party's F.W. de Klerk, either began to understand that
black oppression was a crime against man, or became so apprehensive
about the impending civil war intoned in the work and political
climate that they gave in. With this idea in their minds (or gun to
their heads) the National Party dismantled apartheid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, a country breathed. &QL; 
`NO LONGER ASHAMED' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go now into the art world and know I no longer have to
bypass my color,'' says Davies, who spent many of his 11 years in
Robben Island's infamous jail at the side of Nelson Mandela. ``I
can express myself as a person, not just as a a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Koloane, who also was once imprisoned, his crime was not
carrying the card that dictated his access into white-only areas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can embrace what my African brothers are doing. I no
longer have those doors closed for me. I can wake up and know that
there's nobody watching me. I can walk in any shop without being
told that I have to use a separate entrance; I am no longer ashamed
to say that I am South African, and that has changed my art.'' &QL;

JUDGE RULES INTERNET GAMBLING IS WITHIN REACH OF STATE AUTHORITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a case followed closely by law enforcement
agencies across the country, a judge has ruled that New York
authorities were justified in freezing the assets of an Internet
gambling company, even though the company's computers are based
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision disclosed Monday, Justice Charles Ramos of state
Supreme Court in Manhattan said the New York state attorney
general's office, working with federal authorities, was within its
rights last year when it froze $800,000 in assets of World
Interactive Gaming Corp., an Internet gaming company that is based
in Bohemia, N.Y., but has placed its computers in Antigua, a
Caribbean island nation where casino gambling is legal. The
$800,000 represented most of the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos cited the state constitution, which bans gambling, as the
basis for the attorney general's authority and said the company's
Web site created a ``virtual casino within the user's computer
terminal'' in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act of entering the bet and transmitting the information
from New York via the Internet is adequate to constitute gambling
activity within New York state,'' Ramos wrote in his ruling, which
was dated last Thursday and disclosed Monday by Eliot Spitzer, the
state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies have struggled with how to regulate commerce
on the Internet. Internet gambling, in which wagers are placed by
computer, is of special concern to federal authorities because of
its potential for fraud and abuse, and the Internet companies'
seeming ability to defy federal and state laws against gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kesner, chairman of an Internet gambling task force for the
National Association of Attorneys General, which represents law
enforcement officers in all 50 states, said, ``What the judge was
saying was that even though you are on the Internet, you are where
you are. You are not magically transported to Antigua, where
gambling is legal. You are still in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Kesner likened Internet gambling to playing poker over the
telephone. ``You can't see the other guy's hand,'' he said. ``He
says he has four aces and he can prove it to you by sending you a
printout.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Colleluori, a lawyer for World Interactive Gaming, said
the company planned to appeal Ramos' ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Colleluori said that in a 1997 case begun by Spitzer's
predecessor, Dennis Vacco, a state investigator opened a $200
account in a bank in Antigua. She downloaded software from World
Interactive's Web site that allowed her to play blackjack, roulette
and other casino games. The investigator typed in New York State on
her identification form. (The Web site is now inactive.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer server rejects her,'' Colleluori said. ``New York
does not permit gambling. She types in Nevada, where gambling is
legal. The server lets her bet. She bets less than $20. She loses.
The money leaves the bank in Antigua. The entire transaction took
place where? We say Antigua.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cabot, a lawyer for Nevada casinos, said the Minnesota
Supreme Court last year upheld a consumer fraud action against an
Internet gambling company and that this year Missouri sued an Idaho
Indian tribe for putting its lottery on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos also ruled that World Interactive had violated state
securities law by failing to register a sale of stock in the
company that raised $1.8 million in capital for Jeffrey Burton, a
36-year-old stock promoter and president of World Interactive, and
other company officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We failed to register once,'' Colleluori said. ``We'll pay our
fine and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   World Interactive was the central target of a group of nearly 60
gaming companies singled out by Vacco, the Federal Trade
Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a Wall
Street industry group, the North American Securities Administrators
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the FTC alleged in a complaint that World
Interactive misled consumers in its stock offering by claiming it
would ``conservatively'' earn $100 million in its first year.

DESPITE LEAD, RANGERS HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ He had this thick, Rollie Fingers-style
handlebar mustache and if I squinted just right, I got a sense of
an old, flannel uniform hanging loosely on a lean and muscular
frame. A wad of chewing tobacco puffed out his cheek and the front
of his jersey was splattered and stained brown from the dribblings.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing outside Doubleday Field, watching the fans
lining up for autographs from the handful of Hall of Famers who
were there for yesterday's exhibition game between the Rangers and
Royals at the quaint, turn-of-the-century ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   He talked funny, like New Englanders do, and it was hard to get
a read on just how old he was. But the man definitely knew his
baseball. Knew it inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   You from around these parts? I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks seem to think so,'' he said, rocking on his heels
and hooking his thumbs in his belt. ``Came here once a long time
ago. Started tellin' folks how great baseball was. Twarn't much
here then, but I could see the place had prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   He introduced himself as Abner _ I didn't catch a last name _
and it was clear that he loves this game dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ayuh,'' he said around his chaw, pausing to send a stream of
red-brown juice on a direct line between my shoes. ``Read the box
scores ever' day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them Rangers,'' he said, nodding in the direction of the Texas
players in their 1993 uniforms honoring Nolan Ryan's last year as
an active player, ``they might be goin' places.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting you should bring that up, I told him. Things have
certainly changed dramatically for the Rangers in the past week.
There's this eight-game winning streak they've got going at the
same time that the A's, their closest competitor in the American
League West, have seemingly run up a white flag by trading their
best pitcher, Kenny Rogers, to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The ends of his mustache twitched and he rolled a stern and
baleful eye in my direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ayuh,'' he said. ``There's another fool born ever' day. I
wouldn't be fryin' my eggs 'till I got the hens to lay 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken aback, I asked him if he didn't think the Rangers had the
American League West locked up.
</P>
<P>
   They just need to be positioning themselves for the playoffs
now, I suggested, trying to get home-field advantage and somehow
avoid the Yankees in the first round if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankees?'' he said, his eyebrows shooting up under his cap.
``Twarn't so long ago, was it, that folks in your part of the
country dreamed about someday meeting the Yankees in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir. I wouldn't be worryin' about the Yankees, or the
Indians or anybody else just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember 1997? Your Rangers were out of the race and the
Angels, from out there in Southern California, had what, an 11-,
12-game lead in August? Best I remember, it was the Mariners who
won the division, though. Things can change awful fast in this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the Mariners and the Angels who have some decisions to
make, he said. The trade deadline is 11 p.m. Saturday,and rumors
abound that Seattle has first baseman David Segui and pitcher Jeff
Fassero on the block. The Angels are seriously considering
unloading pitcher Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   That would cash both teams' chips for this season, leaving the
Rangers and A's to fight it out for the division flag.
</P>
<P>
   The A's? Without Rogers, I scoffed, they're as cooked as an
overdone ballpark hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head in disgust. Clearly, I wasn't a fast learner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word is,'' he said, leaning close enough to splatter minibombs
of tobacco juice on my new Hall of Fame T-shirt, ``ol' Billy Beane,
their general manager, has said they're goin' to go get somebody
else, somebody better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tired of Rogers squawkin' all the time anyway,
thinkin' about nobody but himself. You watch, boy. They'll make a
deal. I wouldn't be raisin' that AL West flag just yet. Things
changed quick in the Rangers' favor this week, but they could go
the other way just as fast next week.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I conceded, maybe you're right. So should the Rangers pull
the trigger on a trade, add another pitcher before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depends,'' he said. ``Remember this, boy: Keep your powder
dry. You got to be ready for all emergencies. Say the Rangers go on
and make a trade right now, just for the sake of makin' a deal, and
get one of these marginal starters that ever'body's talkin' so much
about. Bunch of good-for-nothin's anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then somebody _ somebody important say, a regular player _
gets hurt. Now you got no ammunition to spend to make what I'd call
a `necesary deal.' Sure, if the price is right, you got to do it.
But I'd make sure it's a deal I can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had to go then, and I watched as he disappeared into
the tunnel heading towards the field. He was, I figured, just
another part of the day's Hall of Fame festivities.
</P>
<P>
   He had almost faded from sight when he turned in the dimness of
the tunnel and lifted a hand to wave. It was then that I realized
just how much Abner looked like Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Mustache and all.

BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE CUE JONES TO LET PAST GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ In fairness to George W. Bush, he would have
been there regardless last weekend in way-out-of-the-way
Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But what a priceless political photo-op, being able to take a
detour on the presidential campaign trail and pal around for two
days with Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Nolan is probably the only sports institution in
Texas with a larger magnetic appeal than the Cowboys. So Bush
seized the moment during the Baseball Hall of Fame festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, however, the Cowboys opened another
training camp here yesterday, and it was almost difficult for even
Jerry Jones to get a word in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a TV newswoman answered her ringing cell phone
during Jerry's state-of-the-franchise media conference and chatted
away for a few minutes. And that was followed by a would-be Van
Cliburn briefly banging away on a noisy piano in an adjacent room
at the Midwestern State University student center.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, celebrities and politicians were definitely missing.
See what happens when you win one playoff game in three years. The
high rollers act like they can't find Wichita Falls. And when only
16 minicams were lined up at the back of the room, the TV types
reported it was by far the smallest collection of cameras for a
camp opener since the Cowboys started training in Texas in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The glory days, although not that long ago, are obviously fading
fast in some hearts and minds. And the beautiful people always jump
ship first.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking on behalf of Mr. Jones _ he made no request for me
to do so _ let it also be said that Jerry himself has began to
distance himself from those glory days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a valid criticism,'' Jones answered firmly
yesterday when asked if he had erred in trying to hold on to the
dynasty personnel of the mid-'90s for too long.
</P>
<P>
   But you did, Jerry, whether you admit it or not.
</P>
<P>
   And Jones with plenty of obvious input from Chan Gailey and the
coaching staff, is moving quickly in another direction. Many key
pieces from the Jimmy Johnson era remain in place and are still
vital, but of the old guard, only quarterback Troy Aikman has not
been given notice to upgrade his performance, or else.
</P>
<P>
   Like with Emmitt Smith one summer ago. Once challenged, Emmitt
responded with a very good bounce-back season in 1998. And Jones
quickly pointed out yesterday the Smith example at running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good players \Rin the glory seasons\S, and we did keep
that core group,'' he said. ``I think it warranted us hanging on to
as many of the old group as possible as opposed to looking for a
quick change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as training camp opens, it's receiver Michael Irvin who is
on notice to upgrade. The fact that Irvin didn't receive a contract
extension, and won't receive one, is the only explanation necessary
concerning his current iffy status with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In the off-season, Nate Newton was moved out. Last summer, it
was Bill Bates, Tony Tolbert, Herschel Walker and Mark Tuinei who
were no longer players.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is the Gailey influence on Jones. Much of this is
also Jones breaking the old ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the Cowboys have a terrific head coach in Chan,''
Jones said. ``And people all over the league constantly volunteer
to me how they think we really have something in Chan. The reason I
remain optimistic we can return to where we once were is because of
Chan and Troy Aikman.''
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion of slippage from Troy brings a quick reply from
Jones:
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy hasn't slipped. We've slipped some in the cast of players
we've put around him.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the second season of Jerry and Jimmy
(1990), the Cowboys are a team in transition. That is why by far
the boldest free-agent plunge of the Jones administration came in
the off-season. And it was a good haul.
</P>
<P>
   That is also why more emphasis has been placed on the past two
college drafts than at any time since the Super Bowl runs began.
Remember, it was only four Aprils ago when the Cowboys' public
stance for the draft was to acquire a cheap, backup-type labor
force. It was a franchise that mistakenly thought it already had it
all, and that the winning would go on forever and the party would
never end _ excuse me, Robert Earl Keen.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys will put on the Midwestern State University
practice fields over the next week is a better team (pending the
Deion-Leon defensive questions) and a more focused team. At least
when compared to the past two summers.
</P>
<P>
   Football-wise, things are changing in a positive way. But until
the proof comes from September through January, neither the
beautiful people nor a George W. Bush will be seeking photo-ops in
Wichita Falls.

HATE CRIMES AGAINST HISPANICS ON THE RISE, SAYS GROUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Fueled by the anti-immigrant battles that raged for
most of this decade, hate crimes and harassment against Hispanics
are on the rise, according to a report released Monday by the
National Council of La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as if open season has been declared on our
community,'' said La Raza President Raul Yzaguirre during the
group's annual convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``These crimes are not only perpetrated by hate groups but also
include acts of systemic discrimination and violence by ordinary
citizens and those in law enforcement whose job it is to serve and
protect Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This behavior is especially troublesome because it suggests
that, increasingly, hate is being mainstreamed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the first year in which federal hate-crime statistics
were reported, there were 472 anti-Hispanic incidents reported. In
1995, the number increased to 516 and, in 1996, it jumped again to
564.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest year reported, more than 600 anti-Hispanic
hate crimes were documented across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 Hispanic churches also are currently on the list of
suspected arson sites to be investigated by the National Church
Arsons Task Force and the National Coalition for Burned Churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue is a simple question,'' Yzaguirre said. ``Do Hispanic
Americans have the right to drive the streets, attend places of
worship and otherwise live their lives free from hate, violence,
harassment and law-enforcement abuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``For the countless Latinos, this report suggests that these
rights are very much in question in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavily anecdotal report titled, ``The Mainstreaming of
Hate,'' details allegations of violent hate crimes, church burnings
and law-enforcement abuse, including the Pedro Oregon Navarro case
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12 of last year, the 22-year-old Hispanic father of two
died in a hail of bullets fired by six Houston police officers who
burst into his bedroom while pursuing an informant's tip of alleged
drug-dealing. Oregon suffered nine gunshot wounds in the back, and
two other shots entered his head from above.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris County grand jury dismissed charges against all but one
of the officers, who was given a misdemeanor charge for criminal
trespass.
</P>
<P>
   While the case is being investigated by the U.S. Department of
Justice for possible civil-rights violations, the La Raza report
singles out these federal officials for special rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick out the most important player in this arena,
it would have to be the Department of Justice,'' said Yzaguirre,
citing its almost unlimited authority to investigate and prosecute
civil-rights violations, including hate crimes and law-enforcement
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also has direct oversight authority over
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which the report
said engaged in ``racial profiling'' by allowing Border Patrol
agents to routinely stop Latino motorists in search of undocumented
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, instead of being part of the solution, the
Department of Justice continues to be more a part of the problem,''
Yzaguirre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fails to prosecute most of of the cases involving Latinos
that come to its attention. It has not ordered its own agencies,
like the INS and the Drug Enforcement Administration, to simply
stop profiling on the basis of race and ethnicity. It continues to
pursue joint operations with local law enforcement, which
inevitably violate civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Hispanics are concerned, it may as well be called
the `Department of Injustice'''
</P>
<P>
   Among factors contributing to the violence and harassment of
Latinos, said the report, are pervasive racism, persistent
stereotyping, negative media portrayals, demographic change,
inter-ethnic tensions and anti-immigrant sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that Latinos are `foreign,' `un-American' or
illegal immigrants has translated into numerous incidents of
discrimination, threats and actual violence involving private
citizens and vigilantes,'' notes the report.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, who comprise 11 percent of the U.S. population and 25
percent of Texans, are expected to surpass blacks as the nation's
largest minority within five years. By the year 2050, demographers
expect one of every four Americans to be Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Yzaguirre called the reported incidents ``the tip of the
proverbial iceberg. After all, we did not go looking for them. They
found us.''

HOUSE SPENDERS LOOK FOR BOOKKEEPING MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
  (With CONGRESS-SPEND) 
 (ms) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Critical elements in the House Republican strategy
to pass big domestic spending bills became clear Monday night: a
little smoke, a few well-placed mirrors and, presto, billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is opening a bag of accounting tricks to try to pass
major bills for veterans, housing, labor, education and other
agencies before the scheduled August recess and without appearing
to break lawful caps on spending.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. C.W.
Bill Young, Republican of Florida, calls the tactic ``looking for a
pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. David R. Obey of
Wisconsin, calls it ``an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders decided to designate $3 billion for
veterans' benefits as ``emergency spending,'' meaning it would not
count against the budget caps Congress imposed on itself in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency money _ with $1 billion specifically earmarked for
the Veterans Medical Health Service _ materialized hours after Vice
President Al Gore announced that the administration would seek an
extra $1 billion for veterans' health care this year.
</P>
<P>
   The money would come from $3 billion in borrowing power
possessed by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the federal agency
created in the Depression to provide electricity for the rural
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Untapped borrowing power is not the same as cash, Young conceded
in an interview. ``We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' he said.
``Trouble is, Paul doesn't have anything more to rob.''
</P>
<P>
   Another appropriations subcommittee decided last week to count
the costs of the 2000 census _ $4.5 billion _ as another
``emergency,'' though little in the national agenda could be less
unpredictable. The Constitution mandates that the census to be
taken every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit odd to consider it an emergency for the
first time'' in history, said the White House budget director, Jack
Lew.
</P>
<P>
   The creative accounting came Monday night as the Appropriations
subcommittee governing the Veterans Administration, the Department
of Housing and Urban Development and other federal agencies drafted
its $70 billion spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The process was ``nothing short of a roller-coaster ride,'' said
the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. James T. Walsh, Republican of New
York. ``We are now going over that first big steep scary drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Obey described the plunge differently. ``We're jumping off a
building,'' he said. ``We're all right so far, but I worry about
what happens when we hit the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, striving to keep a public
promise, has ordered the appropriators and House Republicans to
pass all 13 spending bills required by law before the recess on
Aug. 6. He threatens to keep the House in session until the bills
pass.
</P>
<P>
   This will require finding additional billions in unexpected
places, in order to finance bills for labor, education and other
programs, without appearing to exceed the budgetary caps.
</P>
<P>
   If the spending bills are not passed by Sept. 30, Congress faces
the embarrassment of huge and unruly last-minute spending bills or
another government shutdown.

IRVIN MAY GET REST; DEFENSE MAY GET HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Jerry Jones and Chan Gailey sat
shoulder-to-shoulder at the team's training-camp-commencement news
conference yesterday, fielding questions and sounding an awful lot
like an owner and head coach who fully intend to not only hit the
ground running, but to hit the ground running with players who want
to be here.
</P>
<P>
   This being their second training camp at Midwestern State
University, and their second season under Gailey, the Cowboys
realized they don't need to pussyfoot to the starting line this
time around. Management has reported to camp with an noticeable
edge on its game.
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines, you get the sense that the Cowboys
want to play this season on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was asked about Michael Irvin, whose role at age 33 has
been the source of considerable speculation this off-season, and
Gailey simply maintained that what's good for Irvin is what's good
for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Irvin is a starting wide receiver; that's his role,''
Gailey said. ``I think it's smart for us that the older \RIrvin\S
gets, the more we should try to rest him so that he can be fresher
at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The same consideration was made for running back Emmitt Smith
last season, although Smith ended up with 1,332 yards on 319 rushes
in 1998 because backup Chris Warren missed seven games with a groin
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we talked about \Rresting\S Emmitt last year, which
we tried to do,'' Gailey said. ``We were somewhat successful. We
just didn't keep Chris \RWarren\S as healthy as we wanted, but
that's part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is a very hard worker. I would like to see him get the
work in, but to be smart about it, too. If he can take care of
himself, and we can help him take care of his body ... the older he
is getting, he can be very productive throughout the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin arrived yesterday, along with rookies and selected
veterans. The rest of the veterans are scheduled to report
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he was here already, Irvin told reporters, ``I'm
here because Chan told me to be here,'' then added that he doesn't
expect his role to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have the same role I've always had,'' said Irvin, who
had 74 catches for 1,057 yards but only one touchdown last season.
``If I have a reduced role, it'll be me not practicing one day or
taking reduced reps.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth of the matter is, right now, only Gailey knows what Gailey
has in mind for Irvin in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Michael goes out and plays unbelievably great, it will be
hard to take him out of the game,'' Gailey said. ``Just like when
Emmitt is running for 200 yards, it's hard to take him out of the
game. But at the same time, you have to understand the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense, where the Cowboys will be trying to improve upon a
disappointing pass rush that produced four sacks in their final
five games, Jones let it be known that he doesn't plan to stand pat
between now and the start of the regular season Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chance that we might bring in a veteran defensive
lineman between the end of training camp and before the start of
the season to see if he can fit in and contribute,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a player would probably come from the waiver list, and
later rather than sooner, because the better players will be among
teams' final cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a Cowboys defense that figures to open the season
without cornerback Deion Sanders (rehabilitating after toe surgery)
and defensive tackle Leon Lett (under indefinite suspension for
substance abuse)?
</P>
<P>
   Said Gailey: ``I'm not as worried as everyone else seems to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jones: ``Deion has been running hard on machines,'' Jones
said. ``And now, he will begin running without machines and doing a
lot of straight-ahead running. He's making progress. I've also been
told that we won't know any more until he starts pushing off ...
starts cutting ... getting into \Rgame\S situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' 1999 draft class was supposed to be signed and on
the field this morning. It seemed that it took a deadline to force
any progress. The team's top two picks, defensive end Ebenezer
Ekuban and offensive tackle Solomon Page, remained unsigned but
were close going into last night.
</P>
<P>
   Contract ``issues should not, in my view, keep a rookie from
being here on time with as much at stake as a rookie has at
stake,'' Jones said. ``I look at that. If an individual or his
representatives can't see how important it is for a rookie to get
in here ... well, we mark that down someplace for the future.''

 &HT;    Jewell libel case focuses on public figure question
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attorneys in Richard Jewell's lawsuit against The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution argued in court Monday over a key
question that will determine how far the former security guard must
go to prove the newspaper libeled him after the fatal bombing in
Centennial Olympic Park three years ago today.
</P>
<P>
   Was Jewell a public figure when the newspaper identified him as
a suspect?
</P>
<P>
   If so, Jewell faces a much harder standard in proving the
newspaper defamed him in a series of articles that, he says,
portrayed him as a strange person who was probably guilty of
setting off the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the burden he must meet to continue this case,''
Jewell attorney Lin Wood told Fulton County State Court Judge John
Mather during a two-hour hearing. ``Richard Jewell can defeat The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution if given the opportunity to present
the truth under a fair burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Mather did not indicate when he will rule, calling the issue
``arguably more important'' than what previously has consumed the 2
1/2-year-old case. Mather last month ordered two reporters jailed
until they reveal confidential sources, but they remain free while
the newspaper appeals.
</P>
<P>
   A private person claiming libel must prove a news organization
was negligent in reporting information that was false and damaging.
But a public figure must prove malice, which means a news
organization knew or suspected it was reporting harmful falsehoods
and acted with reckless disregard.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell, who made his first court appearance in the case Monday,
was working as a park security guard when the bomb exploded,
killing one person, contributing to the death of another and
injuring 111.
</P>
<P>
   He initially was hailed for spotting the knapsack that contained
the explosive and in the next three days gave 10-12 interviews to
TV and print media, including CNN, NBC's ``Today'' show and the
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of July 30, 1996, the newspaper reported that
Jewell was under suspicion by federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department cleared Jewell of any wrongdoing in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He sued the newspaper in January 1997, seeking tens of millions
of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. To win a punitive
award, given by juries to punish defendants, Jewell will have to
prove malice regardless of Mather's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Sean R. Smith, an attorney for the newspaper, said Jewell became
a public figure by reporting the knapsack and clearing away
spectators, and again by granting interviews. Further, he said,
Jewell was not only a public figure but a public official, since he
was acting as a police officer during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said that was ``ludicrous'' because Jewell was working for
a private security company and not the government. He insisted
Jewell remained a private figure until a September ``60 Minutes''
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Previous interviews were mostly arranged by AT&AMP;T, which employed
the security firm that hired Jewell for the Games, Wood said. And
in them, Jewell mostly discussed what he saw the morning of the

 &HT;    High school band to Sydney: G'day!
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Band members from Walton High School in Cobb County,
Ga. will not travel to Australia for the 2000 Olympics after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Walton band and the Fayette County High band had been
invited to perform during the Opening Ceremony, but Olympic
officials withdrew the invitations after Australians protested the
decision to include foreigners in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Talerico, a Walton band parent who was a coordinator of the
trip, said the students' parents decided at a meeting Sunday to
decline Australian officials' subsequent offer for the band to
participate at other, lesser events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish the Australians all the luck in the world with their
Olympics,'' Talerico said.
</P>
<P>
   John Moore, a marketing executive with the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games, apologized in person to Cobb and
Fayette parents. Other options offered included performing at the
Sydney Opera House, in the Olympic torch relay ceremonies and at
the opening of the soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another context, it might be deemed to be a wonderful
trip,'' Talerico said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Beard, Fayette County High band director, has said his
band parents were yet considering the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, World Projects Corp. of California, which arranged
the band trip, has asked the New South Wales Supreme Court to
enforce its performance agreement with Sydney's Olympic committee.
The company said it stands to lose $1.95 million and suffer damage
to its reputation if the agreement is not honored.
</P>
<P>
   Talerico said Walton band families have had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fatigue setting in,'' he said. ``We're ready to move
on. We have to move on. We'll do something else.''

SAN FRANCISCO LETS AT&AMP;T BAR CABLE ACCESS TO RIVALS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the latest skirmish of what has become a
national fight, the Board of Supervisors here declined Monday night
to compel AT&AMP;T to open its cable television system to competing
providers of high-speed Internet access like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The action, on a vote of 9 to 2, followed a day of negotiations
among the supervisors, the company and lobbyists of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco was the latest battleground in a lobbying effort _
at the federal and local levels, in the courts and before
regulatory agencies _ to determine who will provide high-speed
Internet access over cable television lines and on what terms.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals like America Online and local telephone companies are
making the case that high-speed Internet service should be more
like long distance service and that the company providing the
connection should not have a monopoly or undue advantage in
providing service.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators like AT&AMP;T contend that there will be little
financial incentive for them to upgrade cable systems to provide
Internet service if their systems merely become a gateway to other
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Although AT&AMP;T prevailed here, the supervisors did require the
company, as a condition of its assuming the cable franchises of
Tele-Communications Inc., to upgrade its cable system to digital
technology within four years. And the supervisors reserved the
right to revisit the issue.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T spokesman, James R. Peterson, said it would cost $50
million to upgrade San Francisco's cable infrastructure to digital
technology permitting high-speed Internet connections and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased to obtain the transfer of control without
imposition of cable and bundling requirements,'' Scott Morris,
AT&AMP;T's vice president for local government relations, said after
Monday night's vote. ``We now have the opportunity to make the
investments we want to make.''
</P>
<P>
   On the local level, AT&AMP;T's purchase of the cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc., has provided a strategic wedge for its
opponents, who have sought to make the transfer of TCI's cable
franchises to AT&AMP;T contingent on what they are calling ``open
access'' to high-speed Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Their first victory came in December in Portland, Ore., which
approved precisely such terms. In early June, a federal judge in
Portland upheld the move. The decision is on appeal to the Ninth
Circuit and is being watched closely, with AT&AMP;T contending that the
federal government, not local governments, should regulate
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Broward County, Fla., voted to require AT&AMP;T
and MediaOne to open their cable systems to competing providers.
And last week, the National Association of Counties, meeting in St.
Louis, passed a resolution backing the right of municipalities to
require open access.
</P>
<P>
   Before its vote Monday night, the 11-member Board of Supervisors
here unanimously passed a resolution supporting open access in
principle.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, proposed by Supervisor Leslie Katz, requires the
city to monitor open-access legislation and legal decisions around
the country and then reconsider the matter in December; an
open-access bill is pending in the California legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Ammiano, the president of the Board of Supervisors, was
not satisfied. He called the board's ultimate action Monday night
``a lot of hocus-pocus and hooey,'' adding, ``So much for open
access.'' He predicted that the issue would ultimately be put to a
local referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Roper, executive director of the Bay Area Open Access
Coalition, a group financed by GTE, Pacific Bell and other
companies that want access to AT&AMP;T's lines, said the member
companies fully intended to compensate AT&AMP;T for access to its cable
lines. ``We're not asking for free access,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for Hands Off the Internet, a group financed by AT&AMP;T,
among others, countered that AOL, GTE and other aspiring high-speed
access providers were spending millions to develop their own
technology and should not be allowed to piggyback on AT&AMP;T's
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a million homes are estimated to have high-speed
Internet service now, typically at about $40 a month, through their
cable or telephone companies. But analysts estimate that the number
will rise to 16 million by the end of 2002, with nearly 80 percent
of those connecting through cable.

METS DEFEAT PIRATES, 7-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With nine victories in 12 decisions this season, Rick
Reed easily possesses the highest winning percentage of any of the
New York Mets' starters. But there is still a chance that Manager
Bobby Valentine will drop Reed from the rotation in the wake of
Kenny Rogers' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   And that chance may have become better based on Reed's
performance on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mets have won nine of Reed's last 10 starts
after roughing up the Pittsburgh Pirates, 7-5, before 32,010 at
Shea Stadium, Reed has looked anything but the pitcher who won 16
games last season and 13 games the season before.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez has looked better, too. He came on in the bottom
of the ninth in a 7-4 game needing three outs for his 11th save. He
struck out Warren Morris on a 3-2 pitch to open the inning but then
threw 13 balls in a row, walking the bases full in the process.
When Benitez walked Al Martin on a full count to force in a run, he
had thrown just 5 of his 24 pitches for strikes, and Valentine had
seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell bailed out both Benitez and Reed out by retiring
the next two batters for his third save. The Mets are a season-high
19 games over .500 at 60-41 after winning their sixth straight
game, and they are a major league best 33-13 since June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who began the day a half-game out of first place in
the National League East, were hoping to overtake the Atlanta
Braves and move into first this late in a season for the first time
since Sept. 3, 1990. But the Braves held on to first by defeating
the Milwaukee Brewers, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are considering who might move from the rotation to the
bullpen because they have six starters after having traded for
Rogers, who will make his first start for his new team on
Wednesday. On Monday night Reed again provided more questions than
answers.
</P>
<P>
   He was staked to leads of 3-0 and 7-2, but the 33-year-old
right-hander could not make it out of the sixth inning. The Mets
are still looking for their first complete game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brant Brown drilled a two-run home run off Reed in the second
inning and Kevin Young launched a shot estimated at 416 feet over
the bleachers in left field in the sixth. Reed has allowed 19
homers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Reed surrendered eight hits and four runs in his five and
two-thirds innings on Monday night, and his earned run average rose
to 4.92. It was 3.48 last season and a stingy 2.89 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Reed walked only one batter on Monday night, but he has been
having trouble with his control. For the year, he has walked 35
batters in 1092/3 innings, compared with 29 walks in 2121/3 innings
last season and 31 walks in 2081/3 innings in 1997. The homers,
which Reed is giving up at a rate of one a game, are another sign
that Reed's control, once almost pinpoint, is off.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lack of endurance: Reed is averaging just five
and two-thirds innings a start.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in Reed's experience in relief earlier in his career, and
Reed could be a logical choice to lose his starter's spot, though
Masato Yoshii and Orel Hershiser are Valentine's other choices to
move to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was saved again on Monday night when the Mets again scored
in bunches behind him. They scored seven runs on six hits and five
walks through the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura and Benny Agbayani led the way with three runs
batted in apiece. Ventura singled in two runs and Agbayani one in a
three-run first. Ventura then walked with the bases loaded and
Agbayani followed with a two-run single in a three-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo banged out three hits. And just when it appeared
Agbayani's batting average would finally slip below .300 _ the
rookie was hitting .500 on May 26, .409 on June 8, .349 on June 19
and an even .300 entering Monday night _ he went 2 for 4 to improve
to .305. The crowd was even back to chanting his first name.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone seems to get hot when Reed takes the mound. The
Mets are 14-5 in Reed's 19 starts and have scored 121 runs, an
average of 6.4 a game. In his last four starts alone, the Mets have
banged out 32 runs, or eight a game.

EPA TO PROPOSE REDUCING USE OF GAS ADDITIVE THAT POLLUTES WATER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS: in 5th graf, inserts Philadelphia, Baltimore, Milwaukee,

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency will propose
that Congress no longer require oil companies to add an ingredient
to gasoline that is meant to make the air cleaner, because it
pollutes water.
</P>
<P>
   A panel appointed by the EPA is set to report on Tuesday that
use of the ingredient, MTBE, should be ``reduced substantially''
because it dissolves easily in water and turns up in tap water when
gasoline has leaked or spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the report was made public, EPA Administrator Carol
Browner said Monday that Americans should have ``both cleaner air
and cleaner water _ and never one at the expense of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner, whose agency in the past has defended MTBE mandates
to critics who said it posed health problems, said that she would
urge Congress to change rules passed in 1990 that require oil
companies to put an ``oxygenate,'' a chemical that incorporates an
oxygen atom, to promote more thorough burning in engines. Most oil
companies chose the ingredient known as MTBE, for methyl tertiary
butyl ether.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress required an oxygenate in nine big metropolitan
areas _ those with the dirtiest air, including New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Houston,
San Diego and Hartford, Conn. _ other communities voluntarily
embraced the use of MTBE, which not only cuts carbon monoxide, as
it was designed to do, but dilutes toxic components of gasoline,
like benzene and toluene.
</P>
<P>
   Experts differ on how much it has done to control carbon
monoxide and smog, but they agree that it has cut air poisons from
gasoline by about 30 percent where it has been used.
</P>
<P>
   But when fuel is spilled or leaks from underground tanks or
pipelines, MTBE dissolves easily in water and flows faster than
other components of gasoline into wells. And microbes in soil that
digest natural hydrocarbons, making them harmless, do not like
MTBE, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the EPA panel's findings calls for Congress to drop
the federal requirement that gasoline sold in the big cities
contain MTBE, and that its use be ``reduced substantially.'' A
summary of the draft did not define substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The draft has been widely circulated and its contents were
confirmed Monday by the panel's chairman, Dan Greenbaum, who is
also president of the Health Effects Institute, a non-profit study
group financed by the EPA and the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said that MTBE ``has been better
for reducing toxics than anybody thought it would be,'' and has
also helped cut carbon monoxide emissions from cars. But newer cars
control carbon monoxide without MTBE, he said, and ``you have to
stack that up against the potential water risk.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows just how many spills there have been, but the panel
report estimates that in places where oxygenates are used, 5 to 10
percent of drinking water supplies show detectable amounts of MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE makes up 3 percent to 5 percent of the national gasoline
supply. If refiners had to make up that volume suddenly with other
components, shortages and price spikes would result, the MTBE
producers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans can be paying more for dirtier air,'' said Terry
Wigglesworth, executive director of the Oxygenated Fuels
Association. A better approach, she said, would be to take steps to
stop leaks and spills, which would protect drinking water from
MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts, noting that MTBE costs significantly more per
gallon than gasoline, say that if the change is made slowly, the
cost of fuel could drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which require oxygenates,
also require a 15 percent reduction in poisons in gasoline. When
the oil companies turned heavily to MTBE, because it contains
oxygen and boosts octane, the result was an unexpected dividend, a
30 percent drop in toxics.
</P>
<P>
   But MTBE has been shown to cause cancer in animals, even though
it is not clear to researchers if those findings are applicable to
people. People can smell MTBE at very low concentrations, and it
makes water smell so bad that most will refuse to drink it.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why California in March ordered oil companies
to phase out the chemical by 2002. Under the Clean Air Act, subject
to the veto of the EPA, California can develop its own clean air
policies because pollution in Los Angeles is worse than in the rest
of the country. The panel will also recommend that Congress clarify
the right of the EPA and the states to regulate gasoline for
environmental reasons that may not add up to a public health
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner said the recommendations ``are expected to confirm
EPA's belief that we must begin to significantly reduce the use of
MTBE in gasoline as quickly as possible, without sacrificing the
gains we've made in achieving cleaner air.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies used MTBE before the Clean Air Act required
oxygenates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, clean octane,'' said Jason Grumet, executive
director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management. ``MTBE is low toxicity and high exposure,'' but is ``a
pesky molecule,'' said Grumet, whose organization comprises the air
pollution commissioners of the six New England states, plus New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress required oxygenates, oil companies turned to MTBE
for 85 percent of their needs. Ethanol or its derivative, ETBE,
which stands for Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, make up most of the
rest. The study to be released Tuesday calls for further study of
those ingredients, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner said that she would like to preserve ``the important
role of renewable fuels like ethanol.'' But experts said that
ethanol production, which is mostly from corn, is far too small to
replace MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol producers have strong political support, including
presidential candidates who want to do well in the farm belt,
including in the important primary state of Iowa.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   When oxygenates were first required by Congress, in 1990,
proponents said that putting oxygen into the liquid fuel would
insure that engines produced more carbon dioxide, and less carbon
monoxide. In the intervening years, most cities have reduced their
carbon monoxide problems, though, and a study by the National
Academy of Science released in May found that neither Ethanol nor
MTBE make much difference in controlling the bigger air pollution
problem from cars _ ground-level ozone, or smog.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey recently won permission from the EPA to stop using
extra MTBE in gasoline in wintertime, because it had solved its
winter carbon monoxide problem, according to Peter K. Page, a
spokesman for the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection.
People complain about the smell of MTBE at the pump, he said, and
``the complaints seemed to correlate with the introduction of
wintertime gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   The winter-time gas had been 2.7 percent oxygen, by weight; the
summertime standards, which the state continues to use, is 2
percent oxygen by weight. Asked about EPA support for dropping the
mandate, Page said, ``That's fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Jennifer K. Post, a spokeswoman for the Department
of Environmental Conservation, said, ``We like it but obviously we
have concerns about it. It's a balancing act.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither New York nor Connecticut has sought to drop MTBE. Maine
has, though, because of concerns about water.
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated gasoline is required to be sold in all or part of
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA panel and Ms. Browner said they do not want MTBE
replaced by toxic components.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything is going to be introduced that replaces MTBE, we
want it to be researched, so we don't get the kind of surprises ...
that we got with MTBE,'' said Page, of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that hardly anything in gasoline was desirable.
``Some day people will look at us driving gasoline-powered cars the
way we look at our ancestors throwing chamber pots out the
window,'' Page said.

SYNCOR DENIES DUPONT CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Medical firm Syncor International Corp. is firing
back against counterfeiting allegations filed in Mexico by DuPont
Pharmaceuticals Co.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Syncor announced Monday it has filed a
defense with Mexican regulators that denies charges it purchased
and sold counterfeit doses of DuPont's Cardiolite, a cardiac
imaging product used to examine blood flow in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Syncor officials also took DuPont to task over the airing of the
charges, which were filed June 17 but announced by DuPont last week
on U.S. news wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stunned that DuPont would see the need to announce a
Mexican situation here in the United States, particularly to make
what we view as false statements regarding the situation,'' said
John S. Baumann, senior vice president and general counsel for
Syncor.
</P>
<P>
   William DeLorbe, an executive vice president at DuPont's Medical
Imaging Division, said the company stands by its charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``DuPont does not file lawsuits capriciously,'' DeLorbe said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government is investigating the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said the patent infringement suit will not affect a
longstanding U.S. Cardiolite distribution agreement between Syncor
and DuPont. Under that agreement, Syncor distributes more than 80
percent of the unit doses of Cardiolite in the United States,
according to Syncor officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst D. Larry Smith estimated U.S. Cardiolite
sales are worth about $250 million and are growing by 25 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Syncor's Mexican operations include just $400,000
in Cardiolite business, Baumann said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican dispute _ technically between a Syncor subsidiary
and DuPont _ bubbled to the surface June 17 when DuPont filed
charges with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property. The
multibillion-dollar company alleged that Syncor illegally purchased
and sold Cardiolite, including counterfeit Cardiolite.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann, the Syncor executive, said his company has DuPont's
permission to distribute unit doses of Cardiolite in Mexico, but
another company, Accesorios Para Laboratories, is authorized to
sell the material in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann said all the Cardiolite his company sells in Mexico is
purchased from either DuPont or Accesorios.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we acquired something that was not Cardiolite,'' Baumann
said, ``it would have been from DuPont or their local
distributor.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont executive DeLorbe confirmed that Syncor has permission to
distribute unit doses of Cardiolite. But he said DuPont's
investigation into the matter supports the counterfeiting charge.
