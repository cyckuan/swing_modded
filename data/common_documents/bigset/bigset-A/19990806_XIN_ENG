<HEADLINE> Rwanda Sells State-Owned Oil company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government stroke a
deal with Shell Oil Company Thursday on selling of Rwanda's
government-run oil company, Petrorwanda, to the company.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Shell Oil Company acquired 19 out of 32
retail service stations previously owned by Petrorwanda, Donald
Kaberuka, Rwandan Minister for Finance and Economic Planning
indicated.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government agreed to lease the Gatsata Depots,
15 km northeast of the capital Kigali, for a period of 30 years,
the Rwanda News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Government shares in Petrorwanda have been divested at 2.1
million U.S.

dollars, whereas the annual lease for Gatsata depots was valued at
51,000 dollars,'' Kaberuka said.
</P>
<P>
Paul Maes, Shell Managing Director, based in Kampala declared
that his company will inject 5 million dollars in the
rehabilitation of the Petrorwanda network.
</P>
<P>
"The sale of the company's assets stems from the heavy losses
that have always been incurred,'' explained Kaberuka.
''Petrorwanda owes the government an outstanding debt of over 3,9
million dollars as indicated by December 1998 audit," he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Petrorwanda started with specific objectives but
later became a financial liability due to corrupt management and
inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
Kaberuka commended Shell Oil Company for its track record
worldwide, saying "Rwandans hope Shell will bring high level of
services, quality, and competition.''
</P>
<P>
Shell is an international oil company with 60 percent of shares
owned by the Netherlands, while 40 percent belong to the British
government.
</P>
<P>
The divestiture of government's shares in Petrorwanda coincided
with the spectacular rise of fuel pump prices Wednesday which had
seriously disrupted transport of people and goods between the
capital and upcountry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Central Bank Staff Threaten to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Workers at the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe Thursday said they have resolved to go on strike over a
45-percent cost of living adjustment across the board to cushion
them against harsh economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Workers Union has written a letter to the bank Governor
Leonard Tsumba saying the employees had unanimously resolved to
strike following lack of progress in the collective bargaining
discussions by the Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
The union said while management maintained that cost of living
increase would be given to those considered to have salaries
within salary scales, the workers' position was that the increase
should be across the board.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the union said, management's position was that
the increase should be based on minimums, while workers maintained
that it should be based on actual situations.
</P>
<P>
"If increases are awarded in terms of the management proposal,
it means the majority of workers would receive increases which are
below 45 percent, with a number of workers receiving no increase
at all.
</P>
<P>
To put it simply, management is proposing an increase based on
a zero percent to 45 percent sliding scale," the union said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Arrests Italian National for Forgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan security forces Tuesday
arrested an Italian for forgery and use of forgeries, the
Prosecutor's Office in Kigali said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''Elio Mufatti, was netted by the Kigali police following
intensive investigation into reports that he was in possession of
many stamps that attracted people's curiosity,'' Emmanuel
Rukangira, the Kigali Prosecutor disclosed to Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Rukangira exhibited 17 different stamps forged by Mufatti which
were found to be copies of some government-owned enterprises like
the Education Ministry printery, some oil companies, and many
hardware shops.
</P>
<P>
The Italian is said to own a fleet of five vehicles which have
 diplomatic plates from Uganda which he was reportedly using to
ferry goods from Uganda to Rwanda without any hindrance at the
customs on the border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the man explained himself arguing that he was
using the stamps to justify the money donated by the Italian
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Luigi Scotto, the Italian Charges d'Affaires with residence in
Kampala who happened to be at the Prosecutor's office declared
that he was awaiting for an official reply from the Rwandan
government regarding the accusations leveled against his national.
</P>
<P>
''I'm aware of the affair, but the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign
Affairs must give us a verbal note explaining the charges,''
Scotto said, adding that Mufatti does not enjoy a diplomatic
status.
</P>
<P>
Mufatti, 45, has been working in the Italian cooperation since
1995. He is now remanded in Kigali Central Prison.

KHARTOUM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government Thursday
announced a unilateral comprehensive cease-fire in all fronts all
over the country to facilitate relief operations in the country's
war-torn south.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire is to take effect at midnight (2200 GMT)

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian TV Producer Wishes to Cooperate with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian television
producer has expressed his wishes to join hands with Chinese firms
in producing TV sets and other household electronic appliances.
</P>
<P>
Tebarek Hassen, general manager of the United Tebarek and
Family Private Limited Company, told Xinhua that he was looking
forward to have cooperation with Chinese counterparts in a bid to
expand Ethiopian TV industry.
</P>
<P>
"I am open to work with Chinese," Tebarek said, noting that any
form of cooperation, including assembling of TV spare parts from
China and China's investment in form of technique and machinery,
would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
The United Tebarek and Family Private Limited Company, which
became operational on May 8, 1999, is the first and only TV
producer ever established in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Tebarek, who personally invested 4.5 million birr (about
562,000 U.S. dollars) to build the TV assemble plant, has begun
exporting 21-inch color TV set.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of TV sets produced in the factory was
transported to Zimbabwe early this week. Zimbabwe is to import
1,000 21-inch color TV sets from Ethiopia during the next six
months, he said, adding that Tanzania and some other African
countries are also studying to import TV sets from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian TV assemble plant currently imports spare parts
from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to Tebarek, the factory is to employ some 1,500
staff, and to increase its production capacity from 100 to 1,500
TV sets per day following the completion of its expansion program.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain has written off Zambia's
46 million British pound debt, British Ambassador to Lusaka Thomas
Young announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 65 million pound Zambia owes to Britain has been
rescheduled and will be paid off after six years over a period of
24 years.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said that Britain's
move will lessen Zambia's external debt service obligations and
enable the Zambian government to finance in other economic sectors
and thus help alleviate poverty of Zambians.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that delayed sale of the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) and low agricultural output affect his
country's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
To revive its gloomy copper industry, the copper-producing
country is selling its copper mines to private hands, foreign
investors in particular.
</P>
<P>
But due to disagreement over the sale, bigger mines have not
been sold out.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Business Confidence Resumes Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's business
confidence index (BCI) has continued to rise strongly on a new
wave of economic optimism in July despite the effects of the fall
of the gold price, South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The index rose by 3.1 points, the sharpest rise this year, from
87 in June to 90.1.
</P>
<P>
This is up from an all-time low of 83 at the beginning of the
year. The current levels are similar to figures experienced in
1992. The index rose to a record of 105 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A positive reading was largely in response to interest rate
cuts, Sacob said.
</P>
<P>
But it warned not to expect too much from the banks in the near
future. A positive reading was largely in response to interest
rate cuts, Sacob said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Sacob, the stability of the rand also played a
role in producing an upswing of continued positive sentiment in
the business community.
</P>
<P>
"Financial stability is more firmly entrenched than a year ago.
 Improving levels of foreign confidence have been sustained," said
chief executive officer Kevin Wakeford.
</P>
<P>
He said although domestic demand was already showing signs of
moving out of the doldrums, the initial stages of an economic
recovery may be mainly export-led.
</P>
<P>
Gold's recent nose-dive, he added, had not yet produced the
wake of devastation that some had been predicting, due to the
metals declining predominance in South Africa's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The show of optimism to some extent has countered the negative
effects of the serious decline of the gold price," said Wakeford.
</P>
<P>
The rise in business confidence has emanated mainly from the
manufacturing sector, which according to the BCI has been
demonstrating a positive trend.
</P>
<P>
Sales volumes of manufactured goods are expected to rise over
the next 12 months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate OKs Holbrooke as U.N. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Thursday
confirmed Richard Holbrooke as U.N. ambassador after the post has
been vacant for almost one year.
</P>
<P>
After a 35-minute debate, the Senate voted 81-16 to approve the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton first announced the
appointment of Holbrooke to replace Bill Richardson. However, the
appointment was bogged dow because of investigations into
Holbrooke's business contacts.
</P>
<P>
Since Richardson left the U.N. post in September, the United
States launched airstrikes against both Iraq and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, 58, is the Clinton administrator's top international
troubleshooter and the architect of the 1995 Bosnia agreement
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said that Holbrooke was a
"contender" for secretary of state in Clinton's second term before
the president chose Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The report also said he has been at odds at times with Albright
and is a favorite target for Republicans since he's widely viewed
as a likely secretary of state if Vice President Al Gore wins the
presidency.

WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad has replied to President Bill Clinton on resumption of
peace talks between Syria and Israel, the White House said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Assad's letter was received on Wednesday at the White
House, which was in response to last month letter, in which
Clinton urged Assad to "seize the moment of opportunity" and
negotiate peace terms with Israel's newly elected prime minister,
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
"The president received a reply," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters. "He was pleased to receive it, but I'm no
going to go into the substance of the letter." Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
According to some U.S. officials, the administration was
"studying the response" from the Syrian president.
</P>
<P>
"He wants the United States to be involved in the process," one
of the officials said. "It is a continuing process. And the
president said we will remain in close communication."
</P>
<P>
Barak, who took the place of Benjamin Netanyahu early last
month following hie victory in the May 17 election, visited
Washington after his assumption of the premiership and held talks
with Clinton on ways of revival of stalled the peace process in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He has publicly promised to make a "painful compromise" with
Syria over the Golan Heights, which was seized by Israel during
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
Syria initially responded favorably to Barak's overtures. But
it has recently taken a more pessimistic tone. On Wednesday
Syria's foreign minister said no date was yet set for the
resumption of peace talks that broke off in 1996.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
passed a 10-year, 792 billion dollars tax cut bill introduced by
the Republican party Thursday in spite of repeated veto threats
from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 221-206 to send the bill to the Senate, where
expected final passage was scheduled for this evening.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good deal for the American people," Speaker Dennis
Hastert said. "It's fair, responsible and balanced tax-relief
bill."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, addressing a Democratic rally at the Capitol before
the vote, said any budget surplus should go first for preserving
social security and Medicare and reducing government debt.
</P>
<P>
The Republican leaders will send the bill to Clinton for
signature after the August congressional recess to avoid an
immediate veto.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and most Democrats insisted that projected budget
surpluses should be used to first safeguard social security and
Medicare, pay down public debt and ensure adequate levels of
government spending.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton has said he would sign a modest tax cut of
perhaps 300 billion dollars, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said that he saw no signs of compromise with the White House.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said the projected 2.9 trillion dollars surplus
over the next decade was enough to meet Clinton's priorities and
still enact the largest tax cut since 1981.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Thursday warned American citizens around the world to take
precaution as the first anniversary of two U.S. embassy bombings
in Africa was drawing nearer.
</P>
<P>
"Americans should keep a low profile, vary routes and times for
all required travel and treat mail from unfamiliar sources with
suspicion," the State Department said in a notice, labeled a
"worldwide caution."
</P>
<P>
"The Department of State continues to receive reports that
prompt concern about the safety and security of both official U.S.
government personnel and private American citizens," the notice
said.
</P>
<P>
The notice also cited a potential for retaliatory acts against
U.S. citizens in response to the worldwide pursuit and
apprehension of alleged associates of Osama bin Laden, who is
charged as mastermind of the bombings in Kenia and Tanzania on
August 7, 1998, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
The State Department notice came a day after U.S. officials
said a majority of embassies remain vulnerable to car bombs
although some progress on safety had been made.
</P>
<P>
Since the bombings, State Department analysts estimate 2,400
threats or incidents have been aimed at U.S. interests overseas
-- more than double the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
nearly 70 embassies or consulates have been closed for 24
hours or more in response to security concerns or specific
threats since the bombings.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) Thursday hailed a donation of 12.5 million U.S. dollars from
the European Commission Humanitarian Office, which will be used to
feed some 40,000 foreign refugees in western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We are enormously relieved and grateful to get such a generous
response from the European Commission Humanitarian Office," WFP
representative in Tanzania, Irene Lacy, said in a press release
issued in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The press release also alerted donors and the public to a
severe funding shortfall, which could lead to a potential gap in
the food aid to the refugees between June and September.
</P>
<P>
It said that to avoid a complete halt in food distributions,
the WFP reduced rations of cereals and pulses for the refugees by
25 percent over a two-month period in Kigoma and Kagera regions in
west Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the latest donations, however, it is planned that
full rations will be resumed this month," the press release noted.
</P>
<P>
It added that the continuing insecurity in neighboring Burundi
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has forced large
number of refugees to cross border into Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of refugees has dropped from almost 10,000
people per week in June to 5,000 recently.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has also expressed gratitude to earlier contributions
made by the United States, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
On top of 400,000 Congolese and Burundian refugees living in
camps in Tanzania, the WFP also provides food aid to 900,000
people in other Great Lakes Region countries like Rwanda and
Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Universities Risk Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice chancellors of the Ghanaian
universities said Thursday in Accra, Ghana, that the country's
three universities risk closure or their intakes be reduced due to
lack of financial resources, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The alternative now is to close down until such time when
adequate financial resources are obtained from sponsors of
students, the government or parents or admit no fresh students and
lay off about 30 percent of continuing students," the Committee of
Vice Chancellors said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which is in charge of the management and
administration of the universities, said that much as the
institutions do not wish to impose hardships on students, they
cannot run any credible academic programs in the 1999/2000
academic year without additional funding.
</P>
<P>
The universities subsist on government grants to finance their
programs and have had to operate with great difficulty, as the
money provided do not match their financial requirements.
</P>
<P>
Each of them requires between 3.2 million cedis (one U.S.
dollar equals some 2,540 cedis) and 9.5 million cedis to train a
student in humanities, sciences and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The vice chancellors said grants and income from other sources
over the past five years have amounted to less than 60 percent of
(their) requirements.
</P>
<P>
"The shortfalls have serious implications for the delivery of
quality academic programs," they said.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted, "in a serious attack" on the integrity of
degrees awarded by the universities by some employers and
international organizations, "with some of them threatening to
withdraw recognition or accreditation".
</P>
<P>
The committee, therefore, has suggested an increase in the
charge for academic facility user fee to raise adequate resources.
</P>
<P>
"These charges range from 290,000 to 320,000 cedis per student
per year for humanities and 430,000 cedis to 460,000 cedis per
student per year for science and applied science excluding
medicine," it said.

MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's state-owned
Rosvooruzhenie arms exporting company and Germany's Bremen-based
OHB-System GmbH have signed an agreement concerning cooperation in
the launches of space missions, the Interfax news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two sides in Germany have resulted in an
understanding on the conditions under which the Russian Strategic
Rocket Service will launch the scientific CHAMP, META and BIRD

year, Interfax said, quoting Rosvooruzhenie's public relations
board.
</P>
<P>
OHB-System GmbH's ABRIKSAS and MegSat satellites were
successfully launched from Russia's Kapustin Yar facility last
April, and this encouraged OHB-System GmbH to work more actively
with Rosvooruzhenie, the board said.

<HEADLINE> Russia May Lose Arctic Shipping Lane, Official Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia is likely to lose its
Arctic Northern Shipping Lane in five to 10 years unless the
government takes "well-calculated steps," First Deputy Prime
Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The icebreakers and northern ports are in poor condition,
Aksyonenko said, noting that the areas served by the lane contain
nearly 35 percent of the world's stores of oil and gas, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Only 1.48 million tons of cargo were shipped along the route
last year, a dramatic drop from 6.58 million tons of 1997, he told
a conference on the status of and outlook for the lane.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the potential is there for 25 million to 30
million tons of oil from the Timan-Pechora province and of the Ob
and Yenisei river basins, 15 million to 20 million tons of
liquefied gas from the Yamal Peninsula and 1.3 million tons of gas
condensate from the Ob and Yenisei river basins to be shipped to
Europe in 2015, Interfax reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian parliamentary committee on
legal affairs, governance, human rights and gender matters has
resolved to examine the operations of the Electoral Commission,
correspondence between Zambia Independent Monitoring Team and the
National Assembly has revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to parliamentary records available here Thursday,
president of the independent monitoring team, Alfred Zulu, has
confirmed the development but declined to give full details,
saying that his recommendations were now property of the national
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Correspondence from the National Assembly dated on July 1
stated that the committee, according to their program of work for
this year, is resolved to examine the operations of the Electoral
Commission with the help of monitoring team which had reportedly
made recommendations to overhaul the commission.
</P>
<P>
The correspondence from the parliament further requested the
team to submit 20 copies of a detailed memorandum which include
among other things an assessment of information regarding to what
extent are the service provided by the Electoral Commission known
and accessible to the potential users throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Parliament further requested the monitoring team to furnish
details on what measures the Electoral Commission should take to
sensitize the public on its services.
</P>
<P>
On July 27, Zulu submitted a memorandum and requested for some
changes in the operation of the commission.
</P>
<P>
United Party for National Development (UPND) Lusaka province
chairman, Joseph Chilengi, suggested at a press briefing Monday
that the term of office for Electoral Commission chairman should
be reduced from the current five years to one as a way of infusing
competition and hard work in the office.

<HEADLINE> Angola Shows Positive Attitude to U.N. Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with the National Radio of Angola, the
ambassador announced that the Angolan government delivered a
letter Wednesday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, "expressly
notifying the decision of the government."
</P>
<P>
Van Dunem added that some issues on U.N.'s "physical presence"
in Angola are currently discussed.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador stressed that the Angolan government has been in
favor of a "not so big" U.N. presence, in correspondence with the
reality of the situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Considering U.N. as a shield for the rebellious National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Angolan
government demanded a pull-out of the United Nations Observer
Mission in Angola last January, when the government troops
encountered some setbacks in battle-fields in the central
provinces Huambo and Bie.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission formally pulled out from the war-torn country
on March 1 this year. Meanwhile, the U.N. expressed a will to
maintain a mediatory organization in Angola.
</P>
<P>
But the Angolan government insisted that this kind of agency
should be established in New York, where the U.N. is
headquartered.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Thursday urged Afghan Taliban forces to stop the
offensive immediately and resume political negotiations under the
U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Council members demanded that the Taliban act in line with the
commitments expressed at the meeting in Tashkent in July,
according to a press statement issued by the council president,
Namibia's Martin Andjaba.
</P>
<P>
Council members appealed for the immediate end of all external
interference and in particular called on those states whose
territories are reportedly being used by Afghan parties to take
measures to prevent such acts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces, who control some 90 percent of Afghanistan,
launched their summer offensive on July 28 to capture the rest of
the country before winter begins. However, they have met strong
resistance from northern opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fighting has displaced more people in Afghanistan,
known for one of the biggest refugee sources in the world, with
2.1 million Afghans in Iran and 1.6 million in Pakistan, according
to U.N. figures.

<HEADLINE> Libyan FM Holds Talks with His Italian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Omar Al-Montassir held talks with his Italian counterpart Lamberto
Dini in the Libyan port city of Sert on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The talks dealt with the ways of developing and strengthening
the cooperative ties between Libya and Italy to serve the
interests of both countries, according to the Libyan News Agency
(LNA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Sert, Al-Montassir and Dini co-chaired a meeting of
the Joint Libyan-Italian Committee that includes technical experts
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Dini told the LNA that Italy will conduct necessary contact
with European states to return to Libya all the documents and
antiquities stolen from the country Libya in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival Wednesday evening, Dini said Italy attributes
great importance to developing cooperative ties with Libya and
will contribute to Libya's erasing of the land mines planted by
Italy during the colonization period.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the sanctions, which were imposed on Libya
following the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, has allowed
Tripoli to take part in the dialogue among the Mideterranean basin
countries, he added, noting that Italy calls for helping Libya
play a "substantial role" in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
This is Dini's second visit to the north African country this
year. He paid the first visit to Libya on April 5 shortly after
the lifting of the U.N.-imposed embargo on the country.
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister is scheduled to have a meeting with Libyan
leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi at a later time.
</P>
<P>
Italy is a major trade partner of Libya.
</P>
<P>
Dini's visit took place a few days after the Italian Eni Group
for Oil and Gas signed a contract with the Libyan authorities on
the gas exploitation and the gas pipe line between Libya and
Sicily with a total investment of 5.5 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> IATA: Air Travel Safe for Passengers Despite Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Travel by air is safe for
passengers despite the millennium computer bug (Y2K), said the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the passengers should be patient of certain
inconveniences like flight delays or a long wait for their
baggage, caused by the Y2K problem, the IATA said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of safety. It's not a question of planes
falling out of the sky," said Nancy Gautier, communications
manager at the IATA's Year 2000 (Y2K) Project.
</P>
<P>
"Safety is the first priority of the air transport industry,
and this will not be compromised on any day of the year, including
during the millennium changeover period," said the IATA in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Y2K bug might cause luggage to go astray,
impair baggage carousels or delay flights, but it would not
endanger passenger safety.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug stems from the fact that many computer systems in
use today will encounter difficulties in processing the date
changeover from 1999 to 2000 unless they undergo costly and
time-consuming modification.
</P>
<P>
Experts fear that many computers worldwide could malfunction or
crash on January 1, 2000. Many older computers allocate only two
digits to represent the year. Thus, 2000 may be read as 1900.
</P>
<P>
According to an IATA survey, airlines have spent more than 2.3
billion U.S. dollars to ensure their computer systems were immune
from any problems arising from the year 2000 changeover and the
results of worldwide air transport tests for year 2000 compliance
were encouraging so far.
</P>
<P>
"We can say that in every continent the work is very solid.
Some continents are almost at an advantage because their equipment
isn't highly computerized to begin with," said the IATA official.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov is the most trusted politician in Russia,
according to a latest public opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is trusted by 26 percent of the 2,407 Russians polled
by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center from July 8 to 24, well
ahead of any other political figure in the country, the Interfax
news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The margin of error in such polls is less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The people polled were asked to name five or six political
figures they trusted. The center takes such polls once a year.
Primakov was not on the list last year.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister is followed by Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, the leader of the Fatherland movement, with 17 percent,
significantly up from last year's 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov trails the mayor by
only a fraction of 1 percent. He was named by 14 percent last
year. Yabloko party leader Grigory Yavlinsky has improved his
standing, up to 15 percent from last year's 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin was named by 13
percent. He is followed by Krasnoyarsk territory Governor
Alexander Lebed, who dropped to 11 percent from last year's 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky rose to 8
percent from his showing last year of 6 percent. Former Russian
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko is trusted by 7 percent, down from
last year's 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kemerovo region Governor Aman Tuleyev was named by 5 percent (4
percent).
</P>
<P>
One of the Right Cause movement's leaders, Boris Nemtsov, is
the last on the list of 10 most popular political figures with 4
percent as against last year's 8 percent.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that it
boycotted the "Peace Shield-99" exercises because they are under
the Partnership for Peace program of NATO, at a time when Moscow's
relations with the alliance remain frozen.
</P>
<P>
Russia's ties with NATO have been frozen since the military
bloc launched a 78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia on March
24.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry noted that the United States and
Great Britain, both participants of the bombings on Yugoslavia,
are taking part in the exercise, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The time-frame for the resumption of Russian-NATO military
relations is largely dependent on the cooperation between them in
Kosovo, the only area in which the two parties are cooperating at
present, Defense Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace Shield-99" began Thursday at the Lvov training grounds
of the Ukrainian Western Command, with the participation of over
1,200 servicemen from Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Britain,
Bulgaria, Denmark, Georgia, Greece, Latvia, Moldova, Poland,
Romania, Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Observers from Estonia, Norway, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, France
and Hungary are also participating.
</P>
<P>
The multinational contingent will train in the maintenance of a
cease-fire between parties to an ethnic conflict in two countries,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Demands Earliest Release of All Hostages in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday called upon a Sierra Leonean group to release
all detainees, including U.N. military observers, at once and
without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, contained in a statement issued here by a U.N.
spokesman, came in the U.N. chief's first response to reports that
former junta soldiers demanding humanitarian aid kidnapped 13 U.N.
military observers, four journalists and a group of West African
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General deplores this serious incident and urges
the armed group to release all detainees immediately and without
any conditions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He also calls on the Government of Sierra Leone and RUF (the
rebel Revolutionary United Front) leader Foday Sankoh, as well as
ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) and its
military group ECOMOG, to do their utmost to seek the earliest
release of all detained personnel and to ensure the safety and
security of all international staff assisting the Sierra Leonean
people to implement the Lome Peace Agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is deeply concerned at the detention, at
Ocra Hills on August 4, by an armed Sierra Leonean group of United
Nations military observers and civilian personnel, the
Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops who escorted them, as well as local
journalists," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers abducted their captives Wednesday when the
fighters were supposed to hand over 150 women and children taken
prisoner during the West African country's bloody civil war, which
ended last month after the signing of the Peace Agreement in Lome,
capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at Ocra Hills, a forested, hilly area
about 65 kilometers east of the coastal capital, Freetown. The
detainees were held by former soldiers of the Armed Force
Revolutionary Council, the junta that seized power in a 1997 coup
and was ousted in 1998 by the West African peacekeepers, known as
ECOMOG, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Sierra Leone and the junta signed the Peace
Agreement in Lome on July 7 to end the eight-year civil war, in
which tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more were
mained by rebels in a terror campaign.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Learn From Uganda in Combating AIDS: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Health Department will
continue to fight HIV/AIDS by adopting Uganda's successful model
of mobilizing society against the scourge, Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the return of a high-profile delegation from a
four-day fact- finding mission to Uganda on strategies to fight
the epidemic, she said: "Social mobilization is key to prevention
and, before we have a cure, that is where we need to concentrate."
</P>
<P>
"Ugandans are very open about HIV and AIDS. This is what we as
South Africans really have to learn -- the openness is an
essential tool against the stigmatization of the disease."
</P>
<P>
Strategies that encouraged this openness and mobilized
communities were needed in South Africa, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Openness helps Ugandans to give each other support. AIDS has
strengthened the extended family concept and has helped to
destigmatize the disease."
</P>
<P>
Political commitment at the highest level was part of creating
that openness but civil society, churches and traditional leaders
also had a significant role to play, as had been seen in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated the necessity for openness about the disease as
an important part of prevention, which is one of the main reasons
the government has cited to back its plan to make AIDS a
notifiable disease.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the only country in Africa that has reduced its
HIV/AIDS infection rate substantially through an awareness
campaign that begun 10 years ago. About 1.9 million people in
Uganda are HIV-positive out of a population of 20 million.
</P>
<P>
But these successes were not linked to the use of medication,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to tests on Uganda's newly announced retro-viral drug
(which initial findings show reduces transmission from mother to
child during pregnancy), Tshabalala-Msimang said: "There's no
conclusive evidence, but we're testing it. There's also a cost
issue here -- and we don't want to raise the expectations of our
population yet."
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan drug, which is presently being tested in clinical
trials, is considerably cheaper than its counterpart AZT, costing
34 rand (5.6 U.S. dollars) instead of 400 rand (66 dollars) per
treatment.
</P>
<P>
There was also a lesson to be learnt from that country on
integrating culture and tradition in AIDS prevention programs, and
to translate the knowledge of how HIV is transmitted into changed
sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
South Africa would also seek to create the situation now
prevalent in Uganda where the level of awareness focused on
abstinence among the youth, faithfulness to one partner and condom
use.
</P>
<P>
A declaration of intent on cooperation in vaccine research and
training was signed with Ugandan officials during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives had been to look at home care plans for the
infected, caring with orphans, the impact on the social security
system, how to reach school children through life skills training
and civil sector partnerships.
</P>
<P>
"We came back as a South African delegation absolutely
inspired, absolutely motivated, " said Tshabalala-Msimang.
</P>
<P>
"If Uganda can do it, so can South Africa. We have fought many
battles. We can't be defeated by a virus," she said.
</P>
<P>
About four million people are reportedly infected with the AIDS
virus in South Africa, which has a population of 43 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Thursday received a message from his Thai counterpart
Surin Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
The message was handed over to Egyptian Assistant Foreign
Minister for Asian Affairs Nagi al-Ghatrifi by Thailand's
ambassador in Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The message focused on the planned meetings of the
Egyptian-Thai Joint Committee due to be held in Cairo in October
under the chairmanship of the foreign ministers, the news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the two countries will sign a number of
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The agreements include one on protecting reciprocal
investments, another on avoiding dual taxation, and a third on
political consultations between the two foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
During the committee meetings, a council grouping Egyptian and
Thai businessmen will be formed in an effort to bolster trade and
economic cooperation and increase investments between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Thailand maintain good relations. Officials of the
two countries have expressed keenness on further promoting
bilateral cooperations, in the economic and trade areas in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been exerting efforts in recent years to attract
foreign investments and seek ways of increasing exports.

DAMASCUS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen and her entourage wound up a two-day visit to Syria and
left here this afternoon for Beirut to continue their tour of the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Before her departure, Halonen, whose country is the current
president of the European Union (E.U.), described her talks with
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad as "very good, friendly and frank."
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the situation in the Middle East and the latest
developments of the peace process in the region," Halonen said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased because I have got a good vision. I'm
looking forward to seeing positive outcome of my recent talks,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
On the European role in the peace process, she said the
E.U. aim is to establish peace among the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our position toward the Middle East peace process is different
from that of the United States as some of the E.U. members are
located in the Mideterranean basin," she said, adding that
"stability and prosperity serve the interests of the region as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
Halonen expressed the will of the E.U. to continue its
unremitting efforts to strengthen the economic and trade ties
with the countries of the region.

<HEADLINE> S. African Green Party Opposes Passage of Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Green Party
Thursday joined the chorus of opposition to the two nuclear fuel
ships expected to round the Cape in September and urged government
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Party spokesman Jeremy Acton said in a statement: "It is
unacceptable to accept the passage of this highly dangerous cargo
around South Africa's exclusive economic zone, without the
provision of any protection."
</P>
<P>
The government should negotiate at the highest level with the
governments of France, Britain and Japan, in order to ascertain
the course, position and speed of these vessels.
</P>
<P>
The ships, Pacific Teal and Pacific Pintail were bound for
Japan via Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
The two vessels, transporting recycled nuclear fuel for
Japanese power stations originate from Britain via a French
reprocessing plant.
</P>
<P>
They left France on July 16 amid protests by Greenpeace, a non-
governmental eco-conservationist group.
</P>
<P>
"According to international accords on the transport of nuclear
material of this nature, a naval escort should be provided, but
this has been ignored and the shipping nations wish to
irresponsibly shirk the duty of guarding this shipment," Acton
said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Green Party also urged government to send the
navy to escort these vessels once their positions have been
divulged to security forces.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Environmental Affairs Valli Moosa has also
expressed concern over the shipment and Deputy Minister Joyce
Mabudafhasi met British, French and Japanese diplomats for a
briefing on the shipment.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that Cabinet had already decided in
1997 that vessels carrying nuclear material around the South
African coast should be treated strictly in accordance with
national and international law.
</P>
<P>
She said the government's overriding interest was to minimize
risk to human health, marine life and the environment by ensuring
the safe passage of the ships to Japan.
</P>
<P>
She had been given assurances at the briefing that the ships
would not dock at any South African harbor.
</P>
<P>
"Further assurances were received that the radiological
protection and safety arrangements meet international standards,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Confirm Fall of Three Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban's senior official
responsible for information, Amir Khan Muttaqi, Thursday confirmed
the fall of Charikar, Jabel Saraj and Gulbahar to the opposition
forces, sources from Kabul told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, opposition spokesman Abdullah (eds: one
name) said the forces loyal to former defense minister Ahmad Shah
Masood recaptured the three towns in an overnight surprise counter
offensive.
</P>
<P>
The opposition troops moved out of the Panjsher valley late
Wednesday night and took Gulbahar at the entrance of the valley
and then pushed westwards to take Jabel Saraj, some 70 kilometers
north of Kabul, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
Then the troops moved southwards and captured Charikar, the
capital of Parwan province.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia last week launched a major offensive and
forced the Masood forces to retreat to the heavily fortified
Panjsher valley.

<HEADLINE> Masood Says Ready for Talks With Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah
Masood Thursday said that war is no solution to Afghanistan's
problems and he is ready for talks with the ruling Taliban
militia, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Pakistan-based agency from the front
lines north of Kabul, Masood said: "After regaining the positions
we lost early this week, we are now ready for talks with the
Taliban to rule out differences."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his forces killed more than 400 opponents,
including Pakistani and Arab militants, during the counter
offensive early Thursday morning, in which they recaptured several
strategic towns including Charikar, the provincial capital of
Parwan.
</P>
<P>
"War is not in the interest of the Afghans, it only serves the
interests of our enemies," the AIP quoted Masood as saying.
</P>
<P>
Masood, a former Afghan defense minister, is known as the Lion
of Panjsher for his gallantry against Soviet troops in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
He is regarded as the only formidable obstacle left to the
Taliban militia's ambition of extending their rule over the whole
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Slows, Labor Cost Jumps in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. workers' productivity
slowed significantly in the second quarter while unit labor costs
increased sharply, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work, rose
at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent in the April-June quarter,
far below the 3.6 percent rate of productivity growth in the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, unit labor costs, a key gauge of wage
pressures, surged at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the second
quarter, the worst showing for this measurement since the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The big gain in unit labor costs far exceeded analysts'
expectations. Many were looking for a rise around 2.2 percent,
which would have been a pickup from the modest gains of 0.8
percent in the first quarter and an outright decline of 0.4
percent in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and many other economists believe
the good showing on productivity has helped keep inflation low.
Greenspan warned two weeks ago that if productivity slows, wage
pressures are likely to quickly surface, given that labor markets
are the tightest in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
The 1.3 percent increase in productivity was the slowest
quarterly increase since the second quarter of last year when
productivity only rose at a 0.4 percent rate. For all of 1998,
productivity rose by 2.2 percent, which was almost double the 1.2
percent increase of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in productivity reflected the fact that the gross
domestic product, the total output of good and services, also
slowed sharply to an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second
quarter of this year, compared to 4.3 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 3.8 percent rate of increase in unit labor costs compared
to modest increases of just 2 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have already begun to worry about wage pressures
following a report last Thursday that the Employment Cost Index,
which includes both wages and benefits paid to workers, rose at an
annual rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter of this year, the
biggest gain in eight years.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reduces Gas Taxes to Curb Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Fuel prices in Greece dropped by
three drachmas (about 300 drachmas equal one U.S. dollar) as of
Thursday, a result of the country's reduction of consumption taxes
in order to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
The measure, in effect from Thursday until June 30 next year,
would cost Greece about 22.5 billion drachmas, but would benefit
the inflation rate by an annual 0.1 percent, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End Sharply Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON August 5 (Xinhua) - US inflation fear and weaker than
expected US productivity figures pulled European markets down on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 lost another 133.8 points to close down 2.14
percent at 6101.6 after hitting 6079 earlier in the day. It was
London's lowest close in almost four months.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eurotop 300, a broader index of the largest pan
European shares, reflected the nervous mood as it fell 2.3 percent
to 1235.41.
</P>
<P>
The big faller was Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed International
which was down 41.25p at 424p after revealing a big fall in
profits and announcing a major review of its operations.
</P>
<P>
Telecom shares continued to be hit hard by profit-taking
following broker comment on excessive valuations. They were
responsible for 23 points of the day's total fall.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt fell further in afternoon trading
after a morning session depressed by disappointing numbers from
two key sector members.
</P>
<P>
The index ended the session down 140.92 points at 4978.45, a
loss of 2.75 percent, having earlier hit a low of 4948.
</P>
<P>
Some traders blamed the fall on general concern that US shares
were about to take a dive. Others said the strength of the euro
had helped to trigger the downward momentum.
</P>
<P>
Paris was also feeling the pressure from Wall Street. The
CAC-40 index closed 85.50 points lower at 4240.70. It had fallen
to 4221.00, its lowest level since 1 April.

<HEADLINE> Explosion at Romanian Steel Plant Kills Three People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A strong explosion on Thursday
killed three and injured ten workers at Romania's SIDEX Galati
steel combine.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Rompres news agency, the chimney of
the furnace 4 of the combine blew up on Thursday morning, killing
one woman and one man on the spot. Another man died en route to
the hospital. 14 employees hurt by the explosion were taken to the
county hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to SIDEX General Manager Ionel Bors, the blast seemed
to be a technical accident caused by accumulations of gas which
turned into an explosive mixture due to the high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Prefect's office, police and fire brigade investigations are
under way at the accident site, and a special committee has been
set up to further investigate the accident.
</P>
<P>
Situated 240 km east of Bucharest, SIDEX Galati operates six
furnaces and is the most important steel producer in Romania,
producing one third of the country's total steel output of some
six million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
A similar explosion occurred at SIDEX in 1998, with furnace 6,
with two casualties reported. In 1994, a blast at one of SIDEX's
furnaces killed four workers.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Declares Cease-Fire in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
declared a two- month comprehensive cease-fire in its war with
southern rebels in consideration of human suffering in the war
zones, sources available here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign
Relations Thursday issued a statement in capital Khartoum,
declaring a cease-fire in the southern areas of the country and
calling on the rebel group to act the same.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire would start at midnight Thursday and end on
October 5, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government was concerned about the suffering
of the people in the conflict-stricken regions and the cease-fire
would enable them to receive relief aid.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
declared a three-month cease-fire in Bahr al-Ghazal, Western and
Central Upper Nile regions in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
However, the government regarded the SPLA's action merely as
propaganda and urged the rebels to declare a comprehensive
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, the Sudanese government and rebels met in Kenyan
capital Nairobi for the five-day fourth round of Sudan peace talks
and made no substantive progress on major controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
Both sides at the talks agreed to set up a permanent
secretariat in Nairobi to facilitate peace negotiations and
accepted a special envoy, a Kenyan senior diplomat, to conduct
shuttle diplomacy between them.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese civil war has ravaged the southern part of
Africa's largest country. Over 1.5 million people have died
during war and famine since 1983 when the fighting restarted.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Urges Attention for Indigenous People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Thursday urged the international community and
national governments to assess indigenous people's needs and
accelerate the correction of situations that put them at
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
"Out of 6,000 languages that are spoken today, 2,500 are in
danger of extinction," UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer said
in Nairobi in a message to mark the International Day of the
World's Indigenous People, which falls on August 9.
</P>
<P>
The pace of extinction is accelerating both for cultures of the
 indigenous people and for biological species, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As global socio-economic factors disrupt traditional ways of
life, the knowledge of their environment is being rapidly lost,
causing poverty and over exploitation of the environment by both
local groups and outside forces, Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
"External pressures also promote tensions and conflicts over
indigenous peoples' land rights and impinge on their human rights
-- including linguistic, cultural and resource rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the fifth year of the International
Decade of the World's Indigenous People, it is an opportunity to
bring about tangible improvements in the daily life of indigenous
people, Toepfer said.

WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on

</P>
<P>
"The United States is deeply concerned about the rising tide

Rubin, citing the killing of 45 people on May 3 as well as the
deaths of 40 to 70 on July 24, said, "The indisputable point is
that tragic, extrajudicial killings are on the rise."
</P>
<P>
Rubin called on Indonesian security forces to exercise
restraint as they seek to maintain security and also urged the
armed rebels to halt further attacks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Releases Russia's Secrets on Kennedy's Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
released about 40 top secret documents held by the Soviet Union
about the assassination of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
The documents show that Kennedy's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy,
wrote to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev nine days after her
husband's assassination, saying the U.S. policy of "restraint"
would continue.
</P>
<P>
The 80-over-page documents, including the application of
alleged Kennedy assassin U.S. national Lee Harvey Oswald for
Soviet citizenship, were in a package file which was sent by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to U.S. President Bill Clinton as
a gift in June.
</P>
<P>
However, Jacqueline's letter was translated from Russian into
English. The original copy of the letter is not released.
</P>
<P>
"You and he were adversaries, but you were also allies in your
determination not to let the world be blown up," Mrs. Kennedy
wrote to Khrushchev on December 1, 1963.
</P>
<P>
"I know that President (Lyndon) Johnson will continue the
policy my husband believed in so deeply -- the policy of
self-control and restraint -- and he will need your help."
</P>
<P>
"The danger troubling my husband was that war could be started
not so much by major figures as by minor ones," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"If only in the future major figures could still force minor
ones to sit down at the negotiating table before they begin to
fight!"
</P>
<P>
The documents were released by the U.S. National Archives after
they were translated into English from the original Russian
version.
</P>
<P>
The document also contains materials about obtained by the
Soviet officials and diplomats about Oswald. In it was a copy of
Oswald's letter in October 1959 to the Supreme Soviet in which he
asked to be made a Soviet citizen.
</P>
<P>
"I want citizenship because I am a communist and a worker, I
have lived in a decadent capitalist society where the workers are
slaves," Oswald wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have enough money left to live indefinitely here, or
to return to any other country."
</P>
<P>
The documents show the process how Oswald was allowed to stay
in the Soviet Union and married a Soviet citizen but was never
granted citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"Because no decision had been reached on Oswald's request by
the time his visa expired and he was to leave the USSR, Oswald
tried to commit suicide by slitting a vein," one document said.
</P>
<P>
On November 22, 1963, Oswald was arrested in Dallas in the
United States when Kennedy was assassinated. He was shot to death
by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby two days after the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Some documents about decisions and policies of the Soviet Union
towards the United States after Kennedy's assassination were also
released.

<HEADLINE> Apartheid S. Africa's Chief Assassin Granted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African apartheid
regime's chief assassin, Eugene de Kock, was Thursday granted
amnesty by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) for the
1988 bombing of Khotso House, the headquarters of the South
African Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the former commander of the Vlakplaas
police unit, which used murder and torture to defend white rule,
has been pardoned for any of his crimes for which he is serving
several life sentences.
</P>
<P>
Former law and order minister Adriaan Vlok, former police chief
Johann van der Merwe and 14 other policemen were also pardoned by
the TRC's amnesty committee for their role in the 1988 bombing.
</P>
<P>
The committee said in its judgment that amnesty had been
granted to all the applicants in respect of public violence and
malicious damage to property, and the unlawful possession of arms,
ammunition and explosives for bombing Khotso House.
</P>
<P>
Evidence was led before the committee that Vlok discussed the
plan to bomb the building with Van der Merwe, who was then head of
the Security Police.
</P>
<P>
They submitted a report to then State President P.W. Botha and
the matter was discussed by the now defunct State Security
Council. The committee said Botha instructed Vlok to look into
the matter in depth and take the necessary steps to make the
building unusable.
</P>
<P>
Botha has categorically denied his role in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction, African National Congress spokesman Smuts
Ngonyama said his party hoped the amnesty decision had been well
considered, "with the aim of taking our country forwards with
respect to reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
The ANC would have to study the judgment before arriving at a
more informed view.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, we respect the position of the amnesty committee,
but we still have to study the formal judgment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former South African Council of Churches president, Frank
Chikane said Thursday that he respected the TRC decision.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that he could never condone the bombing
of Khotso House but was willing to accept the TRC's judgment in
the interest of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing of Khotso House, was an abominable action in
defense of a crime against humanity, and a heresy.
</P>
<P>
"The act of the bombing, like the system of apartheid itself,
cannot be justified and will always be repugnant."
</P>
<P>
Chikane said he had been part of the efforts to set up the TRC
to bring about peace and reconciliation in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, I respect and abide by the decision of the
TRC amnesty committee... in the hope that such a deed will never
again be committed."
</P>
<P>
Chikane said several discussions were held with the then
National Party (NP) government after the bombing, and the NP had
always denied the involvement of state security forces.
</P>
<P>
"Yet there was never any doubt as to who the perpetrators of
the dastardly deed were," said Chikane, who is now
director-general in the president's office.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign countries have
cancelled more than 371 million U.S. dollars of external debts
owed by Tanzania in recent years, Deputy Finance Minister
Abdisalaam Issa Khatibu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the repayment of 584.482 million dollars of debts
has been rescheduled, Khatibu told the National Assembly
(parliament) in the central city of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Khatibu said that the debts were written off following
agreements between the Tanzanian government and governments of
France, Germany, Austria, Norway, the Netherlands, Canada, the
United States, Belgium, Britain and Brazil at the Paris Club
Donors Conference held in Paris in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The deputy finance minister was answering questions raised by
MP Richard Ndassa of the ruling Revolutionary Party, who wanted to
know among others the amount of debts written off by foreign
countries and the names of the states, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
By June 30 this year, the total external debt committed by the
Tanzanian government reached 7.97 billion dollars, according to
the central Bank of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Khatibu said the Tanzanian government has been
taking loans and grants for social services such as roads,
education, health, agriculture, finance, harbors and tourism
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate President Rejects Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The president of Nigeria's
109-member Senate, Evan Enwerem, Thursday branded allegations
against him as "wicked fabrication and calculated attempt" to
tarnish his image.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, the third in the
hierarchy in the west African nation dismissed the letter
purportedly signed by the Chief Secretary to the Premier of the
defunct eastern Nigeria describing him as a convict as "a
forgery".
</P>
<P>
"A competent court of jurisdiction dismissed the letter as
worthless in 1992 after my election as Governor of Imo State," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The document, on which the weekly "Tell" story accusing the
senate president was based, was formerly dismissed as worthless by
a elections tribunal, Enwerem told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
He again denied allegations against him that he had a twin
brother with the same name of Evan.
</P>
<P>
"I never claimed I had a twin brother who is late and whose
name is Evans," he added. Describing the allegations as "recycled
by certain persons whose aim is to use the public media to damage
my name, integrity and office", the Senate president called for
caution in the publication of such material.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem said he was fully in favor of exposing "the
inadequacies of public office holders," but the press should be
wary of being "employed by blackmailers for the prosecution of
private malice."
</P>
<P>
The senate president expressed this after the country's House
of Representatives asked him Thursday to step aside, for an
unimpeded probe of allegations forwarded by the Lagos-based "Tell"
weekly.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Senate also directed its committees on ethics and
privileges; national security and intelligence; judiciary, human
rights and legal matters to investigate and ascertain the truth of
the matter and submit their findings to the House within 48 hours.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Argues for Revenge Violence on Serbs in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States argued on
Thursday that it was reasonable that ethnic Albanians take violent
revenge against Serbs but unreasonable to expect NATO to protect
all Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone... Albanian people of
Kosovo -- when the Albanians were freed from these shackles, that
there would be the potential for revenge and retaliation against
Serbs," State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"And it is simply not possible for NATO to be in a position to
ensure that all the Serbs stay, or that every Serb is free from
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the U.S. has no evidence that the anti-Serb
violence is an organized policy of the KLA, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which has been sought independence of Kosovo through
violence.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important for people to understand that NATO
never could, nor can the U.N., guarantee that people stay in
Kosovo," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Watch based in New York said in a recent
report that more than 100,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo since NATO
troops went into Kosovo. The ethnic Albanians began ethnic
cleansing against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the double standard of the West, some critics say
this shows a failure of the policy to build a multi-ethnic Kosovo
and the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In the name of protecting humanity and human rights, the
U.S.-led NATO conducted a 78-day air bombing against Yugoslavia
before their troops went in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The life expectancy of the
United States was 76.5 years in 1997, up from 76.1 in the previous
year as death rates from HIV, heart disease, cancer, stroke and
homicide declined, according to statistics released Thursday by
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP).
</P>
<P>
White women had the highest life expectancy at 79.9 years,
followed by black women (74.7), white men (74.3), and black men
(67.2).
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises U.S. Economy But Warns of Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The performance of the U.S.
economy during the past years had been remarkable, but there were
significant risks facing the economy, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an annual review of the U.S. economy, the IMF said that
transitory factors have helped fuel the recent rapid growth of
demand and cautioned that any abrupt reversal of these factors
could cause problems for macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors commended the authorities for their sound
fiscal and monetary policies, which together with the remarkable
flexibility of the labor and product markets, had helped produce
what is now approaching the longest economic expansion in U.S.
history," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
"In the period ahead, however, directors considered that the
growth of demand would need to slow to a rate more in line with
the economy's long-run productive potential," the IMF stressed.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said one of the biggest risks facing the U.S. economy
is the danger of a substantial and abrupt decline in U.S. equity
prices.
</P>
<P>
"Directors noted that the strength of demand...had been
underpinned by the high level of stock prices -- a level that was
difficult to explain -- and they were concerned that a sharp
market decline could have significant effects on both domestic and
foreign economies," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the sharp widening of the external current account
deficit and the appreciation of the dollar had been important
factors in allowing rapid domestic demand growth without
rekindling inflation, but cautioned that they could not be
permanent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also cautioned that although strong investment and
continued productivity gains had probably raised potential output
more rapidly than in preceding periods, "the economy still face
resource constraints, and the recent very strong growth in
domestic demand could not be sustained for much longer without
having inflationary consequences."
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances, the IMF said that, unless there was
evidence soon that the strength of demand growth was abating, the
authorities should tighten monetary policy further to ensure that
the expansion remained on a sustainable noninflationary path.
</P>
<P>
"The policy challenge for both the United States and its
international partners would be to restore a more sustainable
pattern of demand growth in a nondisruptive manner," the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Revises Visitor Arrival Growth Forecast Upward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Tourism Board
(STB) said Friday that it has revised upward its forecast growth
in visitor arrivals for 1999 from 1-3 percent to 6-8 percent.
</P>
<P>
STB said in a press release that a hefty nine percent surge in
foreign visitor arrivals in the first half of 1999 has prompted it
to revise its total visitor arrivals significantly upward.
</P>
<P>
STB said that visitor numbers reached 3.3 million by the end of
June this year, rising nine percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
This means Singapore can expect between 6.6 and 6.7 million
visitors for the whole year of 1999 and register a six to eight
increase compared to last year, STB said.
</P>
<P>
The figure is much higher than the forecast growth of one to
three percent made at the start of the year, it added.
</P>
<P>
STB had forecast an increase of between 1 to 3 percent above
the total of 6.2 million arrivals in 1998 when 13.3 percent fewer
visitors arrived in Singapore than the previous year and each
traveler spent 712 Singapore dollars (424 U.S. dollars) per visit.
</P>
<P>
The board said an upturn in visitor arrivals from major markets
like Australia, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and
Britain contributed to the upward revision and it attributed the
upturn to sustained economic recovery and its intensive marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the upward revision of its tourism arrival
figures comes as STB's latest survey shows that visitors are also
arriving in bigger groups and spending more during their stay in
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Two Dead, Six Missing in Bering Strait Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A storm that hit the Chukotka
coast of the Bering Strait Wednesday has left two people dead and
six others missing, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty residents of the Chukotsk Autonomous District were
returning in four whaling ships and five motor boats from St.
Lawrence Island of the United States when the storm began.
</P>
<P>
They were celebrating their ethnic holiday with members of the
U.S. Innuit community in the island.
</P>
<P>
Several people fell into the stormy water. Two of the five
people who were picked up died of exposure. Two motor boats with
six people on board remain missing.
</P>
<P>
An American woman journalist who traveled to Bukhta
Provideniya in Russia to cover the life of Russian Innuits was
among the survivors, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Search and rescue operation, hampered earlier by bad weather,
will resume once the weather improves. Russian border guard
helicopters and army planes will take part in the operation. The
U.S. Coast Guard in Alaska is also prepared to join the search.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 postcards have
been received since January 1998 when two young girls from the
United States launched their "One Million Postcrd Campaign"
against the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to collect one million postcards to President
Clinton," 12-year-old Kouthar Al-Rawi said here Friday at a show
in the Palais des Nations sponsored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Kouthar and her 10-year-old sister, Marwa, asked adults and
children around the world to draw or write a postcard to U.S.
President Bill Clinton requesting him to lift the sacntions on
Iraq for the sake of the children.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the bombing against Iraq in January 1991, the
war didn't end for the Iraqi children," said the sisters.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4,500 innocent Iraqi children die each month, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Kouthar and Marwa Al-Rawi said that the United States
government is virtually alone in its insistence to uphold the
economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton, the people of Iraq are hungry, they are
thirsty, and the children continue to die," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
"We urge you to use your influence to bring happiness, joy, and
food to the children in Iraq, to make this world more peaceful and
just, and to put into practice the mandate dictated by the United
Nations last December, in its historic vote declaring the next
decade to be one promoting a culture of nonviolence," they wrote.

STOCKHOLM -- Vehicle-maker Volvo AB announced Friday that it
has acquired the rival Swedish truck and bus maker Scania after
taking a majority share in the company.
</P>
<P>
Volvo President and Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news
conference Friday that under an acquisition deal reached between
Volvo and Investor AB, the investment arm of Sweden's powerful
Wallenberg family, Volvo should take over a 49 percent stake in
Scania that had been owned by Investor AB.
</P>
<P>
Volvo also offered to buy the rest of Investor AB's share in
Scania in the deal valued at 60.7 billion kronor (7.4 billion U.S.
dollars). The deal gives Volvo 69.6 percent of the votes in
Scania.
</P>
<P>
Volvo began its push to acquire Scania in January, several
weeks before announcing the sale of its passenger car division to
Ford Motors.
</P>
<P>
After the acquisition, Scania will constitute a division within
Volvo, with its trademarks and distribution staying separate from
Volvo.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, which must be approved by the European Union,
would create the world's second-largest manufacturer of trucks and
buses, behind DaimlerChrysler.(Sweden-Volvo-Merger)

TOKYO -- Two destroyers of the South Korean Navy made a port
call to the western Japanese port of Sasebo on Friday after
concluding a joint naval exercise with Japan's Maritime Self-
Defense Force (MSDF) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
King Kwanggaeto, a 3,855-ton destroyer loaded with helicopters,
and Chung Nam, a 2,180-ton destroyer, became the first South
Korean navy warships to visit Japan.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Navy officers will visit the Sasebo city office
and meet with Japanese counterparts to brief them on the drill.
The two military vessels are scheduled to depart on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two destroyers, together with three warships from Japan's
MSDF, participated in the search-and-rescue drills conducted in
the East China Sea Between Japan's westernmost main island of
Kyushu and the Cheju Island, south of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The drill, in which the five ships trained for responding to
fires on civilian vessels, marked the two countries' first joint
military exercise.
</P>
<P>
The drill drew strong criticism from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), which described the maneuver on Thursday
as a prelude to a new Japanese invasion. (Japan-South Korea-

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
remained steady in July at 4.3 percent, matching the June number
and near a three-decade low, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that employers added 310,000 jobs to their
payrolls. The strength in hiring last month reflected big gains in
demand for workers at temporary help agencies, which posted their
strongest rise in 18 months. Hiring of workers also showed big
gains at restaurants, computer companies and engineering firms.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing managed to post a gain of 31,000 workers in July,
after adjusting for seasonal variations, only the second increase
in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
July's 310,000 gain in payroll jobs far exceeded many analysts'
expectations. It followed an increase in June of 273,000.
</P>
<P>
The July increase in payrolls was well above the monthly
average of the first six months of the year of 208,000.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Friday, the Labor Department also reported
that average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
jumped by 3.8 percent in July compared to a year ago, the second
straight month that price pressures have risen. The 3.8 percent
increase compared to 3.7 percent in June and was the biggest gain
since a 4 percent rise in January.
</P>
<P>
Friday's report was the third report in a week showing an
acceleration in wage pressures. On Thursday, the government said
that unit labor costs rose at the fastest pace since the end of
1997. And, last week the government said that the Employment Cost
Index climbed at its most rapid pace in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Given the tighter labor markets, many economists expect Fed
policy-makers would make another quarter-point increase in the
federal funds rate when they meet on Aug.24.
</P>
<P>
Most of strength in July came from gains in service industries
led by the jump of 61,000 jobs at restaurants and bars, almost
double the gain in June. Employment was also up at car
dealerships, hardware and garden supply stores.
</P>
<P>
Construction added 22,000 jobs in July, but mining lost 3,000
jobs as the oil and gas industry continued to suffer layoffs. This
industry has lost one-fifth of its jobs, a total of 71,000
layoffs, since February of last year.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on U.N. Presence in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday met in an open session to discuss a July 16 report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who asked the 15-nation body to
approve 90 military observers immediately to serve as liaison
officers to the main belligerents in the 11-month conflict in
Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council agreed informally after its consultations
some two weeks ago to send the 90 military observers to Congo (K)
in preparation for a possible peacekeeping mission in the central
African country, but has delayed a resolution until the United
States agrees, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to vote a draft resolution on
the U.N. presence in the African country, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council have finalized their
consultations on a draft resolution that authorizes the deployment
of up to 90 military liaison personnel," the Council president for
the month of July, Agam Hasmy of Malyasia, told reporters after a
closed-door meeting on July 23.
</P>
<P>
The resolution under consideration said the observers are to
provide information in planning operations "for a possible further
role of the United Nations" in implementing a peace agreement once
all parties have signed it.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his July 16 written report to the Security Council,
asked the Council to immediately send the 90 military observers as
liaison officers to the main warring parties in the conflict,
which broke out in August last year in eastern Congo (K), also
known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations hopes for thousands of international troops
and 500 military observers to help maintain a cease-fire in the
vast central African nation once all warring parties agree to put
down their guns.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in the war in the former Zaire
singed a cease-fire agreement on July 10 in Lusaka, capital of
Zambia. The signatories included the rebels' supporters Rwanda and
Uganda as well as President Laurent Kabila of Congo (K), who was
backed by troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said his government will try to support domestic
manufacturers and protect the home market in the face of a flood
of foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Vechernyaya Kazan newspaper,
Stepashin said protecting Russia's food manufacturers is
particularly important as "the pressure of imported products is
particularly heavy" in the country's food market.
</P>
<P>
"Imports of food suppress our... agriculture, which has for
centuries brought fame to the country, drive us into foreign
dependence and, as a consequence, undermine the economic security
of Russia," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia's financial crisis of August of last
year had given more chances to Russian manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"The devaluation of the ruble has somewhat increased the
competitiveness of import-replacing industrial products," he said.
The official exchange rate of the national currency is 25.5 rubles
to one U.S. dollar, against the pre-crisis rate of about 6.3
rubles to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"In the first few months after the August crisis, industry in
11 regions of Russia not only did not reduced its pace but
actually grew by several percent," Stepashin said.

TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Two destroyers of the South Korean
Navy made a port call to the western Japanese port of Sasebo on
Friday after concluding a joint naval exercise with Japan's
Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
King Kwanggaeto, a 3,855-ton destroyer loaded with helicopters,
and Chung Nam, a 2,180-ton destroyer, became the first South
Korean navy warships to visit Japan.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Navy officers will visit the Sasebo city office
and meet with Japanese counterparts to brief them on the drill.
The two military vessels are scheduled to depart on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two destroyers, together with three warships from Japan's
MSDF, participated in the search-and-rescue drills conducted in
the East China Sea Between Japan's westernmost main island of
Kyushu and the Cheju Island, south of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The drill, in which the five ships trained for responding to
fires on civilian vessels, marked the two countries' first joint
military exercise.
</P>
<P>
The drill drew strong criticism from the Democratic People's

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has condemned the recent fightings in the Caprivi Strip
area of Namibia and assured Zambians that his government will
continue to search for peace in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special Zambia air force parade in Livingstone,
Southern Province Friday, where he commissioned Zambia air force
flight pilot and cadet officers, Chiluba said his government
condemns the barbaric acts of aggression which took place in
Caprivi region of Namibia recently.
</P>
<P>
Lives were reportedly lost following an attack on a military
garrison and radio station in Namibia by rebel fighters
</P>
<P>
"I also wish to take this opportunity to condemn the recent
barbaric acts of terrorism in Katima Mulilo in Namibia. Acts of
terrorism aimed at subverting legitimate government should be
condemned in the strongest terms. Zambia in line with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), will not countenance any acts
that deviate from the principles and tenets of democracy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are equally anxious that peace returns to Angola, a country
with which we share common interests."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his government believed in the policy of
non-aggression towards any of the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all Zambians to back his government's effort in
finding peace to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in order
to ensure peace and mutual well being of the two countries for
sustained economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"My government is determined and fully committed to ensure that
Zambia's sovereignty is cardinal to national development, peace
and security must be provided to our people, if economic
development is to be achieved. Peace and security are therefore a
pre-requisite for economic and social development for Zambia and
our region," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered security forces to cooperate and stamp
out the source of lethal weapons being used by criminals in
committing heinous crimes of violence against the innocent hard
working citizens.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Fund-lack Family Planning Body to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, Malawi, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The National Family
Planning Welfare Council of Malawi will close at the end of this
month due to lack of funding, leaving about 85 percent of its
staff out of work, Malawi News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government announced last year it would stop funding 21
statutory corporations including the Copyright Society of Malawi,
Medical Council of Malawi, Malawi College of Accountancy, and
Nurses and Midwives Council of Malawi, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Executive Directors Martin Palamuleni said in a telephone
interview that the family planning council will close down because
government, which used to give the council eight million kwacha
(about 320,000 U.S. dollar) annual subvention has stopped funding
it until about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Established under an act of parliament in 1990 to advocate,
coordinate and support family planning and other reproductive
health activities, the council has about 40 members of staff.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Wesley Sangala said in a separate interview
that activities of the council will now be handled by ministry's
reproductive health and population services units.
</P>
<P>
He said the government could not afford the council because it
required a lot of money, much of which came from donors.
</P>
<P>
Government consulted the donors before arriving at the
decision, Sangala explained, adding that government has prepared
an end-of-service package for the council's staff.
</P>
<P>
Sangala hoped that some members of staff would get similar jobs
with the Kenyan Organization International Parenthood Association
to be launched in the country next month.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Malawian people with HIV/AIDS
involved in conduct likely to spread the disease, might soon face
criminal charges when the law commission completes a review of
the penal code on infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The country's daily Nation newspaper Quoted commission member
on criminal justice, Rosemary Kanyuka, as saying that the public
will be consulted before making a proposal on whether to make the
deliberate spread of HIV/ AIDS a criminal offence.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will be conducting workshops to seek public
opinion starting from the end of this month to see how best the
issue of criminalizing AIDS can be tackled." said Kanyuka at a
public lecture by the visiting U.S. judge Lajune Thomas Lange in
Blantyre Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commission's law reform officer Matilda Katpopla said Thursday
the move to treat people who deliberately spread HIV/AIDS as
criminals is in line with the review of the penal code under the
provision that deals with infectious diseases, the Malawi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She said the commission had already made progress by
recommending that courts give stiffer sentences to people who
commit sexual offences.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has also planned to conduct study tours within
the SADC (South African Development Community) region so that we
can learn about how other countries deals with such cases," said

<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Water is one the major components
targeted for priority action by the Kenyan government under its
National Poverty Eradication Plan, Water Resources Minister Arap
Ngeny said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Launching a sessional paper on national policy on management
and development of water resources, the minister said one of the
major challenges in water sector has been the sustainability of
the 1,800 water schemes spread all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya News Agency quoted the minister as saying that at
present, about 74 percent and 50 percent of Kenya's urban and
rural population respectively have access to safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of appropriate emphasis on the existing water
schemes in the past, the minister said, the government has
adapted various policy options in the water sector.
</P>
<P>
Ngeny pointed out that the sessional paper launched expounds a
policy that encourages more active involvement of the private
sector in the development and management of water resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was encouraged by the situation in which a
large number of operators such as self-help groups, organized
communities and non- governmental organizations have been
attracted to start operating water projects.
</P>
<P>
The document has further laid more emphasis on sewerage
development, institutional framework and financing the water
sector, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> France, Greece Face Legal Action for Tax Rule Offenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
decided to bring an action before the European Court of Justice
against France for its violation of value-added tax (VAT) rules
while giving a warning to Greece for its discriminatory tax
application in the sector of alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said it made
this decision after the French authorities refused to amend their
legislation to comply with the Community law and made no proper
response to a reasoned opinion sent to them on March 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body said the French legislation requires that
vehicles, aircraft and boats used for the instruction of drivers
and pilots be assigned exclusively to that purpose if they are to
qualify for VAT deduction.
</P>
<P>
Such a condition of exclusive use is not laid down in a related
EU directive and "therefore restricts the right to deduct, which
is one of the fundamental principles of the VAT system", it said.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU law, the European Commission has the right to
enforce rules in the whole 15-country European Union. It will
first send a letter of formal notice after finding out any
activity in a certain member country involving law violation.
Then it will send a "reasoned opinion" to the country if it did
not receive a satisfactory response.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the EU executive body will make a decision to bring an
action before the court against the country if it did not get a
proper answer from the country in two months.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the commission is giving a warning to Greece
through a reasoned opinion to force the country to change its
original rule application. It said in a statement that Greece has
applied a reduced tax rate on the alcohol used in the manufacture
of a spirituous drink called ouzo, which is produced exclusively
in that country.
</P>
<P>
The reduced tax rate is half of that imposed on all other
spirituous drinks, including all such drinks produced in other EU
member states, the commission said. "Such a difference clearly
discriminates in favor of the national producers in Greece, which
is where ouzo is exclusively produced," it added.
</P>
<P>
"If the necessary amendment is not made to the Greek tax system
within two months of receipt of the reasoned opinion", the EU
executive body said, it could bring the matter before the European
Court of Justice, the highest EU jurisdictional agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 postcards have
been received since January 1996 when two young girls from the
United States launched their "One Million Postcrd Campaign"
against the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to collect one million postcards to President
Clinton," 12-year-old Kouthar Al-Rawi said here Friday at a show
in the Palais des Nations sponsored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Kouthar and her 10-year-old sister, Marwa, asked adults and
children around the world to draw or write a postcard to U.S.
President Bill Clinton requesting him to lift the sacntions on
Iraq for the sake of the children.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the bombing against Iraq in January 1991, the
war didn't end for the Iraqi children," said the sisters.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4,500 innocent Iraqi children die each month, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Kouthar and Marwa Al-Rawi said that the United States
government is virtually alone in its insistence to uphold the
economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton, the people of Iraq are hungry, they are
thirsty, and the children continue to die," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
"We urge you to use your influence to bring happiness, joy, and
food to the children in Iraq, to make this world more peaceful and
just, and to put into practice the mandate dictated by the United
Nations last December, in its historic vote declaring the next
decade to be one promoting a culture of nonviolence," they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Death Toll Rises to 92 in Philippine Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the recent
landslides and flash floods that hit the northern Philippines rose
to 92 with the recovery of nine more bodies at the Cherry Hills
subdivision, an official report said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said in a
report that at least 36 people are still missing and 35 others
have been injured.
</P>
<P>
The total number of families affected by the monsoon heavy
rains in Metro Manila and nearby provinces reached 349,121 or
1,708,846 persons while about 129,607 hectares of agricultural
lands have been destroyed worth 333 million pesos (8.3 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the NDCC, estimated damage to infrastructure was
placed at 70 million pesos (1.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some 235 evacuation centers have been set up in Metro Manila
and the nearby provinces of La Union, Pangasinan, Tarlac,
Pampanga, Bulacan, Zambales, Nueva Ecija and Rizal sheltering
12,794 families or 58,530 persons.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said 32 of the fatalities were residents of Cherry
Hills subdivision in Rizal province where landslide destroyed 179
town houses on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers working round-the-clock since Tuesday night are
still looking for the more than 30 missing people.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces chief General Angelo Reyes said the military which
is spearheading the massive search and rescue effort from the
start will gradually turn over the job to non-government
organizations, the police and other volunteer groups in the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
He said only a small number of military personnel and heavy
equipment operators will remain to assist the rescue workers.
There are about 300 military personnel involved in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
Although four days have passed since the killer landslide
struck Cherry Hills, Reyes is hoping against hope there are still
survivors underneath the rubble.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that the debris and the soil structure and the
buildings are so unstable that if you hurry up the removal of the
debris, the whole thing might collapse so we have to work very
carefully on this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said rescue and clearing operations may take another
week because of the complicated situation on the spot.
</P>
<P>
As time passed, hopes were fading for the more than 30 people
who were believed trapped underneath the tangle of concrete slabs,
twisted iron sheets, and steel, said the NDCC.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five residents of the subdivision were rescued within a
few hours after the landslide. But none have been recovered alive
since then.
</P>
<P>
The government assured the public Friday that ongoing
investigation of the cause of the tragedy will yield the guilty
parties.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely somebody will have to be held responsible,"
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
Friday morning. But he declined to comment further pending the
results of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Presidential Palace expects to get at least an
initial report by Monday from the investigating committee, which
was tasked Thursday by Philippine President Joseph Estrada to wrap
up its probe in 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Estrada Thursday inspected the site of the landslide, where he
reiterated the need for the early passage by the Congress of the
Land Use Act which will rationalize further the housing program of
the country.
</P>
<P>
He also formed the investigating team to determine the
liability of parties responsible for the tragedy and vowed to
institute measures to prevent tragic landslides in the country.
</P>
<P>
Another landslide occurred in Caloocan City of Metro Manila on
Thursday night and endangered three houses. Fortunately, the
occupants of the houses managed to get out of their abode into
safety.
</P>
<P>
Weather improved Friday over the northern Philippines after
hammering the region with monsoon rains since Sunday, and
floodwaters have started receding in several provinces.
</P>
<P>
With the receding water level, life is now gradually getting
normal in some flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
The education authorities of Metro Manila also said the classes
in elementary and secondary schools might resume next Monday as
flood waters in several areas of the city have begun to subside.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological authorities said that while rains were
expected in the northern Philippines until Sunday, these would be
confined to early mornings, late afternoons and early evenings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cultural Circles Criticize Lee Teng-hui's"Two States" Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- People from Chinese cultural
circles gathered at a forum here today to condemn Lee Teng-hui's "
two states" statement, which reveals his evil motives to split the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The people on China's mainland and Taiwan share the same
history and cultural background, and are longing for the
reunification of the motherland, said the attendants at the forum,
who have been to Taiwan many times for cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Lee will only achieve notoriety by trying to split the country,
going against the people's will, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
"I have been to Taiwan three times for exchanges and
cooperation with my counterparts there," said Yang Xin, deputy
curator of the Palace Museum here.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that his Taiwan counterparts often expressed their
hope that the relics transported by the Kuomintang (KMT, the
Taiwan authorities) from the Palace Museum in Beijing to Taipei
would be returned to Beijing one day, and that Taiwan would return
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Leading cultural figures and famous artists also voiced their
disapproval of Lee's "two states" statement at today's forum, and
expressed their determination to safeguard China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Ministry of Justice held a forum to condemn Lee
Teng-hui's "two states" statement. Officials from the ministry
showed their firm stand of opposing the "two states" statement and
other statements, including "independence for Taiwan", "two Chinas
" and "one China, one Taiwan", which are aimed at splitting the
country.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government to Set Up Eco-Clubs for Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- In a move to make students
aware of the environment and ecology, the Indian government has
proposed to set up 1,000 eco-clubs in middle and secondary schools
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Friday that the objective of the
clubs would be to motivate children to keep their surroundings
green and clean, to encourage them to say "No" to the use of
plastic bags and promote afforestation and tree plantation in
their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, each school will be given a grant of 4,000
rupees (93 U.S. dollars) per year and at the end of each year, the
performance of the schools will be monitored by the Department of
Environment and the best will be given a trophy and a cash prize.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Nature of "Special State-to-State Relations" Statement is Splittism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- An Xinhua News Agency commentary
today stresses that the real nature of Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state relations" statement is splittism, not promoting
the level of cross-Straits talks, as the Taiwan authorities have
claimed.
</P>
<P>
It says the written speech of Koo Chenfu, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on July 30 and the written
explanation of the "Mainland Affairs Council" on August 1 were
attempts to whitewash Lee Teng-hui's "two states" statement.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that the common point of the two
speeches was to take Lee's remarks as "laying foundation for equal
cross-Straits dialogue."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the speeches are serious distortions of the real
situation of the cross-Straits talks, the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
It says that though the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have
not achieved reunification, the fact is that China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
This is a practical reflection of the situation of the cross-
Straits relations, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Since the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (
ARATS) and the SEF began their contacts and negotiations, the two
sides have taken the "One China" principle as the basis for
promotion of cross-Straits relations, though the two sides still
share different views on the political implications of the "One
China" principle.
</P>
<P>
The commentary emphasizes that denying and destroying the "One
China" principle is aimed at attempting to change the present
situation of cross-Straits relations, and China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It says that this is a challenge to peace and reunification,
and that the aim of Lee's "special state-to-state relations"
statement is to turn Taiwan into a "state" and then sperate it
from China.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the history of cross-Straits
negotiations indicates that Lee has been playing a role hindering
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "two states" statement, made before ARATS President Wang
Daohan's expected visit to Taiwan, has fundamentally destroyed the
foundation for cross-Straits negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Lee is putting the fundamental interests of Taiwan's people in
jeopardy, and that his aim is to ask for foreign intervention in
China's internal affairs and prepare for the "independence of
Taiwan," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the Chinese people will firmly safeguard China
's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that Lee Teng-hui's
splittism is doomed to failure.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Representative of China and Japan
signed several agreements on a five-year term of cooperation in
projects concerning information technology.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials and businessmen from northeast China's
Liaoning Province, Shenzhen City in south China's Guangdong
Province, Tianjin and Shanghai municipalities, Hubei Province in
central China and the Beijing Union Hospital, among others, signed
the documents along with the Japanese representatives.
</P>
<P>
The agreements cover six pilot projects concerning information
technology to be implemented before March 2003 -- a comprehensive
study of the movement of goods, long-distance education and
medical diagnosis, agricultural production and distribution, flood
monitoring and prevention, and forest fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
China's State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry and companies from
both countries will cooperate in using advanced multi-media
systems for the planned projects, according to SDPC officials.
</P>
<P>
The information technology cooperation project is one of 34
projects agreed upon during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan
last November. It is also the first governmental cooperation
project between China and a foreign country in the information
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation in February in Beijing, stating that between April
1998 and March 2003 they would spend from 2.5 billion to 3.0
billion Japanese yen (about 21.15 million US dollars to 25.38
million US dollars) on the pilot projects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find 100 Liver Cancer-Related Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Shanghai
Institute of Cell Biology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences
have discovered more than 100 genes which are related to the
incidence of liver cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
"We used the cDNA array to find those genes," said Dr Hu Gengxi,
head of the institute's Max-Planck Guest Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The cDNA array is a preliminary stage of bio-chip, which can
provide the most rapid biological analysis by integrating
thousands of items of biological information into a tiny piece of
material, Hu explained.
</P>
<P>
Besides the liver-cancer related genes, they have also found
more than 300 human genes with similar functions since they
started experiments at the end of 1998, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to identify 25,000 genes, or one fourth of the total
number of human genes," Hu added.
</P>
<P>
He said that his laboratory is also trying to develop a kind of
bio-chip which can help carry out early-stage diagnosis on cancer
such as liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that large-scale cancer checks will become a reality if
a new low-priced bio-chip can be used for diagnosis. It will only
take a few minutes to complete one check by using such a bio-chip,
he explained.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Buy 8 Strategic Bombers From Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia will buy eight strategic
Tupolev-160 bombers from Ukraine before the end of the next month,
Colonel-General Anatoly Kornukov, commander of the Russian air
force, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The planes will be brought to Russia as partial payment for
supplies of natural gas to Ukraine, which owes Moscow around 1
billion U.S. dollars. The deal was struck during Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin's recent visit to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"A decision to this effect has been made and, I think, we will
move these planes to Russia before the end of September," the
Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bombers will significantly increase the capability of the
country's strategic air force group, Kornukov said. The purchase
will bring the total of the group's number of strategic missile
carrying Tu-160s to 15.
</P>
<P>
The group will be stationed in Engels, Saratov region,
Kornukov said. "We have well-trained crews for every plane to be
obtained from Ukraine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said 85 percent of Russia's fleet of some 50 Tu-95MS
and six Tu-160 strategic bombers are combat ready with more than
enough crews to fly them. The crews flew an average of 21 hours
last year and 12 hours in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tu-160 and Tu-95MS bombers carried out long-range flights
during a major war game earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine owns 19 Tu-160 bombers based in Priluki, Chernigov
region, and 21 Tu-95MS bombers in Uzin, Kiev region. These planes
were meant to carry cruise missiles capable of delivering nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Russian air force officers and Tupolev design
bureau experts have recently visited the Ukrainian bases to find
that only 60 percent of the bombers were fit to fly, The Moscow
Times reported, quoting an official with the Russian air force.

<P>
He did not explain the reason for his resignation at the news
conference. Local political analysts said more and more
Moderaterna Party members are complaining that Bildt focused most
of his attention on international politics while ignoring Swedish
domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
The Moderaterna Party will elect a new leader in September.
</P>
<P>
Bildt took the post since 1986 and served as the country's
prime minister from 1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
He began focusing his attention on international politics in
1995, when he became the European Union's mediator to the conflict-
torn Bosnia. He won a international reputation for successfully
brokering a peace agreement there.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed as the U.N. envoy for Balkans in May this year.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko Denies Politics Behind Charges Against Former PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said Friday that charges filed against former Prime
Minister Mikhail Chigir, accused of embezzling 10 million U.S.
dollars, have nothing to do with the ex-premier's activities as an
opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Chigir was arrested last May on suspicion of embezzlement as
head of the Agroprombank commercial bank, a position he held
before becoming prime minister in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, citing the prosecutor general, said Chigir was
accused of stealing 10 million dollars. "Concrete documents prove
this," the Interfax news agency quoted Lukashenko as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Chigir's arrest "has absolutely nothing to do" with
the fact that he became an opposition activist after being
dismissed as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"What does politics have to do with this?" Lukashenko said, "
Let those who've stolen money return it, and we'll consider
releasing such people from custody."

<P>
HONG KONG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) said on Friday that the official foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong amounted to 89.1 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Including unsettled forward contracts, the foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong at the end of July 1999 also stood at 89.1
billion U.S. dollars, according to an HKMA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign currency reserves ranking, Hong Kong is the
world's fifth largest holder of foreign currency reserves,
following Japan, China's mainland, Taiwan and Germany, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 500 million U.S. dollars in settled foreign
currency assets during the month reflects mainly the valuation
effect of foreign currency investments held by the Exchange Fund,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the total foreign currency assets
of 89.1 billion U.S. dollars represent over seven times the
currency in circulation, one of the highest ratios in the world.

<HEADLINE> Bond Market Booming in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Bond market is booming in
Singapore with corporate debt issuance totaling 9.0 billion
Singapore dollars (5.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of
1999, equal to the amount for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore-dollar issues by statutory boards and foreign
entities ballooned to 4.0 billion Singapore dollars (2.4 billion
U.S. dollars) from practically nothing.
</P>
<P>
The revelation was made by Minister for Health and Second
Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang Thursday when he made
congratulatory remarks on the announcement of the first batch of
financial institutions awarded the Approved Bond Intermediary
status.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has carried out a number of reforms in the financial
sector since last year, including liberalizing commercial banking
and upgrading local banks, boosting bond markets and liberalizing
guidelines on the internationalization of the Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that a vibrant bond market is important to the
overall development of Singapore's financial sector, the
government has introduced various new policy initiatives to boost
Singapore's debt markets and make the operating environment more
conducive to bond players.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the implementation of these initiatives, the
number of bond issues increased significantly and representation
of issues by both foreign and local entities became much broader.
</P>
<P>
Various efforts have been made in Singapore to boost its debt
market.
</P>
<P>
A committee has been set up by the government to spearhead bond
issuance by the statutory boards and both the public and private
sectors have been encouraged to engage in the bond market for
capital raising.
</P>
<P>
A host of tax incentives have been introduced to promote the
development of an active bond market and foreign entities have
been allowed to issue bonds in Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
A key component of the country's strategy to develop the debt
capital market is to attract reputable global fixed income trading
and arranging teams to base their Asian operations in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the objectives of drawing more
international debt teams into Singapore and tap the Singapore
dollar market, the Monetary Authority of Singapore introduced the
Approved Bond Intermediary or the ABI scheme in this year's
budget.
</P>
<P>
Carrying out this scheme, the MAS announced Thursday the first
batch of 16 financial institutions awarded the Approved Bond
Intermediary status after evaluating their debt origination and
trading capabilities in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Once a financial institution has been accorded the ABI status,
all debt security lead managed by it will be treated as qualifying
securities. The ABI will also be exempt from tax on fee income
from debt market activities while holders of the qualifying
securities will enjoy a 10-percent concessionary tax rate on
interest income.
</P>
<P>
Singapore aims to play a key role as a leading international
hub in Asia, dealing also in non-Singapore dollar issues.
</P>
<P>
The MAS believes time has come for Singapore companies to
actively engage in the bond market as the environment and
sentiment at the financial market have improved much.
</P>
<P>
The government will form a debt market committee comprising
representatives from the MAS and other relevant government
agencies and this multi-agency committee will drive and coordinate
the overall strategies in developing the Singapore debt markets.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also look at how public and private sector
bond-raising could be further encouraged and review and develop a
regulatory and infrastructural environment that is conducive to
the growth of a vibrant debt market.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Lim said, "what we have done are initial steps.
The challenges ahead are to get liquidity in the market."
</P>
<P>
"The government sets the operating framework and we encourage
as many players as possible, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Regional Bank Files for Liquidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Namihaya Bank, a Japanese regional
bank, filed for liquidation with the Financial Reconstruction
Commission (FRC) on Friday, giving up its efforts to survive with
the issuance of new shares to boost its capital.
</P>
<P>
Shinji Yoshida, president of the Osaka-based, second-tier
regional bank, told a press conference that the bank made the
decision after finding it difficult to recapitalize itself and
unable to repay depositors.
</P>
<P>
Yoshida said the bank foresaw its debts exceeded assets by
nearly 110 billion yen (about 96 million dollars) at the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
Namihaya Bank, the product of a merger of two regional banks in
Osaka last October, has been tottering under the weight of massive
bad loans for some time.
</P>
<P>
The FRC, a government body authorized to put troubled banks
under temporary state control, is expected to convene an
extraordinary meeting Saturday to recognize Namihaya Bank as
insolvent and decide to send bankruptcy administrators to the bank.
</P>
<P>
Even if the bank is declared bankrupt, it could continue doing
business over the weekend with deposits fully protected.
</P>
<P>
Namihaya Bank would be the sixth Japanese bank declared
bankrupt by the FRC under financial reconstruction legislation
aimed at fixing the bad loan-saddled banking system.
</P>
<P>
It would also become the fourth second-tier regional bank
declared bankrupt, following Tokyo Sowa Bank, Kokumin Bank and
Kofuku Bank.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Acquires Swedish Vehicle-Maker Scania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle-maker Volvo AB
announced Friday that it has acquired the rival Swedish truck and
bus maker Scania after taking a majority share in the company.
</P>
<P>
Volvo President and Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news
conference Friday that under an acquisition deal reached between
Volvo and Investor AB, the investment arm of Sweden's powerful
Wallenberg family, Volvo should take over a 49 percent stake in
Scania that had been owned by Investor AB.
</P>
<P>
Volvo also offered to buy the rest of Investor AB's share in
Scania in the deal valued at 60.7 billion kronor (7.4 billion U.S.
dollars). The deal gives Volvo 69.6 percent of the votes in
Scania.
</P>
<P>
Volvo began its push to acquire Scania in January, several
weeks before announcing the sale of its passenger car division to
Ford Motors.
</P>
<P>
After the acquisition, Scania will constitute a division within
Volvo, with its trademarks and distribution staying separate from
Volvo.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, which must be approved by the European Union,
would create the world's second-largest manufacturer of trucks and
buses, behind DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said the merger of two big vehicle manufacturers will
make Volvo and Scania products more competitive in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the merger will bring in 4 billion to 5
billion kronor of economic benefit for Volvo and Scania.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Scania's sales were 45 billion kronor (5.6 billion
dollars) and Volvo's non-passenger car sales were 83 billion
kronor (10.2 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM to Go to East Timor to Discuss Ballot </HEADLINE>

<P>
JAKARTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas is scheduled to arrive in Dili, capital of East Timor
Saturday to discuss various issues concerning the autonomy ballot
to be held there on August 30, a U.N. official Friday said.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign minister is to meet with the head of the U.N.
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), Ian Martin, tomorrow for talks on
security, code of conduct for the ballot campaign, and issues on
the process of the upcoming ballot," Antara News Agency quoted
UNAMET deputy spokesman Yasuhiro Ueki as saying in Dili Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ueki said Alatas will be accompanied by a number of ministers.
</P>
<P>
He also said that until Wednesday, the UNAMET had registered
439,580 people for the ballot, 427,190 of whom signed up in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, the ballot registration period should end on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The code of conduct for pre-balloting political campaigning in
East Timor is expected to be approved this week and it will
subsequently be announced and published next Monday, Ueki said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the approval of the code of conduct is slow,
the campaign period has not been determined yet. However, the
campaign period is anticipated to be from August 11 to August 27.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is organizing a direct ballot in East Timor
to enable the East Timorese to accept or reject a wide-ranging
autonomy offered by the Indonesian government early this year.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the autonomy proposal will mean independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Hamas Leader Announces Revival of Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The spiritual leader of the
Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, Sheikh Yassin, announced in
an interview published on Friday that his movement would revive
military action against Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Liberation made in his
home in Gaza, Yassin said that the Palestinians need now more than
ever before to carry out resistance against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The days which will come will show that the military branch (
of Hamas) always exists," he said, when asked whether the Hamas
has given up its armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said that to win cooperation from Hamas, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat should abandon the Oslo agreements signed with
Israel first.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to negotiate with your enemy, you should be as
strong as he. If you negotiate with him in a state of weakness,
you will not achieve a peace process, but a process of
capitulation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin said that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is not "
a man of peace but a man of war."
</P>
<P>
"The proof is, he went to the United States talking about peace
but came back with 8 billion U.S. dollars worth of armaments," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should resist the occupation more than ever before, there
is no alternative to the military action today," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Striving to Promote High-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- This special economic zone in
south China's Guangdong Province is promoting the development of
high-tech industry by introducing a range of preferential policies
and clearing away some restrictive measures that hindered the
registration of new high-tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to newly published policies, non-residents will be
encouraged to apply to start up new high-tech businesses in
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Previously, it was mandatory for at least one of the
shareholders in a local business to have permanent residence
registration in Shenzhen if he or she wanted to set up a new high-
tech business.
</P>
<P>
The new policies also stipulate that high-tech achievements can
be evaluated as high as 35 percent of the registered capital for
new high-tech businesses, while the registered capital for such
businesses can be paid in installments over two years.
</P>
<P>
During the implementation of the new policies, overseas
citizens will be allowed to hold such posts as members of the
boards of directors, supervisors or managers of new high-tech
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors will also be allowed to ignore the benchmark
of 25 percent of the registered capital for starting up new high-
tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shenzhen will be the venue for China's first
international high-tech fair, which will be held October 5-10 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Some 31 Chinese provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have announced plans to send delegations to the
fair. A large number foreign high-tech companies, including
multinationals such as Microsoft, IBM, Ericsson and Siemens, have
also applied to attend.
</P>
<P>
Government delegations from a number of countries, including
Canada, Australia, Italy and Finland, will attend the fair, along
with representatives from US laboratories and Canadian
universities. In addition, organizers report that a number of
overseas banking organizations have expressed strong interest in
the event.

<HEADLINE> China Initiates Self-Protection Drive for Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A school to train minors how to
protect themselves, the first of its kind in China, was
established today in Daxing County near this Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are 360 million people under the age
of 18 in China. Governments at all levels have paid great
attention to their healthy growth, and made considerable efforts
to provide good education for them.
</P>
<P>
The school will provide a variety of training programs on self-
protection, self-rescue and mutual protection, with the aim of
helping youngsters to develop a healthy psychology and personality
when confronted with mental problems, disasters and accidents.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that more such schools will be set up across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, the country has implemented a series
of regulations and laws on protecting minors against criminals.
</P>
<P>
While calling on the whole of society to join the protection
efforts, education experts also urged improving education in self-
protection for young persons.
</P>
<P>
Last November, a 14-year old girl was kidnapped and murdered
near her home in Beijing when she was watching a meteor shower,
according to a local educator.
</P>
<P>
The incident might have been avoided if the girl had had an
adequate knowledge of self-protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
A week after the incident, the city carried out an education
and promotion drive on juvenile self-protection. The relevant
departments set up a training camp, opened a 24-hour telephone
line, hosted a law seminar and recruited volunteers in this field.

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Rebels Release Several Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A branch of Sierra Leone rebels
late Thursday released several hostages they kidnapped Wednesday,
according to information reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The released includes two U.N. officials, one Rueter reporter
and one clergy man.
</P>
<P>
The development is believed to be related to the intensive
negotiations underway between the rebels and Foday Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and Sierra Leone's government.
</P>
<P>
Christo Johnson who was among the freed Thursday said Friday in
Freetown that all the hostages were well and that their captors
wanted food and medicine among other demands.
</P>
<P>
Johnson with other hostages were seized Wednesday in the Okra
Hills region about 65 km east of the country's capital Freetown by
soldiers loyal to a military junta that supplanted elected
President Tejan Kabbah in 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people including U.N. observers, West Africa Peace
Keeping Force (ECOMOG) officials, journalists, and other personnel
were believed to be taken hostages by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), who signed a
peace agreement with the government on July 7, said Thursday that
their leader Foday Sankoh had instructed the captors to release
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are former soldiers of the junta that seized
power in May 1997 and were ousted by the West African Peace
Keeping Force of ECOMOG in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers said they would release the hostages if the
peace agreement signed on July 7 in Lome, Togo, was revised.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they were not satisfied with conditions
accorded them under the agreement which provides that the rebels
share power with the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 6 (Xinhua) --A sample survey shows that most
overseas investors are satisfied with the investment environment
of this special economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The overseas investors surveyed say that the stability of the
city's policies and legal guarantees regarding overseas investment
have given them confidence, and the rapid expansion of Shenzhen is
also creating many opportunities for business development.
</P>
<P>
The survey was done recently by the Shenzhen Overseas
Investment Promotion Bureau in order to study the situation of
overseas businesses in Shenzhen and offer constructive opinions to
help the city government work out policies conducive to improving
the city's investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The overseas investors surveyed also say that they believed
that tax policies affect their investment plans. Some of them
complained that administrative controls and comparatively higher
costs of labor limit the development of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
By April this year, Shenzhen approved 22,515 overseas-backed
projects, involving investments totalling 28.3 billion U.S.
dollars. So far, 18.03 billion dollars of overseas investment have
been pumped into the city.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 leading international companies have invested in
180 projects in Shenzhen, and many overseas investors have
increased their investments here.

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Integrity of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it
wholeheartedly supports the integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement, reiterated by officials with the Russian
Foreign Ministry, came after Yugoslavia's Montenegro republic
passed a draft plan Thursday on name change aimed at loosening its
partnership with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Moscow regards relations between these two constituent
republics of Yugoslavia as an internal affair of that country, the
news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that these issues should be solved
through political dialogue and within a constitutional framework,"
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue cooperating with Montenegro as part of
Yugoslavia, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to Montenegro Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic, the
plan proposes that the name of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
be changed into the Commonwealth of States of Montenegro and
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The plan suggests replacing the current federal government
with a "council of ministers" and the current two-chamber Yugoslav
parliament with a single house, said Vujanovic, who is supported
by the West.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the abolition of the central foreign
ministry and the establishment of two separate foreign ministries
instead.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Belgrade said that the plan, which is going to be
presented to the parliament of Montenegro and the government of
Serbia, is a result of the West's isolation policy on Serbia,
which, with Montenegro, formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
in April, 1992 after the former Yugoslavia fell apart.

<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The rebels in Sierra Leone have
kidnapped 15 persons including officials of U.N. missions in the
war-torn country and asked the revision of the peace agreement
signed last month between the government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) said that
rebel leader Foday Sankoh had given instructions for their
release, adding that "they will be released before (Thursday)
evening", The Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages including five British soldiers, who were working
for a U.N. mission in the country, were seized Wednesday and were
being held in the region of Occra Hills, about 40 kilometers east
of capital Freetown, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are former soldiers of the junta that seized
power in May 1997 and were ousted by the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers said they would release the hostages if the
peace agreement signed on July 7 in Lome, Togo, was revised.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they were not satisfied with conditions
accorded them under the agreement which provides that the rebels
share power with the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Urban Subway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to step up the
construction of its urban subway system in a bid to reduce urban
pollution and spur the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The government is ready to approve subway lines in cities
including Chongqing, Qingdao and Shenyang, following the recent
approval of a line in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province,
according to vice construction minister Zhao Baojiang.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's ceremony marking the delivery of the first
batch of cars for a new section of Beijing's subway system, Zhao
said that developing subway systems is important for controling
the worsening air pollution and alleviating traffic congestion in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 kilometers of subways have been constructed in
Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, while some new lines
are under construction in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said construction of more subways will also lend a strong
boost to the national economy since subways are an important part
of the urban infrastructure, and their construction may greatly
stimulate the machinery and electronics industries.

<P>
MACAO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Currency and Foreign Exchange
Authority of Macao has announced that the computer systems in
local banks are able to go smoothly through the year 2000 (Y2K).
</P>
<P>
The banks in Macao completed the testing of their computer

problem in 1997. Recently, the authority sent out questionnaires
to local banks to check their progress in handling the Y2K problem,
and the results turned out to be satisfying.
</P>
<P>
To make sure that the banks have the ability to deal with
unpredictable situation, the authority requires that the banks
work out emergency measures before September.
</P>
<P>
The sources with the authority noted that individual depositors
do not have to worry about their accounts, as the banks will back
up data for each client in advance.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Purchases Subway Cars for New Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The first order of 30
domestically produced subway cars were delivered today for trial
operations on a new section of Beijing's subway system, which will
begin on September 28.
</P>
<P>
The cars are the fourth and latest generation of China-made
subway cars, and the most advanced yet. A total of 174 cars will
be needed for the new line.
</P>
<P>
The newly completed 13.5-kilometer-long line, which runs from
Fuxingmen to Bawangfen, has 11 stations along the way, and passes
through Tian'anmen Square. It is also the main underground line
along the city's major thoroughfare, Chang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
This project is an addition to Beijing's current 42-kilometer-
long subway lines, and was jointly built by the Beijing City
Construction Co., the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering
Corporation, and the No.16 Engineering Bureau under the Ministry
of Railways.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 7.57 billion yuan (908.4 million U.S.
dollars), the project broke ground in 1992, but failed to meet the
original deadline of 1996 due to a shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
After going into trial operations on September 28, the new line,
with the carrying capacity of 30,000 passenger per hour, is
expected to greatly relieve traffic jams along Chang'an Avenue.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Slams Congo Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
condemned the alleged air raid Wednesday carried out by Sudanese
planes in the northwestern part of the the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The bombing, which Kampala said to be at the request of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, claimed a total of 524 lives
in areas bordering Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Barigye Ba-hoku, press assistant to State Minister of Defense
Steven Kavuma, told Xinhua in a telephone interview Friday morning
that the matter is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local newspapers said Kavuma and his counterpart for
regional cooperation Amama Mbabazi condemned the incident, saying
that it is a violation of the Lusaka cease-fire accord.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi said those who refuse to endorse the agreement are to
blame because this is endangering the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala-based New Vision paper said that by attacking the
northern Congo, Sudan was trying to hit the Ugandans where they
can because they are their enemy and to lock Uganda in the war.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Congolese Liberation Movement,
a rebel group fighting in the northern Congo and backed by the
Ugandan government, said recently that the bombing was done on
behalf of the Congolese government.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government Thursday denied any link with the
bombing. Information Minister Didier Mumengi dismissed the claim
and called on Bemba to provide proof of his statement.
</P>
<P>
He said Congolese forces respect the cease-fire agreement and
accused Bemba of making the allegations in a bid to keep the war
going.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum government has denied any involvement in the
year-old Congolese civil war which also sucked in some other
African countries in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Daewoo Group and the
U.S. General Motors (GM) Friday exchanged a memorandum of
understanding on strategic auto alliance, agreeing to talk further
on a specific plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the alliance plan, the GM will possibly take over Daewoo
Motors, the auto unit of the South Korean company.
</P>
<P>
"The two companies decided to withhold details from the public
until negotiations are completed, " Daewoo said Friday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Daewoo Motors, the second largest automaker in South Korea,
is under the weight of an estimated 11790 billion won (9.8 billion
U.S. dollars) in debt.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean company, with five factories in South Korea
and 12 production bases abroad, has an annual capacity of 1,260,
000 vehicles. Last year it sold 880,000 units in both domestic and
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
GM officials reportedly said that they would begin a due

month.

<HEADLINE> Monetary Reform in Angola Urgent: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Financial Minister Joaquim
David said that a monetary reform is urgent and important for his
inflation-torn country, a newspaper here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
David was quoted as saying Thursday that the monetary reform
will be based on a change of the national currency reajusted
kwanza, or called "a cut of zeros on bank-note".
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that the currency system of the reajusted
kwanza, with too many zeros in paper money, has caused
insustainable problems in social life and sometimes even beyond
the capability of computers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government should have an alternative for the
reajusted kwanza, David said the fundmental objective of the
currency reform is to stabilize social life and the financial
market in his country.
</P>
<P>
The reajusted kwanza has devaluated fast since the turn of the
year when the civil war broke out, hindering the country's
industry from developing.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government gave up on June 3 the fixed rate of
exchange, in a bid to curb inflation and strike the illegal
currency exchange market.
</P>
<P>
But the impasse in the battlefield and the deteriorating
economic situation prevented the policy from working. On Friday,
the exchange rate in reajusted kwanza against the U.S. dollar is
1:3,080,000 (one dollar for 3.08 million reajusted kwanza), worth
only a quarter of its value on June 2, when it was officially
priced at 1:710,000 in exchange for the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Produce Anti-Malaria Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is to produce
anti-malaria chemicals itself within this fiscal year starting
July 8, a report reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Halala, general manager of the Adami-Tulu Pesticides
Processing factory, was quoted as saying that his factory is due
to produce three types of anti-malaria chemicals in an effort to
check the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the new products, the pesticides factory, which was
established last year with a capital of 51.3 million birr (6.4
million U.S. dollars), has been manufacturing 10 types of liquid
and dust pesticides to protect crops from pests and animals from
ectoparasites.
</P>
<P>
The home-made anti-malaria chemicals not only help reduce
expenses on importing pesticides, but also enable the people to
get them locally with reasonable price at proxy, Samuel said.
</P>
<P>
According to the manager, the quality of chemicals produced in
his factory fully meet the standards set by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, their efficacy has been proved successful
in the laboratories of Ethiopian agricultural research institutes.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Prosecutor Requests to Free Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A Spanish prosecutor has appealed
to the high court to annul the ruling made on October 16, 1998 on
August Pinochet so that the former Chilean leader can be released,
press reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, has been detained in London for the past 10
months at the request of the Spanish court.
</P>
<P>
The appeal by state prosecutor Pedro Rubira came after Chile
and Spain were reportedly trying to reach an out-of-court deal to
free Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Rubira said that the former Chilean leader is immune from
prosecution for crimes committed during his rule.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital last October.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused Pinochet of being responsible for the
disappearances and deaths of 3,000 people and wanted him to be
extradited from Britain to face trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Spanish State Procuratorate was
reportedly considering having Pinochet released from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The British government had declared that if Spain dropped its
request for extradition, Pinochet would be free to go home.

<HEADLINE> Water-Saving Irrigation Brings Good Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China has saved 15 billion cubic
meters of water and increased its grain production capacity by 23
billion kilograms since it began promoting water-saving irrigation
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had spent 25 billion yuan to
build water-saving irrigation facilities covering 5.63 million
hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, irrigation techniques for 8.66 million
hectares of farmland have been improved, according to sources from
Ministry of Water Resources (MWR).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China began to develop water-saving irrigation systems
in 300 counties, which marked the beginning of a full-scale
nationwide campaign to promote water-saving irrigation.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 100 counties have reached state standards,
and over 100 counties have completed most of the construction work,
in addition to the completion of 209 high-yield grain pilot zones
irrigated by water-saving facilities.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are now underway for a water-saving irrigation
project to be created with a 100 million U.S. dollars loan from
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
An MWR official said that with the financial support of the
central government, 15 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous
regions have been developing rainwater collecting and drip
irrigation projects, helping to bring many farmers in China's arid
and semi-arid regions out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, during 1997 and 1998,
nearly 400,000 rain-collecting sites and 3.77 million water
cellars, wells, and other types of water-storing facilities were
built in these regions, with a total investment 2.6 billion yuan,
increasing water supplies by 680 million cubic meters annually.

<HEADLINE> South China City Speeds Up Opening Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The government of this capital of
south China's Hainan Province has carried out a series of
promotion measures recently aimed at accelerating the city's
opening up.
</P>
<P>
Haikou has provided overseas investors a variety of business
and production projects in the fields of ecological tourism,
sports tours, biological pharmaceuticals, environmental protection,
marine development, as well as the processing, storing, packing
and transporting of agricultural by-products.
</P>
<P>
The city also has opened a number of websites to offer Internet
users worldwide abundant information about its investment projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has hosted many trade fairs to heighten
high-tech exchanges and production cooperation between local
enterprises and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
As one focus of the city's opening up efforts, international
tourism will play a more important role in developing the local
economy, as Haikou plans to send a delegation to Indonesia for a
tourism promotion drive later this year.
</P>
<P>
The city will also hold seminars in September and October in
conjunction with dozens of other Chinese cities on the joint
development on international tourism.

<HEADLINE> Truth of Falun Gong's Besieging of Chongqing Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The besieging of a newspaper in
this southwest China city last November by the Falun Gong cult was
a plotted act aimed at disrupting social stability.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 Falun Gong practitioners besieged and attacked on
the Chongqing Evening News from November 4 to 6 last year after
the local paper reported on the cult and the harm it had done.
</P>
<P>
On November 1, 1998, the newspaper received a hotline call from
a worker at the Southwest Medicine Factory about the break-up of
his family.
</P>
<P>
The next day, the paper carried a story titled "When would
Laughter Return to My Home?" telling the story of the changes in
the worker's wife, Zhang Longhui, who had practiced Falun Gong for
several months and was seeking a divorce.
</P>
<P>
On November 3, Gu Zhiyi, chief of Falun Gong's general
instruction station in Chongqing, gathered a horde of Falun Gong
practitioners and decided to "preach" and demand apologies the
next day at the paper's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Early on November 4, the paper was surrounded by Falun Gong
practitioners who put up a big banner and forced their way into
the offices of editors and reporters, demanding that the paper
publish an open apology.
</P>
<P>
They also threatened that if the paper did not apologize, they
would exercise their "gong" to "inundate the paper with floods"
and "make the Earth explode ahead of schedule."
</P>
<P>
Editors and reporters at the paper, and its parent paper the
Chongqing Daily, had to stop work and persuade the practitioners
to go home.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Gong practitioners continued their harassment of the
paper for the next two days, and seriously disrupted the normal
working routine there.
</P>
<P>
Now, more and more people involved in Falun Gong have realized
the political nature of the cult, and have broken away from it in
large numbers.
</P>
<P>
Several key Falun Gong members in cities including Beijing and
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, are reported to
have stood up and exposed the harm done by the cult.

<HEADLINE> China Initiates Program for Preventing Birth Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commission Vice Minister Yang Kuifu said at the project's start-
up ceremony that the government's population and family planning
policy includes population control, improving population quality,
and providing natal health care.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has set a target for population and
family planning for the first decade of the next century: to
maintain the total population within 1.3 billion by 2000, and
reduce birth deficiencies; to maintain the total population within
1.4 billion by 2010; and to provide basic natal health care for
couples of fertility age.
</P>
<P>
Among China's 20 million newborn babies every year, 4 to 6
percent are congenitally deficient, including both visible and
invisible natal deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
Professor Li Zhu of Beijing Medical University said that the
first step for improving population quality is to reduce the birth-
deficiency rate.
</P>
<P>
The State Family Planning Commission has decided to develop
this program for preventing birth deficiencies by establishing a
scientific supervision and prevention system to fulfill the
country's family planning policy.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 87 in Philippine Landslides, Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from landslides and
floods caused by continuous rains in the northern Philippines in
the past days rose to 87 as of Friday afternoon, the National
Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC also said at least 36 people were still missing and 35
others were injured.
</P>
<P>
In the Cherry Hill sub-division of Rizal province where a
landslide destroyed 179 town houses on Tuesday evening, rescuers
found three more bodies on Friday, bringing the death toll to 30.
</P>
<P>
Rescue and retrieval operations were continued there by teams
from the Armed Forces and the police, assisted by various private
rescue groups.
</P>
<P>
The landslide struck the sub-division in Antipolo City at about
8:00 p.m. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government assured the public Friday that the ongoing
investigation of the cause of the tragedy will find the guilty
parties.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely somebody will have to be held responsible,"
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
Friday morning. But he declined to comment further pending the
results of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Presidential Palace expects to get at least an
initial report by Monday from the investigating committee, which
was tasked Thursday by President Joseph Estrada to wrap up its
probe in 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Estrada inspected Thursday the site of the landslide, where he
reiterated the need for an early passage by the Congress of the
Land Use Act which will rationalize further the housing program of
the country.
</P>
<P>
He also formed the investigating team to determine the
liability of parties responsible for the tragedy and vowed to
institute measures to prevent tragic landslides in the country.
</P>
<P>
Another landslide occurred in Caloocan City of Metro Manila on
Thursday night and endangered three houses. Fortunately, the
occupants of the houses managed to get out of their abode into
safety.
</P>
<P>
The landslides and floods caused by continuous heavy rains in
the past few days affected more than 1.5 million people in the
capital region and nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department estimated that floods have damaged
nearly 100 million pesos (2.5 million U.S. dollars) worth of rice
and other crops in 10 provinces in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological authorities said that while rains were
expected in this area until Sunday, they would be confined to
early mornings, late afternoons and early evenings.
</P>
<P>
Life is now getting normal in some flooded areas as floods are
receding with the easing of the monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
The education authorities of Metro Manila also said the classes
in elementary and secondary schools will resume at the latest on
Monday as flood waters in several areas in the city have begun to
subside.

Amy Chan, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA), and Lily Shum, HKTA regional director for the

<P>
She said that she was very honored to be considered one of the
most powerful women in the sector, particularly in the U.S. where

1999. We aim to maintain growth by actively tapping into new
market segments and developing stronger relationships with the
media and trade," Chan said.

<HEADLINE> Role of U.N. Organizations Should Be Increased: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that to help realize the comprehensive economic
and social development of developing countries, the role of the
United Nations (U.N.) organizations should be increased.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to continue conducting and reinforcing
cooperation with the U.N. and its organizations, Jiang said in a
meeting with administrator Mark Brown of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) this morning in this summer coastal
resort of Beidaihe, about 300 kilometers east of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The multi-lateral assistance organizations of the U.N., as
major forces for world development and cooperation, have important
and active roles to play in this aspect, Jiang said, reiterating
China's consistent support for the U.N.'s role in world affairs
and the purpose and principles of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China has made considerable achievements in
economic construction and social development since 1978 when it
initiated the reform and opening-up policy, and cooperation with
the UNDP has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation has served as a channel for China in learning
foreign scientific and technological developments, absorbing
advanced technology, and drawing on advanced management experience,
and it has also assisted China in resolving problems concerning
reform, opening up, and economic and social development, the
Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
As the 21st century draws near, peace and development should be
worldwide goals, Jiang said, adding that all countries should
cooperate with equality and respect for diversity.
</P>
<P>
China opposes the idea that all countries must deal with
different issue in the same way and by the same approach, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are pursuing an independent
foreign policy of peace, and consider the development of the
national economy and the promotion of development worldwide as
their primary task, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that only when the vast developing countries
achieve comprehensive economic and social developments, can world
peace and stability enjoy a solid foundation.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he is happy with China's achievements over the past
20 years, and satisfied with the UNDP's fruitful cooperation with
China during that period.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNDP highly appreciates the Chinese government's
support for its work, and it is willing to join with the Chinese
government to contribute to the reform, opening and modernization
drive ongoing in the country.
</P>

Brown is visiting China as guest of China's Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng.

<HEADLINE> PNA Calls for U.S. Intervention Over Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
asked U.S. intervention for a fair and precise implementation of
the Wye Accord, PNA chief negotiator Saed Erekat has said.
</P>
<P>
Several contacts were made with U.S. Special Envoy to the
Middle East Denis Ross and other officials and "we asked their
help so as to ensure honest and timely implementation of the Wye
Agreement because U.S. is a key sponsor of the peace process,"
Erekat was quoted by the Arabic daily Al-Ayam published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contacts came after the recent conclusive talks between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Israel proposed to postpone the troops
withdrawal from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank stipulated in
the Wye Accord and combine the third of the three-phase pullback
with the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The status talks, which should have started by May 1996, will
deal with the thorniest issues in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations, such as the fate of Jerusalem, refugees and borders.
</P>
<P>
Israelis regard the holy city as their undivided and eternal
capital while the Palestinians want it their capital for their
future state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have pinned hopes on Israeli newly elected
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to implement the Wye Accord that was
suspended by his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu in early December.
</P>
<P>
The recent inconclusive talks have disappointed the
Palestinians and they rejected any modification to the Wye Accord.
</P>
<P>
PNA Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo has said
"now we see no need for more meetings."
</P>
<P>
"The meetings are not the problem since they seem to be of no
use. The real problem is that Barak, like Netanyahu, wants to
convey to the world from those meetings as if here is no
trouble. That is nothing but deception," said the minister, who is
also a member of Higher Commission for Negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Information Industry Officials Slam Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Leading Chinese officials and
experts in the field of information denounced Lee Teng-hui's
splittist remarks here today, saying that his "two states"
statement has destroyed healthy cross-Straits cooperation, and
they urged him to stop all activities splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, Minister of Information Industry told a seminar
that Lee's "two states" or "special state-to-state relations"
statement has further exposed his nature as one that wants to
split China's territory and sovereignty, enraging Chinese people
both at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
He said President Jiang Zemin reiterated China's solemn stand
on the Taiwan issue in a recent telephone conversation with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, which fully conveyed the determination of
the Chinese people to safeguard the territorial and sovereign
integrity of China.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the "peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems" principles, cross-Straits trade and
personnel exchanges have been expanding in recent years, and
progress in direct links for mail, shipping and trade has also
been made, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
So far, the GSM mobile phone, ISDN, and other
telecommunications businesses have been opened between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits, and post and telecommunications
volume has also been on the rise in recent years.

basis.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, made the remarks in a meeting today with UNDP

adding that assistance projects launched by the UNDP have helped
developing countries in their economic growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
China is satisfied with its cooperation with the UNDP over the
past two decades, Shi said, expressing the hope that such
cooperation will continue to grow in the years ahead.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Seven people have been killed and
dozens severely injured in a flood that hit the eastern part of
northwest China's Qinghai Province over the past three days,
according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
The flood, caused by heavy rains and hail, damaged a large
number of houses, highways, railways, and crop areas, said Sun Lin,
an official with the Qinghai Civil Administration Department.
</P>
<P>
He said the flood swept across five counties and over 20
townships and 100 villages, affecting more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The flood also inundated 16,000 mu (about 1,000 hectares) of
farmland, destroying hundreds of hectares of cultivated land and
causing over 400 houses to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Mountain torrents triggered by heavy rains also damaged some
road beds in the area, suspending operations on three sections of
the Qinghai-Lanzhou railway line and leaving passengers on the
line stranded for nine hours.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have been sent to the area to evacuate flood
victims and are working round the clock to repair damages, Sun

<HEADLINE> Govt Revenue Up in First 6 Months in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's government revenues
 increased by nearly 50 percent in the first six months of this
year, according to a Ministry of Finance report.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the increase mainly to the introduction
of the 10 percent value-added tax (VAT) that came into force at
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
VAT alone accounted for 44.2 million U.S. dollars in revenue,
more than 60 percent of the total revenue collected by the
government, the Cambodia Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report also predicts the country will have a 4 percent
growth in its gross domestic product this year.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries have demanded that the Cambodian government
broaden its tax base and carry out extensive fiscal reforms. The
report shows that efforts being made to this end have yielded some
positive results.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian, Ghanaian Police Probe Arms Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Police (INTERPOL)
of Nigeria and Ghana have begun investigating the case of six
Ghanaians arrested in Lagos for smuggling arms into Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian High Commissioner to Nigeria James Kwofie said
Thursday that the INTERPOL had been asked to unveil the
circumstances surrounding the arms smuggling, according to a New
Nigerian report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kwofie who is leading a high-powered delegation from Ghana
noted that investigations were going on and it would be premature
at this stage to interfere in the investigations, so the INTERPOL
of the two countries would be comparing notes.
</P>
<P>
He stated that his home government viewed arms smuggling
seriously, especially with the importance his government attaching
to the numerous bilateral relations with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The action the Ghanaian government would take on the arms
smugglers would to a large extent depend on the outcome of
investigation by the INTERPOL of both countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Western Marine Command of Nigeria's Customs Service
intercepted last week in Lagos six Ghanaians in a canoe containing
72,500 rounds of live ammunition and 99 sacks of short gun from
Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Iran Promises to Release Two Detained Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Ambassador to Turkey
Seyed Mohammad Hossain Lavasani has promised that Iran will soon
release two Turkish soldiers, who allegedly entered Iranian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Lavasani made the promise when he had a secret meeting with
Turkish Interior Minister Sadettin Tantan here on Thursday, local
Hurriyet (Freedom) daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lavasani said that the pair will be probably released before
the Turkey-Iran Higher Council on Security meets that is slated
for next Monday in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Iran's release of the two soldiers will
show a "sign of goodwill" to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iran and Turkey were strained when Iran claimed
that Turkish fighter jets hit an Iranian military post and tents
belonging to Iranian tribesmen on July 18.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the bombardment had killed five people
and injured 10 others in the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said that the attack was aimed at the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which uses bases in northern Iraq
for hit-and-run attacks on Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has complained that Iran allowed the PKK to move into
Iranian territory after Turkey threatened to use military force to
oust PKK rebels from Syrian territory last fall. But Iran has
denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkish and Iranian officials would
discuss why Iran had reportedly allowed the PKK militants to move
into the Iranian territory during the Monday meeting in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been waging a separatist war for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts between
the Turkish security forces and the PKK rebels have claimed over
37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Sports People Urged to Stand At Forefront Against Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's top sports administrator
has called on everyone in sports circles to "bravely stand at the
forefront" of the struggle against the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the press here on Thursday, Wu Shaozu,
director of the State General Administration of Sport, said that
Falun Gong has spread malicious fallacies that are "reactionary"
and anti-government.
</P>
<P>
Wu listed several reasons for his call to action. First, Falun
Gong cheated a large number of people who hoped to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
"We'll never allow Falun Gong to tarnish the good nature of
sports and its glorious tasks, and let the cult continue
bamboozling the masses," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Facts demonstrate that Falun Gong has taken the lives
of many practitioners, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Falun Gong has never been accepted by sports
administrative departments. It is anti-science theoretically, and
has promoted social unrest politically, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"Every sports person should take a clear-cut stand in the fight
against Falun Gong," the administrator stressed.
</P>
<P>
In criticizing and exposing the true face of Falun Gong and its
founder Li Hongzhi, "we should enhance our understandings, uphold
materialism and atheism, and strengthen the right ideals and
faiths," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As to those sports people who have been involved in Falun Gong,
Wu said that his administration is taking various steps to help
them break away from the cult and its preaching.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that the current campaign against Falun Gong is a
serious political struggle. "We'll make every efforts to make
materialism and atheism prevail in the sports field," he added.

<HEADLINE> Barak Sends Secret Envoy to Meet Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A personal envoy of Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has met with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat in an effort to establish
a private channel of contact between the two leaders, local daily
Haaretz reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the meeting was arranged in the past few
days, which was also aimed at resolving the dispute over Barak's
proposal to modify the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The envoy is reserve Brigadier General Yitzhak Segev, a former
military governor of the Gaza Strip and an attache of Israeli army
in Iran during the period of the Shah's rule.
</P>
<P>
Segev is now a businessman who represents a variety of foreign
companies in Israel and heads an organization called the "Children
of Abraham," which seeks to promote an Israeli-Palestinian peace.
</P>
<P>
Segev maintains ties with a number of figures in the PNA,
including Hani al-Hassan, who is in charge of foreign relations in
the Fatah movement, and the al-Mattar family in Gaza, some of
whose members are close to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The position of "personal envoy to Arafat" was forged during
Yitzhak Rabin's Labor government. Rabin asked Yossi Ginossar, a
former deputy chief of Israeli General Security Service, to set up
a personal channel between him and Arafat, parallel to the formal
delegations that were holding talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's personal envoy to
Arafat was attorney Yitzhak Molcho.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a spokesman for Barak's office as saying
that "There are direct contacts between Israel and the PNA."
Barak has proposed to postpone the implementation of the Wye
accord, but the Palestinians insisted that the Wye accord be
implemented verbatim.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Jerusalem told the daily that a
compromise will ultimately be found and Arafat will agree to
the proposed delay in the implementation of the Wye agreement
in return for a series of Israeli "gestures" such as the
release of prisoners and economic benefits.

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi Defrauds People of Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Public Security Bureau in
Northeast China's Jilin Province recently discovered new evidence
of the fraudulent behavior of Li Hongzhi, the head of the Falun
Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
This evidence shows that Li defrauded people of large sums of
money by selling books and audio and video products on Falun Gong.
In 1995, Li and his followers made nearly 100,000 yuan from the
sales of a book on Falun Gong. Li Hongzhi and his key members also
reaped more than 300,000 yuan by selling audio and video tapes of
his lectures.
</P>
<P>
Li also accumulated wealth by running Falun Gong study classes
in Changchun, and earned 400,000 yuan there since 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang Xuehua, a former key number of Falun Gong,
Li collected no less than 1,500,000 yuan by running Falun Gong
study classes in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Former Falun Gong cult members in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region said that the Falun Gong organization there also
collected a large amount of money from its practitioners in a "
pyramid" scheme.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Send More Workers Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to have an
estimated 25,000 workers employed abroad this year thanks to a
positive influence on the country's labor export industry by the
regional economic recovery, press reports Friday quoted Vietnam's
labor authority as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Department for the Management of Overseas Workers
(DMOW) said about 8,000 workers were sent to work overseas in the
first half of this year, with traditional markets such as south
Korea, Japan and Libya receiving the greatest numbers.
</P>
<P>
DMOW predicted that the number of export workers is expected to
increase steadily in the near future.
</P>
<P>
There are 71 labor export agencies operating throughout
Vietnam, according to DMOW statistics.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, south Korea and Japan have limited the number of
Vietnamese workers due to economic problems in both countries. Now
the two countries' economy is recovering, and it is expected that
more foreign workers will be needed.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill this year's target to export 20,000-25,000 workers,
Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs has
ordered labor export agencies to try to develop the existing
markets in Japan, Laos and Libya, while seeking new markets in
Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Lee's Remarks Threaten Taiwan's Future: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's "two
states" remark is in defiance of both Chinese history and the
present situation of cross-straits economic relations, and poses a
threat to the island's future, a senior Chinese economist said
here recently.
</P>
<P>
"Lee is sacrificing Taiwan's future interests to fulfill his
political ambition of separating the island from China," said Hong
Yinxing, a professor of economics and vice president of Nanjing
University in the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Hong's university has established steady cooperative ties with
several institutions of higher learning in Taiwan over the past
decade, and they have frequently exchanged visits by presidents
and teachers.
</P>
<P>
Hong met many Taiwan business people and scholars when visiting
the island in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"All Taiwanese I've met expect to develop cross-straits
relations and reunify the motherland," Hong said, stressing that
Lee's separatist remarks are against the will of most Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
Hong indicated that Taiwan has always been an inalienable part
of China in history, and that the Republic of China was replaced
by the People's Republic of China in 1949, which means the former
no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
Hong also pointed out that Taiwan's development is dependent on
the support of the mainland because the island has limited natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Hong said, Taiwan has transferred its
traditional manufacture of clothing, shoes, and toys to the
mainland, making room for the development of modern industries
such as information technology, which have greatly accelerated the
Taiwan economy.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan economy could not have been upgraded if it weren't
for the support of the mainland," Hong added.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that Lee's intention to create two Chinas is
detrimental to Taiwan's economy and is absolutely unacceptable to
Chinese people on both sides of the straits.

<HEADLINE> China's State Sector Enjoys Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned assets
amounted to 8.22 trillion yuan ( 993 billion U.S. dollars) at the
end of 1998, surging 13.8 percent year-on-year, according to the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the ministry show that total assets of
state enterprises have grown by 8.3 percent to 13.5 trillion yuan
(1.6 trillion U.S. dollars) although the number of state
enterprises decreased by 24,000 over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Among 238,000 state enterprises, the 9,357 largest registered
an asset value of 7.6 trillion yuan ( 918 billion U.S. dollars) to
account for 56.4 percent of the total assets of state enterprises,
up 9.8 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has continued its efforts on
diversifying the investment of state enterprises, and state-owned
holding enterprises have grown to account for 10.1 percent of all
state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country has also devoted itself to strengthening the role
of state enterprises in key industries in a bid to remove a major
obstacle to national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
While China stepped up restructuring its state enterprises, the
money-losing enterprises were left further behind profit-making
ones, and discrepancies between state-owned and state-owned
holding enterprises have become greater.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) made good
progress in its major business activities in the first half of
this year thanks to improvements in asset quality and increasing
capital strength.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the BOC said today that in the first six months,
the bank's newly increased loans reached 48.77 billion yuan, an
increase of 25.48 billion yuan over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
These loans have mainly been channeled to key enterprises in
the telecommunications, high-tech, transportation, and energy
sectors, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of June, the bank's deposits increased
9.94 percent over the end of last year, while the amount of
outstanding loans increased 2.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the BOC also made large strides in credit card
issuance, foreign exchange trading, bond investment, derivative
products trading, and other business sectors, he said, adding that
great efforts were also made in providing integrated financial
services for corporate clients, launching consumer credit
businesses, and developing investment banking.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Paper Voices Pessimism over Peace Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hopes for peace progress that
are pinned on Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak began dimming in
view of his retractions and diversions, Syria's leading daily
Al Thawra said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the official paper said after nearly two
months in office, Barak voiced sheer slogans instead of actions
concerning peace while the Israeli hardline attitude remained
unchanged since Barak's predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu's reign.
</P>
<P>
Rescuing the Mideast peace process from the current deadlock
needs a return to the bases of peace, implementing relevant
U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
It also said Washington's inactivity to get the peace process
back on track prompted Israel to further delay in enforcing signed
peace accords and work against peace references.
</P>
<P>
Washington's recent decision to give Israel more military aid
has encouraged Barak to skip his campaign promises to move forward
peace and hold more NOs than Netanyahu, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Syria's stance is stable and clear to help achieve lasting,
just and permanent peace based on Israel's full pullback from the
occupied Arab territories and implementing relevant
U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, the commentary
added.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process on the Palestinian, Syrian and
Lebanese tracks have been deadlocked under Netanyahu's
administration. Labor Party leader Barak's winning over Netanyahu
in May election rekindled hope of concerned parties to reactivate
the peace process.

SNOW DRAGON SHIP, August 6 (Xinhua)-- Scientists of the Chinese
Arctic Expedition today obtained absolute gravity data in the
Arctic Ocean, the first time this long-cherished dream of
scientists all around the world has ever been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was described by scientists as very successful,
thanks to the China-made portable absolute gravimeter, according
to Ruey-Gang Chang, a Taiwanese scientist aboard the expedition
ship, the Snow Dragon.
</P>
<P>
The professor from Taiwan-based Ming Hsin Institute of
Technology said determining the absolute gravity in the Arctic
region has great significance for scientific studies in the fields
of aviation and space flight and mineral exploration.
</P>
<P>
Professor E Dongchen of the Wuhan Technology University of
Surveying and Mapping indicated that this was the first time the
absolute gravity of the Arctic Ocean has ever been determined, and
that this is a great contribution to the world.
</P>
<P>
Scientists indicate that they will also conduct experiments to
determine the absolute gravity at other sites in the Arctic region,
as well as at the South Pole.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Get Short-range Missiles from Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is to receive six TOR-M1
short-range missile systems from Greece as part of the exchange
for the long-range Russian S-300 missiles now deployed in Greece's
Crete island, local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' National Guard will receive the first batch of the 21
missile systems once Greece gets them from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, Cypriot army's top officials are reportedly concerned
about the island's air defense because the short-range missiles
such as the TOR-M1 and the Italian-made Aspides cannot reach
Turkish airspace for preemptive strikes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriots-controlled north
and Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus had planned to buy S-300 missiles from Russia to cement
its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
But following intense international pressure and war threats
from Turkey, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides had to decide to
divert the surface-to-air missiles to Greece's Crete island last
December.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Cypriot government has struggled to find
alternatives as part of its air-defense umbrella.
</P>
<P>
But there are fears that missiles that could hit the Turkish
mainland, some 80 kilometers away, would raise tensions again in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture for Container Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- An agreement was signed between
two Chinese companies and a Singapore firm in the northeast port
city of Dalian on Thursday on establishing a joint venture to
develop the container shipping business.
</P>
<P>
The venture is jointly funded by the Port of Dalian Authority
in northeast China, the Zhonghai Group based in Shanghai, and the
Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) Group.
</P>
<P>
The new enterprise will introduce PSA's advanced management
system and international standards of operation to promote China's
domestic container transportation sector.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, domestic container transportation has
been developing rapidly in China, handling 600,000 TEUs (Twenty-
Foot Equivalent Units) last year, and is expected to handle 1.5
million TEUs this year, posing new challenges to port development
in all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To date, the port of Dalian has opened seven domestic shipping
lines including the Dalian-Huangpu, Dalian-Shanghai, and Dalian-
Ningbo routes.
</P>
<P>
With this new venture, Dalian is expected to handle 70,000 TEUs
of domestic containers this year, and 170,000 TEUs by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the port handled 29,000 TEUs,
up 867 percent compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Zhonghai Group, with a fleet of 79 ships and
60,000 containers, now has a 70 percent market share of China's
domestic container transportation.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Pushes for Approval of Ocalan's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ignoring pressures from several
European countries and human rights groups, Vural Savas, the
chief prosecutor of Turkey's High Court of Appeals, asked the
court to uphold the death penalty for a Kurdish rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
Outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan,
captured by Turkish special anti-terror squads in Kenya in
mid-February and brought back to Turkey, was sentenced to death on
June 29 on charges of treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been waging a separatist campaign in
southeastern Turkey since 1984. Conflicts between the Turkish
security forces and the PKK rebels have claimed over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Appeals was expected to review the Ocalan
file in early September after a judicial recess, the Daily News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
If upheld, the verdict would have to be endorsed by the
Parliament and President Suleyman Demirel before carried out.
</P>
<P>
"Despite pressure by foreign officials whose support to Ocalan
has been proved and the hostile attitude of so-called human rights
organizations against the Turkish Republic...the approval of the
verdict for defendant Abdullah Ocalan is being requested," Savas
said in his evaluation.
</P>

Despite the opposition to Ocalan's death sentence abroad,
there is wide-spread public pressure in Turkey to hang Ocalan. No

<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is confident that Southern
African Development Community (SADC) member states will ratify the
SADC Trade Protocol in readiness for the Trade Negotiations Forum
billed for South Africa on August 27.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will then pave way for the tariff reduction.
The latest Business Line of the chamber of Commerce and Industry
noted that "two thirds of the original 11 signatories have to
ratify the document before the process of implementation can
start."
</P>
<P>
Friday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper quoted the chamber as
saying that so far, only Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Mauritius have ratified the Trade Protocol, out of the
organization's 14 members.
</P>
<P>
A government source said trade negotiations are expected to
come up with agreed goods that would fall on the three-phase
reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
While some goods would be quickly adopted by member countries,
there were sensitive items which a few countries still want to
protect, the source said.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, this is the category small exporting countries
want to trade in," the source said, adding that if not properly
discussed, negotiations might put the whole tariff reduction
program in jeopardy.

BEIRUT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen Thursday night reiterated the European Union's commitment
to further the widely anticipated Middle East peace process, the
Al Nahar newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, Halonen
said her whirlwind trip to Beirut "has been very successful."
</P>
<P>
"We have a window of opportunity in the peace process," she
said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Finland, which took over the half-yearly rotating presidency
of the EU in July, is trying to play a more pivotal role in
reviving the peace talks under U.S. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Halonen said the potential for peace has moved to a stage that
will hopefully lead all the way to final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
EU Middle East peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos was
accompanying Halonen on the tour which has taken the foreign
minister to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos told reporters that the EU has a "political
commitment" to the regional peace process which is in a "new and
crucial phase."
</P>
<P>
"If we missed this opportunity, it will be a big disaster for
the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Halonen arrived here from Damascus on Thursday night. She had
held talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the peace
talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's courts have been
receiving less criticism this year because the Chinese are more
satisfied with what they are doing, according to a leading judge.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Mingshan, vice president of China's Supreme People's Court,
told a national conference of senior judges here that this year's
campaign to improve the work of courts has helped their image and
has made trials and sentencing fairer.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the number of court workers who
had to be sanctioned dropped 36 percent from the same period last
year and the alarming increase in irregularities in recent years
has been checked, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, Chinese courts handled 2.72 million
cases, 2.2 million of which were on appeal, an 8.12 and 6.5
percent increase respectively from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But, in spite of these improvements, there are still problems
in some places, Zhu said, adding that he has asked courts at all
levels to continue improving their work and to make certain that
the rights and interests of all parties are protected.

HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Standard Chartered Bank of
Zimbabwe has increased its minimum lending rate by five percent to
49.5 percent per annum with effect from Friday, and analysts said
more commercial banks were likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
This follows measures introduced by the Reserve Bank last month
to curb high inflationary pressures and discourage the government
and other institutions from borrowing, the daily Herald reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The measures involved the hiking of the bank rate by 2.5
percentage points and the widening of the margin between the repo
rate and Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also increased statutory reserves for
commercial and merchant banks by five percentage points to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank rate would now be maintained at five percentage points
above the effective Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
"Current account rates have been increased by five percent.
Savings and call rates have also been increased. The rate
increases reflect the impact of changes in monetary policy on
market rates, for example Treasury bills," the bank said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Say Society Should Leave No Room For Cults (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A sociologist at the China
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) has told Xinhua that China needs
to take a good look at the social causes of the Falun Gong cult
and to eliminate them and to promote science and rational thought.
</P>
<P>
Jing Tiankui, a research fellow at CASS's Sociology Institute,
said that although Falun Gong cult is full of contradictions and
lacking in common sense, its numbers grew to about 2 million in
just a few years.
</P>
<P>
In this shell game, people with education were deceived by
inferior people and people with a background in science were
deceived by people with no background, with good being tricked by
evil and truth being obscured by fatuousness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jing took part in a CASS study on Falun Gong cult and said that
its social causes need to be studied in the campaign against Li
Hongzhi, its founder, and his fallacies and that because of
cultural reasons there are still places where for swindlers like
him can operate.
</P>
<P>
China has vigorously pushed science and technology, Jing said,
but feudalism and superstition have deeper roots than science, and
superstition resurfaces whenever the climate is right.
</P>
<P>
The lack of development of society has been one of the major
reasons for the Falun Gong phenomenon, he said, and in some places,
society is in a state of disunity and illegal organizations can
take hold.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of doctors, nurses,
 radiologists, psychiatrists and midwives in New Zealand is
forcing patients to wait long periods for treatment, the Evening
Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The shortage has been blamed on large numbers of health workers
shifting overseas, to Australia in particular, higher student
loans, and poor pay and working conditions compared to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, according to the Wellington-based newspaper,
there is a 10-month wait for mainly non-urgent CT scans at
Wellington Hospital due to a shortage of radiologists and
technicians.
</P>
<P>
Wellington's staffing problems are echoed in other regions with
 rural areas being the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post said the New Zealand Health Ministry is aware
of the problem and has organized meetings with different
professions, such as nurses, this month to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many hospitals in New Zealand are trying
to recruit from overseas, especially from Britain.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that more than 300 junior doctors in
Wellington and its nearby district Wairarapa are likely to walk
off the job later this year due to "radical differences of
opinion" in their contract negotiations with hospitals.

Yunnan, known as the "kingdom of nonferrous metal" because of
its special geological features, has proven deposits of 130 kinds
of minerals, and its reserves of tin, zinc, copper, and lead are
among the richest in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, these abundant mineral and nonferrous metal resources
have not been fully developed due to inadequate investment and
poor management.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Say Society Should Leave No Room for Cults (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unusual groups or organizations often employ superstitious
means to deify an individual and outsiders know little about this,
so it is quite easy for people with sinister motives to control
and use them for their own purposes, as in the case of Falun Gong,
Jing said.
</P>
<P>
With China's market economy developing and society becoming
more diverse, it is becoming more important for the country to
encourage social groups and organizations grow in a healthy and
regulated way, he said, and the only way the government can
guarantee sound development of organizations and maintain social
stability is to strictly separate normal groups and organizations
from illegal ones and to leave no room for the latter to grow.
</P>
<P>
Jing analyzed the international background of the Falun Gong
and said that as the new millennium approaches, various schools of
thought and cults appear and those with evil motives have already
developed like the 'doomsday' myth and some astrologists are
attempting to predict good or bad lucks. Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong
are just another imitator.
</P>
<P>
Jing said that China needs to increase thought and education
and to promote a scientific world view that is compatible with the
21st century to prepare for a more civilized century.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Won't Record Growth in 1999: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- No economic growth will be
recorded in Zambia this year, Muna Nakalonga, executive director
of the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) has said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Southern African Development Community (SADC)
executive secretary Preg Ramsamy's announcement that the 14 member
regional group was expecting a three percent growth, Nakalonga
said SADC's growth will not come from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the macro-economic indicators so far registered,
one could see that no growth will be expected this year in
Zambia," Nakalonga was quoted by Friday's newspaper, The Post, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday that Zambia's contribution to SADC's projected
regional growth of three percent will only be in the negative.
</P>
<P>
Nakalonga attributed this to the continued depressed economy in
the wake of the soaring inflation levels and low performing mining
sector including the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Ramsamy announced in a statement Wednesday that SADC projects a
three percent economic growth rate this year after last year's
disappointing 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The projections were based on an improvement in the world and
southern African economic climate.
</P>
<P>
He said free market reforms in the region and initiatives to
attract foreign investment are also likely to boost the growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
"The region has embarked on market oriented economic policies
which gives us hope that there will be some growth," Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, some of the 14 southern African countries in
the grouping had already taken steps to reduce inflation and
budget deficits and stabilize exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The region needed to achieve at least 6.5 percent economic
growth to make impact on the current high poverty levels which
could be achieved through the fast development of the agro sector,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Lee's "Two States" Statement Refuted in Guangdong Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheng told a forum to refute Lee's separatist statement
Thursday in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, that Dr.
Sun Yat-sen, the forerunner of Chinese revolution, once called
reunification the hope of all Chinese people and that Lee's
statement, opposed by the Chinese people, will eventually go into
the trash heap.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zhonghe, the deputy governor of the province, said that the
"two states" statement was calculated to split the motherland,
betray the nation, and halt the smooth progress in relations
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is necessary to stick to the "one China"
principle, which is a prerequisite for progress in relations
across the straits and the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lu stressed the need for increased cooperation and exchanges
across the straits so as to make new contributions to progress in
bringing about the lofty cause of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Chen Weiwen, the vice chairman of Guangdong Provincial
Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said
that there is only one China and that this is the consensus of
people on both sides of the Straits and that adhering to the "one
China" principle benefits all Chinese people and is in their basic
interest.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 30 in Philippine Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the landslide
which destroyed 179 houses at the Cherry Hill subdivision in the
northern Philippines has reached 30 as of Friday morning, the
Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The rescue and retrieval operations were carried out by teams
from the Armed Forces and the police, assisted by various private
rescue groups, said the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The landslide struck the subdivision in Antipolo City in Rizal
province at about 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operations began hours after the tragedy, which also
injured 35 people and left 39 more missing as of Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada Thursday inspected the site
of the landslide, where he reiterated the need for the early
passage by the Congress of the Land Use Act which will rationalize
further the housing program of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also formed Thursday an investigating team to determine the
liability of parties responsible for the tragedy and vowed to
institute measures to prevent tragic landslides in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the PNA, another landslide occurred in Caloocan
City of Metro Manila on Thursday night and endangered three
houses.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from landslides and floods caused by continuous
heavy rains in the past few days claimed more than 70 lives and
affected more than 1.5 million people in the capital region and
nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department estimated that floods have damaged
nearly 100 million pesos (2.5 million U.S. dollars) worth of rice
and other crops in 10 provinces in the northern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Accepts Compromise Electoral Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Southern African foreign
ministers have persuaded the Lesotho government and opposition to
accept a compromise electoral model for new elections, South
Africa's The Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This emerged at a news conference held in Maseru Thursday night
after two days of difficult talks.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Zuma said the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and major opposition parties
had agreed on an electoral model which would combine the present
constituency-based "first- past-the-post" system and proportional
representation.
</P>
<P>
Under the "first-past-the-post" model, each constituency has a
seat in parliament and the candidate who receives the most votes
in the constituency gets the seat. Under proportional
representation, the number of seats a party receives in parliament
is in proportion to the percentage of votes it receives in the
election.
</P>
<P>
The "first-past-the-post" system is favored by the ruling LCD,
while opposition parties had insisted on 100 percent proportional
representation model.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said the softening of these positions was the main
achievement of her mission and she was satisfied that enough
goodwill and momentum had been created to reach compromise on this
and other outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
These include the composition of the Independent Electoral
Commission and the fate of soldiers facing charges for taking part
in the mutiny during the unrest last year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition wants them to receive amnesty while the
government wishes normal justice to take its course.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) mission also
includes foreign ministers from Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho held its general elections in May last year, but a
major upheaval followed when the opposition alliance refused to
accept the results and staged massive demonstrations in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties claimed the election was rigged in favor of
the LCD, which won 79 of 80 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
South African and Botswana troops, under the auspices of the
SADC, entered Lesotho to quell the unrest.
</P>
<P>
The government and opposition agreed in October to hold fresh
elections within 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds American Students Lack Study Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 60 percent of school
guidance counselors believe that American students are not
adequately prepared to tackle homework assignments, said a survey
report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A national survey conducted by two educational organizations
found that schools in the United States failed to equip their
students with the fundamental study skills to foster increased
academic achievement. In fact, among more than 200 counselors
surveyed, almost 70 percent said that teachers in their schools
think that students have poor study skills.
</P>
<P>
The survey was jointly conducted by the American School
Counselor Association (ASCA), and Sylvan Learning Center which
offers supplemental education programs for students.
</P>
<P>
The results are not surprising as nearly 50 percent of the
schools surveyed do not offer study skills courses to their
students, the report said. Of those that do offer instructions,
only 11 percent require students to take the course and just 10
percent offer it as a separate class rather than incorporating it
into the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Study skills include organizing and managing time, note taking,
reading and studying, and test-taking strategies such as how to
best tackle multiple choice and essay tests while learning to
conquer test anxiety.
</P>
<P>
"Children are not born knowing how to study," the report said.
"They need to be taught and guided. Sometimes, problems with
homework develop because students haven't acquired the skills to
tackle their studies in an efficient, organized and focused manner.
This creates considerable stress and frustration for families."
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that most guidance counselors think that
it is most effective for students to study together in a group
environment. However, 57 percent of students typically do their
homework at home.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four percent of the counselors agree that new technology
such as the Internet has greatly changed the nature of homework.
Many students use the Internet a great deal to gather information
for homework assignments. Only 33 percent of schools have a "
homework hotline" for students to call regarding assignments, and
63 percent do not.

<HEADLINE> American Families Concerned About Growing College Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Americans are more concerned
than ever about their ability to pay for their children's higher
education, according to a report released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey conducted by financial organization Merrill
Lynch, 60 percent of respondents say that they are very concerned
about their ability to afford the cost of college education when
their children are ready to attend.
</P>
<P>
According to Merrill Lynch, for the past 20 years, college
costs in the United States have outpaced the general rate of
inflation and, for many families, the expense of college education
is the single largest financial goal.
</P>
<P>
Current estimates predict that when today's newborn child
reaches college enrollment age, the cost of attending a public
institution could easily exceed 80,000 U.S. dollars and more than
200,000 dollars at a private university.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it has worked out a plan providing
Americans with a new, tax-advantaged way to help meet the rising
costs of higher education.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, an individual can set up an automated
investment schedule and contribute 50 dollars a month. When the
beneficiary enters college, account balances can be withdrawn and
used for college expenses.
</P>
<P>
The college-investing plan also permits individuals to
contribute up to 50,000 dollars and a couple up to 100,000 dollars
per beneficiary in a single year without federal gift-tax
consequences, provided no additional gifts are made to the
beneficiary for a five-year period.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Float 30 New Insurance Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Thirty more new insurance
companies, including 19 general and 11 life insurance ones, will
be floated in Bangladesh in the private sector soon, The
Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Commerce has already given pre-approval to
these companies under the Insurance Act. After receiving the final
approval of the prime minister, the ministry sent the list of the
30 insurance companies to the chief controller of insurance on
June 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
Some terms and conditions are required to be fulfilled to get
registration before the floating of an insurance company,
according to the Insurance Act. One condition is that the sponsor
or the promoter shall neither be a bank defaulter nor a director
of any other companies, and the dependents of any sponsor or
director shall not be a director of the insurance company.
</P>
<P>
Besides, an amount of 150 million taka (about 2.92 million U.S.
dollars) is required as paid-up capital to start a general
insurance, of which 60 percent will be collected through public
shares and the rest from the sponsors or the promoters. In the
case of floating a life insurance, 75 million taka (about 1.52
million dollars) is needed.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for meeting the above terms and conditions for
registration has been fixed by the chief controller of insurance
on August 8.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 24 general insurance companies and seven
life insurance companies including one foreign life insurance
company in the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Holds "Women in Business" Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka on Friday inaugurated a
three-day "Women in Business" trade fair to improve the potential
of rural women to develop their income-generation activities and
standards of living.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 local and Indian women exhibited their wide-ranging
products at the fair, which is organized by Sri Lanka's Women's
Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC).
</P>
<P>
The fair is expected to help rural women to expand their trade
links and also generate foreign exchange for the country.
</P>
<P>
The first vice chairperson of WCIC, Maya Senanayake, said that
they were encouraged to conduct such fairs after the success of
the first one in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The Internal and International Commerce Ministry has instructed
export development officials to install a "cyber trader" and
Internet facilities at the fair to help woman entrepreneurs
develop their business contacts and find new markets abroad.

<HEADLINE> Central China Economic Belt Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- An economic belt in central China
encompassing four provinces is showing such vigorous growth
momentum that it is likely to overtake the limelight from the
country's fast-developing eastern region.
</P>
<P>
Stretching over an area of more than 300,000 sq.km and with a
population of 120 million, the economic belt is connected to China
's financial center of Shanghai to the east and linked with the
enormous Municipality of Chongqing to the west.
</P>
<P>
The economy in the region mainly depends on commodity trade,
with a total of 30 billion yuan worth of contracts signed since
1997.
</P>
<P>
A variety of markets, including labor, Chinese medicine, farm
produce, seeds, telecom equipment and books, have mushroomed in
Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, which is the transportation hub
of the central economic belt.
</P>
<P>
The economic belt, with Wuhan at its core, radiates through
Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces. These provinces have
substantially enhanced economic and technological cooperation
among themselves to coordinate economic development with related
contract investment totaling 60 billion yuan over the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan has become a financial and commercial center in central
China, with some 500 financial companies trading securities and
bonds worth 680 billion yuan over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
It is also a research center for technological development in
the region. During the past two years, more than 1,800 research
results were marketed in Wuhan, a city which recorded 100 billion
yuan in GDP last year, and used one billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment as well as five billion yuan of domestic funds.
</P>
<P>
Floating capital has helped revitalize a number of large state-
owned automobile and steel enterprises, which have learned to
merge their assets to avoid restructuring and enhance their market
competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Bans Flights to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
suspended commercial flights from Entebbe to rebel-held areas in
eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where some
airlines have been doing brisk business.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the move could be part of the July 10 Lusaka
cease-fire agreement aimed at ending the year-old civil war in the
Congo, the New Vision newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) stopped the flights
effective as from July 30, authority chief Ambrose Akandonda was
quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Air Alexander has been the main operator between
Entebbe and Kisangani, the third largest city in the Congo. The
company has since February been using a hush kitted Boeing 707
wet-leased (hired with crew) from a third country.
</P>
<P>
Akandonda said that Uganda, as a member of the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), has to abide by the rules of
the organization.
</P>
<P>
Any flights to the war zones would be in defiance of the
International Civil Aviation Organization rules, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kisangani in eastern Congo has no road link with Uganda. It
has been heavily depending on the goods from Kampala which are
flown there by Air Alexander.

<HEADLINE> Hiroshima Marks 54th Anniversary of A-Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hiroshima commemorated the 54th
anniversary of the atomic bombing of this southwestern Japanese
city Friday, while calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 people, including atomic bomb survivors, gathered
at the Peace Memorial Park near the center of the bombing, and
prayed for those who died from the world's first atomic bombing in
1945.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Hiroshima Mayor Tadatoshi
Akiba, and Pakistani Ambassador to Japan Touqir Hussain joined the
mourners at the annual Peace Memorial Ceremony.
</P>
<P>
At 8:15, the exact time of the blast, participants observed a
moment of silence, while representatives of A-bomb victims and
children tolled a bell of peace.
</P>
<P>
Akiba delivered a peace declaration in which he stressed the
need to have a strong will to abolish nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government should "understand fully the crucial
role" the A-bomb survivors have played in abolishing nuclear
weapons, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 doves were released, while 300 children sang a song
of peace.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also gave a speech at the ceremony, pledging that his
government will work toward nuclear nonproliferation and
disarmament and the eventual creation of a world free of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said his government supports the proposal made by the
Tokyo forum on nuclear disarmament, which has urged the United
States and Russia to reduce the number of their strategic nuclear
warheads to 1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
Before the beginning of the ceremony, Hiroshima citizens
offered flowers and sticks of incense in front of the cenotaph at
the center of the park, praying for the repose of the victims'
souls.
</P>
<P>
The atomic bomb, which was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6,
1945, by the U.S. B-29 bomber "Enola Gay," killed an estimated 140,
000 people by the end of that year.
</P>
<P>
Akiba offered a new list of 5,071 atomic bomb victims who have
died since August 6 last year, bringing the death toll to 212,116.

<HEADLINE> Magic Accept Deal, Trade Hardaway to Suns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- He did not make it to the Los
Angeles Lakers, but three years later Penny Hardaway followed
Shaquille O'Neal out of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway, who teamed with O'Neal to lead the Magic to the 1995
NBA Finals, today was traded to the Phoenix Suns in a sign-and-
trade deal. Those who headed to Orlando are forwards Danny Manning
and Pat Garrity, plus a pair of first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway, a four-time All-Star, had three years left on his
contract with Orlando before exercising a clause that made him a
free agent, forcing the sign-and-trade deal. Terms were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"I think we always tried to keep that window of opportunity
open for him to come back," Orlando general manager John Gabriel
said. "I think Penny looked at it as a pretty big challenge to
right some things that were not handled well on his part. Then it
was up to him to decide if he wanted to take on that challenge or
start over anew in Phoenix. That's what we wanted to do."
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls made a similar move last season with Scottie
Pippen, who was sent to the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, Hardaway will team with Jason Kidd to form a dream
backourt. Hardaway has averaged more than 19 points, just under
five rebounds and over six assists per contest in his career.
</P>
<P>
Manning averaged 9.1 points and 4.4 rebounds off the bench. He
won the Sixth Man of the Year award in 1997-98, registering 13.5
points and 5.6 boards per game.
</P>
<P>
Garrity averaged 5.6 points in 39 games during his rookie
season.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the goal for this franchise, No. 1 is to win a world
championship, still to win a world championship, even though it
may not come next year," Gabriel said. "The trading of Penny
Hardaway sets the foundation for the relaunching of this franchise
and this team."
</P>
<P>
The Suns were willing to deal two reserves instead of forward
Tom Gugliotta, who Orlando originally demanded. Gugliotta averaged
a team-leading 17 points and 8.9 rebounds a game last season.
</P>
<P>
The deal continued a very busy offseason for the Suns, who
agreed to terms with former Los Angeles Clippers forward Rodney
Rogers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rogers was the third free agent signed by the Suns, who inked
center Oliver Miller to a one-year deal and re-signed forward
Clifford Robinson to a reported four-year, $29 million package.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River's Floodwaters Continue To Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The floodwaters on the Yangtze
River, China's longest, continue to drop from the dangerously-high
levels that lasted more than a month.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at the Chenglingji section in central-south China'
s Hunan Province, which is adjacent to one of the country's
largest freshwater lakes, Dongting Lake, dropped below the 33-
meter danger mark on Thursday afternoon. Sources at the local
hydrology station say that the lake water has been receding more
in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Water levels at the Jiujiang section in east China's Jiangxi
Province were also lower than the previous day, but were still 1.
72 meters above the danger line yesterday afternoon and heavy
winds in the region has added pressure to the flood control effort.
Hydrology stations at the city of Jiujiang and at Poyang Lake
predict that waters will fall below the danger mark in about 10
days, meaning that the Yangtze's water levels are expected to last
some 40 days less than last year.
</P>
<P>
Pang Daomu, chief director of Hunan's Flood Control and Drought
Relief, says that the flooding on the Dongting Lake this year was
nearly as serious as the disaster last year but resulted in only
25 percent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
He attributes this achievement to the dyke reinforcement effort
since last year that cost some 6.2 billion yuan (747 million US
dollars) in Hunan. Moving some 140,000 people out of low-lying
areas near the lake to safer ground are also helped by the means
of increasing the flood containment area by some 16,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Fossilized Rhinoceros Skeleton Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered the fossilized skeleton of a large rhinoceros near the
Sala Us River in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which they
believe to be some 50,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 meters long, 1.8 meters tall skeleton is the first
well-preserved skeleton of its kind to be discovered in China,
archeologists say.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the teeth and bones prompted archaeologists to
guess that the adult rhinoceros must have fallen into river mud
and got drowned.
</P>
<P>
The Sala Us River area was the home of the Hetao Men, who lived
from around 35,000 to 50,000 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Cardiovascular Disease Becomes Top Killer in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that 62 percent of
the deaths in Bulgaria are caused by cardiovascular diseases, with
8,000 people dying annually of acute cardiac crisis.
</P>
<P>
The causes of death are the result of the unhealthy lifestyle
of Bulgarians and their negligence regarding health care, said
professor Choudomir Nachev, head of the Internal Diseases
Department at the Medical University of Sofia.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarians use 8-12 grams of salt per day, much more than the
recommended 4-6 grams. They also can fruit and vegetables instead
of eating fresh ones, so that excessive quantities of salt and
sugar are added to their foods.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Bulgarians check their blood pressure for
the first time at the age of 50-60, when they have -- as often as
not -- already developed hypertonia, Nachev said.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that Bulgarians accept stressful situations
calmly.

<HEADLINE> WB: Vietnam Needs 6.9b Dollars Investment in Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has said that
Vietnam's energy sector faces four main challenges in making the
transition to a modern, industrialized society.
</P>
<P>
A press brief of the Would Bank in Vietnam issued on Thursday
said that Vietnam's economic growth is slowing because of the
financial crisis in East Asia, and because of its own inertia in
implementing structural and policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
Energy plays a crucial role in Vietnam's economic prospects,
said WB in the press brief, adding that Vietnam's energy sector is
facing following four main challenges:
</P>
<P>
First, to meet economic growth targets, energy supplies will
need to grow about 30 percent faster than GDP.
</P>
<P>
Second, though Vietnam is rich in natural resources, its
limited financial resources demand careful planning in the energy
sector.
</P>
<P>
Third, Vietnam will have to invest 5.3-5.5 percent of GDP --
twice the level of its Southeast Asian neighbors -- in essential
energy infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, attracting foreign investment will require creating an
enabling business environment, including a supportive legal
framework.
</P>
<P>
WB in its study said that Vietnam's power sector needs require
around 6.9 billion U.S. dollars in investment in the next three
years, and that a much more rational and coordinated approach is
needed among the state energy corporations covering gas, coal and
electricity.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Adopts Plan to Change Name of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Republic
of Montenegro passed on Thursday a draft plan on name change aimed
at loosening its partnership with Serbia, reported Yugoslavia's
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes that the name of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia be changed into the Commonwealth of States of
Montenegro and Serbia, Montenegro Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic
told the press.
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes replacing the current federal government with
a "council of ministers" and the current two-chamber Yugoslav
parliament with a single house, said Vujanovic, who is supported
by the West.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the abolition of the central foreign ministry
and the establishment of two separate foreign ministries instead.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the plan, which is going to be
presented to the parliament of Montenegro and the government of
Serbia, is a result of the West isolation policy on Serbia, which,
with Montenegro, formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in
April, 1992 after the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
</P>
<P>
On July 19, The European Union decided to lift its air and oil
embargo on Montenegro, but to continue the embargo on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
On July 30, the summit on the Balkan Stability Pact held in
Sarajevo worked out the concrete measures to assist Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has told Vujanovic that Washington
will provide 10 million U.S. dollars to the opposition to the
Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has stressed that as long as Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic is in power, the isolation policy will continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian swimmers
still look sharp in the Pan Am Pool here on Thursday, scooping up
a pair of golds and establishing a Games record.
</P>
<P>
A brazilian quartet of Fernando Scherer, Cesar Qintaes, Andre
Cordeiro and Gustavo Borges set a pounding pace to the gold medal
and the new Pan Am best time of 3:17.18, eclipsing more than one
seconds off the previous 3:18.68.
</P>
<P>
The United States was a distant second in 3:19.00 and Venezuela
the third in 3:22.21.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400m freestyle race, Brazilian Luiz Lima clocked 3:
52.25 to chalk up the gold, the fifth following their hatrick
performances yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The traditional power United States, from which lots of first-
choice stars are absent to concentrate on the Pan Pacific Games
championships later this month in Sydney, still managed two golds
today.
</P>
<P>
Staciana Stitts shattered the Games record to win women's 100m
breastroke in 1:09.16 while in the women's 100m butterfly, Karen
Campbell registered a 1:00.05 clocking to beat off Canadian double

men's 200m breastroke event.

</P>
<P>
Venezuela's Maria Vento continued her giantkilling way by
scoring a 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 victory over American second seed Tara

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Final Bill on Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled U.S.
Congress on Thursday approved the final bill to cut 792 billion U.
S. dollars in taxes in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has vowed to veto the bill, saying that
it would squander bigger-than-expected budget surpluses and
threaten the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by Republicans but opposed by Democrats,
would trim all five income tax rates by one percentage point,
lower capital gains taxes for individuals, eliminate estate taxes
and ease the so-called marriage-tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton advisers warned that it would force automatic cuts in a
wide range of critical government programs, including Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Undeterred, the Senate gave the measure final approval in a
mostly party-line vote of 50 to 49. The House of Representatives
passed it earlier by a 221-206 vote.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders were expected to send the bill to Clinton in
September, after Congress takes its August recess. That will give
Republicans a chance to sell the plan to their constituents before
it is vetoed.
</P>
<P>
Tax cuts are a key political battleground for Republicans and
Democrats, and both parties expect Thursday's vote to resonate in
the 2000 presidential and congressional races.

At 792 billion dollars, the Republican bill promises the
largest tax cut since 1981 when Ronald Reagan was president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and congressional Democrats say they favor targeted tax
breaks in the 250 billion to 300 billion dollar range as part of a

Under the Republican tax bill, income tax rates would be
reduced to 14 percent, 27 percent, 30 percent, 35 percent and 38.6
percent from 15 percent, 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.
6 percent. For families in the lowest bracket, the measure would
provide a 7 percent tax break. Wealthier taxpayers would get a 4
percent break.

The bill would also cut the top capital gains tax rate on
investment profits for individuals to 18 percent from 20 percent,
effective January 1, 1999, and reduce the capital gains rate for
taxpayers in the lowest income tax bracket to 8 percent from 10
percent. Capital gains would be indexed for inflation under the
plan.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM: No Federal Intervention on Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Friday ruled out federal intervention to curb rising fuel
prices, saying it was simply the market in operation and prices
would eventually settle.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Howard said he could understand that
consumers paying more than 80 Australian cents (52.8 U.S. cents )
a liter might be angry.
</P>
<P>
But he said Australia still enjoyed very low fuel prices by
world standard, second only to the United States and substantially
lower than Europe.
</P>
<P>
The fuel price increases in Australian have been dramatic, up
from under 70 Australian cents (46.2 U.S. cents) a liter for
unleaded petrol in March to more than 80 Australian cents (52.8
U.S. cents) in some places.
</P>
<P>
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Allan
Fels said Thursday the hike was due to countries of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pushing
up their oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Looks for Solution to Internal Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) will search for a way to solve its worst financial
crisis since its founding in 1991.
</P>
<P>
During the extraordinary meeting of the common market group on
Thursday and Friday in the Uruguayan capital, technical
negotiators from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay discussed
the trade controversies between Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators are also preparing for a meeting of Mercosur's
Council of Ministers on Friday in which ministers will design the
future of the bloc's customs union.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's recent announcement of excluding member countries
of Mercosur from safeguard measures calmed the heated discussion.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Argentina enacted a protocol regarding
macro-economic coordination, which sets contingency measures when
trade balances and fluctuations become seriously distorted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brazil said it would not provide financial
compensation for products of its associate members due to the
devaluation of Brazil's currency.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay insisted on strengthening Mercosur by creating a
mechanism that would control macro-economic policies and resolves
trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay told Mercosur that it would not propose revising the
Asuncion Treaty, but Paraguayan industrialists are asking for
revisions of this organizations legal norms, arguing that
differences between Argentina and Brazil have damaged the bloc's
ability to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Trade disputes between Argentina and Brazil occurred after
Argentina notified Brazil about enacting safeguard measures
against Brazilian products.
</P>
<P>
Although Argentina quickly canceled restrictive measures
against products from Mercosur countries, the turbulence caused
within the bloc by the action has not subsided.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti said that in the
final analysis, the Argentina-Brazil trade quarrel is due to a
Latin American economic recession, and therefore the problem must
be attacked at its roots.

<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The paper carries a commentator's article today to further
criticize the fallacies of Li Hongzhi, head of the illegal
organization Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Li has used two important methods to run the Falun Gong cult
and its organization which include poisoning practitioners' minds
with fallacies and controlling practitioners through various
levels of the organization, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
-- The General Office of the State Council issued a notice
recently, requiring a freeze on the use of forest land for
construction projects before the adoption of the Regulations for
the Implementation of the Forestry Law.
</P>
<P>
The notice stipulates that during the freeze period, local
governments at all levels must take effective measures to strictly
ban the use of forest land for construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Under strong criticism from Taiwan and the rest of the world
for his "two states" remark, Lee Teng-hui has repeated that the
Taiwan authorities have not changed their mainland policy, a point
also echoed by Koo Chen-fu in his recent written speech.
</P>
<P>
But if it is true that the Taiwan authorities have not changed
their mainland policy, why did Lee hastily make his "two states"
statement, which is only one step away from betraying the country
and has greatly hurted the hearts of the Chinese people, said a
Xinhua News Agency commentator Thursday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Falun Gong cult took advantage of people's desire for
good health to spread superstition and defraud people, including
women. With the deepening struggle against Falun Gong, more women
now have a clear understanding of the true purpose of this illegal
organization, and have broken away from it, a Xinhua commentator
said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- China strongly resents and firmly opposes a recent bill
submitted by a few United States Congress representatives in
support of "one China, one Taiwan" and "the independence of Taiwan,
" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao Thursday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Ministry of Civil Affairs said Thursday the summer
flooding has resulted in a death toll of 725, and that the direct
economic losses had reached 66.8 billion yuan (8.06 billion U.S.
dollars) as of yesterday.

reported.
</P>
<P>
At the award ceremony for the 7th Rado Chinese Youth Talent

The four first-prize winners each received 10,000 yuan (1,210 U.
S.dollars) as well as a chance to visit Switzerland in September.
</P>
<P>
The award was initiated in 1993 by Swiss watchmaker Rado in
collaboration with science institutions in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangdong and Hong Kong New Generation Culture Association. Most
winners are now studying at China's prestigious Beijing and
Qinghua universities.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said the contest offers an ideal combination to
encourage Chinese students to invest their talent for the benefit
of China and their own personal career, according to the paper.

QUITO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's armed forces said
Thursday they will not participate in regional armed intervention
headed by the United States against Colombian guerrillas or drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The joint command of Ecuador's armed forces said in a
communique that U.S. soldiers frequently train in Ecuador for
jungle combat, but this does not mean the country will participate
in a regional strategy against the guerrillas or drug traffickers
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Colombian daily "El Espectador," special
American forces are training in a jungle school operated by the
Ecuadorian Army to fight guerrillas in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The joint command said Ecuador's armed forces will guarantee
the control of the border with Colombia to prevent the
infiltration of Colombia's guerrillas into the country of Ecuador.

PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IAAF) claimed Thursday that they are not in the
position to take action against Cuban high jump world champion
Javier Sotomayor, who failed a drugs test for cocaine this week at
the Pan American Games in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"It's an affair that concerns the Cuban athletics federation
and it's their responsibility to take the necessary action if it
occurs that an athlete tests positive," explained an spokesman of
the world athletics ruling body at Monaco.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Pan Am Games delegation declared on Wednesday that
Sotomayor was innocent and Cuban Sports Medicine director Mario
Granda said "there was a manipulation" in the drug testing of
Sotomayor's urine samples.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, 31, regarded as one of athletics' greats, won the
world title in 1997 and took the Olympic crown in 1992. His world
record stands at 2.45m.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua to Evacuate 16,000 Persons Living Near Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government is
intensifying the evacuation of around 16,000 people living very
near to volcano Cerro Negro, which erupted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The volcano erupted again at 10 o'clock local time (1600 GMT),
after provoking a large quantity of quakes with top intensity of 4.
7 degrees on the Richter scale, confirmed the Nicaraguan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to officials and journalists that got close to the
volcano, Cerro Negro now has three new craters on the east side,
by which it throws out ash, sand and sometimes a little lava,
forming a huge "mushroom" of about 5,000 meters height.
</P>
<P>
Inhabitants of municipalities around Cerro Negro are now
protecting themselves with sombreros, caps or berets, and
handkerchiefs on their faces, while receiving urgent advice on
protection against eventual gas emanations.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Leon, with 161,530 residents 100 kilometers west
of Managua, Rigoberto Sampsom, decreed "red alert" and went to an
area where he ordered evacuating about 16,000 peasants from eight
communities near the volcano.

<P>
BONN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- French midfielder Youri Djorkaeff
will make his debut at the Bundesliga with Kaiserslautern
following a frustrating season with Italian club Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
Kaiserslautern board member Gerhard Herzog said on Thursday
that both sides had reached an agreement and Djorkaeff could be in
the uniform of the 1997-1998 German champions in their opening
match of the season against Borussia Dortmund at homecourt on
August 14.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old was expected to sign a three-year contract this
weekend. According to press reports, Kaiserslautern will pay Inter
around four million marks ($2.21 million) for the newcomer, who
will receive an annual salary of around 3.6 million marks.
</P>
<P>
Djorkaeff, who joined Inter Milan from Paris St Germain in 1996,
was a regular in the Inter first team until this season, during
which he was often left on the bench.

MEXICO CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's international

The press here on the same day quoted Gulllermo Perry, chief

"Mexico and Peru are the two Latin American countries which

<HEADLINE> Over 280 Hot spots Detected in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A preliminary survey has shown
that there are more than 280 hot spots in West Kalimantan
province, Indonesia, putting the area in a real danger of being
covered by thick haze, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for the Environment Panangian Siregar said
Thursday in Pontianak, capital of West Kalimantan that he had seen
part of the hot spots from the plane, Antara News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said when his plane flew over Sintang District in
the province, he saw people on the ground burning scrubs in small
areas, apparently for the purpose of clearing land.
</P>
<P>
Haze, which always blankets some areas in West Kalimantan
during the dry season, could grow into an international problem if
the haze spreads to neighboring countries like Brunei and
Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the haze did spread to those countries and they
promptly lodged complaints because the vapor created such problems
as reduced visibility and air pollution, Panangian said.
</P>
<P>
He said if the burning of scrubs was done by big companies, the
government would immediately take strong measures against them.
But so far, it seemed that the burning was the work of members of
local community.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said this year's forest fires may be bigger than
that in 1997 when forest fires raged in many parts of the islands
of Sumatra and Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 fires destroyed about 5 million hectares of forest in
the country with an economic lose of about 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another report said, people in Sumatra's province of Riau were
urged Thursday to wear masks and reduce outdoor activities because
haze from forest fires now covering the region has hit a dangerous
level.

morning for a 24-hour strike.

cutting pilot numbers by at least 30, according to the New Zealand

</P>
<P>
The strike has forced the cancellation of 100 Ansett flights in
the country. Pilots have also given notice of two more 24-hour
strikes, one next Tuesday and the other the following Tuesday.
</P>

Arch-rival Air New Zealand is cashing in on the Ansett strike,

<HEADLINE> Cuban Sports Minister Issues Statement of Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Minister of Sports
Humberto Rodriquez Gonzalez Thursday reiterated that the country's
athletes are competing under "an atmosphere of hostility" at the
13th Pan American Games in a statement of principle following
world record holder Javier Sotomayor tested positive for Cocaine
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason why I'm here today is to speak of performances
of our delegation, which unfortunately have not been the main
center of our Games," Gonzalez said at a news conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban athletes came here to compete in the sports, to
defend their main medals, which are "the medals of our country",
and to underline their spirits of discipline, pereverence and
concentration.
</P>
<P>
And the job so far has been "proficiently and exellently done",
said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
But the local media gave priority to other non-sports issues,
in which he implied the reporting on defections -- a male gymnast
asking for asylum Tuesday is the sixth known case.
</P>
<P>
In his marathon speech, Gonzalez once again pointed out the
Cuban delegation are here subject to such a pressure and difficult
situation they have never had experienced before where athletes
were being stalked, provoked and swamped by phonecalls and
personal messages.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, they did receive repect of the Canadian
audience, which is a "extremely good reponse".
</P>
<P>
"Medals-winning is not the most important thing for us. Dignity
is," Gongzalez said.
</P>
<P>
"But unfortunately, the most basic respect did not come at the
right place at the right time," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether there was hostility from the PASO
laboratory in Montreal, which reported a positive drug test result
for Sotomayor, Gongzalez said:" We don't have any proof yet."
</P>
<P>
He then went on to reiterate they totally believe Sotomayor is
an innocent man.
</P>
<P>
"He said he was being victimized and fell under a trap,"
Gongzalez quoted Sotomayor as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair for an athlete giving so much to the sports world
to be subject to such a result," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr.Mario Granda, chief doctor of the Cuban delegation, said
yesterday there is a manipulaton in the Sotomayor case.
</P>
<P>
But Gongzalez today preferred "manuveur" to "manipulation".
</P>
<P>
"I've never said manipulation," Gongzalez said. " What I said
was manuveur."
</P>
<P>
Despite "all the manuveurs which has been created", Gongzalez
ensured that the Cuban delegation will prepare themselves for a
good finale and leave the central Canadian city on a high-note.
</P>
<P>
"But we'll forever remember we've been subject to such a
pressure,to such a great amount of hostility," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson to Face Douglas Again in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson is seeking a
revenge on his biggest rival Buster Douglas in his latest comeback
fight on October 2 at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas, a press
report said today.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's boxing adviser, Shelly Finkel, was flying from New York
to Scottsdale, to watch Tyson train but was out of reach for
comment.
</P>
<P>
Douglas, 38, made a big surprise on February 11, 1990 when he
knocked out the then undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson in the
10th round. Douglas went off as a 42-1 underdog, but dominated the
bout and put Tyson out with a series of punches to chalk up one of
the most shocking upsets in boxing history.
</P>
<P>
Douglas lost the title to Evander Holyfield in his first
defense, then retired for six years.
</P>
<P>
He made a comeback but looked like a shadow of himself in
recent bouts. He was knocked out in the opening round by Lou
Savarese in June 1998 and won his last two fights by knickout
against nondescript opposition.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who knocked down Frans Botha in the fifth round on
January 16 at the MGM, is going to make his third return to boxing.
The former heavyweight champion was put into jail after assaulting
two men following a traffic accident.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Signs Free Agent Terry Porter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The NBA champion San Antonio
Spurs added depth in the backcourt today by signing veteran free
agent guard Terry Porter.
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, but the San Antonio Express-News is
reporting that Porter agreed to a three-year, $6.6 million deal
and that the Spurs will use their $2 million contract exception on
the 14-year NBA veteran.
</P>
<P>
Porter played for the Miami Heat last season, averaging 10.5
points, 2.9 assists and 2.8 rebounds in 27.3 minutes per game. He
shot 45.6 percent from the field and his 41.1 percent mark from 3-
point range was 12th-best in the league.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Porter can play either guard position and can
be used to back up Jaren Jackson, a free agent the Spurs hope to
re-sign, as well as Avery Johnson and Mario Elie.
</P>
<P>
Porter spent his first 10 NBA seasons in Portland after being
selected by the Trail Blazers in the first round of the 1985 draft.
After three seasons in Minnesota, he signed with Miami prior to
last season.
</P>
<P>
The main concern for the Spurs this offseason is to plan for
the absence of forward Sean Elliott, who needs a kidney transplant.

<HEADLINE> Stevenson Upset about Pan Am Semi Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon semifinalist
Alexandra Stevenson admitted yesterday's semi-final crushing
defeat at the Winnipeg Law Tennis Club made her very down.
</P>
<P>
"I think I feel disappointed in myself and myself as an
American player. I really wanted the gold," the 19-year-old
American tennis prospect said of her 6-0, 6-3 loss to Venezuela's
Maria Vento in the Pan Am women's tennis semi-finals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"But the Olympics is in 10 months and I'll just have to aim for
that." she said.
</P>
<P>
The much-hyped Stevenson, who is ranked No.37 in the world and
argueably the biggest star in the Winnipeg Games, will have to
settle for a bronze medal. The Pan Am competition setup doesn't
require losers of the semis to go head to head for third place.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson insisted all the hype surrounding her Wimbledon
victory and the notoriety of being NBA legend Julius Erving's
biological daughter hasn't bothered her on the court.
</P>
<P>
"I only got to the semis of Wimbledon and the semis here so
that means I have a lot of work ahead of me," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Am Games was her first tournament since last month's
Wimbledon Open where she made history by becoming the first
qualifier in the history of the coveted tournament to reach women'
s singles semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The American teenager said she had an upset stomach prior to
the match. "I just made errors," she said, "I was late to the ball
and when you're dizzy you have to play tough. I tried to do that
but it didn't work out."
</P>
<P>
Promoted by her mother Samantha, a freelance journalist and an
unofficial co-ordinator of the US delegation, Stevenson creditted
vento.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan had been ranked as high as 31 (currently 117)
and got to the fourth round of the 1997 French Open.
</P>
<P>
"I was able to move her around a lot and try to make her have a
lot of unforced errors which she did," said Vento, 25. "I feel
really good about this win."
</P>
<P>
Vento and American Tara Snyder will go for women's gold later
today.

<HEADLINE> UK Bank Keeps Interest Rates on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON August 5 (Xinhua) - The Bank of England has decided to
leave UK interest rates unchanged at 5 percent, despite signs of
the quickening pace of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
It is the second month in succession that members of the bank's
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have voted for no change in rates,
which remain at a 22-year low.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as no surprise to economists, although many
of them believe it is now only a matter of time before the MPC
starts raising rates again to head off inflation as the recovery
gathers strength.
</P>
<P>
It also came as a relief for those with mortgages and is
welcomed by business leaders who feared that a rise in rates could
push up the value of the pound and so make life tougher for
exporters.
</P>
<P>
The MPC's brief is to set interest rates to ensure that
underlying inflation stays within 1 percent of the 2.5 percent
target rate on inflation. It currently stands at 2.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Catches More Tuna in the Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 5 (Xinhua)-- With a volume of 110,000 metric
tons, Ecuador has become the country with the largest capture of
tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's taking represent 30 percent of those made by all the
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Ecuador will not be allowed to go on at this speed,
because the maximum quota the Inter-American Commission of Tropic
Tuna gives Ecuador is 40,000 metric tons. If Ecuador break the
rules, the country's fishing activity would be suspended in year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Flying Doctors Perform Eye Operations in Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Doctors from Orbis, an airborne
eye hospital traveling around the world, have completed 72 eye
operations in this capital of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
It is the 24th mission to China for the Orbis doctors and
nurses, who come from 11 countries, including India, the United
States, Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The three weeks of free surgery has helped local people regain
their eyesight through cataract removal, implanting of corneas,
and glaucoma treatment. The doctors also conducted 10 operations
as training programs at a local hospital, and donated nine corneas.
</P>
<P>
Harish Nayak, chief ophthalmologist of Orbis, described their
activities in Lanzhou as a successful mission which has laid a
good foundation for future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 local medical personnel attended the operations
and received training courses in a bid to improve local
ophthalmologic services.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of the importance it attaches to its collaboration
with China, Orbis set up its China branch in Shanghai recently, as
well as an ophthalmologic training center in Taiyuan, capital of
Shanxi Province, said Dr. Nayak.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1982, Orbis has accomplished more
than 390 medical missions to 79 countries, conducting operations
and training programs.

MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

<HEADLINE> USA Becomes Pharmacy for World's Sports Cheaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States seems
to be becoming the pharmacy for world-wide sports cheaters.
</P>
<P>
Nandrolone, an anabolic steroid found in the urine of Canadian
roller hockey goalie Steve Vezina at the Pan Am Games last week,
seems to be the drug of the moment.
</P>
<P>
But it's not because drug testing has become more sophisticated
or because researchers have discovered some new methods of
discovering prohibited substances, said Christiane Ayotte,
director of a Montreal laboratory accredited by the International
Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
It's because it's easy to get steroid precursors through oral
supplements in the United States, the only country in the world
that allows the sale of these substances. The precursors turn into
steroids when metabolized by the body.
</P>
<P>
The US Food and Drug Administration will not regulate the use
of steroid precursors unless there is clear proof that they work
to increase muscle mass, Ayotte said.
</P>
<P>
Nandrolone is used by the agriculture industry to increase the
muscle mass of beef cattle. But word came yesterday that Linford
Chiristie, a 39-year-old athlete who has always spoken out against
drug use, was suspended for testing positive for Nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
It seems that more athletes are being caught lately, Ayotte
said, because many of them are high-profile and catch a lot more
attention. " I don't think the number of positive tests has
increased," she said.
</P>
<P>
And the top athletes have been caught because they have been
turning to the steroid precursors that are freely available in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Nandrolone is a steroid usually available as an injectible
medication that requires a doctor's prescription, Ayotte said.
Some athletes may get it through the black market or from a doctor
who is very lenient in making out prescriptions for it.
</P>
<P>
Now it's much easier to buy the precursor of the drug in the
United States. The precursor is administered orally.
</P>
<P>
The IOC and countries that do not allow the sale of such
substances are putting pressure on the United States to change its
rules, Ayotte said.
