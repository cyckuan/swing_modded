`OTHER GUY' LEADS CYCLONES PAST COWBOYS

 STATE-OKLAHOMA STATE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Iowa State proved itself to be more than
Marcus Fizer and a cast of hangers-on with a 68-64 victory over
Oklahoma State during Saturday's semifinals of the Big 12 men's
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, the league's Player of the Year and a 30-point scorer in
five of his past seven games, did not make a field goal in the
final 13:34 against Oklahoma State. Nor did he score a point during
the Cyclones' comeback from a four-point deficit in the waning
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the biggest crunch-time contributions came from the
team's ``other'' forward. That would be Stevie Johnson, a senior
known for defense and rebounding. Johnson arrived Saturday in
Kemper Arena with the fewest attempts (5.3 per game) and lowest
scoring average (8.3) among the Cyclones' starters.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Johnson who scored nine of the Cyclones' last 11
points in helping Iowa State (28-4) erase a late 61-57 deficit and
earn a berth opposite Oklahoma (26-5) in Sunday's 2 p.m. title
game. With the victory, the Cyclones advanced to their first title
game in a postseason conference tournament since 1996, their final
year in the Big Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's stretch run began with 2:20 remaining, when Oklahoma
State's Desmond Mason hacked Johnson and became the first of three
Cowboys' starters to foul out before the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Johnson responded in less-than-heroic fashion. He
missed his fifth consecutive free throw. But on his second attempt
after the Mason foul, Johnson hit nothing but net. He would not
miss again, converting consecutive three-point plays on the
Cyclones' next two possessions and sinking a pair of clinching free
throws with 17 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to talk about Marcus because of all his points,''
said Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy, referring to Fizer's
league-best scoring average (23.3). ``But Stevie is a special guy.
He does a lot of things that don't show up in the box score. He's
the heart and soul of our team, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamaal Tinsley, the Cyclones' point guard, said Johnson's
domination down the stretch ``shows people that we've got other
guys than just Marcus ... We're a true team. We don't need Marcus
to score 30 (points) every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fizer had just 19 against the Cowboys. But he was
instrumental in drawing fouls on Oklahoma State's three inside
starters: Mason, Brian Montonati and Fredrik Jonzen. All three
fouled out in the final 2:20, as the Cowboys frittered away a 61-57
advantage. Their collective absence, said Cowboys guard Joe Adkins,
helped pave the way to the basket for Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some younger guys were in and they didn't do what they were
supposed to do on defense. Anytime you have three front-court
players foul out, you're in trouble,'' Adkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were the Cowboys helped by a season-low shooting percentage
of 33.9. OSU missed 16 layups, including five by point guard Doug
Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough to get you beat, right there,'' said OSU coach
Eddie Sutton He complained after the game about a technical foul
assessed to the Cowboys' bench midway through the second half but
conceded the call had no bearing on his team blowing its 61-57
advantage over the final 2:20.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, crunch time belonged to Iowa State's ``other'' forward:
Stevie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I needed to redeem myself after missing all those
free throws early in the game,'' Johnson said. ``The opportunities
were there and I took advantage of them.''

STARS CENTER JOE NIEUWENDYK HOPES TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Hockey didn't exist for Joe Nieuwendyk. Not for long
stretches of this season.
</P>
<P>
   He simply couldn't allow himself to think about the game he
wasn't able to play.
</P>
<P>
   As January quickly faded into February, and the Stars began
playing like a legitimate Cup contender, Nieuwendyk instead passed
his time e-mailing friends and tracking his stocks online. He
didn't feel comfortable in his own locker room, coming for rehab
when no one was around and leaving before anyone could see him.
He'd go to Stars games, but he didn't stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get away,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``It's just hard because
you're not really a part of it, but you are.''
</P>
<P>
   A separated shoulder on Jan. 19 created this dichotomy. Doctors
told him another six to eight weeks loomed before he would play
again. So Nieuwendyk returned from that West Coast swing, retreated
to his house, and soaked in his disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   This, he thought, wasn't the way it was supposed to be. He was
coming off a Stanley Cup playoffs where he played maybe his best
stretch of hockey, and these next couple of years were supposed to
be his years. He had just signed a three-year, $15 million contract
extension, which, with the year he had remaining, could take him to
the end of his career. He's 33, and these next four years would
likely define his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But time was running out on the first year.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled in October and into November and finally, just as
playing began to be fun again, he couldn't. He physically couldn't.
A rib injury sidelined him for 10 games. He played three before
separating his shoulder and missing another 21. He has missed as
many games this season (34) as he has played.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really understand what's so hard about not playing
until you are not playing,'' said Stars captain Derian Hatcher, who
missed 24 games with a lacerated calf. ``I think you get frustrated
and the best way to deal with that is try to get away. You just
have to come out of the first couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk emerged from his sabbatical. Swinging.
</P>
<P>
   He played on Friday, only his fourth game in the Stars' past 35.
He played 18-plus minutes, getting four shots, scoring one goal and
winning 61 percent of his faceoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when Nieuwendyk gets disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment from missing the Stars' 1998 playoff run with
an injury turned Nieuwendyk into the player he was during last
season's Stanley Cup stretch. As a parting gift, he was awarded the
Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, that's the player we need. Only we don't need it in
the playoffs. We need it now,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``If ever we've needed it, we need it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have spent the season putting fingers in the dykes.
Every time one is plugged, another busts open. They were awaiting
someone's return or for this group _ quite different from last
season's Cup team _ to jell in time for the playoffs. Now, with the
status of goalie Ed Belfour in doubt, the Stars are looking for
someone to plug that hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are hoping Nieuwendyk is that someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has he played, 30 games this year?'' Stars winger Jamie
Langenbrunner said. ``I think Joe plays well when he wants to play
well. Not that he turns it off and on. But when he gets focused and
wanting to play _ like he did last year in the playoffs _ where
he's focused to that goal, he can dominate play to a point where
you forget other people are on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A, Langenbrunner says, has to be an eight-week stretch
in the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk had an NHL-leading 11 goals, including six
game-winners, with another 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Bryan Marchment? He, in some way, had something to do
with this.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk didn't make it through the first period of the first
game of the first round of the playoffs in 1998. Marchment made
sure of that when his hit from behind sent Nieuwendyk into the
Reunion Arena boards. He emerged with a season-ending tear to the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee _ his good knee.
</P>
<P>
   He went through the same withdrawal from hockey then.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't watch the playoffs. He didn't show up until the
third round, only to watch the Stars lose to the Detroit Red Wings
in the Western Conference Finals. He tried not to think about what
could have been during those long summer days in Dallas where he
stayed to rehab.
</P>
<P>
   But when he came back last year, you could tell he had thought
of nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mission,'' his teammates described him being on last season.
He sucked every ounce of marrow out of the playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I really seized the opportunity,'' Nieuwendyk
said. ``It was a long time since I got that far in the postseason.
You just put all your heart and soul into it and you get rewarded
in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what made the beginning of this season so frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk didn't find the form he displayed on the way to the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just tough for him at the beginning of the year
to get that focus back,'' Langenbrunner said. ``He wasn't the only
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk couldn't accept that.
</P>
<P>
   The thinker in him went looking for reasons. He talked to
friends, a couple of teammates, but mostly he thought. That's what
thinkers do, sometimes to their own detriment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely got that from my mother, no doubt about it,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``A worrier and a thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   The worry now is: Did he leave himself enough time to make up
for the time that has been lost?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said before,'' Nieuwendyk said, ``ultimately you get
judged on how you do in the end. That's what everybody is going to
write about when the season is over with. How did the Stars finish
up? Not how did they start.''
</P>
<P>
   As March quickly turns into April, and the Stars begin their
defense of the Cup, hockey once again exists for Nieuwendyk. Just
in time for the Stars, too.

SPITTING OUT THE SEEDS WILL BE DIFFICULT TASK

   CHICAGO _ This is Illinois' schedule for today's Big Ten
Conference championship game:
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m. _ Wakeup. 10:30 a.m. _ Breakfast. 11 a.m. Walk through.
Noon _ Tape. 1 p.m. _ Bus leaves. 2:30 p.m. _ Play for
championship.
</P>
<P>
   That last entry has the NCAA Men's Tournament committee reaching
for the antacid pills. An Illinois upset of Michigan State today
would pose just another problem for the committee to solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonkers. I think they're going absolutely bonkers,'' CBS
analyst Billy Packer said between Illinois' 94-84 semifinal victory
against upstart Penn State and Michigan State's 55-46 defeat of
Wisconsin. ``This will be by far the toughest tournament to select
and seed. I think the committee will have to make more subjective
selections than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee faces this question: Is Michigan State a No. 1
seed regardless of today's outcome? The committee might have to
prepare an ``A'' bracket (Michigan State wins, No. 1 seed), and a
``B'' bracket (if the Spartans lose). Had top-seeded Ohio State
reached the final against the Spartans, the committee could have
given the title game winner a No. 1 and the loser a No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it's just not that easy.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's deadline is 5:30 p.m. today when the 64-team
field is announced on CBS' national telecast. Sometimes in the
past, before the committee improved its organizational skills,
there was a mad dash to achieve a finished product. But never
before has there been so much doubt and uncertainty with the No. 1
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my best guess: Duke is a the strongest lock to be a No. 1
seed, probably in the East. Michigan State, if it beats Illinois,
would be a No. 1 in the Midwest. Stanford is probably headed to the
No. 1 seed in the South, although a strong case could be made that
Temple deserves a top seed.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which gained the Pacific-10 Conference's automatic bid
yesterday, probably deserves the top seed in the West. Loren Woods
has suffered from a bad back and might not play again this season.
The Wildcats are down to six scholarship players. Word out of
Tucson is that Arizona coach Lute Olson has imposed a news blackout
on Woods' status in order to protect his team's possible No. 1
seed.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, with a 28-3 record, no doubt feels it deserves a No.
1 seed, but might not get it without player of the year Kenyon
Martin, who broke his leg during the Bearcats loss to Saint Louis
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Each committee has its own personality and philosophy. This
year's committee wants to select and seed the field based on how
teams play on Selection Sunday, and what specific teams can bring
to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be more subjective than it's ever been,''
Packer said, noting the myriad of player injuries and suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 Conference presents a similar problem. If Iowa State
follows its regular-season title with the tournament crown, the
Cyclones deserve top seed consideration. But, if Iowa State loses
to Oklahoma today, do the Cyclones fall to a No. 2? If so, does the
committee prepare a ``C'' bracket and a ``D'' bracket?
</P>
<P>
   Saint Louis' unexpected Conference USA championship means a team
not expected to make the field has an automatic bid. If Arkansas
wins the Southeastern Conference title today, there will be two
unexpected automatic bids in the field. That has teams like St.
Bonaventure, Missouri and Notre Dame listening to their stomachs
churn.
</P>
<P>
   Told that an Illinois victory today would probably send objects
flying around the basketball committee room, Illinois sophomore
guard Cory Bradford got a crooked, wicked little grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, man,'' he said. ``I guess we do sort of hold the key to
some things.''

GREER IS WILLING TO HIT SECOND, BUT WOULD LIKE PERMANENT SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Manager Johnny Oates' main goal with his Texas
Rangers lineup is to get Rusty Greer, Rafael Palmeiro and Ivan
Rodriguez to the plate as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   For Greer, that appears to mean batting second. That comes after
batting third for the past four years and after Oates flirted with
the idea this off-season of using him in the leadoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you know my attitude,'' Greer said. ``I've proven I
can hit third and I like hitting third. But if I'm best suited for
this team to hit second, I'll do that. If I'm best suited to hit
leadoff, I'll do that. It's just whatever Johnny thinks will help
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer's only request is to hit in one spot as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a hitter you grow accustomed to one spot,'' Greer said.
``You feel comfortable doing that and not moving around. That's not
to say I can't be moved. Earlier in my career I was moved all over
the lineup. That doesn't matter. But as a hitter, if you had one
thing on your list, it would be a certain spot in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now Oates is using Royce Clayton as his leadoff hitter,
followed by Greer, Ivan Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro. Oates has
also talked about eventually moving Ruben Mateo to the No. 3 spot.
PITCHING ON MEND
</P>
<P>
   The latest on the Rangers' injured pitchers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Closer John Wetteland is over the strained calf muscle that
sidelined him for the first week of the exhibition season. The
Rangers are waiting for him to get over a strained groin muscle but
Johnny Oates said, ``we're not even close to being at the critical
stage. They tell me he's close to rejoining us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers are encouraged by the progress pitcher Mike
Venafro (strained ligament of his left middle finger) has made the
past four days and think there's a chance he could get ready for
Opening Day. Trainer Danny Wheat said, ``I'm afraid to get excited
because it could go the opposite way just as quickly. But if he
continues to improve next week like he has this week, he's got a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers continue be excited about the progress of
left-hander Justin Thompson, who is coming off shoulder surgery.
General manager Doug Melvin said the first week of May is still the
target. Oates watched Thompson throw Friday and said,
``Mechanically, he looks flawless. It doesn't look like he's
favoring (the injured shoulder) at all.'' YOUNG PITCHERS DISAPPOINT
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates still isn't happy with what he's seeing with his
young pitchers. Jonathan Johnson, the Rangers' rapidly fading No. 1
pick from 1995, was particularly disappointing last night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took over in the eighth with a 5-2 lead and couldn't get
out of the inning. Instead, he gave up three runs and allowed the
Reds to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not getting anybody out,'' Oates said. ``He's up in the
strike zone and his curve ball is rolling around. He's not making
quality pitches around the knees. Everything is up at the belt.''
</P>
<P>
   R.A. Dickey, a first-round pick in 1996, got the Rangers out of
the eighth but gave up a game-winning home run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last four pitchers threw more pitches above the belt than
below the belt,'' Oates said, referring to Danny Kolb and Francisco
Cordero, as well. ``They can't pitch up. They've got to do
better.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Second baseman Edwin Diaz, trying to win a spot as a utility
infielder, had a double in three at-bats and is 5-for-12 on the
spring. He also made a nice catch on a pop-up in short center field
to save a run.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right fielder Jason McDonald, trying to win a job as a fifth
outfielder, threw out Sean Casey trying to stretch a single into a
double in the fifth. Said McDonald, ``I'm the type of player who
has to do the little things to have a chance to make this team.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark Clark, Matt Perisho and Ryan Glynn are scheduled to pitch
against the Minnesota Twins on Sunday at Port Charlotte. nn

STARS BACKUP GOALIE MANNY FERNANDEZ TRIES TO SHORE UP CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Manny Fernandez's demons have never been a product of
his talent. Yet they terrorize his mind like a hurricane battering
the shoreline, ripping apart his confidence like fragile limbs of
trees trapped in the raging storm.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez's mind, not his ability, has served as his past
undoing in his previous stints with the Stars. The Stars' backup
goalie, unexpectedly thrust into the starting role by virtue of Ed
Belfour's arrest and ongoing evaluation, is desperately fighting an
internal struggle of mind over matter.
</P>
<P>
   The demons are still there, gnawing at the security he has built
this season as a quality backup. They are there in even greater
force now, emotionally whipping him since the Stars tied Vancouver
and lost in overtime on Friday to the lowly New York Islanders. The
loss was not solely his fault, they never are, but the demons have
always told him otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the confidence I built in the first part of the
season ... I need to get that back, I need to start thinking about
the good things that I did before and stop thinking about what
happened the last two games,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys expect certain saves, and if something bad happens, I
can see I start panicking. So in a sense, I put a little bit on my
back, actually quite a lot, but it's the way I'm going to come out
of that. If I come out, I'm going to make myself a lot stronger. I
think it's going to be a good challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge of his brief NHL career begins at 2 p.m.
today when the Stars face the Western Conference-leading St. Louis
Blues. Just as one defensive breakdown can sabotage a goalie, he
knows one mental breakdown can doom the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the mental aspect right now, I think I can play in
this league,'' Fernandez said. ``The thing is, I care for these
guys as much as anybody else and you don't want to let them down.
</P>
<P>
   He says that ``when a bad goal happens,'' he gets so upset,] ``I
seem to lose control for a couple minutes. I don't think I'm
helping the team as I am right now, so I better get my head on
straight and calm down out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, 25, finally recognizes his self-destructive patterns.
His success this season has worked as therapy. In 19 games, he has
a 2.06 goals-against average and .922 save percentage. Today, he
tries to snap a three-game winless streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny's been at the top of the stats all year. His
goals-against, save percentage are right there. He's been
rock-solid,'' rookie Brad Lukowich said. ``I played with him in
Kalamazoo, he was our No. 1 there. I know he's capable of the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Belfour returns, coach Ken Hitchcock has no choice but to
trust in Fernandez. But, trust has never been an issue. Hitchcock
coached Fernandez on the team's minor-league affiliate and
continues to believe in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always go the extra mile for talent,'' Hitchcock said.
``Our focus is having Manny play well and play strong and that's
our primary focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Fernandez knows that is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing about not putting in 110 percent because I've
given everything I have,'' Fernandez said. ``A hockey game is one
thing to give all you've got, but it's another thing to just calm
down and play the game.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton chastised
game officials for calling a technical foul on the Cowboys' bench
with 8:05 remaining in a game that was tied, 49-49. After a foul
was called underneath the Iowa State basket, several players and
student managers seated on the Cowboys' bench joined Sutton in
standing as the coach bellowed his disapproval of the call.
</P>
<P>
   From the opposite end of the court, referee Bob Sitov pointed at
the Oklahoma State bench and assessed the technical, much to
Sutton's surprise. Sutton characterized the call as nitpicking and
said he sought an explanation from Dale Kelley, Big 12 men's
coordinator of basketball officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think in a league with four teams in the Top 20,
there should be better officiating than what was out there this
afternoon,'' said Sutton, whose team lost to Iowa State, 68-64.
``I'm sure I'll get reprimanded for saying this ... But how can you
call a technical foul on guys for standing up? How can you make
that call in a big-time game? If someone says something, OK. But
not that. I want an explanation from Dale Kelley.''
</P>
<P>
   During the final 2:20, three Oklahoma State starters fouled out
as the Cowboys watched a 61-57 lead disappear. Asked his assessment
of the officiating other than the technical foul, Sutton smiled and
remained silent for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably said enough already,'' he said.  &LR; name: _ Jimmy
Burch \Nsubheds:Loss upsets Mihm Texas center Chris Mihm admitted
profound disappointment in the way the Longhorns lost their
semifinal game against Oklahoma, but tried to find a reason for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, in the long run this might be the slap in the face
to wake us up and get us ready for the NCAA Tournament,'' he said.
``That's what I'm hoping. Last year we were inexperienced in
postseason and we had some first-timers here today. Hopefully this
will show them what it's like, that it's do or die, one loss and
you're out. That's what I'm hoping.''  &LR; name: _ Mike Jones
\Nsubheds:Sutton: ISU deserves top seed Iowa State coach Larry
Eustachy, whose team improved to 28-4 heading into today's
championship game, remained noncommittal when asked about the
Cyclones' probable seeding in the NCAA tournament. But not Oklahoma
State coach Eddie Sutton, whose team fell to Iowa State in
yesterday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they win \Rtoday\S, they ought to get a No. 1 seed,''
Sutton said. ``They won the regular-season title. They'd be 29-4.
The NCAA tournament committee should give them a top seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said the season-ending injury to Cincinnati forward
Kenyon Martin, coupled with the Bearcats' early exit from the
Conference USA tournament, should open up a top seed for Iowa
State. At worst, said Sutton, the Cyclones deserve a No. 2 seed.
 &LR; name: _ Jimmy Burch \Nsubheds:Falling seeds? Longhorns coach Rick
Barnes said he wasn't sure how much yesterday's loss cost Texas in
terms of NCAA seeding.

   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I'll be surprised if we're not a
No. 4 seed, or somewhere in that area. But I will be disappointed
if the winner of \Rthe Big 12 tournament\S doesn't get a No. 2
seed. I want to see this league continue to grow and I'm not sure
we have the national respect we deserve. But we'll have to \Rget\S
that in the tournament.''

BELFOUR'S STATUS REMAINS UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Stars general manager Bob Gainey on Saturday spoke with
the doctor in charge of the substance-abuse program evaluating
Stars goalie Ed Belfour. Gainey said the evaluation is ongoing and
he hopes to have the program's final report and any recommendations
before the team leaves for New York after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who play host to St. Louis on Sunday, open a
three-game road trip tomorrow against the New York Rangers. Gainey
said that ``I doubt he will be traveling with us tomorrow, but
nothing is firm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no final evaluation and no recommendations as
yet, but (the doctor) has given me an indication that I could
expect to hear something from him later in the day (Sunday) before
the team leaves town,'' Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   The league-sponsored substance-abuse program is evaluating
Belfour's actions from early Wednesday morning, when he was jailed
on misdemeanor charges of assault and resisting arrest. The police
report said Belfour was intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL requires that any player arrested in an incident
involving alcohol or drugs be evaluated by the substance-abuse
program so that it can recommend treatment for the player or action
by the team. A player cannot practice or play in games while under
evaluation. Gainey said Friday that Belfour would not face
suspension by the NHL or the team. HATCHER, HULL TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   Not only will the Stars get winger Brett Hull back for Sunday's
game, captain Derian Hatcher also will return. They both missed
Friday's game against the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher thought he had a strained Achilles' tendon. An MRI
showed that he didn't, which is good news because it would've put
him out three weeks. He did have the fluid that had built up in his
Achilles' tendon drained. The time off definitely helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the best it's felt, and I'm really excited about it,
to be honest,'' Hatcher said. ``We know it's weak, but it's going
to be weak until next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull missed Friday's game with a hip flexor injury. Ken
Hitchcock said three days of a strenuous off-ice exercise program
designed to strengthen the muscle has paid off. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Winger Scott Thornton will be a game-time decision Sunday. He
is still feeling the effects of the flu, which forced him out of
Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars reassigned left winger Jamie Wright to their
minor-league affiliate, the Michigan K-Wings, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ ABC has decided to drop the Stars-Blackhawks game next
Saturday in Chicago as one of its regional telecasts. That leaves
no local television coverage of the game because of the network's
exclusivity during that three-hour window. The 2 p.m. game can be
heard on WBAP/820 AM.

SIMMS HOPING TO SHOW RANGERS HE CAN STILL RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ One at-bat consumes the thoughts of Rangers
outfielder Mike Simms.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch for that at-bat remains to be thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's with a week or 10 days left in spring training,'' Simms
said. ``I want to hit a long single, bust out of the box, slide
into second and get a double out of it. Then, I want to have some
guy smoke the next pitch right at an outfielder _ a one-hop base
hit _ and score from second and have people go: `Oh, wait a second.
He's running again. Look at that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simms emerged as one of the Rangers' unheralded heroes from
their 1998 American League West championship season, but his health
deserted him throughout the 1999 season and leaves him battling for
a roster berth this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what those last two spots will be,'' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``We've got to have a backup catcher, a couple
of infielders and you know Chad Curtis is going to be on the team.
That leaves only a couple of spots. It just depends on what we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates expects catcher Bill Haselman, infielder Frank Catalanotto
and outfielder Chad Curtis among those on his bench. Catalanotto,
though, cannot play shortstop, which likely presents a roster berth
for either Scott Sheldon or Edwin Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Simms and outfielder Jason McDonald as the most
likely candidates to earn that one available roster berth. The
Rangers, though, remain concerned about Simms' health.
</P>
<P>
   Simms suffered a partial tear of his left Achilles' tendon while
running during spring training a year ago. The injury limited him
to four September appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Achilles' is fine,'' Simms said. ``I don't even worry about
my Achilles'.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Simms struggles to run. His legs, hip, groin and muscles in
those areas make the process one of labor after a year of
inactivity. Simms signed a two-year contract before the 1999 season
that will pay him $1 million this year, but that will not play a
factor in whether he will be on the Opening Day roster, general
manager Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rewarded Simms with that contract after the
outfielder/first baseman hit .296 with 16 home runs and 46 runs
batted in as a reserve. Simms joined Eddie Robinson and Bob Thurman
as the only major-league players to hit as many 16 home runs with
fewer than 200 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show them that their faith in me from '98 did not go
all to waste,'' Simms said. ``I want to prove that they were right
and I was worth giving this contract. I don't want to glide
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress gives Simms reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do what I did today two weeks ago when camp
opened,'' Simms said. ``That's how far I've come in two weeks. I
think if I can progress that way over the next two weeks, then
hopefully that little dream I have will come true.'' nn

HULL, BLUES BETTER OFF WITHOUT EACH OTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues come in to Reunion Arena on Sunday with the
best record in the NHL. Former Blues winger Brett Hull comes in
with his first Stanley Cup ring won last season, his first with
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't have done it with each other.
</P>
<P>
   No typo there. Hull wasn't going to win a Cup in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Hull disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   OK, he doesn't exactly disagree. He just doesn't know whether
they would have or not. He certainly doesn't want to hazard a
guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to say,'' Hull said. ``Obviously not, because
we didn't while I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The history suggests it wouldn't have happened if he had stayed.
It didn't in his 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The good-but-not-quite-good-enough Blues finally reached a
decision. The Golden Brett had to go. So, they didn't sign him. The
Stars did.
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations are better for it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues' success has come with the younger group that Hull's
departure allowed them to develop and play. The Stars' Cup finally
happened when in triple overtime of Game 6 Hull banged a puck past
Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   As he pointed out the other day, who's to say if he had stayed
in St. Louis that the Cup-clinching goal wouldn't have come from
somebody else. If he had been playing for St. Louis, who's to say
the Blues wouldn't have beat the Stars in the second round of the
playoffs and he wouldn't have scored the Cup clincher for the
Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Hull doesn't believe in the wonderful world of what if. He
refuses to go there.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that both St. Louis and Hull are better
off without each other.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Blues this season. This isn't Hull's team. They're
allowing something like a shot a game against them. They look like
the Stars' version of ``Mini-Me.'' The Blues that Hull played for
were just a bit more wide open, which, of course, is why everybody
wondered if Hull would fit in when he brought his game to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hull has benefited from the split. Not only did he prove
that he was capable of winning the Cup, the one jewel in hockey
that he lacked. He also proved that he was capable of being a part
of the team and not ``the'' team.
</P>
<P>
   He has been able to do it because the Stars didn't need him to
be the team.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he had spent his entire career in St. Louis. He was
every bit as popular as other St. Louis sports icons like Ozzie
Smith. The way he played there made hockey fun. He was like
watching the highlight reel every night.
</P>
<P>
   And, if things happen as they're supposed to, he would've won
his Cup there. It's like Ray Bourque now. You basically spend your
entire career in one city amassing personal records and then move
to another town to win your Cup.
</P>
<P>
   So does Hull ever think about what it would've been like to win
his Cup with St. Louis?
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my years in St. Louis and really loved playing there
and the people and the players,'' Hull said. ``But, you know what,
I'm not there anymore so I don't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's to think about? Hull has his ring, and it appears as if
the Blues could get theirs.
BOURQUE FINALLY IN CUP CHASE
</P>
<P>
   Not seeing defenseman Ray Bourque in a Boston Bruins uniform is
like the president not living at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just doesn't seem right, does it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel bad. Bourque said his first game in a Colorado
uniform since being traded to the Avalanche on Monday felt weird
for him too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down for a little nap just before I left for the game.
Seemed like once I woke up from the nap, it was really weird, it
was like reality: I was going to the rink and playing with another
club,'' Bourque said. ``Warm-up was probably the toughest part.
Seemed like I was just skating around, not really knowing what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of his 21 NHL seasons, Bourque has known exactly what to
do. He played for the Bruins. He was their best defenseman for
season after season. In none of those seasons did Bourque win a
Stanley Cup. He wasn't going to win one with them this season
either. The Bruins were already out of the playoffs. That fact led
to a coy conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he didn't want to leave, but he might ...
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins said they didn't want to trade him, but they would
...
</P>
<P>
   And then as quickly as you can say rent a player, Bourque was on
a plane to Colorado in pursuit of the one thing he couldn't get in
Boston. This wasn't about money. This wasn't about playing time.
This was about doing the one thing in hockey he hadn't done. Just
the pursuit of the Cup has energized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the biggest positive that's going to happen,''
Bourque said. ``I think it's a really exciting situation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Avs played the Edmonton Oilers and won with
Bourque scoring two goals. The teams are battling for the best
record in the Northwest Division and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs
that is likely to come along with it. These are the types of games
that Bourque hadn't been playing a lot of lately in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't seem right to see Bourque in anything except a
Bruins uniform. But, it sounds good. Bourque talks like a rookie
called up to the big club just before the playoffs when he talks
about his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much talent here. I've never played with a team
that has as much talent up front as we have here,'' Bourque said.
``You could go up and down that lineup. There are so many guys that
are so talented. I think it's going to be real enjoyable to play
here.''
ROAD TO THE STANLEY CUP
</P>
<P>
   The start of the Stanley Cup playoffs is four weeks away. Here's
a look at who's who and what's what on the path there:
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S HOT
</P>
<P>
   Montreal: Going into last night's game, they have the seventh
seed in the East with 70 points. Despite being the most injured
team they're now a playoff team
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Alexander Mogilny: Entering last night's game, he
had scored goals in the Canucks' past five games. He has helped
edge the Canucks back into the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S NOT
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes: One point away from dropping to third in
the Pacific Division. Don't look now, but isn't that the LA Kings
knocking at the door?
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Vincent Damphousse: Quiet like the rest of Sharks in
the second half. What happened to the guy we saw earlier in the
season?
</P>
<P>
   CUP FRONT-RUNNER
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues: OK, OK, so what happened to the part where
they were supposed to struggle at some point?
</P>
<P>
   CUP DARK HORSE
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Canadiens: OK, so they're a really long shot, but
just getting to the playoffs proves they're made of something.
</P>
<P>
   THE TOP 3
</P>
<P>
   The top three reasons to expect something big to happen between
now and Tuesday's NHL trade deadline:
</P>
<P>
   3. The Red Wings haven't done anything yet. And you know they're
going to do something.
</P>
<P>
   2. The St. Louis Blues still don't have depth on the blue line,
and they don't want to go into the playoffs without it.
</P>
<P>
   1. Don't the Philadelphia Flyers still need a goalie?
</P>
<P>
   HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we have to be pleased where we are right
now considering the number of injuries this year. If we go on all
of our cylinders, we'll be a tough team to beat. I think our game
is pretty solid all the way through right now.''

GIVE GEORGE W. HIGH MARKS FOR BEING A GOOD GUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Reeves, known to be a proud Democrat, dancer, shuffleboard
shooter, horseman and sports-page columnist, was having a chat one
day last summer with a high-level politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think I'm doing?'' asked George W. Bush, referring
to the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just fine,'' answered Revo. ``Just be yourself, and that will
be good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, this is extremely scary: the thought of one of us
giving advice to a man who could be president of the United States.
Molly Ivins, a newspaper hero of mine, is also sure to pounce on
that point about George W seeking an opinion from a what? A
sportswriter? Molly may never stop laughing, or drilling ``Shrub.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Revo also couldn't tell you the name of four world
leaders, he would serve, if asked, as Bush's running mate. Another
scary thought.
</P>
<P>
   Political affiliation aside, George W is still George W to any
local sports media rodents who covered the Rangers during the
baseball phase of Bush's life (1989-94). As the ownership frontman,
or managing general partner, of the Rangers, there was nothing
unusual about George W's relationship with us, meaning plenty of
disagreements and anger surfaced at times. But, along the way, a
case of trust developed, then something else. The very area that
Bush currently scores lowest in the political polls _ likability _
I'd say he topped out at 100 percent with any of us.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 or so local sportswriters (beat writers and
columnists) who dealt almost daily with Bush on baseball, the guess
is that at least eight tend to vote Democratic. But I don't know of
one who to this day doesn't label Bush as a ``good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that make for a good president? I doubt it, but it is
ironic that with Bush and Al Gore headed for a November showdown,
the political analysts keep coming back to how Bush is being
perceived, personalitywise.
</P>
<P>
   What does that little bemused smile mean? Is that arrogance? Is
he being snide?
</P>
<P>
   We saw the same thing, but it meant something different to us.
That smile came before he would nail you on a disputed baseball
point. Or after you had just nailed him. That smile was good.
</P>
<P>
   One day in the early '90s, Bush and his fellow owners announced
``The Ballpark in Arlington'' would be the name of the dream yard
being built just south of old Arlington Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and fellow owners Rusty Rose and Tom Schieffer walked into
the press box that night and Bush said, ``OK, how do the geniuses
like the new name?''
</P>
<P>
   Some did, some didn't. I was in the ``didn't'' category. ``OK,
Galloway,'' said Bush, briskly, ``exactly what would you have named
it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann Richards Field,'' came the reply. And Bush laughed the
loudest. He had, of course, just announced he was running for
governor against the popular Richards.
</P>
<P>
   George W truly liked the give-and-take game with the media. Now,
however, it's on a much bigger scale, against the heavyweights in
the national political media. The stakes are a tad higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, there's no doubt the baseball part of George's life was
great preparation for the governor's race, and now for all this,''
said Schieffer, who replaced Bush as managing general partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so much like holding public office. You have to develop
a public trust and there is the constant media pressure. It's
certainly not in the same league as being president, but it gives
you a taste of it. And George handled it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer also remembers the rocky start in 1989, beginning with
the media. Several different groups were bidding to buy the team
from Eddie Chiles, including one of Chiles' partners, Edward
Gaylord, who was the media's choice. But the commissioner's office
awarded the buying rights to the Bush group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general feeling of maybe George didn't deserve to
be an owner of the Rangers,'' said Schieffer, ``and that he was
nothing but a rich kid with a powerful daddy who made it happen. A
wariness from the media was evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as everyone got to know George, and dealt with him, that
did change. By the time he left to be governor, we all could see
George had been accepted by the media as being a genuine person who
loved baseball. Anyone who gets to know George will say he's a good
guy, and I think that will eventually come across nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   This column was not meant to be political commentary. I leave
that to Molly. It's just that there's some pride involved, seeing
George W in the national arena with the media, knowing it was some
of us who once hammered at him on such things as, ahem, deficit
spending.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, that idea of Revo for veep has some appeal, don't
you think? {Randy Galloway is a columnist for the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.}

IOWA STATE ROLLS PAST TEXAS TO WIN BIG 12 CROWN
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-TEXAS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A night of scattershooting ended Texas'
improbable journey one step short of a championship at the Big 12
women's basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Longhorns, who rarely found an open jumper they
couldn't make while knocking off two teams that shared the
regular-season title during the early rounds of the tournament,
could not extend that streak Saturday night against top-seed Iowa
State. The Cyclones' zone defense put the brakes on Texas' zone
busters, 75-65, at Municipal Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Texas turned in its worst shooting half in more than a month,
connecting on just 25.6 percent of its attempts before
intermission, and never recovered. It proved to be the Longhorns'
poorest shooting stretch since connecting on 24.1 percent in the
first half of a 73-44 loss at Texas Tech on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Longhorns began finding the range in the waning
minutes, they found themselves down by as many as 24 points in the
second half and were behind, 74-54, when Iowa State coach Bill
Fennelly pulled his starters en masse with 1:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the victory, the Cyclones (25-5) earned the
league's automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament. Texas (21-12), an
NCAA bubble team when the week began, will meet today with
expectations of being selected as an at-large team when the 64-team
women's bracket is announced at 4 p.m. on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard, but a better team won,'' said Texas coach Jody
Conradt, whose team played its fourth game in five nights. ``I'm
sure our legs were a little tired and that may have come into play
on some of the easy shots we missed. But that's not the reason we
lost. Their zone defense threw us off-stride. They shot the ball
well and we didn't. That's the reason we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Cyclones connected on 50.9 percent, including 59.3
percent during a second half in which Iowa State stretched a
10-point halftime lead to 74-50 behind the inside work of center
Angie Welle (17 points, 10 rebounds) and forward Desiree Francis
(19 points, 5 rebounds). Arguably, Welle and Francis did their best
work on the defensive end, keeping the clamps on Texas' leading
scorer, Edwina Brown, until the outcome was decided.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who finished with a game-high 23 points, connected on
just 2-of-13 shots in the first half. She scored 15 of her points
in the final seven minuts, when Iowa State was busy protecting a
20-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make her do everything off standstill jump
shots,'' said Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly. ``We tried not to let
her drive to the basket. I think we did a good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the tournament's most valuable player, mirrored her
team's 36-percent shooting night (9-of-25). She termed the outcome
``frustrating'' because the Longhorns fell short in their quest to
knock off all three league tri-champs in consecutive nights.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas forward Edwina Brown was selected as the most valuable
player of the Big 12 women's tournament. Brown finished four games
with 88 points, 42 rebounds, 27 assists and 11 steals.
</P>
<P>
   _ The women's championship game drew a crowd of 9,130, a
single-session record for the Big 12 tournament. Big 12 officials
said all tickets were sold and the turnstile count reflected 570
no-shows.

MOST EXCITING DAY IN SPORTS? INCLUDE SELECTION SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventh game of the World Series. Sunday at the Masters.
Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May. A heavyweight fight
at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. The NCAA Tournament's Final Four
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   All are worthy candidates for the best day in sports, a moment
in time where the palms sweat, the skin tingles and the heart races
with excitement and anticipation. It's why we're sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   All of the scenes mentioned above are fit for mental snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   But the following is submitted as evidence that today is one of
the most entertaining and exciting days in sports. This argument is
made even though this event isn't a competition.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 p.m., from a hotel room in Indianapolis, the NCAA will
announce its 2000 men's tournament bracket. From hoop heads to the
casual fan, it's a 30-minute made-for-TV production that has more
drama and excitement than the average mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a finite announcement,'' said Mountain West Conference
commissioner Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA men's basketball
tournament committee. ``The first everybody hears about the bracket
and the selections is when the announcement is made on CBS. In
essence, the entire college basketball world is tuned in and
waiting to hear what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It says here that staring at a blank, pristine NCAA Tournament
bracket can be an exhilarating experience. The opportunity to fill
in the blanks with 64 teams is an annual rite of spring. The
anticipation of who's in, who's out and who plays who provides the
same tingles that come seconds before tipoff for the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the Kentucky Derby, this is the most exciting two
minutes in sports,'' said Steve Weiberg, ``USA Today's'' college
writer, referring to the time it takes to scan a filled-in bracket.
``TV stretches it to 30 minutes. I don't think there's anything
else in sports where you have all the discussion and speculation
leading up to something _ who's in, who's out. There is nothing
like the week leading up to Selection Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the excitement from two areas _ who makes the field,
who doesn't and then who's playing who, which teams got sent
where.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, maybe the excitement of Bracket Day has been
overdramatized by television. ESPN's saturated coverage of college
basketball has heightened interest in the sport. In 1982, when CBS
gained the rights to the NCAA Tournament, it started televising a
selection show.
</P>
<P>
   CBS analyst Billy Packer remembers when he was working for NBC,
which televised the NCAA Tournament before CBS took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing a game in 1979 at the end of the season,'' he
recalled. ``Dick Enberg said, `Hey, let's call and find out who's
in the tournament.' During the course of the game, Al McGuire was
saying, `Well, so and so got in and this team didn't.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went over to CBS, I told them that we could make a show
out of the bracket announcement. It's really taken on a life of its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's another reason why Bracket Day has its own brand of
excitement. Once all 64 teams are assigned their lines, it's time
to start playing What If. ``Hey, what if Indiana and Duke make the
regional final, it'll be Knight against Krzyzewski. Wow, do you
think Princeton might be able to beat UCLA? Hmmmmm, Rhode Island's
guards might gave Kansas some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a year, you know it's coming and you spend weeks trying to
figure it out ahead of time,'' said Blair Kerkhoff, who covers
college sports for the ``Kansas City Star''. ``And yet, when it
happens, there's drama, you're still intrigued and surprised. After
you've scribbled all the teams down, you really have to catch your
breath and try to figure out what it all means.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1985, when the field expanded to 64 teams, the NCAA
bracket sings with symmetry. No messy first-round byes. Just four
regions of 16 teams, sub-divided in eight first-round sites. Win
two games the first weekend, two games the second and two at the
Final Four and you're a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country this afternoon, Blue Devils from Duke and
Central Connecticut State, Bulldogs from Butler to Fresno State
will gather to wait and watch the 2000 NCAA Tournament bracket
appear on their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day the bracket comes out is an exciting time if you're
having a good year,'' said Big 12 director of basketball operations
Kim Anderson. ``If you know you're in, you've got the excitement of
where you're assigned, who you'll play, who else is in your region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a bubble team, it can be jubilation or devastation.
You're sitting there waiting to see your name called. It can be
bittersweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, bittersweet. We like that.

ROUGH STUFF STARTS EARLY FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Kings didn't set a season-high for penalty
minutes in the first period Saturday against the Calgary Flames. It
only seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   After just 11 minutes, Ian Laperriere, Marko Tuomainen and even
captain Rob Blake were issued five-minute fighting penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting is part of Laperriere's job. He is among the league
leaders with 174 penalty minutes. But Tuomainen, who also plays on
the Kings checking line, was overwhelmed by Rene Corbet.
</P>
<P>
   Physical play, or the lack of it, has been an issue with the
club this season. Laperriere has no shortage of fighting spirit,
but he is just 6-foot-1, 200 pounds. Steve McKenna is 6-7, but the
rest of his game isn't strong enough for everyday duty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings claim no moves are expected by Tuesday's
trade deadline, a physical forward like Montreal's Shayne Corson
and Atlanta's Kelly Buchberger has been on their wish list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably saw more fights tonight that we've had in the last
month,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor said. ``You would like
to have a physical player up front, but you really can't afford to
have just a fighter for the playoffs. You can't afford to have him
off the ice this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a trend the past few seasons away from pure
fighters, affectionately known as goons. Among the league's elite
teams, St. Louis, New Jersey, Colorado and Florida do not employ
classic tough guys.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's slashing incident between former King Marty
McSorley, now with Boston, and Vancouver's Donald Brashear brought
public outcry against rough play. But fight videos played at arenas
during games remain popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a mixed message,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said.
``But I think you'll see the league continue to move away from
fighting. Skill players still sell the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 48 combined penalty minutes in the first period
Saturday, 22 by the Kings. The season-high this season is 69
penalty minutes, set Dec. 30 in an 8-2 victory over Edmonton. In
that game, the Oilers had 101. The Kings' season-low is four, done
twice including Feb. 14 against Calgary.

IN NCAA TOURNAMENT, FINAL SHOTS CAN LEAVE LASTING IMPRESSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Swishhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scene that is played out every day throughout America.
For almost any kid who takes a basketball to the neighborhood
playground, the dream of the last-second shot to win the national
title is a constant.
</P>
<P>
   The buzzer-beater has become the signature of a tournament that
has become the signature of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you envision is catching the ball out on the
perimeter and making a shot like that,'' former North Carolina
State player Lorenzo Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles is living proof that the shot that beats the buzzer in
an NCAA Tournament game can come from anywhere and in any fashion.
With Charles, it was a rebound and follow of a missed shot. But
they can be set up by a length-of-the-floor pass or a layup
following a length-of-the-floor dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Though such heroics sometimes are the result of well-designed
and practiced plays, the number of ways to produce a last-second
shot are limitless.
</P>
<P>
   From Charles' putback at the buzzer for N.C. State to Ulyesses
Reed's halfcourt shot that defeated Louisville, there's no formula
for game-winning heroics. Below are some of the most memorable:
A CHRISTIAN PRAYER
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Christian Laettner against Kentucky in the 1992 East
Regional final at The Spectrum in Philadelphia. It's the
buzzer-beater that everyone remembers.
</P>
<P>
   And here are a few things that should not be forgotten:
</P>
<P>
   _ Grant Hill threw the inbounds pass from his own baseline
three-quarters of the length of the floor. No one was guarding him,
double-teaming Laettner instead, a decision that invited media
debate toward Kentucky coach Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   _ The game was so emotional that forward Thomas Hill cried
uncontrollably on the court after Laettner's shot. Thomas Hill
played for the winning Duke team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laettner was the ``perfect'' person to get the ball for the
final shot. He finished the game 10-for-10 from the field and
10-for-10 from the free-throw line. THE GARBAGE MAN
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Charles was an unlikely person to make the final shot
for North Carolina State in the 1983 national championship game
against Houston at Albuquerque, N.M. His job on the team was to
gather loose balls and missed shots around the basket _ ``garbage''
_ and put it back in.
</P>
<P>
   If any tall man was going to standout in this game, it figured
to be Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon or Clyde Drexler _ who, while not
being big, jumped as if he were. Charles would never match the
future stardom of Houston's ``Phi Slamma Jamma,'' but his moment of
fame arrived when NC State guard Dereck Whittenburg's desperation
shot was an air ball.
</P>
<P>
   Charles snatched the ball in the air short of the basket, while
Olajuwon watched almost flat-footed, and jammed the ball through
the hoop to seal the title as time expired and Wolfpack coach Jim
Valvano ran, stunned, back and forth across the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job on the team that year was as a role player,'' Charles
said. ``My job was to bang the boards and put missed shots back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach V \RJim Valvano\S had diagrammed a play for one of the
perimeter players to penetrate to try to force Hakeem or one of
their big guys to commit,'' Charles said. ``I was battling for
position'' underneath the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was a battle he would lose. Someone _ Charles doesn't
remember who _ pushed him underneath the basket. It turned out to
be incredible luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing directly beneath the basket, and I could see
the ball was going to be short,'' Charles said. ``I saw the ball
better than anybody else. If Hakeem \ROlajuwon\S had the angle I
had, he wouldn't have been standing there.'' FATHER AND SON
</P>
<P>
   Indiana has Bobby Knight and the Hoosiers. Purdue. Notre Dame.
Even the legend of Larry Bird. And then there's tiny Valparaiso.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusaders lack tradition and power. But they made up for it
with possibly the craftiest buzzer-beater in NCAA Tournament
history. It was a play named ``Pacer'' designed by a father _ Valpo
coach Homer Drew _ for his son _ guard Bryce Drew.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusaders trailed by two points with less than five seconds
on the clock in an opening-round game against Mississippi in 1998.
The ball went inbounds to a Crusaders player, and Bryce Drew cut to
the ball. When he received it, he made a running 3-point shot at
the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't lead to a national title. Valpo was eliminated after
advancing to the Sweet 16. But it allowed Valparaiso to join its
bigger Indiana brothers in NCAA Tournament lore. LENGTH OF THE
COURT, I
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Brigham Young's Danny Ainge was about to have a
streak of 110 consecutive games of double-figure scoring come to an
end in a second-round game in 1981. Finally, late in the second
half against Notre Dame, he scored his 10th point.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars trailed 50-49 with less than 10 seconds
remaining when the Irish's Kelly Tripucka scored on a jump shot.
Ainge took the inbounds pass and hurriedly worked it down the floor
without passing to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge first took the ball past John Paxson, who had guarded him
so well for most of the game. Ainge switched hands and cut across
midcourt. He slid through Tripucka and Tom Sluby. He went around
Tim Andree and finally reached the lane where Orlando Woolridge was
waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up at least 6 inches in height, Ainge still was able to
get the shot off and over Woolridge's outstretched arm. It went in
with 2 seconds left, and time expired with a 51-50 BYU victory.
LENGTH OF THE COURT, II
</P>
<P>
   This was almost like Ainge revisited. But this was a game that
would send one team to the Final Four in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was a first-round failure earlier in the decade with losses
against Penn State and Tulsa. And Missouri was ahead by a point
with 4.2 seconds remaining in a second-round game in the West
Region.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins inbounded the ball to Tyus Edney. At not even
5-foot-11, Edney drove downcourt. He went into the heart of the
Missouri defense and scored on a falling, off-balance jump shot
over Mizzou interior defenders near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did UCLA advance to the Final Four, the Bruins won the
championship. HALFCOURT, U.S. STYLE
</P>
<P>
   The days of accurate outside shooters such as Sidney Moncrief,
Ron Brewer and Marvin Delph were over at Arkansas by 1981. In their
place was U.S. Reed and Darrell Walker, who led the Razorbacks into
the second round against defending champion Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had won 19 of 20 games heading into the tournament
and had four starters back from the national championship team. And
they led Arkansas 73-72 with 5 seconds left after Derek Smith's
fall-away jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The best shot Arkansas could get off was one from past the
midcourt line. Reed took it, and it went in at the buzzer. Arkansas
won 74-73 (it was the days before the 3-point shot).
</P>
<P>
   Though an improbable shot, this was nothing new for Reed. He had
made a similar shot from near halfcourt against Texas earlier in
the season. TWICE IS NICE
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 tournament game pitting Syracuse against Georgia, the
Orangemen needed two buzzer-beaters to keep moving toward the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   Their first one came when Jason Cipolla nailed a shot from the
corner at the buzzer to send the game into overtime. But the Orange
didn't finish this one off until John Wallace put down a 3-pointer
at the buzzer of the extra period for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse and coach Jim Boeheim advanced to the championship game
before losing to Kentucky. BEFORE THERE WAS LAETTNER
</P>
<P>
   UConn used to be the Boston Red Sox of college basketball. Make
the playoffs, then fold.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going swimmingly in 1990 when the Huskies reached
the Sweet 16. It looked even better when things went UConn's way
against Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   UConn trailed by 2 points to the Tigers with 1 second on the
clock. Scott Burrell threw a length-of-the-floor pass to Tate
George, who nailed a 3-pointer to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies turned back into the Red Sox in their next game,
losing to Duke in the East Regional final when Christian Laettner
hit a last-second shot for the victory. RO BEFORE DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   Before the Dallas Mavericks stockpiled all those first-round
draft picks in trades with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Rolando
Blackman was a star at Kansas State. Maybe the shot he made in the
second round of the 1981 NCAA Tournament caught the Mavs' eye, and
that was the reason Dallas eventually drafted Blackman with their
second first-round pick of the upcoming draft (Dallas took Mark
Aguirre with the first choice).
</P>
<P>
   K-State was the ninth seed in the West Region playing top-seeded
Oregon State. The Wildcats were behind the entire game until Ed
Nealy drew the fifth foul against OSU's Steve Johnson. Nealy made
both free throws to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State missed a free throw on the other end, and the
Wildcats got the ball to Blackman, who madea 16-foot jump shot at
the buzzer to give K-State a 50-48 victory. WHERE'S ESPN WHEN YOUR
NEED IT?
</P>
<P>
   Though many buzzer-beaters have been caught live by telecasts,
there's at least one notable buzzer-beater in the era before
constant TV. In 1962, no tournament games were covered live. The
final game was shown ``condensed'' in same-day coverage on ABC's
``Wide World of Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   So not many people saw a Final Four semifinal game between UCLA
and Cincinnati. The Bruins blew a 20-point lead and lost the game
when Cincinnati's Tom Thacker put up a line-drive outside shot that
won the game at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati went on to win the title game over an Ohio State team
that was without an injured Jerry Lucas, but still had John
Havlicek and Bobby Knight.

FOR ONE NIGHT, ALL WAS RIGHT AT REUNION ARENA ONCE MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For one night, Reunion Arena was rowdy again.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Blackman, this was your life.
</P>
<P>
   As his number ``22'' was raised to the rafters Saturday night,
Blackman wanted to thank them all, which was so typically Ro
Blackman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make it here alone,'' said the man whose style and
smile were the Dallas Mavericks' beacon for 12 seasons from
1981-92. ``I had help all along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   To honor Blackman and retire his jersey, the franchise had
staged a nostalgic reunion. There was former coach Dick Motta,
whose wisdom seems to grow with each passing losing season. There
was the original owner, Donald Carter, who had the selfless
patience to let the basketball people run the show.
</P>
<P>
   There was Norm Sonju who, as general manager, helped build what
was once, yes, a model NBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the old Mavericks themselves _ Mark Aguirre,
Derek Harper, Brad Davis, James Donaldson, Tom LaGarde, Scott Lloyd
and Randy White.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times,'' said Donaldson, who still plays
professionally in Grenada, Spain. ``I have carried these memories
of Dallas throughout the years. We had something special here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a classy, 20-minute ceremony, during which Blackman was
presented with gifts that ranged from a bag of Hogan golf clubs to
a Kawasaki motorcycle. The NBA, represented by Hall of Famer Bob
Lanier, presented Blackman with a $10,000 donation in his name to
the Children's Medical Center of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   To his wife Tamara, a local grocer presented a $1,000 shopping
spree. Blackman's children received passes entitling them to free
Big Macs and Slurpees for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved this,'' Aguirre said after the halftime ceremony. ``I
loved every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was smooth _ about as smooth as Ro.''
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat stunning coincidence _ some might say it was
simply the karma of the night _ the current-day Mavericks held off
the Phoenix Suns to win, 104-99, as Erick Strickland put on a
Blackman-like shooting spree and tallied 36 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they won the game,'' Blackman said, ever gracious.
``It helped make the night special.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. To longtime Mavericks fans, the walk down
Memory Lane had to be depressing. Donaldson, let me suggest, is
still the best center that the franchise has ever had. The three
guards _ Blackman, Harper and Davis _ helped carry the team to 55
victories in 1986-87 and regularly challenged the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   New owner Mark Cuban told the crowd, announced as a sellout,
that he remembered coming to watch the 1980s Mavericks and sitting
in the $5 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were an inspiration to us then, and you're an inspiration
now,'' Cuban told Blackman. ``I was a fan then, and I'm a fan now.
We will honor you forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Motta told a story about the first time that he saw Blackman
play. He drove from Kansas City to Manhattan, Kan., in a snowstorm
to watch Ro's Kansas State team play Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me this guy could really shoot,'' Motta recalled.
``They won by 18 points, and he took one shot. But there was
something about the gleam in his eye and the way he moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he walked out of that tunnel, I knew what I was going
to get. Ro was the epitome of consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 11 seasons with the Mavericks, Blackman averaged 19.2
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anybody would argue that he has been just a
tremendous person, on and off the basketball court,'' his old
backcourt mate, Harper, said. ``Ro is one of those guys that you
pick as someone you would want your son to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said what he remembers most about Blackman was his
eternally positive spirit. ``He was always up, always optimistic,''
Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Reunion replay board, a tape of Blackman highlights
scrolled by. The memories, the cheers, the Reunion rowdiness,
seemed such a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Cuban jokes with me and says that he has a plan to get
everything back, and that the new guys are going to put the '80s to
shame,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuban's dreams, perhaps. But whatever happens, Blackman's No.
22, now high in the rafters, will serve as a reminder. Once upon a
time, it reminds, this was a proud franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old song, they made Reunion Arena really want to shout.

FINLEY 3-POINTER LIFTS MAVERICKS PAST SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CALVIN WATKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Michael Finley made a 3-point basket and for a change,
Reunion Arena became real loud.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the fifth sellout crowd of the season _ 18,187 _
was here to celebrate the retiring of Rolando Blackman's jersey, it
was two current Mavericks players stealing some cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Finley's crucial 3-pointer and Erick Strickland's career-high 36
points led the Mavericks to a 104-99 victory against Phoenix on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended a season-high six-game losing streak for the
Mavericks. And it couldn't have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise honored Blackman at halftime by lifting his
jersey, No. 22, to the rafters in a moving halftime ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally inspired by Rolando when I went to his dinner
(Friday night),'' said Strickland, who made 11 of 19 field-goal
attempts. ``I just watched. It kinda broke me down to see how he
came through in this league. It gave me a newfound focus.''
</P>
<P>
   In a closely played fourth quarter, the Mavericks were able to
overcome four missed free throws in a 20-second span as they led
102-99.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we won this one,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   They won it despite shooting 41 percent from the field and
having their two main scorers, Finley and Dirk Nowitzki, shoot a
combined 12-for-27 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley provided the big 3-pointer when needed.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 99-99, Strickland missed a 15-foot jumper.
But Nowitzki grabbed the offensive rebound and found Finley
unguarded at the 3-point arc. He nailed the shot to give the
Mavericks a 102-99 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we rode Strickland on offense and
(Shawn) Bradley on defense,'' Nelson said. ``We played as hard as
we could. I don't think we played very well offensively, we
sputtered again, but it was one of those games that it really
didn't seem to matter.''
</P>
<P>
   After Finley's basket, both he and Strickland each missed two
free throws on consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   But when Greg Buckner blocked a 3-point shot from Anfernee
Hardaway, the Suns were forced to foul, and this time Finley made
two free throws with 6.6 seconds left to seal the victory. CEBALLOS
PLAYS
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Cedric Ceballos didn't start but did play
despite a broken pinkie on his left hand. Ceballos scored 11 points
in 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos was listed as questionable before the game. He has
missed only four games this season because of the flu or the finger
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke it in two places,'' Ceballos said after the game. ``I
have a bone that's floating in there and its also cracked right
down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos said he broke his pinkie about six weeks ago and has
been playing in pain. But a pass from Steve Nash in a game last
week made the pinkie worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos said he's not sure if he will need surgery after the
season. BRADLEY IS ALL-TIME SHOT BLOCKER
</P>
<P>
   With his five blocked shots Saturday night, Mavericks center
Shawn Bradley became the team's all-time leading shot blocker with
616 blocks. He surpassed James Donaldson's mark of 615. GUGLIOTTA
OUT FOR SEASON
</P>
<P>
   The Suns lost forward Tom Gugliotta for the season when he
injured his left knee in Friday night's loss to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta had complete ruptures of the anterior cruciate
ligament and the medial collateral ligament and damage to the
meniscal attachment.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Gugliotta averaged 13.7 points and 7.9 rebounds
per game. nn

RANGERS FORCING REALIGNMENT FOR 2002
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite winning three American League West titles in four years,
despite having the AL MVP three of the past four years, the Rangers
barely create a blip on the national radar.
</P>
<P>
   Rare is a Rangers game that is televised nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Rarer still is a member of the national media making an
appearance at the Rangers' spring-training camp. Many make the trek
to Sarasota, Fla., and Fort Myers for the obligatory Ken Griffey
Jr. and Pedro Martinez stories, but apparently few realize the
Toledo Blade Boulevard exit, about halfway between the two cities
on Interstate 75, would lead them to Port Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than five weeks, though, the Rangers will
command the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's owners meet in Houston on April 18, and are almost
certain to approve a realignment plan for the 2001 season that will
clear the way for an unbalanced schedule to allow teams to play
more games against divisional foes.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind realignment is the local major-league
baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, baseball doesn't need to realign to implement an
unbalanced schedule. Morally, though, it must.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were put at a geographical disadvantage in 1994,
when the expansion Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies entered the
majors and the sport realigned. The AL West went from a seven-team
division that included the Chicago White Sox, Kansas City Royals
and Minnesota Twins, to a four-team division with the Rangers,
California (now Anaheim) Angels, Oakland Athletics and Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers president Tom Schieffer lobbied hard to move the
Rangers out of the division, logically arguing that when an
unbalanced schedule was implemented the club would be damaged
financially. The number of late-night games on the West Coast, two
time zones away, would mean lower TV and radio ratings, and thus
lower broadcast-rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer was promised the Rangers would be moved, but it didn't
happen when the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays
necessitated realignment when they joined the majors in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we can get to an unbalanced schedule is to
resolve the problem of the Texas Rangers,'' said Boston Red Sox
chief executive officer John Harrington, chairman of the
schedule-format committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers will move to the AL Central, with the
Diamondbacks replacing them in the AL West by moving from the NL
West. To keep the current 16-14 breakdown, Tampa Bay goes to the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo doesn't want to change
leagues because he fears the financial repercussions. Fan surveys
have shown the paying customers prefer the Senior Circuit. But he
has no choice. Arizona and Tampa Bay both agreed when they were
awarded franchises that they could be moved without their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements remain to be worked out. Commissioner Bud Selig
said the eventual realignment may contain ``some surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise, though, already has been revealed. The
oft-ignored Rangers are the engine powering the whole thing.
SPOTLIGHT ON: DOC GOODEN
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker was trying to explain how
his team could trade 22-game winner Mike Hampton and still have a
solid rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds, he said, is as solid as any pitcher in baseball.
It's no fluke that Jose Lima won 21 games last year. Scott Elarton
has ace-type stuff. Chris Holt is more than a year removed from
shoulder surgery and should be much better.
</P>
<P>
   And the fifth starter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc Gooden is our sleeper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden indeed was a sleeper going into camp. He signed a
minor-league contract after going 3-4 with a 6.26 earned-run
average for the Indians last season.
</P>
<P>
   But after giving up only four hits and three runs in his first
seven spring innings, he might be emerging from his hibernation. He
retired the first 12 batters he faced, but the Dodgers got to him
for three runs in three innings Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's written him off, and at age 35 he hasn't shown much
to suggest there's a whole lot there,'' Hunsicker said. ``But
knowing Doc, seeing the shape that he's come into camp, knowing the
competitive fire is still there and knowing that he's fighting for
a job and maybe his career, I like those kind of intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking him to come in here and be the ace and win 15
games. We're asking him to be the fifth starter and win eight to 10
games, and I think that's doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, manager Larry Dierker is asking a bit more. He
realizes Gooden isn't the same pitcher who looked like a future
Hall of Famer when he went 24-4 with a 1.53 ERA for the Mets in
1985, his second season in the majors. But he challenged Gooden not
to be content to be the No. 5 starter, but to be the No. 3 guy
behind Reynolds and Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what he's accomplished in his career, we know he's not
going to go out and get shook up,'' Dierker said. ``He's been a
starter all of his career, so we know he's going to have some
poise.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely accept the challenge,'' he said. ``I feel good,
and the shoulder feels fine, so it should work out.''
WELCOME TO DEION
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Sean Casey became a Deion Sanders fan the first
day the former Cowboys cornerback arrived at the Reds' camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion's great,'' Casey said. ``He brings instant respect as
soon as he walks into the clubhouse, but also he's just a great
guy. His humility and his faith in God really shows in the way he
carries himself in his life. He's a special person.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a different person than Casey expected, given Sanders'
public persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Casey said. ``You see two different things. You
see Prime Time, and then you see just Deion. He has his flair when
he gets out there on the field, and he's the best at what he does,
whether it's baseball or covering the best receivers out there.
When you get to know him, he's a little different from some of the
interviews you've seen over the years.'' AROUND THE HORN
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cubs want Kerry Wood to abandon his slider, the pitch
responsible for most of his 20 strikeouts against Houston two
seasons ago, to lessen stress on his surgically repaired elbow.
Wood doesn't necessarily agree. ``They think I can get people out
with fastball, curve and changeup,'' he said. ``But I don't think
the slider is a pitch I can abandon. We will shorten it up and make
it less stressful on the elbow, but I can't throw it out the
window.''
</P>
<P>
   _ John Smoltz's season-ending elbow injury reduces the
once-formidable Braves rotation to three solid pitchers. Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine and Kevin Millwood are as good as anyone's top
three, but now there's a huge drop off. Terry Mulholland, who was
supposed to pitch out of the bullpen, becomes the fourth starter.
Bruce Chen, Steve Avery and Derrin Ebert are the fifth-starter
candidates. General manager John Schuerholz said he and manager
Bobby Cox will evaluate the rotation and decide whether to pursue a
trade for another starter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cubs manager Don Baylor assigned Jeff Huson to the minors when
both were with Colorado in '97, and Huson asked Baylor if he had a
future in the game. ``If he would've said, `No, I don't think you
can play anymore,' I would've been done,'' Huson said. ``That's how
much I value his opinion.'' Three years later, Huson is reunited
with Baylor in the Chicago Cubs' camp and has a good chance to win
a job as a utility infielder.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Sox reliever Rod Beck did not look ready to claim the
closer's job during his first outing of the spring. He threw 12
fastballs and, according to one scout's radar gun, topped out at 85
mph (four times). The other eight were measured at 84.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free-agent-to-be Manny Ramirez evidently won't be signing a
contract extension with the Indians anytime soon. GM John Hart told
agent Jeff Moorad they would sign Ramirez to a Ken Griffey-like,
below-market deal if he wants to stay in Cleveland. Moorad, who was
in camp last week, indicated it will take more than the $14.5
million per season the Dodgers are paying fellow right fielder (and
fellow Moorad client) Shawn Green to keep Ramirez in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Expos plan to leave the small-market blues behind. They
expect to break ground for a new ballpark in April and expect it to
open for the 2002 season. By then, they hope to have their payroll
in the $50 million range.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giants have set an attendance record before playing a game
in their new, 40,800-seat, Pacific Bell Park. As of Tuesday, only
50,000 reserved seat tickets remained for the season, not counting
the 500 bleacher seats set aside for walk-up traffic every game.
Attendance easily will exceed 3 million. The previous mark was
2,606,354 in 1993. THE FINAL WORD
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of interleague play revolves around the
geographical rivalries. The two Chicago teams, the two New York
teams, Anaheim-LA. I would welcome that opportunity with the
Rangers. I think it would be great for the state of Texas.'' _
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker, on the possibility of the
Rangers going to the AL Central and playing Houston in interleague
play nn

KINGS HOLD OFF FLAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time of year, the Kings only care about games
won, not opportunities lost.
</P>
<P>
   But as the opponents get tougher in the final month, it might be
hard to forget their slumping power play, which could have made
Saturday night's 3-1 victory over the Calgary Flames a whole lot
easier.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center saw the Kings
complete a four-game sweep of the Flames and solidify their sixth
spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But for the third consecutive game, the Kings did not score with
the man advantage. Four times during that span, including twice
against Calgary, the Kings had a five-on-three advantage and didn't
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who close out their season-long seven-game homestand
Monday night against Vancouver are 3-2-1 in the first six games.
That could be better if they weren't 0 for 16 and 2 for the last 32
with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play is what wins playoff games,'' captain Rob Blake
said. ``It just has to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   They did get first-period goals from Ziggy Palffy and Craig
Johnson, who beat Flames goaltender Grant Fuhr in his first start
since mid-November when he went out with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jarome Iginla scored midway through the second, it
became anyone's game. Aki Berg gave the Kings a little room when he
scored with 11:28 to go in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames entered the game just three points behind San Jose
for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference,
but were coming off dismal losses against Colorado (8-3) and
Toronto (6-2).
</P>
<P>
   They cut the Kings lead to 2-1 midway through the second period
on a goal by Jarome Iginla, who was NHL Player of the Month for
February.
</P>
<P>
   Iginla, who had a league-high 16-game scoring streak stopped by
the Avalanche, took a long pass in front from Phil Housley and
poked it past Jamie Storr for his 24th goal of the season. Iginla
had 28 all last year.
</P>
<P>
   Again the Kings power play failed them from holding off the
Flames. With 4:03 remaining in the second and Derek Morris already
off for cross checking, former Duck Bobby Dollas was whistled for
holding the sti ck.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Kings a five-on-three advantage for one minute and
31 seconds. They didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who outshot the Flames 38-25, emerged from a physical
start (seven fighting penalties in the first 11 minutes) with a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr was making his first start after missing 25 games with a
knee injury and faced 14 shots in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy scored first at 12:19 when he skated across the Flames
crease as Rob Blake fired from the slot. The rebound popped out and
Palffy slipped it under Fuhr's right pad for his 26th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Palffy, Johnson rarely gets to show off his offense. But
with less than two minutes left in the period, he and Ian
Laperriere converged in front of the Calgary goal. The puck landed
on Johnson's stick and he slid it between Fuhr's legs for his ninth
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But without the power play, the Kings could not pull away. The
first five-on-three came at 14:04 of the first when Eric Charron
went off for roughing. Darryl Shannon already was in the box from
cross checking , but the Kings couldn't capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, they limited the Flames to just three shots in the
period, but the lost opportunity could have been more critical.

THE BAD NEWS BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Good game. Great guys.
</P>
<P>
   The catchy marketing phrase that ushered the Bruins into the
1999-2000 season with such promise could be summed up best this
morning by a forlorn Charlie Brown, dragging behind him a tattered
black-and-gold pennant:
</P>
<P>
   Caption: Good grief!
</P>
<P>
   Something not so funny happened on the way to the Stanley Cup
finals _ Boston's destination, as forecast in an August issue of
Sports Illustrated. Not only was there no playoff berth, but the
Bruins so badly lost their way, their play so thoroughly inept and
hopeless, that their revered team captain traded his sweater last
week for a devil-may-care flyer with the temptress that is Lord
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades-plus later, Ray Bourque finds himself a proud member
of the Colorado Avalanche, working with the best surrounding cast
he's ever had, beyond his Canada Cup and Olympic dalliances. On his
way out of town, he also fired the heaviest shot of his career,
labeling Boston a city in which few NHLers would want to play,
expressing his frustration with both management and ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The step-back view here is not pretty. For the second time in
four seasons, the Bruins will miss the playoffs, leaving them with
but one postseason series victory since 1994. In an interview at
his Buffalo office last week, club owner Jeremy Jacobs said there
soon will be changes in the way his team operates, and, based on
the rising rhetoric he detects from the fan base, he worries about
a possible downturn at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   It's all somewhat hard to believe for a team that less than a
year ago was poised for takeoff, looking young, vibrant, and
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry (Sinden) and I, we both have said to each other
recently, `Who would have thought we'd be talking about these kinds
of things?' '' said Jacobs, sorting through the pitfalls and
disasters this season. ``We never saw this hit on the radar screen
coming. I think we are still a very talented team. I think the kids
we have have really underperformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs is right. The young, talented players, almost without
exception, have been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is, why?
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from what Jacobs says and how management has acted,
specifically in recent weeks, that Pat Burns will not be back to
fulfill the fourth year of his contract as head coach. The blame
almost certainly will fall to him. The parts should have performed
better, management will say. Another Boston coached sacked. From
Rick Bowness (one year), to Brian Sutter (three years), to Steve
Kasper (two years), and now to Burns, most of the past decade has
brought little fortune to Causeway Street and an abundance of hasty
adieus for the men who have stood behind the Boston bench.
</P>
<P>
   As in any game, the coach is always an issue. But to implicate
Burns as the root cause of most, or even much, of what has gone
wrong with the Hub's hockey team would be, at the very least,
shortsighted. Three years ago, he was viewed as part of the
solution. Now he's looked upon, by ownership and management, as
most of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has his foibles, just as he has his strengths. He clearly
needed to vary the game plan when it became painfully obvious in
the first nine games of the season (0-5-4) that too much was made,
said, and written based on last year's postseason victory over the
Carolina Hurricanes. When another bout of the blahs hit in late
November _ this time with no antidote _ it was some six weeks
before Burns attempted a more up-tempo game. His approach, so
successful for two seasons, wasn't working. September's blue skies
had given way to a horizon full of funnel clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new scheme would have improved results. However, by
the time it was rolled out, far too much else was blowing up.
Disruptions began on a near-daily basis, ranging from an array of
season-ending injuries befalling key players _ Jason Allison, Anson
Carter, and Byron Dafoe _ to the bizarre firing of Joe Murphy and
the season-ending suspension of Marty McSorley for his two-handed
chop on Donald Brashear's head.
</P>
<P>
   But the footprint for much, if not most, of what has gone wrong
this season was laid last summer, when the state of semi-euphoria
following the playoffs led Sinden and Mike O'Connell to
overestimate the team's talent base and do next to nothing to add
to the roster. The offseason shopping began and ended with the
acquisition of 36-year-old Dave Andreychuk. When it was obvious the
talent was not what was billed, there were hurried acquisitions of
rent-a-wrecks Murphy and McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk, after a sensational start, turned into a nonfactor
by early December and was cashiered in last Monday's trade that
shipped Bourque to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who appeared troubled and agitated in his short time
here, produced little and was discharged after showering Burns with
one too many expletives.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, a congenial but tired warhorse, earned marks of
willingness but displayed little effectiveness. He now faces jail
time, if convicted of assault charges brought last week by the
Crown Counsel in British Columbia. Brashear was left with a
concussion. The league was left with a black eye. The Bruins, once
more, were left with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Sinden and O'Connell went 0 for 3 in the
player-acquisition department. On top of that, they also lost
center Tim Taylor, their defensive specialist, to free agency and
became the first franchise in NHL history to exercise free agency
``walkaway'' rights, opting not to pay Dmitri Khristich a $2.8
million arbitration award. He packed for Toronto and the Bruins got
a draft pick _ whose goals and assists may not be a factor for
another three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the summer, veteran winger Ken Baumgartner and
defenseman Dave Ellett were released, the last years of their
contracts bought out.
</P>
<P>
   The total on all those comings and goings: four veterans out,
three brought in _ and not a single one left in uniform today.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all that wouldn't add up to disaster if the remaining young
base, including returnees as well as farmhands and draft picks, was
enough to recharge the product. Obviously, that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Carter and Allison remained healthy the entire season,
the point production up front was challenged. Joe Thornton's
numbers improved, but his overall game plateaued. Sergei Samsonov
(Jacobs: ``There's a better player in there'') showed only bits and
pieces of the sensational style that made him Rookie of the Year in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque turned 39 in December and his game, for the first time,
grew gray around the temples. So bad were the club's fortunes that
Burns was still playing Bourque 25-30 minutes a night, a cruelty
printed in black-and-white for all to see in the game summaries. In
the midst of Bourque's struggles _ or perhaps contributing to them
_ the games of Kyle McLaren and Hal Gill fell down around him. One
of the few bright lights of the year _ perhaps the only one _ was
the tough, determined, and consistent play of backliner Don
Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   In net, Dafoe, after a one-month holdout, only briefly showed
reliable shot-blocking after returning in November. In a game plan
as simple as the one employed by Burns, with top defensive play and
netminding a must, too many holes add up to too many losses and
ties.
</P>
<P>
   The season that went nowhere is first and foremost about talent
_ rather, the lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   Good game. Great guys.
</P>
<P>
   Just not enough of them.
</P>

UCONN SWEPT AWAY

 EAST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One night they were embattled St. John's teammates
who had plunged their team into turmoil on the eve of the Big East
tournament final. But Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, all was well with Erick
Barkley and Marvis ``Bootsy'' Thornton, the combatants of a
reported locker room altercation during halftime of Friday night's
semifinal victory over Miami.
</P>
<P>
   One night they were trading fists, angry glares, and angrier
words.
</P>
<P>
   The next it was nothing but love and high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a night and one team meeting make.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who opted not to follow through with his plan to take a
leave of absence from the team, and Thornton combined for 41 points
to lead third-seeded St. John's to its first Big East title since
1986 with an 80-70 victory over No. 4 seed Connecticut in the
conference tournament final at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, voted the tourney's Most Outstanding Player, led the
Red Storm (24-7) to their third victory over UConn (24-9) this
season by scoring a team-high 22 points on 9-of-14 shooting,
including 4 of 6 from 3-point range, while Barkley added 19 points
(6-for-10 shooting), 3 rebounds, and 3 assists. Anthony Glover,
whose two clutch free throws clinched Friday night's win, had 15
points, while Lavor Postell, who joined Barkley and Thornton on the
all-tournament team, had 14 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never fell apart,'' Thornton said. ``We had an argument,
but it was nothing. It was just between two competitive guys.
Tonight we just sucked it up and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I got a lump in my throat, but I'm not gonna cry,'' said
Barkley. ``It feels great, going through what I've been through.
I'm just trying to play basketball for St. John's.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Red Storm never lost focus in a season rife with
distractions served as a testament to the amazing job done by coach
Mike Jarvis, the former Boston University and Cambridge Rindge &AMP;
Latin mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in my heart that all would be resolved,'' said
Jarvis as he stood on the Garden floor and proudly watched his
players cut down the nets. ``I have a bracelet with the initials
W.W.J.D. It stands for, `What Would Jesus Do?' We had a team
meeting today before practice and I wrote those intials on the
chalkboard and I asked each player `What would Jesus do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When it got around to Anthony Glover, the kid who made the two
free throws (against Miami), he said, `Jesus would forgive.' Then
when it got to Chudney Gray, he said, `All is forgiven now. Let's
go out and be a team again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what it took for the Red Storm to avenge an
82-63 loss to UConn in last year's championship game. St. John's
denied the Huskies, who were playing their fourth game in as many
nights, their third straight Big East title and snapped UConn's
nine-game winning streak in tourney play.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Mouring led UConn with 22 points on 7-for-16 shooting,
including 6 of 11 from 3-point range, while foul-plagued Khalid
El-Amin added 13 points and freshman guard Tony Robertson had 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies trailed by as many as 12, 36-24, in the first half
when Thornton drained a 3-pointer with 2:38 to go. The Huskies, who
made only two field goals in the final 6:38, ended a scoreless
drought of 4:22 when Mouring hit two free throws to make it 36-26.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's held a 37-28 halftime lead, so there was little
concern that Barkley and Thornton would be at each other's throats
again. But if UConn had any intention of winning its third straight
title, the Huskies were going to need a better showing in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, unlike Friday night's game when he was three
minutes late for the second half, Barkley showed up on time and
scored St. John's first two baskets, including a 3-pointer that
gave the Red Storm a 42-33 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies managed to pull within 46-41 on Robertson's jumper,
but UConn unraveled when El-Amin picked up his fourth personal with
12:27 left. Thornton and Postell combined to score 9 in a 10-2 run
that enabled St. John's to build a commanding 15-point lead, 58-43,
with 10:41 to go. But UConn refused to go away, using a 15-4 run to
rally within 64-58.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, though, staved off the Huskies for a title that did
not seem probable the night before.

RED SOX VISIT TO DOMINICAN IS SYMBOLIC 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ You know how somebody looks
familiar but you just can't quite connect the man and the moment?
That's how it was at the very nice pregame reception thrown by
United States ambassador to the Dominican Republic Charles Manett
and his staff Sunday. In the middle of the hubbub, there was this
very impressive-looking middle-aged gentlemen with a familiar look
wearing a Houston Astros cap.
</P>
<P>
   And then someone says to you, ``Would you like to meet Rico
Carty?''
</P>
<P>
   You kidding? Rico Carty? A man who might as well have the name
Senor Line Drive to commemorate all the bullets he knocked out in
both leagues?
</P>
<P>
   We are kind of used to the idea that in modern baseball
Dominicans rule. But it wasn't always thus. First, there were the
Cubans, followed by the Mexicans, and then the Puerto Ricans. The
San Francisco Giants came down here in the mid-'50s and came away
with the great Juan Marichal, not to mention an entire Alou family.
And right there in the forefront of this Dominican-friendly
takeover of baseball was Rico Carty, a righthanded masher of the
first degree.
</P>
<P>
   Marichal got himself into Cooperstown without the bother of
buying a ticket. He is now the Dominican's Secretary of Sports and
in that capacity he represented his country's administration at the
embassy ceremony. Carty was present to help promote the idea of a
Dominican sports Hall of Fame, which in this country basically
means a Dominican baseball Hall of Fame. Toward that end, an
18-item Baseball Hall of Fame exhibit featuring artifacts connected
with some of the great Dominican ballplayers is on display at the
American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have the slightest idea when I came up that there
would someday be this many Dominicans in the big leagues,'' Carty
said. ``If you had asked me if it would ever come to this, I would
have said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Sutton was once famously quoted as saying that he robbed
banks because ``that's where the money is,'' and that's the basic
reason the Red Sox, along with the Astros, are part of this two-day
major league excursion to Quisqueya Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it as great exposure for us,'' said Red Sox vice
president John Buckley. ``This is a chance to promote the Red Sox.
We were the first ones to raise our hands and say, `We'll go,' when
Major League Baseball was looking for volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Duquette joined the Red Sox five years ago, the
organization had, by his estimation, ``1 or 2 percent Dominican
players.'' And now? ``It's near 30 percent,'' he said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   At the big league level, the prominent Red Sox players of
Dominican extraction thus far have come via trades or free agency.
That would mean the likes of Tony Pena, Pedro Martinez, Ramon
Martinez, and Jose Offerman. We are just getting a glimpse of this
regime's Dominican harvest when we look at impressive young third
baseman Wilton Veras and promising righthander Juan Pena.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox now have a baseball academy in the Dominican, and
with Pedro as a marquee signing, they have strengthened their
influence in this most critical of all baseball venues. And
speaking of Marichal, Duquette said every Red Sox fan owes him a
great deal of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Marichal was one of the key advisers when Pedro decided
to sign with us after we made the trade,'' Duquette explained.
``Pedro respects him greatly, and he signed with us on that
recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget Marichal, known in his prime as the Dominican
Dandy, passed through the Red Sox portals as he was making his way
out of the big leagues. He was once even part of a memorable 1974
Sunday doubleheader pairing with Luis Tiant. Whoever would have
thought that this brief Red Sox experience one day would prove so
significant in the history of the organization?
</P>
<P>
   After years of neglect in the area of Caribbean recruitment,
Duquette has the Red Sox as proactive as anybody. Doing so was a
major priority when he took the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from our experience in Montreal how important
international recruiting was to anyone's developmental program,''
said Duquette. ``If you're a good team, year in and year out, this
is what you have to do. This is a good time for the Red Sox to be
in the Dominican.''
</P>
<P>
   For any serious baseball organization, any time is a good time
to be in the Dominican. If you can also play a ballgame here on a
nice sunny afternoon, so much the better.

BACK-TO-BACK WINS FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Inspired isn't a word that's been used to describe
the Bruins very often this year.
</P>
<P>
   The season has been defined by strife, disappointment, and
controversy. However, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's 5-3 victory over the
Montreal Canadiens at the Molson Centre was a credit to the young,
patchwork Boston lineup, whose primary goal will be to play spoiler
against playoff-bound opponents down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who won back-to-back games for the first time since
Jan. 19-20, when they beat Atlanta and Tampa Bay, did a pretty good
job against the Habs, who are trying to claw their way into
contention for the remaining postseason berths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of pressure on us,'' said Bruins coach Pat
Burns. ``The pressure is on the other teams. The more we win games,
the more the pressure is not on us. It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the Bruins debut of right wing Mike Knuble, who
joined the team after being dealt from the New York Rangers Friday
night for right wing Rob DiMaio. Knuble played on a line with left
wing P.J. Axelsson and newcomer Brian Rolston, who joined the team
in Buffalo after coming from Colorado in the Ray Bourque deal.
</P>
<P>
   Knuble set up the winning goal, which was scored by Rolston on
the man-advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Rob Tallas, who thought he'd be backing up John Grahame,
was pressed into service when Grahame went down with a shoulder
injury Friday night against Carolina. Tallas made many tough stops,
picking up his first win since Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens struck first, scoring at the three-minute mark.
Craig Darby, positioned in the right circle, potted his sixth of
the season after he took a centering pass from Patrick Poulin and
beat Tallas with a high shot.
</P>
<P>
   That lead lasted only a little more than a minute. Boston's most
impressive line in the early going was Shawn Bates, Cameron Mann,
and Mikko Eloranta. It was Mann who pulled the Bruins even at 4:18,
beating goalie Jose Theodore with a backhander between the pads.
</P>
<P>
   At 18:59, Mann dropped the gloves with one of Montreal's peskier
players, Shayne Corson. The more experienced Corson got the better
of the shots, but Mann held his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Bruins took the lead less than two
minutes in when Bates made a nice move on Theodore. Eric Nickulas
feathered a pass from the right side to Bates heading down the
slot. Bates beat Theodore with a backhander inside the right post
at 1:48.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens roared back to tie it, 2-2, at 5:47 when Martin
Rucinsky beat Tallas on a breakaway with a backhand flip shot.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had plenty of scoring chances. At 13:46, it was Antti
Laaksonen's turn. His first shot was stopped by Theodore, but
Laaksonen picked up the rebound in his skates, kicked the puck to
his stick, and cashed in on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   After Theodore made a terrific stop on Eloranta, the Habs came
back the other way and defenseman Sheldon Souray made it a 3-3 game
at 18:52. Souray, in the right circle, pulled up and fired a shot
between defenseman Kyle McLaren and Mann that appeared to glance
off Tallas before landing in the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, who suffered as a result of injuries early in the
season and struggled mightily until getting healthy again, were
dealt a blow when center Saku Koivu went down with a left knee
injury in the second period and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went back on top to stay with a power-play goal at
2:13 of the third. Knuble, positioned behind the net, relayed a
pass to Rolston, who was along the inside edge of the right circle.
Rolston fired an off-balance shot and it beat Theodore between the
pads.
</P>
<P>
   It brought a rare but genuine smile from coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have not been eliminated from the playoff race.
There's still a glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible,'' said Burns. ``You never know at this
time of the year. Usually the teams that aren't really in the hunt
for the playoffs are the dangerous ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton added an empty-net goal with 26.1 seconds left.

O'CONNELL CONCEDES MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are a million and one reasons the Bruins went
south this season. No one factor has been overwhelming. There have
been wrong decisions, wrong personnel, wrong chemistry, wrong
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jeremy Jacobs has been publicly critical of coach Pat
Burns and players such as underachieving Sergei Samsonov while
supporting the job that president/general manager Harry Sinden and
assistant GM Mike O'Connell are doing. But, truth be told, there's
plenty of culpability on their part.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to rate the job management has done this season,
O'Connell paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough question,'' he said. ``But I think you'd have
to say we failed. We haven't done very well. It's easy to sit back
now and look at it. We thought we'd have as good a chance as anyone
to make another step in the right direction and it didn't work.
Going into the season, we all had such high hopes. It didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell doesn't understand the perception that he is the one
who would like to get rid of Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why that's been portrayed that way,'' he said.
``I've been away. I haven't been around the team. That's not the
truth. It's odd. If I'm around the team too much, I'm meddling, and
if I'm not around the team, I'm sour on the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connell, who soon will take over the GM title and has
already assumed most of the duties, wouldn't endorse Burns, who is
in the final year of his contract. Even Jacobs said he thought
O'Connell was more ``reactionary'' than Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he felt that was true, O'Connell said, ``I'm a
pretty patient guy. I don't know if reactionary, if I am that or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he understands the fans' anger and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching this team,'' he said. ``I know what it
means to the community and how the town reacts to the team. I feel
for the fans. As bad as this season has gone, if you look back at
the start of the season, I don't think anybody thought we'd go
through this. We didn't think so, either. I think we were realistic
about our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people picked us to go to the Stanley Cup finals. We
thought that would be nice but there are a lot of things that would
have had to happen. Going forward, we have every bit of a chance
next year to have the success people thought we'd have this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, said O'Connell, this season is worse than 1997,
when the Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in 30 years.
In other ways, he doesn't think it's as bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``From '97 to the end of last year, (the turnaround) happened
pretty quick,'' he said. ``No one ever expected us to turn it that
quick, to have an old team that looked like it had nothing. To turn
it around to one of the top teams in the league in a matter of 18
months, it startled a lot of people, and maybe it was too much, too
soon. Maybe these are growing pains we need to live with and
hopefully players and coaches and management will learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   When management was preparing for this season, it had great hope
that everything would come together. Instead, things blew up in
their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like no matter what was done, it didn't work,''
said O'Connell. ``Whatever was said, it didn't work. Whoever was
quoted, it seemed like it worked against everything. It hasn't been
an easy season. There have been fires here and fires there and it's
taken its toll. You look at (Joe) Murphy and (Marty McSorley) and
that just didn't work. And Dave Andreychuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you looked at the team at the start of the year, we
showed some promise. Then, bang, one thing led to another. How
Byron (Dafoe's) holdout affected the psyche of the team. All of a
sudden, he gets back and John Grahame was playing well and we send
him down, how that affects the team. We bring in Murphy and
McSorley and how that affects the team and then injuries. The
difference between winning and losing in this game is so close. It
just seemed like we were always on the wrong side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell acknowledged the team was adversely affected by the
number of players who missed training camp, but because of the
players' salary demands, it couldn't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make a difference, especially for goaltenders,'' he
said. ``It's hard, but the players have to make the decision as
well as us. The easiest thing for us to do is to just pay whatever
they want. We've never made unrealistic offers to people. I think
they're very fair, very well thought out. We research almost
everything we do extensively. If both parties are realistic, a deal
will get done.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, O'Connell said, the Bruins are trying to re-sign
right wing Anson Carter, who had wrist surgery Friday. O'Connell is
trying to get Carter's agent, Pat Brisson, to cut to the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an initial introduction to the area,'' said O'Connell.
``I still haven't seen any hard numbers. I'm going to call him back
and thank him for that and say please get to the numbers. I know
Anson as well as his agent does and who makes what and where he
should fit. So, we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player they'd like to keep happy is veteran defenseman
Don Sweeney, who was the Bruins' most consistent player. Sweeney is
due to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season.
O'Connell said Sinden is talking to Sweeney's agent, Mark Witkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to keep him,'' said O'Connell. ``He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fallout from a dreadful year that, mercifully, is
almost over, O'Connell said he's looking forward to taking over the
GM's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more difficult it is, the greater the challenge,'' he
said. ``I'm not ready to play bingo yet.''
</P>
<P>

   The Buffalo Sabres were busy last week bolstering their lineup.
In addition to acquiring center Chris Gratton from Tampa Bay
Thursday, the Sabres picked up Chicago center Doug Gilmour Friday.
Gilmour knew he was going somewhere, but it was difficult waiting
for the other shoe to drop. ``It's hard knowing all they want to do
is move you,'' said Gilmour, who is sidelined with bruised ribs. He
will be paid $6 million this year and next, and the Blackhawks will
pick up a good portion of that . . The McSorley incident continues
to raise questions. Should he be punished outside the realm of the
NHL? Will he be found guilty in a court of law? Former Islanders
great Denis Potvin and two-time Lady Byng winner Marcel Dionne
weighed in. ``When you enter the NHL, you know if a guy
sucker-punches me on the ice, I have to deal with that in my own
way,'' said Potvin. ``The game deals with it in its own way. If a
guy sucker-punches me on (the street), that's a totally different
thing. Where do you draw the line? I think the NHL did the right
thing and I'd rather not see it go any farther.'' Dionne thought it
was a tough call. ``I really believe McSorley is paying a dear
price,'' said Dionne. ``You always worry about what's next. I'm
sure it has happened before, when I was playing in the 1970s, but
we didn't have the coverage and media attention we have now. From
what I saw on TV, if I'm not a hockey fan, this is criminal
assault. No different than if it were in the stands and someone
hits you with a baseball bat.'' Brad Marsh, a former NHL defenseman
now coaching teenagers, thinks McSorley could make a contribution,
warning youngsters of dangerous behavior. ``I would like to see him
do some public service announcements geared at minor league players
across North America, trying to get them on the straight and
narrow,'' said Marsh. Former player Rob Ramage, who coaches kids in
St. Louis, echoed those sentiments. ``It's something I had to
explain to them,'' said Ramage. ``What went on there is not part of
the game. But what a spokesman he could be to the kids. `I didn't
play because this is what I did. I lost my chance to play.' What a
powerful message.''

   We think things are weird here, but how about the goings-on in
Dallas? The defending Stanley Cup champions have a big problem with
goaltender Ed Belfour. Belfour was arrested Wednesday morning for
assaulting a security guard and resisting arrest. The Dallas police
had to Mace him twice, once while he was in custody. Belfour
refused to cooperate and was placed in a restraining chair. He is
being evaluated by officials from the NHL's substance abuse program
and is expected to miss at least two games, including Sunday's
contest against the St. Louis Blues. Belfour said the incident was
a big misunderstanding, a position coach Ken Hitchcock rejected.
``That's the worst attitude you can have,'' said Hitchcock. ``This
is not about a misunderstanding. Eddie's a good person and he's got
a heart of gold. We want him to have a successful career but also a
successful life. You can't close your eyes in these situations.''
Belfour is going to have to be accountable to his teammates. ``Our
concern is that people stand up and explain themselves and do it
honestly,'' Hitchcock said. ``Because this isn't a
misunderstanding; this is a big mistake and we need to correct
it.'' . . . Former Bruin Shawn McEachern could have become an
unrestricted free agent at the end of the season but is thrilled in
Ottawa and recently signed a three-year deal believed to be worth
$6 million-$7 million. ``I wanted to stay in Ottawa,'' said
McEachern, a native of Waltham. ``My wife enjoys it, our kids enjoy
it, and I enjoy the small community feeling. I've been in other
places and I know the grass isn't always greener on the other
side.'' . . . It appears Long Island billionaire Charles Wang, CEO
of Computer Associates, is interested in buying the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He got off to a slow start, but Washington Capitals center Adam
Oates, at 37, is having a tremendous season. Coach Ron Wilson is
pushing Oates for the Selke Trophy, awarded to the best defensive
forward. ``Adam contributes so much defensively,'' said Wilson.
``He is such an extension of the coach's arm on the ice and he
bought into a defensive system that's difficult for offensive
players to buy into. He had to be the guy to give up some of his
responsibility offensively, but not at all in terms that hurt the
team. As far as I'm concerned, there isn't a guy who is even close
when it comes to the Selke.'' . . . Even when Rick Tocchet was
toiling in his brief and unsatisfying tenure in Boston, he would
have rather been in Philadelphia. He was happy in Phoenix, a team
loaded with talent, but to say he's ecstatic about being back with
his beloved Flyers is an understatement. ``It's a great situation
for me,'' said Tocchet, who was dealt for Mikael Renberg. ``Philly
was No. 1 on my list. I'd like to think I've got something to
offer.'' Tocchet, a terrific guy and respected leader, will be
missed in the dressing room. ``He's taught us and me a lot about
what it means to play this game,'' said the Coyotes' Keith Tkachuk.
``It's a sad day around here.''

RED SOX VISIT TO DOMINICAN IS SYMBOLIC 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ You know how somebody looks
familiar but you just can't quite connect the man and the moment?
That's how it was at the very nice pregame reception thrown by
United States ambassador to the Dominican Republic Charles Manett
and his staff Saturday. In the middle of the hubbub, there was this
very impressive-looking middle-aged gentlemen with a familiar look
wearing a Houston Astros cap.
</P>
<P>
   And then someone says to you, ``Would you like to meet Rico
Carty?''
</P>
<P>
   You kidding? Rico Carty? A man who might as well have the name
Senor Line Drive to commemorate all the bullets he knocked out in
both leagues?
</P>
<P>
   We are kind of used to the idea that in modern baseball
Dominicans rule. But it wasn't always thus. First, there were the
Cubans, followed by the Mexicans, and then the Puerto Ricans. The
San Francisco Giants came down here in the mid-'50s and came away
with the great Juan Marichal, not to mention an entire Alou family.
And right there in the forefront of this Dominican-friendly
takeover of baseball was Rico Carty, a righthanded masher of the
first degree.
</P>
<P>
   Marichal got himself into Cooperstown without the bother of
buying a ticket. He is now the Dominican's Secretary of Sports and
in that capacity he represented his country's administration at the
embassy ceremony. Carty was present to help promote the idea of a
Dominican sports Hall of Fame, which in this country basically
means a Dominican baseball Hall of Fame. Toward that end, an
18-item Baseball Hall of Fame exhibit featuring artifacts connected
with some of the great Dominican ballplayers is on display at the
American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have the slightest idea when I came up that there
would someday be this many Dominicans in the big leagues,'' Carty
said. ``If you had asked me if it would ever come to this, I would
have said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Sutton was once famously quoted as saying that he robbed
banks because ``that's where the money is,'' and that's the basic
reason the Red Sox, along with the Astros, are part of this two-day
major league excursion to Quisqueya Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it as great exposure for us,'' said Red Sox vice
president John Buckley. ``This is a chance to promote the Red Sox.
We were the first ones to raise our hands and say, `We'll go,' when
Major League Baseball was looking for volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Duquette joined the Red Sox five years ago, the
organization had, by his estimation, ``1 or 2 percent Dominican
players.'' And now? ``It's near 30 percent,'' he said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   At the big league level, the prominent Red Sox players of
Dominican extraction thus far have come via trades or free agency.
That would mean the likes of Tony Pena, Pedro Martinez, Ramon
Martinez, and Jose Offerman. We are just getting a glimpse of this
regime's Dominican harvest when we look at impressive young third
baseman Wilton Veras and promising righthander Juan Pena.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox now have a baseball academy in the Dominican, and
with Pedro as a marquee signing, they have strengthened their
influence in this most critical of all baseball venues. And
speaking of Marichal, Duquette said every Red Sox fan owes him a
great deal of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Marichal was one of the key advisers when Pedro decided
to sign with us after we made the trade,'' Duquette explained.
``Pedro respects him greatly, and he signed with us on that
recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget Marichal, known in his prime as the Dominican
Dandy, passed through the Red Sox portals as he was making his way
out of the big leagues. He was once even part of a memorable 1974
Sunday doubleheader pairing with Luis Tiant. Whoever would have
thought that this brief Red Sox experience one day would prove so
significant in the history of the organization?
</P>
<P>
   After years of neglect in the area of Caribbean recruitment,
Duquette has the Red Sox as proactive as anybody. Doing so was a
major priority when he took the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from our experience in Montreal how important
international recruiting was to anyone's developmental program,''
said Duquette. ``If you're a good team, year in and year out, this
is what you have to do. This is a good time for the Red Sox to be
in the Dominican.''
</P>
<P>
   For any serious baseball organization, any time is a good time
to be in the Dominican. If you can also play a ballgame here on a
nice sunny afternoon, so much the better.
</P>

<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. - There was just a little left in the tank, and
it belonged to tournament-savvy Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks ended the Cal State Northridge men's basketball
team's bid for its first Big Sky Conference tournament title with a
thrilling 85-81 overtime win Saturday night at Dahlberg Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded NAU (20-10) goes to the NCAA Tournament, and
fifth-seeded CSUN (20-10) must wait to see if it gets an NIT bid;
the invitations are extended tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge, which has won 20 games for the first time since
1984-85, has never gone to the postseason since moving to Division
I in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors didn't go down easily against the Lumberjacks.
Trailing 81-75 with under a minute left in overtime, Markus Carr
was fouled on a 3-point attempt and made all three free throws. He
made another shot with 3.4 seconds left to cut the lead to two. NAU
made four free throws to provide the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona, playing in its third consecutive Big Sky
final, scored the first four points of overtime, but Marco McCain
drilled a 3-pointer with two minutes left to cut the lead to one -
74-73.
</P>
<P>
   NAU's Adam Lopez, a senior point guard who was a reserve when
the Matadors beat the Lumberjacks 69-66 in Northridge in January,
came back with a basket while getting fouled. He made the free
throw and NAU led 77-73 with one minute left.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was fouled again with 48 seconds left, and he made both
free throws to make it 79-73. But Carr came back with a 17-footer
six seconds later to cut the lead to four. Then Lopez made two more
free throws and the lead was 81-75.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, down 70-61 with a little over three minutes left in
regulation, scored nine consecutive points to force overtime; it
was the first time since 1978 that the tournament final went an
extra period.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors had a chance to win with three seconds left in
regulation, but Carr's running jumper in the lane was off the back
of the rim. NAU didn't get off a shot in the final 2.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge used two 3s in the final burst - the first by McCain
with 2:11 left and then Andre Larry from the top of the key with
1:35 remaining - to tie the game at 70.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime seemed an unlikely scenario after the first half. The
Lumberjacks did what they do best in the game's first 20 minutes -
shooting and making 3-pointers. They made 10 of 15 shots from
beyond the arc, with Ross Land hitting four.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN couldn't match NAU; the Lumberjacks' shot 58.8 percent from
the field in the first half, and the Matadors hit on 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter from where or how far the Lumberjacks shot.
Forget Land's three-quarters-court miracle at the end of the half,
sure to be an ESPN highlight for the next month. Lopez swished a 3
from 25 feet just 3 minutes into the second half to make it 49-35.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-pointer tied the tournament record for threes in a game
(Weber State had 13 against Nevada in 1988) and Land's long-range
shot from the baseline with 10:35 left broke the mark. It also gave
the Lumberjacks a 58-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Lopez's third 3-pointer extended the
Lumberjacks' lead to 33-22. NAU led 35-22 before CSUN went on a 7-0
run, capped by Denny Odgen's 3-pointer with 1:15 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The score stayed the same until Land's long-distance shot pumped
life into the lukewarm fans, who probably found it hard to get
excited about a tournament final that didn't involve the host
Montana Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth meeting for CSUN and NAU in the Big Sky
tournament, and the Lumberjacks have won the last three. The
Northern Arizona seniors, including Land and 7-foot center Dan
McClintock, were freshmen when the Matadors upset top-seeded NAU in
the 1997 tournament.

 EAST-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One night they were embattled St. John's teammates
who had plunged their team into turmoil on the eve of the Big East
tournament final. But Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, all was well with Erick
Barkley and Marvis ``Bootsy'' Thornton, the combatants of a
reported locker room altercation during halftime of Friday night's
semifinal victory over Miami.
</P>
<P>
   One night they were trading fists, angry glares, and angrier
words.
</P>
<P>
   The next it was nothing but love and high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a night and one team meeting make.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who opted not to follow through with his plan to take a
leave of absence from the team, and Thornton combined for 41 points
to lead third-seeded St. John's to its first Big East title since
1986 with an 80-70 victory over No. 4 seed Connecticut in the
conference tournament final at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, voted the tourney's Most Outstanding Player, led the
Red Storm (24-7) to their third victory over UConn (24-9) this
season by scoring a team-high 22 points on 9-of-14 shooting,
including 4 of 6 from 3-point range, while Barkley added 19 points
(6-for-10 shooting), 3 rebounds, and 3 assists. Anthony Glover,
whose two clutch free throws clinched Friday night's win, had 15
points, while Lavor Postell, who joined Barkley and Thornton on the
all-tournament team, had 14 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never fell apart,'' Thornton said. ``We had an argument,
but it was nothing. It was just between two competitive guys.
Tonight we just sucked it up and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I got a lump in my throat, but I'm not gonna cry,'' said
Barkley. ``It feels great, going through what I've been through.
I'm just trying to play basketball for St. John's.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Red Storm never lost focus in a season rife with
distractions served as a testament to the amazing job done by coach
Mike Jarvis, the former Boston University and Cambridge Rindge &AMP;
Latin mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in my heart that all would be resolved,'' said
Jarvis as he stood on the Garden floor and proudly watched his
players cut down the nets. ``I have a bracelet with the initials
W.W.J.D. It stands for, `What Would Jesus Do?' We had a team
meeting today before practice and I wrote those intials on the
chalkboard and I asked each player `What would Jesus do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When it got around to Anthony Glover, the kid who made the two
free throws (against Miami), he said, `Jesus would forgive.' Then
when it got to Chudney Gray, he said, `All is forgiven now. Let's
go out and be a team again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what it took for the Red Storm to avenge an
82-63 loss to UConn in last year's championship game. St. John's
denied the Huskies, who were playing their fourth game in as many
nights, their third straight Big East title and snapped UConn's
nine-game winning streak in tourney play.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Mouring led UConn with 22 points on 7-for-16 shooting,
including 6 of 11 from 3-point range, while foul-plagued Khalid
El-Amin added 13 points and freshman guard Tony Robertson had 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies trailed by as many as 12, 36-24, in the first half
when Thornton drained a 3-pointer with 2:38 to go. The Huskies, who
made only two field goals in the final 6:38, ended a scoreless
drought of 4:22 when Mouring hit two free throws to make it 36-26.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's held a 37-28 halftime lead, so there was little
concern that Barkley and Thornton would be at each other's throats
again. But if UConn had any intention of winning its third straight
title, the Huskies were going to need a better showing in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, unlike Friday night's game when he was three
minutes late for the second half, Barkley showed up on time and
scored St. John's first two baskets, including a 3-pointer that
gave the Red Storm a 42-33 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies managed to pull within 46-41 on Robertson's jumper,
but UConn unraveled when El-Amin picked up his fourth personal with
12:27 left. Thornton and Postell combined to score 9 in a 10-2 run
that enabled St. John's to build a commanding 15-point lead, 58-43,
with 10:41 to go. But UConn refused to go away, using a 15-4 run to
rally within 64-58.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, though, staved off the Huskies for a title that did
not seem probable the night before.

PEPPERDINE PLAYS TOUGH GAME _ WAITING

<P>
   MALIBU - The last place anybody wanted to be on a gorgeous day
like Saturday was indoors.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rest of civilization, seemingly, was at the beach
across Pacific Coast Highway, members of the Pepperdine basketball
team were working away inside Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Waves aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Life still remains in their season, and today they'll find out
what the future holds - whether they'll be readying for the first
round of the NCAA Tournament or sulking with the rest of the bubble
clubs who felt they got snubbed.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, the Waves (24-8) will gather today at the home
of Andy Benton, an athletic department official, to watch the
tournament selection show. By 4 p.m. they'll know their fate.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Pepperdine went through a two-hour workout, then
scrambled to watch some conference tournament games on television.
But that's been their routine since they concluded the regular
season in a 69-65 loss to Gonzaga on Monday in the West Coast
Conference tournament championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all getting pretty antsy,'' said forward David
Lalazarian. ``We just waiting to find out what's going to happen. I
mean, you watch some of these (conference tournament) games and you
see a few upsets and you wonder how that's going to affect our
chances of getting in. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxious wait could have been avoided had Pepperdine defeated
Gonzaga in the WCC final. A win would have ensured the Waves one of
the 29 automatic bids. Instead, they'll sweat out the last few
hours hoping to get one of the 35 at-large berths in the 64-team
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves would seem a lock to get in after compiling an
impressive list of ''tournament-friendly'' achievements. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   -Of the 60 teams in the current College RPI report, the Waves
rank fourth in most road wins with 13, tying a school record.
</P>
<P>
   -They rank second with the most games played on the road (20)
and second for least amount of home games with 12.
</P>
<P>
   -All 24 wins were against Division I opponents. Ten of its 15
nonconference games were on the road, and they finished 10-5 in
those games.
</P>
<P>
   -They recorded ``quality'' nonconference wins over Colorado
State, Detroit, Fresno State, Long Beach State and
Louisiana-Layette.
</P>
<P>
   -Their losses were to quality teams that reached the tournament
last year - Auburn, Kansas, UCLA, UNC Charlotte and Gonzaga, which
beat Pepperdine twice (and lost once).
</P>
<P>
   -In a conference that yielded five teams that won at least 19
games, the Waves were the regular-season champions at 12-2.
</P>
<P>
   Taking all that into consideration, and the fact that Pepperdine
advanced to the WCC tournament championship game and lost in
overtime, the Waves are on solid ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we keep telling ourselves and we feel like we've
done everything we could do and that we deserve (a bid),''
Lalazarian said. ``But again, you see some of these upsets and you
wonder how it's all going to play out. So you get a little
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff felt the Waves clinched a
bid by reaching the WCC tournament final after winning the
conference regular-season crown. Still, he too is anxious.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the so-called experts and the various Web sites have
Pepperdine in the tournament, but I'll be nervous about the whole
thing until I see our name flash on the television screen on Sunday
afternoon,'' said van Breda Kolff.
</P>
<P>
   The wait is almost over.

BROWN DIDN'T GO DOWN REBUILDING 76ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three years ago, Larry Brown boldly walked into a
minefield known as the Philadelphia 76ers. He inherited a team that
had won 18 games, three more than the Celtics, and richly deserved
its 64 losses.
</P>
<P>
   He made no bold predictions about quick turnarounds or
guaranteed playoff appearances. He and henchman Billy King went to
work and, despite a couple of glaring gaffes, they have assembled a
team that comes to Boston Sunday having lapped Rick Pitino's boys
in green.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers come in as contenders, not pretenders. They don't
talk about trying to make the eighth spot in the playoffs, they
talk about getting home-court advantage. They have the league's
leading scorer in Allen Iverson, but according to the old-school
Brown, if you concentrate only on Iverson, you're missing the
essence of his club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a knock on Allen,'' Brown said, ``but our team is
all about Tyrone Hill, Theo Ratliff, George Lynch, Aaron McKie, and
Eric Snow. When Allen went out, we were 6-4 without him. But with
these guys, we have competed in almost every single game. They
defend their positions as well as anyone in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino talks wistfully about defense, and his team pays lip
service to the concept. The Sixers go out and play defense.
Opponents shoot 43 percent against Philadelphia, the
seventh-stingiest mark in the league. They are near the top in
forcing turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch may be the embodiment of the team, coming in as a free
agent (apparently not good enough to play for Vancouver) and
earning a starting spot through sheer tenacity. Brown says Lynch
reminds him of Adrian Griffin, a player who is utterly selfless and
``brings it on every single possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch also happens to be the only guy on the team to have
started all 60 games. Brown has had injury woes all season, yet the
team is right in the hunt for the division crown. Brown has
outstanding depth up front, thanks to three huge deals.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months into his first season, Brown saw the
Iverson/Jerry Stackhouse thing wasn't working and dealt Stackhouse
to Detroit for Ratliff and McKie. He saw Tim Thomas wasn't working
out, either _ he basically traded Keith Van Horn and cap space for
Thomas _ and sent Thomas to Milwaukee for Hill. Then, he deep-sixed
Larry Hughes, who couldn't coexist with Iverson (and who was
drafted ahead of Paul Pierce) for Toni Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
   The Kukoc deal helped all involved, but it really helped the
Sixers because they now have another legitimate scorer. Brown says
Kukoc is better defensively than he thought _ Kukoc will never be
an All-Defensive Team candidate _ and, needless to say, has been
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won,'' Brown said. ``He understands what it takes to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Sixers. Finally. They broke through last season, not
only making the playoffs but getting to the second round. They're
ready for more.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success, Brown is, of course, worried. He wouldn't
be a coach if he weren't. He's worried about Iverson's sore
shoulder, although, as he noted, with the arrival of Kukoc,
``There's more ball distribution than we've ever had. It used to be
one guy taking 30 shots'' _ guess who? _ ``and the next guy taking
six.''
</P>
<P>
   He's worried about Hill's sore Achilles' tendon and what looks
like a tough schedule the rest of the way. The Sixers haven't
played the Utah Jazz but they will meet twice in the next 18 days.
They have a brutal Western swing (Minnesota, Utah, Lakers,
Sacramento) and still have two games left with both Miami and
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've managed to hang on,'' Brown said. ``I'm thrilled. I
think this season we've lost eight games by 10 or more points and
we've been out of only one of them. That's an amazing thing to me.
But we've got a tough schedule ahead, especially out West. But
that's what's fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are justifiably getting kudos as they rampage through
the league, but guess who's quietly coming around? Yup, it's the
Jazz. They come east this week having overtaken the Spurs for the
top spot (and critical No. 2 seed) in the West. They had won six
straight and 9 of 10 heading into Phoenix Friday. So, are the Jazz
just being the Jazz, ready to make a serious run? Or is it a
fruitless chase the way the Lakers are playing? ``We're not
conceding anything,'' said center Olden Polynice. ``The Lakers are
an abdominal strain away. Shaq gets one of those and they're done.
You can't count us out. I saw what Denver did to Seattle (in 1994)
but we know we have to do it ourselves. To me, it's important to be
playing well, now.'' Polynice is finishing his first year with the
Jazz and thinks the team isn't getting the proper respect. ``We
have two guys here who play hard every night, who are going into
the Hall of Fame, and yet they get nothing,'' he said, referring to
John Stockton and Karl Malone. ``It's like the league is focusing
on all these young guys. I don't think John and Karl get enough
credit. The NBA is supposed to be this great image maker. Well, how
about finding a way to market these guys?'' . . . The NBA is trying
to find a way to boost sagging television ratings. Coaches have
been miked for some NBC games, although most abhor the idea. Then,
starting April 1, the league will allow cameras into locker rooms
at halftime so viewers can get a ``feel'' of what it's like. No one
likes that idea. Said Indiana coach Larry Bird, ``I'll just have my
players sit there naked. That won't last very long.'' . . . Alvin
Gentry won't stay unemployed for long. Brown, who had Gentry as an
assistant at Kansas and in San Antonio, said he'd like to see the
deposed Pistons coach on the Philly bench. (There will be an
opening with John Calipari heading to Memphis.) The Gentry firing
was, basically, a preemptive strike by management because his
contract was up and he wasn't going to be rehired. The more
important question here is, of course, Grant Hill. If the Pistons
can't crack the playoffs, what incentive is there for Hill to stick
around? Interim official taster George Irvine is Hill's fourth
coach in less than six seasons and the new guy will be the fifth.
Names popping up include Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn, who, by the
way, was just named CBA Coach of the Month in Rockford, where he
succeeded Darrell Walker. Another ex-Piston, Isiah Thomas, has put
his Detroit-area house up for sale and is building in the Atlanta
area. Without jumping to conclusions, one would surmise that the
Hawks will be in for some serious redecorating after the season.
Isaiah Rider was late, again, for Thursday's loss at home to the
Spurs. Meanwhile, Dikembe Mutombo looks totally uninterested in the
events around him . . . Speaking of the Pistons, they retired Joe
Dumars's number Friday and will soon celebrate the 10th anniversary
of their second title team. (Can you imagine if the Celtics or
Lakers did that with their title teams?) And to think the Pistons
took immense heat in 1985 after drafting the obscure Dumars out of
McNeese State ahead of East Lansing/Michigan State legend Sam
Vincent, who went to Boston. (If Dallas had drafted Malone and
Dumars, how many flags would it have?) By the way, to illustrate
how wild that draft was, the final two players taken in the first
round are not only still around, they're thriving: A.C. Green and
Terry Porter.

   The Timberwolves may look back on this year and kick themselves
for their play at home against some of the league's flotsam and
jetsam. Their latest lapse: a loss Wednesday to the pathetic
Wizards. Minnesota also has lost at home to the Clippers, Warriors,
Mavericks, Magic, Nets, and Nuggets and is only 7-7 at home against
sub-.500 teams . . . How's this for a sure-fire draw: The Warriors
are offering free admission to Sunday night's game with the
Clippers to anyone who will submit to a buzz-cut from one of 20
Marine Corps ``hair stylists'' at the arena. Good thing the Celtics
would never stoop to a cheesy thing like that. Those in attendance
will see Lamar Odom playing the point. That's where
soon-to-be-fired coach Jim Todd has decided Odom will play, and the
rook averaged 16 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists over a five-game
stretch . . . The silly Dennis Rodman sideshow came to an
all-too-predictable conclusion last week. It wasn't Rodman's fault.
He was just being himself. The Mavericks discovered they could lose
just as easily without him. Said Phil Jackson, ``There wasn't
enough of the drama that Dennis likes, or the showcase perhaps that
he needs.'' Dallas's first Worm-free home game Wednesday drew only
13,435, two-thirds capacity . . . When the league switched Sunday's
Toronto-Seattle game to prime time on NBC, it did so despite
freezing out most of Canada. The game was supposed to be on CTV _
the Canadian cable giant _ but the switch means viewers must settle
for local news, ``Felicity,'' and a show called ``Charmed.'' CTV
already had made commitments to sponsors in those time slots . . .
The Miami Heat have added another suit to the coaching staff. (They
have four assistants already.) Keith Askins, one of Pat Riley's
favorite players, has hooked on as a volunteer assistant. Askins
will be well compensated for his volunteerism; he's still
collecting the remainder of his $1.75 million contract. The Heat
waived Askins prior to the season and he heard from a few teams. He
decided to relax before getting back into it: He had not been to a
single Miami game or even to the new American Airlines Arena since
being released . . . One of the great stories of this or any season
may unfold this week in San Antonio. On Tuesday against Atlanta,
Sean Elliott is scheduled to make his season debut, seven months
after a kidney transplant. It is a debut that many figured might
never happen. Elliott has been determined to make it back _ he
originally targeted mid-February _ even as coach Gregg Popovich
told his team to forget about it. San Antonio has been having
internal woes of late _ Avery Johnson didn't appreciate being
mentioned in trade stories _ and needs all the help it can get in
the cutthroat Western Conference. The Spurs could use anything
resembling the Elliott of old.

CELTICS MUST WIN ON ROAD TO STAY IN PLAYOFF HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Celtics don't like to see box scores in their
locker room, but there is no mistaking the Eastern Conference
standings on the wall. They are updated daily, and they show where
the Celtics stand and where they have to go.
</P>
<P>
   The last two playoff spots in the East are up for grabs, and six
teams, including the Celtics, are in the mix. (We're eliminating
the Hawks, who seem to have tanked the season.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the teams ahead of you,'' coach Rick Pitino said
Saturday. ``It's also the teams right with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino wants the last week of the regular season to mean
something and, with all these teams in a scrum, there's a good
chance it will. ``Every game for us is monumental,'' the coach
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic clearly have the best schedule, with only one-third of
their remaining games against winning teams. Orlando is finished on
the road in the West and plays eight games against the other
pretenders. The Magic have a good home/road split, but they've been
a tough team to peg.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest schedule? Detroit by a mile. The Pistons have the
most road games and start a five-game Western swing next Sunday.
And the game before that? A homer against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who are playing above .500 since their 2-15 start, are
making noise and should have Jayson Williams back next Saturday.
Williams is working out and was told by one teammate that he looked
better than Gheorghe Muresan. ``I don't know how to take that,''
Williams said. The Nets, like the Magic, have the most games
(eight) against the Eastern contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has an excellent April schedule, with 9 of 11 games
against teams with losing records and only six games overall
against winning teams. But the Bucks still have to go out West, and
they are playing horribly right now, as evidenced by their 28-point
home loss to the Nets Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics? After Sunday, they have only seven games left
against teams with winning records. But they've got to do it on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we're behind the 8-ball,'' Pitino said. ``After
(Sunday's) game, we have 10 of 13 on the road. We have to take care
of business at home and get lucky on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Kenny Anderson, ``It's going to be tough. It might come
down to the last week of the season. The main thing we can do is
try to win each game we play, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitino on John Calipari's move to Memphis: ``Memphis is a town
of scoundrels and he's a scoundrel. Seriously, it's a great
opportunity. It's sort of like the UMass situation in that it needs
enthusiasm, recruiting, and to be built from the bottom up. And he
has more resources for recruiting there than he did at UMass.
Amherst is not exactly a basketball hotbed.'' . . . Pitino on the
Sixers: ``They go back door more than any team in pro basketball.''
He also said the Sixers start four ``great'' defensive players
along with Allen Iverson.

ANOTHER GREAT MARINO PASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If Dan Marino retires as expected Monday, he will not
be remembered for the sad way his career ended or the fact that he
never won a Super Bowl. He'll be remembered as the most prolific
passer in pro football history.
</P>
<P>
   That is as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that Marino never experienced the excitement of a
Super Bowl victory as his contemporary John Elway finally did at
the end of his brilliant career, but he is making a wise choice not
to chase the game on to Minnesota, as he was thinking of doing.
</P>
<P>
   Marino belongs in a Dolphins uniform or none at all. To do
something else at this late stage of his football life would be
courting disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, and also rare, is the athlete who knows when his time has
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's arm is not what it used to be, and he is immobile
because of an Achilles' tendon injury suffered a few years back. He
also has a serious case of the yips, his nerve sometimes deserting
him in large part because he knows his receivers are not as good as
the ones he used to have.
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw some horrendous interceptions last year, the only
season in which he threw more picks than touchdowns. Yet he still
got his team into the playoffs and had a brilliant game in Seattle
before his string ran out.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets out now, Marino will not be remembered for the last
few games in which he struggled. If he stays too long, he will
become another hump-shouldered Johnny Unitas, misplaced in a pale
blue San Diego Chargers uniform, or a limping Joe Namath, as a Los
Angeles Ram pretending he was still Broadway Joe of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   If Marino announces his retirement Monday, he will be remembered
not for small weaknesses born of age and infirmity at the end of
his career but for the brilliance that allowed him to pass for
61,361 yards and 420 touchdowns, including seasons in which he
threw 44 and 48 touchdowns. There will be much to remember about
him when Miami retires his uniform next season, and none of those
memories will be the sad ones he could be carrying if he chose to
play on.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino doesn't need a gaudy ring to prove that he is a
champion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Slade's decision to restructure his contract does not make
him a candidate for firing a year from now, as Bruce Armstrong was
this year. Unlike the Armstrong situation, New England would
actually cost itself cap room if it cut Slade in 2001 when his cap
number accelerates to $4.1 million. Armstrong's disappearance saved
the Patriots cap money because the bulk of his income was in
salary, not a pro-rated bonus. But cutting Slade would cost New
England $2.1 million on the cap, including an additional $780,000
as part of his pro-rated bonus. Slade's willingness to restructure
his deal gave the Patriots an additional $860,000 of cap room at a
time when they reportedly were down to $80,000 . . . Willie
McGinest, who was in attendance at the Felix Trinidad-David Reid
fight in Las Vegas last week and looking fit and ready to play,
will be back in New England this week to join the bulk of his
teammates for Bill Belichick's offseason workout program. The
program ends June 16 and training camp will open around July 17,
two weeks before the Patriots play the San Francisco 49ers in the
Hall of Fame game in Canton, Ohio. The only mandatory minicamp runs
June 2-4 . . . Although Patriots wide receiver Sean Morey will play
in NFL Europe this spring, quarterback Michael Bishop will not.
Bishop was always reluctant to go overseas despite the recent
success of NFL Europe alums such as Kurt Warner and Jon Kitna.
Belichick decided it might be counterproductive to send him because
it would mean asking Bishop to learn his fourth offensive system in
less than two years. Bishop ran the Kansas State offense two years
ago, tried to learn Ernie Zampese's timing offense last season, and
now must adapt to Charlie Weis's ideas . . . By contrast, the
Kansas City Chiefs have assigned 11 players to NFL Europe,
including two quarterbacks and college football's all-time leading
rusher, Brian Shay. At Emporia State in Kansas, Shay gained 6,958
yards and scored 88 touchdowns but he went undrafted last year. He
was on the Chiefs' practice squad for five weeks last year before
being cut . . . Tedy Bruschi is expected to make a decision on his
future this week. He has offers from Green Bay, Oakland, and
Cleveland, but no one is offering the $3 million signing bonus he
wants on a five-year deal. He won't get that from New England,
either, because of its cap situation. The best the Patriots could
do would be a $2 million bonus or a longer contract over which to
spread the money . . . Old friend Scott Rehberg is back in the
news. The ex-Patriot lineman made headlines last year when he said
he could not play in a Browns game because of the flu and was
ripped by teammate Lomas Brown. ``Things got ugly up there,''
Rehberg said after signing a two-year deal with the Cincinnati
Bengals as an all-purpose backup.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big-time agent Tank Black may be going down in flames. On top of
allegations that he violated NFL rules governing agents, the
Securities and Exchange Commission is alleging that he defrauded a
number of NFL players of millions. He reportedly took $400,000 from
Tampa wide receiver Jacquez Green's signing bonus and deposited it
in a Cayman Island bank account that the SEC claims was a front for
a Ponzi scheme. Black also allegedly cost another client all of his
$3 million signing bonus . . . Among the players who benefitted
most from the recent NFL combine workouts was Boston College
defensive tackle Chris Hovan, who impressed the scouts by doing 35
reps with a 225-pound bench press . . . Trent Dilfer never expected
to be in the position he finds himself in today. He was supposed to
be leading the Buccaneers into the Super Bowl by now. Instead, he
is backing up Tony Banks in Baltimore after signing a $1 million,
one-year deal. Dilfer started 76 games for the Buccaneers in his
six seasons there but lost the job to rookie Shaun King late last
season. Tampa could have extended Dilfer's contract but refused to
gamble any more money on its former No. 1 draft choice. Meanwhile,
King has become the toast of Tampa after the way he carried them
into the NFC title game. ``We're winning, so they like me now,''
King said. ``But your time in the spotlight isn't always that long.
You never know how long it will last into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interesting dynamics in the brewing quarterback battle in Denver
between incumbent Brian Griese and newly signed Gus Frerotte.
Frerotte is used to such battles, having engaged in them in
Washington with John Friesz, Heath Shuler, Jeff Hostetler, and
Trent Green before moving on to back up Charlie Batch in Detroit
last year. Now he has signed a one-year deal with Denver to compete
with a player who has the same agent he has. He publicly has
conceded the job to Griese, but privately the 31-year-old Frerotte
is going to Denver looking to play. The only fly in the ointment
would be if the Broncos sign Steve Young, as some speculate head
coach Mike Shanahan will. Frerotte was told of that possibility
before he agreed to terms, but he believes there is no more than a
10 percent chance of that happening . . . Rumors abound that
Keyshawn Johnson has been offered to the Redskins, Buccaneers, and
Ravens as the Jets attempt to find a way to parlay their No. 16 and
No. 18 picks into one of the top four drafting slots in pursuit of
Penn State defensive end Courtney Brown. But sources in Washington
say there is little likelihood the Redskins will trade either the
No. 2 or No. 3 spot because personnel director Vinny Cerrato
believes there are only four sure-shot players in this draft _
Brown, Penn State teammate LaVar Arrington, Florida State wide
receiver Peter Warrick, and Alabama tackle Chris Samuels _ and he
is in position to grab two of them . . . One guy in New York has a
unique take on the Jets' decision to shop their best player around.
Mets catcher Mike Piazza, who was traded to New York in 1998
because of brewing contract problems, said, ``Nobody's beyond
getting traded if the team can try to prove that they feel it's the
best for the team. I never thought of myself as untouchable. I
think a lot of guys shouldn't think of themselves as untouchables.
That's the business of sports. It's not personal. Even (Wayne)
Gretzky was traded. You have to realize one door closes and another
opens.'' . . . The belief throughout the league is that Dallas
cornerback Deion Sanders will end up in Washington once the Cowboys
finally dump his salary and endlessly sore toe. The Redskins hope
to team him with Champ Bailey on the corners, with Darrell Green
coming off the bench . . . Bob McNair's new Houston team broke
ground on its state-of-the-art stadium. The $350 million palace is
supposed to be ready for the 2002 season and will have the NFL's
first retractable roof. When the Astrodome was built in 1962,
officials fired off .45s into the dirt to break ground; this time
they drank coffee in china cups.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the essence of what's wrong with free agency. Cleveland
loses Lomas Brown to the New York Giants, then turns around and
signs the guy Brown is replacing, Roman Oben, the Giants' ex-left
tackle. What did Brown have to say about that? ``Oben is a good,
young guy, but it just would've been a little while before I took
his job.'' . . . Bill Walsh met with Jerry Rice's agent, Jim
Steiner, Friday in California to try to break the deadlock on the
Hall of Fame receiver's contract situation. Rice is under contract
until 2004, but the 49ers want him to take a pay cut that will
reduce his cap number from its present $5.49 million. They want to
put much of his future money in incentives at a time when his
skills are beginning to erode. Rice is reticent, and faces being
fired if he doesn't agree to some sort of reduction. San Francisco
is $1.75 million under the cap but must clear another $250,000 by
April 15 to have enough money for its draft selections. Word is,
many of the parameters of a new deal have been worked out but not
the one that counts most _ money . . . The Oakland Raiders lost
another round in court in Sacramento last week but the NFL still
hasn't seen the last of Al Davis. A Superior Court judge ruled the
Raiders cannot leave Oakland, as Davis had threatened, but left the
door open for Davis to sue for damages. You can bet he will . . .
The Rams' Charley Armey has his team in an interesting draft
position this year _ last in every round after winning the Super
Bowl. In each of the Rams' previous five seasons in St. Louis, they
entered the draft in the same spot (No. 6), although they traded up
to No. 1 in 1997. ``It doesn't change what we do,'' said Armey.
``The philosophy you take is you start your draft with Round 2 when
you're drafting 31st.'' . . . Look for the Steelers to trade backup
fullback Richard Huntley to the Dolphins for draft choices and then
open negotiations with starter Jerome Bettis on a contract
extension. Bettis has one year left on his present deal. Pittsburgh
hopes to land at least a fourth-round choice for Huntley, plus a
conditional pick in 2001.

WEBB'S START HAS BEEN PERFECTLY SPLENDID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While we were caught up in that pretty impressive run
by Tiger Woods, another storm of success started to percolate. It
has grown louder and more impressive with each swing of her club,
to the point that Karrie Webb is now the one stalking history,
though she preaches caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Nancy has to start worrying yet,'' said Webb, in
reference to the LPGA Tour record of five straight wins by Nancy
Lopez in 1978. Webb, 25, has won all three of her starts this
season, but is not playing in this week's Welch's/Circle K
Championship in Tucson. She will try to make it 4 for 4 when she
defends her title next week at the Standard Register Ping in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a serious presence on the LPGA Tour since her
rookie season in 1996 when she won four times. Webb triumphed three
times the next season, then twice more in 1998 and seemingly was a
logical choice as the Tour's best player. But nowhere in that mix
was there a major championship, a shortcoming that Annika
Sorenstam, Laura Davies, Juli Inkster, and Dottie Pepper _ among
other notables _ did not have to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, that changed. Webb, after finishing second, 27th, and
14th in the first three majors of the season, came from behind to
win the du Maurier for her first major triumph. That it was one of
six victories in 1999 and contributed to her $1,591,959 windfall
for the season was not as important as the fact that it relieved
her of the burden of explaining to reporters why she had never won
a major. Never mind the fact she was still just four seasons into
her career; the question followed her like a dark cloud.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Now Webb is asked: When will you not win again?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like Woods, the answer is simple. She won't win every
week. That goes without saying. But for now she is as close to a
sure thing as there is in golf. In her three wins this year _ the
Office Depot, Australian Women's Masters, Takefuji Classic _ Webb
has played 11 rounds and shot higher than 71 just once. Six rounds
have been 69 or better and twice she has fired a 65. And, as Woods
outplayed Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, and Davis Love in his streak
of six straight wins, Webb has beaten Sorenstam, Inkster, and Lorie
Kane in her stretch. In other words, she's proven her talents
against the best.
</P>
<P>
   When she beat Sorenstam in a one-hole playoff at the Takefuji,
it reinforced the belief that Webb had replaced the 29-year-old
Swede as the game's queen. At the start of the 1998 campaign,
Sorenstam had won 12 times, with two majors, compared with Webb's
seven and zero. The last two seasons, however, have been advantage
Webb _ eight wins, including that major, compared with Sorenstam's
six and zero. Webb now has 19 career wins, Sorenstam 18, and if
last week's playoff in Hawaii signals anything, it is perhaps that
Sorenstam doesn't like the landscape as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want another chance,'' she said. ``I want another chance
against Karrie. I'll be there again and I'll be on top again.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has not been the friendliest of weeks in state golfing
circles, as 15 local players were stripped of their amateur status
for violating US Golf Association rules against playing for prize
money. There is passion on both sides of this issue, but what comes
through loud and clear is a
``they're-doing-something-wrong-too-so-why-can't-we?'' mentality
that makes me feel like I'm refereeing a fight over the Nintendo
controls between my sons. That some very good people are involved
makes it even more unpleasant, but the worst part of all is that
the game of golf _ to which many of these gentlemen owe a lifetime
of thanks _ is a careless afterthought to many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between wagering and playing for prize money is
a gray area, some claim, which tells me they aren't sure on the
issue. So, I wonder, why not pick up the phone and call the USGA
and ask? Why take a chance? If you interpret a rule one way, and
the USGA interprets it another way, guess who wins?
</P>
<P>
   The issue isn't whether calcuttas (the mere mention of the word
makes me want to vomit) exist. They regrettably do. The issue isn't
why someone reported this particular tournament to authorities. The
issue isn't whether the USGA should revisit its rules on amateur
status. (It should.) The issue isn't about shades of hypocrisy that
exist in the game and some people who rule it. No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a code of conduct that any legitimate golfer lives
by, a code that acknowledges that the Rules of Golf, as interpreted
by the USGA, are supreme and the one voice that matters. Notice I
said ``legitimate golfer,'' which has nothing to do with how well
one scores. It has everything to do with how well one treats the
game. Unfortunately, there are more and more people treating the
game poorly, thumbing their noses at it, using it as nothing more
than a vehicle to satisfy their thirst for what is commonly called
``action,'' which should never, ever be confused with what golf is
all about.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill of winning _ at the expense of honesty, integrity,
and fair play _ is all that matters to more and more people who
play golf. (Let's not call them ``golfers.'') So they play 200
rounds a year but hand in a dozen scores. So they carry a 10
handicap but can make a half-dozen birdies in any given round. So
they hustle some young, naive kid into playing in a member-guest,
where the parimutuel betting is huge, not because they like the kid
_ heck, they just met the week before _ but because the kid can
whip a 3-iron 210 yards off a tight lie.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is not fair, which means it mirrors life, a dangerous
reality that leads all of us to bend rules to suit our particular
need at the moment. Words can be twisted, rearranged, and taken out
of context in such an easy manner that believers can be easily made
disbelievers. But during a week in which many people have expressed
their outrage on both sides of the issue, one man's comment has
stuck with me: The game is always better to the player than the
player is to the game.

   Stuart Appleby, still fighting a daily battle to come to grips
with the tragic death of his wife following the 1998 British Open,
is hoping 2000 takes him into the upper echelon of his profession.
No one disputes his talent (he's won a tournament in each of the
last three seasons in the US), but ``it's time to get to another
level and figure out the buttons to get there and be able to do
it,'' said Appleby, who will be defending champ at the Shell
Houston Open next month. Of course, that road to the next level
goes through the major championships, at which Appleby has failed
miserably. He missed the cut in all four of them a year ago and in
12 career starts in the majors, he has made it into weekend play
just five times, a T-10 at the US Open in 1998 his best finish . .
. Call it penance for his ill-advised criticism of Arnold Palmer at
last year's Masters, because Mark Calcavecchia will not be in the
field at Augusta National for the first time since 1986. He could
not crack the Top 50 in world rankings, nor make it on any of the
other criteria. Brad Faxon and Olin Browne are two others who will
not be at Augusta, despite having won PGA Tour events last year.
(Tournament officials last year stopped a longtime practice of
exempting winners of PGA Tour events, leaning instead on the world
rankings.) Among those who held on to their Top 50 positions to
make it into the Masters: Paul Azinger, Shigeki Maruyama, and Kirk
Triplett . . . That infamous celebration at The Country Club's 17th
green during last September's Ryder Cup is still a sore spot. The
main characters _ Jose Maria Olazabal and Justin Leonard _
reportedly discussed the situation when they met at the American
Express Championship in Spain six weeks after Brookline, but they
were faced with more questions last week after being paired in the
third round of the Dubai Desert Classic. ``I accepted the apology
and everything is fine now,'' said Olazabal, who had to wait on his
birdie attempt while Leonard and teammates celebrated wildly
following the American's improbable birdie putt from more than 40
feet that all but wrapped up the victory. ``It's all in the past,''
said Leonard, who has been stung by criticism. Greg Norman, for
one, suggested that Leonard should have shown better sportsmanship
and conceded Olazabal's putt. ``I don't think it's any business of
Greg to get involved,'' said Leonard. ``What's done is done and
cannot be changed now. I certainly don't intend to say whether I
believe he's wrong or right.'' . . . In the final round of the 1999
Masters, Olazabal was faced with a testing birdie putt on the 13th
hole just moments after his playing partner, Norman, had drained a
dramatic eagle. Olazabal let the noise die down, then made his
birdie, a key to his victory since ``it stopped his momentum,''
said the Spaniard, who makes no comparison with the putt he
attempted just after Leonard's heroics. ``Different format,
different situation. They weren't the same at all.'' . . . From Chi
Chi Rodriguez, on why he is still grinding away on the Senior Tour
at age 64: ``When you retire, your wife gets twice as much husband
and half as much money.'' . . . As for Sergio Garcia, the young
Spaniard was asked if he had a girlfriend in the US or back home.
``Not yet. Too busy,'' he said . . . Johanna Head was all set to
make her debut on the LPGA Tour at the Takefuji Classic when she
got sick and had to be rushed to the hospital. Diagnosed with a
severe bladder infection, Head withdrew from the tournament,
rejecting a plan by her identical twin, Samantha. Seems Samantha,
who was going to caddie, offered to play and let Johanna carry the
bag. ``But she said she was in too much pain,'' said Samantha,
``and people would get suspicious. We could do it, though. There's
no way to tell us apart.'' . . . Lost in the glare of Webb's streak
has been the steady play of Janie Moodie. She has three Top 10
finishes already and seems poised to break through any week with
her first LPGA Tour triumph.

RANGERS TRADE STRENGTH FOR YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ This is not standard operating procedure for
a general manager of a team that won 95 games and its second
straight division title, to trade a two-time American League MVP
and count on kids to come through at three positions (third base,
center field, and right field).
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Melvin, the general manager of the Texas Rangers, made
the tough choices, trading slugger Juan Gonzalez a year before he
could have walked as a free agent, and pointing to the Red Sox as a
reason to trust in young players such as third baseman Mike Lamb
and outfielders Ruben Mateo and Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're a little bit younger,'' Melvin said last week while
sitting in his box at Charlotte County Stadium in Port Charlotte,
Fla., ``but look at the Red Sox. They came into the spring last
year and took a chance on Trot Nixon and Jason Varitek and Brian
Daubach. They gave them a chance, and they did the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season ended for the Rangers when they were swept in the
playoffs for the second straight time by the New York Yankees, a
shocking disappointment for owner Tom Hicks, whose hockey team, the
Dallas Stars, won a Stanley Cup but whose baseball team has scored
a total of two runs in six consecutive playoff defeats to the
Bombers. Overall, the Rangers have lost nine straight postseason
games, the fifth-longest streak in baseball history. (The Red Sox
are No. 1, having lost 13 in a row until Pedro Martinez beat the
Indians in Game 1, 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the year,'' Melvin said, ``we had eight free
agents. When you have eight free agents, you pretty well know your
roster will turn over. We were trying to manage the roster and give
ourselves some payroll flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Series had been over barely a week when Melvin dropped
the bombshell, trading Gonzalez, reliever Danny Patterson, and
backup catcher Gregg Zaun to the Tigers for five players:
lefthanded starter Justin Thompson, outfielder Kapler,
closer-in-training Francisco Cordero, backup catcher Bill Haselman,
and lefthanded pitching prospect Alan Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing we did was trade Juan even before we got
involved with free agents,'' Melvin said, ``so we knew what kind of
players we would be getting for Juan and to help us make better
choices for what we still needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been more certainty in keeping Juan for this
season, but the larger risk was to let Juan go to free agency while
still trying to fill holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's intention was to keep third baseman Todd Zeile and
pitcher Aaron Sele. He balked initially at Zeile's request for a
three-year deal with a no-trade clause, eventually relented on both
counts, and thus was shocked when Zeile elected instead to sign
with the Mets, who didn't offer no-trade protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told his agent a year from now the Mets will be trying to
trade him to open $6 million or $7 million on their roster,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sele also turned down a three-year offer at $24 million and a
four-year package for $28 million from the Rangers, Melvin said.
Sele thought he'd landed a better four-year deal from the Orioles,
but when Baltimore pulled out at the last moment because of
concerns about his arm, Sele had to settle for a two-year, $15
million deal with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd signed Sele, I don't think we would have had the money
to sign Kenny Rogers and Darren Oliver,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Those lefties, along with Thompson when he comes back from
shoulder surgery, will give the Ranger rotation a radically
different look. The last two seasons, Texas had an all-righty
rotation. In the AL West, Melvin sees Mo Vaughn, Darin Erstad, Jim
Edmonds, and Garret Anderson on the Angels, the A's stacked with
lefties (Ben Grieve, Matt Stairs, Eric Chavez, Jason Giambi), and
the Mariners adding John Olerud. Having some lefties with which to
counterpunch should help the Rangers, especially if another October
rematch with the Yankees is in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope Justin is ready by the first week of May,'' he said.
``We don't want him rushing back to justify the Juan trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Melvin said, is not to win down the road. With closer
John Wetteland able to become a free agent after this season _
Texas has no plans to offer him a new deal _ the idea is to make
another run this year, while being in good position to challenge
with the kids in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we can win with this club,'' Melvin said. ``The
main thing is pitching good at the start of the year, to give our
positional guys a chance to get some at-bats on the big-league
level. Rogers, Darren Oliver, Rick Helling, Esteban Loiaza, and
Mark Clark are all established guys. And we're counting on our
bullpen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez may hit 50 home runs in Detroit's new Comerica Park.
Melvin will gladly trade those bombs for the Rangers' first trip to
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but Worcester is becoming a cradle of baseball
scouting. J.P. Ricciardi (A's), Ted Lekas (Blue Jays), Joel
Grampietro (Rangers), Stan Saleski (Giants), Paul Turco (Giants),
Tom Clark (A's), Jack Gillis (Devil Rays), Bill Livesey (Devil
Rays), and Ray Fagnant (Red Sox) all have Worcester ties. Livesey,
a special assistant to Devil Rays GM Chuck LaMar, attended
Worcester Academy, and Fagnant is an Assumption College alumnus . .
. Why did the Red Sox lose bench coach Grady Little to the Indians?
Because Cleveland gave Little a two-year contract with an option
for a third year. The Sox offered only a one-year deal . . . Are
the Yankees Derek Jeter's team? ``He won't admit to it, but yeah,''
said Sox first baseman Mike Stanley, a former Yankee teammate of
Jeter. ``He's very humble, but I think he's just a great player. He
was a little more vocal the second time I was there with the
Yankees, in 1997. There's a core group there of Jeter, Tino
(Martinez), and Bernie (Williams). Those three guys, if there's
something going on, or somebody needs to say something in a
meeting, it'll be one of those guys. They're good friends, hang out
together. Take the age out of it with Derek. Look at the ability,
the leadership qualities. When he steps off the bus, it's like the
Beatles walked off the bus.'' Will Nomar Garciaparra ultimately
assume the same role for the Sox? ``Nomar does not have that
outward expression,'' Stanley said. ``He's not someone who's going
to yell and scream. And it's tough for a young guy to speak up when
there are so many older guys on the team, guys like (Bret)
Saberhagen. Nomar kind of sits back. He likes to lead by example,
the way he prepares for a game and goes about his business.'' . . .
Count Stanley among those Red Sox who believe Darren Lewis can
still play a vital role for this club. ``He's the best outfielder
on our team and one of the five best outfielders in our league,''
Stanley said. ``And he's worked incredibly hard with Tommy Harper
this spring to learn more and more about stealing a base, for when
he comes into a game as a pinch runner.'' . . . Twins GM Terry Ryan
has been giving the same answer to every GM who calls: He's not
trading pitcher Brad Radke, at least not during spring training . .
. Catcher Ben Davis was one of the Padres' most highly touted
prospects when he was promoted last season, but he ticked off
manager Bruce Bochy and veterans like Tony Gwynn when he refused to
go to the bullpen and catch. ``Looking back on it, it was a stupid
thing to do,'' Davis said. ``But I was just so frustrated at the
time. I didn't care what was going on. I just wanted to play. I
didn't want to go sit down there in the bullpen and catch. That's
just the competitive spirit that got the best of me that day.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Former PawSox regular Jon Nunnally, who spent a brief time with
the Sox before being traded last winter to the Mets for Jermaine
Allensworth, went on a tear last week, hitting four home runs in
three games . . . Former Sox reliever Lee Smith, the majors'
all-time leader in saves, is back in the game as a coach for the
Giants. He'll spend the season as pitching coach for Double A
Shreveport, his hometown. ``I just want to get back in the game and
work with kids,'' Smith said. ``I've been doing little things with
high schools and colleges where I live. I've thrown batting
practice, but I wear those high school kids out. They aren't used
to looking at forkballs.'' . . . The Cubs have pushed pitching
prodigy Kerry Wood's first spring start back to next weekend, which
means he'll likely open the season on the disabled list. ``When I
said we are going to be cautious with him, I can't state that
enough,'' manager Don Baylor said. ``It could mean May 1, who
knows? Any type of pain, and he is off the field.'' Wood plans to
abandon his slider, which put too much stress on his surgically
repaired elbow . . . With Reds GM Jim Bowden saying the club has
been rebuffed in its attempts to deal for Radke or Jose Rosado of
the Royals, former Sox pitcher Mark Portugal has emerged as the
leading candidate to become the team's fifth starter. Portugal's
abrupt release by the Sox at the end of the season was not
baseball-related, the club's denials to the contrary . . . The
Braves will have a decision to face this offseason regarding John
Smoltz, who is to undergo Tommy John tendon-transplant surgery on
his pitching elbow. The Braves hold an $8 million option on Smoltz
for next season. The guess here is they will exercise it. . .
Florida's Josh Beckett, the 19-year-old righthander who was the No.
2 pick overall in last June's draft, put on a show in his spring
debut, topping out at 96 miles an hour while showing terrific
composure during two perfect innings against the Royals . . . Jeff
Frye, whose future seems a dead end in Boston, would love to return
to the Rangers and play in Arlington, where he lives, but that
isn't going to happen. He's being paid too much ($2.5 million) and
manager Johnny Oates hasn't forgotten the time Frye went on a radio
show and ripped him for a lack of playing time. Frye may have more
hope that the Phillies take an interest. The Phillies' faith in
Marlon Anderson appears shaky, and they could be in the market for
a second baseman . . . An agent on Garciaparra's $23.5 million
contract, with two option years that could make the package worth
$45 million: ``Dan Duquette and the Sox absolutely stole
Garciaparra. I give Dan credit. Nomar should have posters made up
saying, ``Hi, my agent cost me $36 million.' '' . . . Maury Wills
is in Expos camp as a base-running instructor . . . The Angels'
proposed starting rotation of Ken Hill, Tom Candiotti, Kent
Mercker, Ramon Ortiz, and Jarrod Washburn were a combined 22-30
last year. Maybe that's why Hill isn't talking to the media now . .
. Clip and save: After a series of meetings with franchise anchor
Alex Rodriguez, Mariners CEO Harold Lincoln proclaimed the club
would not trade the star shortstop this season, even though
Rodriguez can walk as a free agent after the season. Said Lincoln,
who is head of Nintendo USA: ``This decision is part head and part
heart. I'm as comfortable with it as any decision I've ever made as
a businessman.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Four consecutive defeats to the University of
Massachusetts. A heartbreaking loss to Rhode Island last season on
a buzzer-beating trey by Lamar Odom. To say Temple had had enough
of losing in the Atlantic 10 championship game is like saying Santa
Claus could stand to lose a pound or two.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an understatement to say St. Bonaventure entered its
first A-10 championship game in 16 seasons with a monumental task
on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-ranked Owls grabbed the first 16 rebounds of the game;
hit 8 of their first 10 3-pointers; held the Bonnies to .077
shooting from the floor over the first 11:30; and raced to a
28-point first-half lead on their way to a 65-44 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Temple was too deep, too talented, and too determined to lose
another title game. With the chance of gaining a No. 1 seed in the
NCAA tournament, the Owls put together one of the most dominant
first-half efforts in A-10 tournament history, making the second
half a formality.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament most outstanding player Quincy Wadley scored 16
points and Mark Karcher added 15 to lead Temple (26-5), which won
its first title since 1990 and is now tied with UMass for the most
A-10 titles (five).
</P>
<P>
   With No. 1-ranked Cincinnati and No. 2 Stanford losing last
week, the No. 3 Owls will most certainly earn a No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph culminates a dominant season for Temple, which lost
just two conference games. ``I think in the first half we executed
real good. That was the key,'' said coach John Chaney, whose team
led, 37-12, at halftime and maintained control in the second half
despite allowing the Bonnies to cut the lead to 50-36 with 6:08
left.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure (21-9) was the only team to beat Temple this
season after trailing the Owls at the half. Saturday night, the
Owls' first-half binge was too large to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they were waiting for this one a long time,''
said St. Bonaventure coach Jim Baron, ``and they showed it
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recent title defeats Chaney made his team watch the
victors celebrate before retreating to the locker room. Even before
the tournament, players said memories of Odom's winning shot
haunted them all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking what happened to us last year,'' said
Wadley. ``We didn't want to go through that again.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what St. Bonaventure was stacked up against. To make
matters worse, Bonnies power forward Caswell Cyrus battled a
stomach virus and didn't start. He entered with 16:34 left in the
first half but wasn't much of a factor.
</P>
<P>
   That and a solid Temple defensive front led to the Bonnies
missing 12 of their first 13 shots. The Owls, meanwhile, sank seven
consecutive treys, including one by Wadley with 6:24 left that gave
Temple a 32-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, we were playing good defense, too,'' said St. Bonaventure
senior guard Tim Winn (9 points). ``They were just making shots.
When you look up and it's 23-2, all you can think is `How do you
get back in it?' And you start taking desperation shots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who will play them in the tournament better be really
guarded,'' said Baron. ``They're a difficult team to prepare for in
a week. They played like this, and we get them twice a year in the
regular season.''

<P>
   PHOENIX, Ariz. - Milwaukee Brewers general manager Dean Taylor
says he and player-personnel vice president David Wilder went into
their job interview with Davey Lopes last October ``with no
preconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: They decided to ignore everything they'd heard
about Lopes, the former Dodgers All-Star who'd been interviewed and
turned down for major-league managing jobs by seven clubs in seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   They'd heard Lopes, 53, was gruff and grumpy, honest to the
point of verbal brutality, bitter about never getting the chance he
sought. In short, a bad interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brewers CEO Wendy Selig-Prieb, daughter of the baseball
commissioner, was committed to bringing in a long and diverse list
of applicants, so what could Taylor and Wilder do with Lopes but
listen?
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lopes had nothing to lose after so many
disappointments, so what could he do in the Brewers' office but
relax and be himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out of it asking ourselves why nobody had given Davey
Lopes the opportunity to manage before,'' Taylor said this week as
he watched Lopes manage the Brewers in a Cactus League game against
the Arizona Diamondbacks. ``He convinced us he had the
communication skills, the motivational skills and the teaching
skills that we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes supposed the answer to ``why?'' wasn't because he's a
minority - the Rhode Island native has Portuguese, African-American
and Irish heritage - but ``maybe because of my style of play
(scrappy), because I'm outspoken, because I'm too honest.''
</P>
<P>
   In his office at Maryvale Baseball Park, Lopes let out a
staccato laugh at the notion he could be (begin ital)too(end ital)
honest.
</P>
<P>
   Too honest for some general managers, who prefer acquiescent
diplomats in the manager's office? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   Too honest for his players? Never.
</P>
<P>
   It's turning out that Lopes' blunt talk is exactly what the
Brewers players wanted to hear this spring as the team of Jeromy
Burnitz and 24 other guys tries to reverse seven straight losing
seasons under Phil Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Garner raised eyebrows in 1998 when he yanked Jose Vina from a
game and chewed him out in front of the team after the second
baseman failed to run out a ground ball. It was the first time the
Brewers had seen the manager do that.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes won't wait seven years to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy's honest and tells you what to expect, I don't
think you can ask for anything more,'' said Marquis Grissom,
Milwaukee's 32-year-old center fielder and leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to sit there wondering, `What's this guy
thinking about me?' '' said relief pitcher Jim Bruske, the former
Dodger who was a Padre when Lopes was the San Diego first-base
coach from 1995-99. ``Davey's the kind of guy who doesn't care what
people think of him. He'll tell you what he thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to motivate a clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't have to see him ticked off,'' said third
baseman Jose Hernandez, who first encountered his new manager in
1991 when Lopes was the Texas Rangers' first-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' bus broke down on the two-hour drive back from a
game in Tucson the other day. Lopes later remarked to a club
executive that he was surprised the inconvenienced players stayed
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The executive said he wasn't surprised at all. After all, Lopes
was on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should rename it the Straight Talk Express. The name
is available again.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes breaks the manager mold. He wears a graying goatee, giving
him a vaguely menacing Lenny Bruce look. He showed up for a
post-hiring appearance in Milwaukee wearing a beret. He listens to
jazz in his office.
</P>
<P>
   But why is straight talk from a baseball manager considered
remarkable?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess guys are reluctant to tell (players) something they
might not want to hear,'' Lopes said before batting practice the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be a politician. They might not like what I say, but
they'll appreciate that I'm telling the truth. That's all I
expected as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopes was the Dodgers' second baseman and base-stealing leadoff
hitter for parts of 10 seasons, spanning Walter Alston and Tom
Lasorda, appearing in four World Series and capping his L.A. career
with the 1981 victory over the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came along, the guy in charge had a lot more power. If
the manager told you to do something, you did it,'' Lopes said.
``Today you get asked, `Why?' You've got to be a psychologist.
You've got to be able to talk to these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of Lopes as a screamer instead of a talker puzzles
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people thought I was going to come in with an iron fist,
you know? They don't know me,'' he said. ``If I'm what a lot of
people think I am, I'm setting myself up for failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am outspoken on issues. I believe we, as minorities, have to
speak out on certain issues, because if we don't nobody will. (But)
I'm not going to do anything to embarrass the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Embarrass the Brewers? Embarrass them worse than seven losing
seasons in a row?
</P>
<P>
   Something different, like a little straight talk, couldn't hurt
in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some people thought he was too outspoken, too brusk, too
brash,'' said Taylor, the GM. ``But that's exactly what we were
looking for.''

BARKLEY'S SEASON A STORM OF CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The circus generally comes to Madison Square Garden
in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But this year it came a few weeks early, cleverly disguised as a
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   How else can you explain the bizarre atmosphere that surrounded
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's Big East tournament championship game between the
University of Connecticut and St. John's?
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a game between the Huskies and Red Storm in March
would offer enough entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Not with St. John's and its traveling soap opera
involved. The spin around the Garden centered on St. John's guard
Erick Barkley, who has had an ongoing dispute with the NCAA over
eligibility issues ranging from the type of car he owned to how his
education at Maine Central Institute was financed.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing compared with what happened in St. John's
semifinal against Miami Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Storm came out for the second half, Barkley wasn't
with them. And when he reemerged three minutes into the second half
of a game St. John's won, 58-57, the campus minister to the
athletic department, Rev. James Mahrrer, accompanied him and was
holding his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's trainer Ron Linfonte then wrapped Barkley's left
wrist and he returned to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? ``Upset stomach,'' was the official team response
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Barkley and teammate Bootsy Thornton had a shouting
match that turned physical at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the game, an explanation of sorts emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I put this?'' said Barkley. ``Tomorrow's game, I don't
think I'm going to be attending it. I'm taking a leave of absence
from the team. I don't know if I'll be here. That's all I've got to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, we come to Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's episode of the soap opera.
Thornton scores 22 points and is named the tournament's Most
Outstanding Player. Barkley adds 19. St. John's wins its first Big
East tournament title since 1986 with a solid 80-70 victory.
Everyone smiles and says, ``What problem?''
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, after St. John's spent Saturday morning
trying to minimize the damage. Reportedly, the Red Storm had two
statements prepared _ one with Barkley back, one without him.
</P>
<P>
   After the celebrations and dances on the court, the Red Storm
were all one big, happy family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a day, quite a week, quite a month, quite a year,'' said
St. John's coach Mike Jarvis. ``This team is a family. We had a
little family dispute (Friday) night. One of our family members
probably redefined what a leave of absence is. This is a family.
When we fight and when we have arguments we have a passion that
sometimes carries over. But we care about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what next week will bring? The NCAA is pouring through
the St. John's records and reportedly talking to people.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Jarvis's future? He has never hidden that fact that
his goal is to coach in the NBA, preferably with the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   With the NCAA continuing to probe St. John's, don't be surprised
if Jarvis takes a hard look at NBA openings this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is hard to determine. St. John's, much to
Jarvis's credit, played better than expected during the regular
season despite the turmoil. The Red Storm developed a
circle-the-wagons mentality.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm have proven they can beat any team in the country.
As proof, just look at their victory over Duke at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   But what must worry Jarvis is the uncertainty in his own locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first round between Thornton and Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   With the stakes much higher, it will be interesting to see how
St. John's conducts itself.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game was a dress rehearsal for the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention will increase and the questions will not go
away.
</P>
<P>
   How St. John's deals with it will determine just how long its
season will continue.

CORNELL OUSTS HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. _ Facing a big, physical team in the playoffs . . .
on the road . . . before probably the most hostile crowd in
college. Harvard knew it was in for a rough time _ and that's what
it got.
</P>
<P>
   The pounding, hitting, and pushing finally got to the Crimson,
as the Big Red erased a 3-2 third-period deficit with two quick
strikes to win, 4-3, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night and sweep the best-of-three
ECAC quarterfinal series at Lynah Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell (15-12-2) is off to Lake Placid, N.Y., for an ECAC
semifinal match; Harvard can start making plans for spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson, who lost the opener, 4-3, here Friday night,
concluded their first season under coach Mark Mazzoleni at 11-17-2.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Prestifilippo, in playing his final college hockey game,
came up with a solid 20-save effort, but the two third-period goals
by Cornell will linger in the senior's memory for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the third period tied, 2-2, Harvard grabbed the lead at
4:41 when Chris Bala scored on a wrist shot from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   But in lightning time, the lead and the season were gone. Denis
Ladouceur tied the game at 6:29 when his shot along the ice beat
Prestifilippo on the right. Just 25 seconds later, Krzysztof
Wieckowski gained control of the puck in front of Prestifilippo and
lifted a backhander into the net for the winning strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out in two, but we could have won this thing in two,''
said Prestifilippo. ``Forget about three games, we could have won
this in two games. I'm proud of how we played, a couple of plays
were the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni lifted Prestifilippo with 1:27, but Harvard couldn't
beat goaltender Ian Burt (23 saves).
</P>
<P>
   Prestifilippo blamed nobody but himself for the tying and
winning goals. ``(The tying goal) went in, it was a problem,'' he
said. ``But the last one was a back door play, and I'd like to have
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson, playing aggressive from th opening faceoff, struck
first. Bala, skating along the right boards, tossed a centering
pass in front of the net that Jeff Stonehouse deflected past Burt
at 5:26.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell tied it, 1-1, when Doug Stienstra's wrister from behind
a screen on the left side beat Prestifilippo at 11:38. Dave Kozier
assisted on the power-play strike.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard regained the lead at 17:32 when Brett Noval deflected
Tim Stay's wrist shot from the right side into the net.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornell evened it, 2-2, just 22 second later on defenseman
Rick Sacchetti's second goal of the season. Ladouceur and Stienstra
had the assists.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni liked the strides Harvard took during this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well enough to win, but we broke down in crucial
times and they capitalized on them,'' said Mazzoleni. ``Our team
played our hearts out for six periods, and a lot of teams could not
have hung in there, it's not an easy environment to play, but we
kept our focus from the beginning to the end.''

2000 OPENER HARDLY VINTAGE FOR AYALA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The 1999 Fighter of the Year didn't get much of a
start on 2000 or much of a payday for the night he earned that
honor.
</P>
<P>
   World Boxing Association bantamweight champion Paulie Ayala
recently was accorded the same honor once won by the likes of
Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Marvin Hagler, Thomas
Hearns, Ray Robinson, Ray Leonard, and many other legends when Ring
magazine presented the Texas bantamweight with the belt it has been
handing out yearly since 1928. Ayala was named Fighter of the Year
in large part for the night he upset Johnny Tapia to win the title
last June, a fight for which he was paid the princely sum of
$60,000 _ before taxes and his manager's cut.
</P>
<P>
   That was supposed to be the start of something big for the
soft-spoken Ayala, who is a fighter only on the nights he is paid
to be one. The rest of the time, he's a quiet family man,
son-in-law of a minister who says, ``He is what a father prays and
dreams his daughter will marry.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, that's not a fighter, but in Ayala's case an
exception can be made because he is what promoter Bob Arum calls
simply ``a really nice guy.'' Not to mention a nice little boxer.
</P>
<P>
   But boxing is a business for really nasty guys. Or really
maladjusted guys. Or really aggressive guys. Normally, it is not
considered a business for really nice guys _ not if those nice guys
want to stay in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ayala is all Arum says he is as a man, and if he turns into
all the promoter hopes he'll be as a fighter, he has the potential
to be the next hot Hispanic property in Arum's stable.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the case after Ayala eschewed the
opportunity to take batting practice on an unqualified opponent in
his first title defense after beating Tapia. Instead, Ayala put his
new title on the line last October against No. 1-ranked Saohin
Sorthanikul, a fighter most bantamweights had been trying to avoid.
It was a tough fight, but that was expected, and Ayala gutted it
out, winning a clear decision.
</P>
<P>
   What was not expected was what happened last weekend in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala was heavily favored to defend his title against a kid from
Denmark named Johnny Bredhal, who admittedly was 45-1 but had
fought outside of Denmark only twice, once in a loss to Wayne
McCullough in 1995 in Belfast. So it was expected that the 1999
Fighter of the Year would launch his 2000 campaign with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was nearly a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 tough rounds, Ayala was still bantamweight champion but
by the slimmest of margins, winning a majority decision that was
not popular. Ayala had been cut under the right eye and on his
lower lip by a guy who had been paid only $10,000 to challenge for
a world title. Ayala's status as 1999 Fighter of the Year seemed to
have meant little to Bredhal but a bit more to the two judges who
voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Ayala was a winner in the end, and unlike many
boxers, he was able to keep his disappointment in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, it's still the same and I'm still the same,'' said
Ayala (30-1) of his status as a world champion. ``I'm still daddy
and husband. I'm more recognized now wherever I go, but I was very,
very surprised to even be nominated for Fighter of the Year, let
alone win it. Getting that belt was overwhelming because of the
people who have won it before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala wins the hard way in boxing, by going the distance and
exchanging flurries. He has registered only 12 knockouts in his 30
victories. For a guy who can't really punch, that is not
necessarily the wisest course of action, but it is Ayala's style
and it is what has made him an exciting attraction and a fighter
Arum believes can make big money despite being a little man.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why a rematch with Tapia is much anticipated this
year, as is a unification fight against International Boxing
Federation champion Tim Austin, because in both cases promoters
know Ayala will come to do one thing: swap punches.
</P>
<P>
   Against Bredhal, Ayala tried much the same tactics that worked
so well against Tapia but with considerably less success, though he
did drop the challenger in the second round. Though many in the
crowd at Mandalay Bay felt the underdog had put the bite on the
champion, Ayala reacted to the decision the way he does to most
things, with calm acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied with the win,'' Ayala said. ``The knockdown was
very substantial but I wasn't able to catch him to the body the way
I wanted. I felt I landed the heavier blows but I take my hat off
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of catching him to the body, Ayala caught Bredhal at the
wire, winning the final three rounds on one card and the final six
on another to pull out a slim victory. For 1999's Fighter of the
Year, it was a win that made clear what he already knew about the
boxing life he has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The Ring belt was for last year. Last weekend was the dawning of
a new year with new fights, and he found a way to win the first of
them. Maybe not the way he or Arum would have liked, but he did
what counts for a prizefighter. The Fighter of Last Year won his
first fight of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Boxing Writers Association of America originally named
Evander Holyfield its fighter of the decade, but a second vote was
demanded by Thomas Hauser, Ali's biographer and an admirer of Roy
Jones Jr.'s. Somehow, Jones nosed out Holyfield, 6-4, by a vote of
the association's executive committee. I'm on that committee but
don't ask me how it happened. Don't you have to beat a formidable
opponent sometime in 10 years to be Fighter of the Decade? . . .
Veteran trainer Teddy Atlas is again preparing Junior Jones for an
April 29 shot at the IBF featherweight title held by Paul Ingle.
Atlas originally signed on to prepare Jones for what they thought
would be a shot at Prince Naseem Hamed Saturday &UR;  &LR; night for $500,000
but that negotiation collapsed and Atlas planned to return to
ESPN2's broadcast booth and leave Jones alone. But the former world
champion was persistent, calling Atlas several times a day until he
finally agreed to prepare him for a fight that could get Jones back
on track for a big payday down the line. ``I forced myself to get
back into it a little bit,'' Atlas said. ``But Junior is a good
kid. He knows this is it. He understands my way of thinking and
that made it easier for me. He knows that when it's all said and
done, all that counts is what he did. All that counts will be his
record.'' In Atlas's opinion, Hamed was beatable if Jones had
anything left, and he believes the same applies to Ingle, who gave
Hamed hell for 11 rounds before being stopped. ``This is a winnable
fight,'' Atlas said. ``Ingle wastes a lot of movement from too far
away. You've got to sniper him. You've got to potshot him and then
feint him and run him into a punch. Junior can do that.'' He's more
likely to do it with Atlas in his corner . . . The Jones-Ingle
fight is on the undercard of the Lennox Lewis-Michael Grant
heavyweight showdown at Madison Square Garden . . . Atlas will be
in a unique situation March 24 when he not only broadcasts ESPN2's
fight card from the Blue Horizon in Philadelphia but also works the
corner of his young fighter, Elvir Muriqui, while miked. Atlas will
commentate from the corner as the fight is in progress as well as
advise his fighter between rounds. ``I'm a little worried about
this,'' Atlas said. ``It will get a lot of attention for my
fighter, but if it don't go perfect, that puts me on the spot.''
Don't bet against Atlas or his Albanian prospect . . . Felix
Trinidad and David Reid drew a disappointing 200,000 buys on
Showtime Event Television, leading Trinidad's rival promoter, Arum,
to say, ``What happened demonstrated that Trinidad is a
non-attraction. From the standpoint of marketability, he gives a
promoter a license to lose money. That card will lose $6 million-$8
million and it did nothing to help a Trinidad-(Oscar) De La Hoya
rematch.'' That's because there won't be one right away. De La Hoya
and Shane Mosley will fight June 17 at either the Staples Center in
Los Angeles or at Mandalay Bay.

   Ex-light heavyweight champion Virgil Hill gets yet another title
shot April 8 in Paris when he squares off with World Boxing
Association cruiserweight champion Fabrice Tiozzo. On the same
card, WBA super middleweight champion Byron Mitchell defends vs.
Bruno Girard for the Acaries brothers, France's biggest promoters .
. . Here's some perspective for you. Remember that war Erik Morales
and Marco Antonio Barrera put on Feb. 19 on HBO? They earned
$200,000 each, while the big-name heavyweights split millions for
doing nothing but look at each other for 12 rounds. You might want
to ask if there is no justice, but you already know the answer if
you've been around boxing for long . . . Speaking of Morales and
Barrera, don't expect a rematch soon. Morales says he has fought
his last fight at 122 pounds and Barrera insists he's not moving up
to chase him. ``I think the public deserves a rematch from us but
it will have to be at 126,'' Morales said. ``I can no longer make
the weight in this division.'' Morales will move up to
featherweight while Barrera retains his World Boxing Organization
portion of the super bantamweight title because only Morales's
World Boxing Council portion was at stake. The WBO made an
intersting move several days after the fight by declaring it would
not vacate its title because, ``This kid was screwed,'' according
to Francisco Valcarcel, president of the WBO. Valcarcel called it a
``miscarriage of justice.'' So Barrera remains the WBO champion
despite losing and says he has no interest in moving above the
122-pound limit to face a guy he just beat . . . Morales hopes to
land a shot with WBO featherweight champion Hamed, who fought
ex-junior featherweight champion Vuyani Bungu Saturday &UR;  &LR; night . . .
Thomas Hearns claims he'll make his last appearance in the ring
March 25 at Joe Louis Arena to defend the International Boxing
Organization cruiserweight title against Crawford Ashley. At 41,
it's long been time for the Hitman to stop getting hit, but he
wanted to go out a champion, and with the proliferation of belts
these days, he found one he could win. Now he says he'll defend it
one time in his hometown, where his boxing career began decades ago
in the basement of the Kronk Gym. Hopefully, Hearns (59-4-1, 46
KOs) will go out with one last knockout to remind the world he was
once one of the most feared punchers in the sport . . . Rumor is
there's a new power struggle going on for control of Mike Tyson,
with adviser Shelly Finkel being undermined by James Prince, the
rap music mogul who took over the career of Floyd Mayweather Jr.
and a half-dozen other fighters, including WBA welterweight
champion James Page.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The John Ruiz-Holyfield title fight will not be May 20. It also
won't be May 27, as Don King told the Globe weeks ago. Now it's
been put off until June 3 and will likely have the WBA portion of
the heavyweight title at stake because that organization is poised
to strip Lewis for refusing to fight its No. 1 contender . . . New
Bedford super middleweight Scott Pemberton is rated No. 13 by the
WBA . . . Word is, Dana Rosenblatt returns to the ring next month
at Foxwoods.

MORE THAN READY FACES TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The bloom came off More Than Ready's rose in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a cinch to be 1999 2-year-old champion _ and Kentucky
Derby winter book favorite _ after winning the first five races of
his career, More Than Ready finished third, beaten just a
half-length, in the Belmont Futurity Sept. 19. He then flopped in
the Champagne Oct. 9, finishing fifth as the choice, beaten 14
lengths. More Than Ready was then pulled out of training. In the
span of three weeks, he lost the 2-year-old crown (which went to
Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Anees) and prominent status for the
2000 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But More Than Ready is fighting back. He gained a dead-heat for
first (with Summer Note) in the 7-furlong Hutchinson Stakes Jan. 29
at Gulfstream, and he gets an acid test Sunmday in the $750,000
Louisiana Derby at Fair Grounds. Trainer Todd Pletcher shipped More
Than Ready out of Florida for Sunday's event, and, surprisingly,
the race came up far tougher than Saturday's more prestigious
Florida Derby. Both Captain Steve, winner of the Hollywood Futurity
and trained by Bob Baffert, and Exchange Rate, winner of the Risen
Star at Fair Grounds and trained by D. Wayne Lukas, were entered in
Louisiana. Baffert also intends to start promising allowance horse
Tribunal at Fair Grounds. Tough crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more pleased with the way the colt has
trained,'' said Pletcher via conference call Tuesday after
witnessing More Than Ready drill 5 furlongs in 1:00 3/5 at Hialeah
Monday. ``He's literally push-button. He's an easy horse to train.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was delighted with his effort in the Hutchinson. Ultimately,
we decided on the Louisiana Derby, instead of the Florida Derby,
because it's a mile and one-16th, not 1 1/8 miles (the Florida
Derby distance). It's a more gradual progression from his first
race.''
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready is by Southern Halo, out of a Woodman mare.
While he has distance breeding, he has high speed and has looked
like a sprinter on the track. Whether he can handle the 1 1/4 miles
of the May 6 Kentucky Derby is a major question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like everyone else, I'm waiting to find out,'' said
Pletcher. ``Surely, he's a gifted sprinter. He's a natural speed
horse. He's been so brilliant sprinting that people are skeptical
he can go long. But his pedigree says he can handle a distance,
maybe even a distance on grass. He definitely has the pedigree.
What makes me think he can go long is that he is a kind horse. You
have to place him forwardly, but he's not a one-dimensional speed
horse, he doesn't need the lead, and that will allow him to stretch
out.''
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready, who is regularly ridden by John Velazquez,
needs a good showing Sunday to progress toward the Kentucky Derby,
but he doesn't have to be sensational.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to the Triple Crown,'' said Pletcher, who
trains More Than Ready for owner James Scatuorchio. ``The Louisiana
Derby will do him more good than another 7-furlong race. He doesn't
have to win it to make it to the Blue Grass (at Keeneland April 15)
or Wood Memorial (at Aqueduct the same day).
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a two-turn race under his belt. He's not going
to be too far off the pace, unless somebody goes crazy. I don't
want to take him out of his natural style. To me, it's an
advantage. He has rateable speed, and I'm not going to take away
the natural speed that he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've left what appears to be an easier race in the Florida
Derby to come to a tougher race. It's too early to rate the Triple
Crown horses. No one knew about Charismatic last year, and he came
within a length of winning the Triple Crown, and became Horse of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a solid crop. They've been running fast races, and
taking turns winning. We're not ducking anybody, and we're not
chasing anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready was put on the shelf after developing a fever.
By the time the Breeders' Cup rolled around in November, the former
star had become an afterthought. But if he can regain the form he
displayed early in his career, he can become an exciting player in
a 3-year-old campaign that sorely needs one. It should also be
remembered that no Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner has ever won the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been an advantage to not run in the Breeders'
Cup,'' said Pletcher. ``I don't know exactly why he didn't run his
race in the Champagne, but we have a fresh horse now.''
</P>
<P>

   Rockingham Park has added two stakes to its 2000 schedule, and
will introduce the Brass Monkey starter handicap series. Rock has
beefed up the racing schedule over the July 4 weekend, adding the
Rockingham Park Derby, to be raced at a mile and one-16th July 2,
and the Rockingham Park Distaff Handicap, at 6 furlongs July 3. In
addition, the Lilac Stakes, run at a mile and one-16th on the turf,
has been renamed the Rockingham Park Oaks, and will be run July 1.
The schedule is designed to build toward the $75,000 Rockingham
Breeders' Cup, at a mile and one-16th on the turf for fillies and
mares July 4. The highlights of the 100-card meeting, to be held
June 11-Sept. 24, remain the Grade 3, $200,000 New Hampshire
Sweepstakes June 24, and the $100,000 Spicy Living Sweepstakes Aug.
6. The Brass Monkey series, named for a popular New England horse
of yesteryear who was known for his late charges to victory,
consists of seven races, open to claiming horses, and will begin at
a mile and one-16th, for a purse of $8,500 on June 24. The distance
and purse will grow with each race through the final on Sept. 23,
to be contested at a grueling 2 miles and 40 yards, for a purse of
$12,000.

FOR BRUINS, BEST MAY BE YET TO COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What goes around comes around, and so Steve Lavin
ought to be prepared later this week to hear some desperate coach
wax paradoxical about how his team, despite being a higher seed
than UCLA, really should be considered the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin, the Bruins' fourth-year head coach, stooped to that
strategy last year, declaring No. 12-seeded Detroit Mercy
formidable to the point of being a frontrunner against fifth-seeded
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Mercy proceeded to go out and prove Lavin right, of
course, sending UCLA home with an ugly first-round loss.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is, if the Bruins do happen to meet a higher seed
in the first round of the NCAA Tournament later this week, the
opposing coach can speak as Lavin did a year ago and chances are
it'll be construed as the god-honest truth and not some shameful
psychological ploy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, the seventh-place team in the Pacific-10 just over a
week ago, have won their past six games and are headed into the
postseason with such a hale wind at their backs, they could easily
enough sail into the second round of the NCAA Tournament or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds farcical, consider:
</P>
<P>
   Starting point guard Earl Watson played only nine minutes of the
second half Saturday and the Bruins still were able to dish out 11
assists in that time to Washington's six.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush, the player all the other Bruins plug into for
energy, appeared in only four of the final 20 minutes and yet the
Bruins managed to pad their 20-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Watson and Rush combined for 25 of UCLA's 47 points in the first
half. And zero of the team's 43 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense simply wasn't needed, not with Billy Knight
collecting all seven of his points in the second half and Dan
Gadzuric, Matt Barnes, Ryan Bailey, Ray Young and Rico Hines coming
off the bench to contribute 21 points in the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And, not since New Year's Eve in Times Square have so many petty
thieves congregated in one place. Nine of the 12 Bruins who played
pilfered the ball from a Washington player. UCLA finished with 19
steals, its highest total this season in conference play.
</P>
<P>
   After an effort like that, it's no wonder the Bruins are eyeing
bigger heists. They are quietly confident they can steal a game or
two from higher seeds in the upcoming NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of teams want to play us in the first
round,'' said Watson, who is averaging 2.3 assists for every
turnover during the six-game winning streak. ``A lot of teams are
going to look at us as a team that's seeded lower than it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach of whichever team draws a first-round date with UCLA
today probably shouldn't rush to call Huskies coach Bob Bender for
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   He's liable to steer them straight to the drug store aisle in
which the Maalox is shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Understand: Bender knows a thing or two about stealing a win or
two in the tournament. Two years ago his 11th-seeded Huskies upset
No. 6 Xavier in the first round on their way to the Sweet Sixteen.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a thief to recognize one. So when Bender said he'd hate
to meet up with UCLA this week, that should be everybody else's cue
to tack up Most Not Wanted posters featuring the Bruins' mugs on
their locker room doors today, then pray the NCAA Tournament
Selection Committee passes over them when filling in UCLA's
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Forget its 19-11 record, its recent productivity is what makes
UCLA so scary.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Huskies, the Bruins shot 44.4 percent from beyond
the arc. That's just about right, considering that in cobbling
together their six-game winning streak the Bruins have made 42 of
95 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, both the Bruins' big men, Gadzuric and Jerome
Moiso, have averaged double figures in scoring (10.5 ppg. and 11.3
ppg., respectively).
</P>
<P>
   They're stretching defenses like taffy and it's oh-so-sweet for
all the Bruins used to hearing how one-dimensional their offense
is.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a Jason Kapono 3-pointer and a cloud of dust anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has been able to execute the half-court offense,
which has been a big knock on our program for a long time,'' Watson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team still has to get better,'' he added. ``But right now
we feel like we have a lot of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you wonder, for once, if UCLA's best really
is yet to come.

KINGS POWERLESS BUT STILL WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time of year, the Kings only care about games
won, not opportunities lost.
</P>
<P>
   But as the opponents get tougher down the stretch, it might be
hard to forget their slumping power play, which could have made
Saturday night's 3-1 victory over the Calgary Flames a whole lot
easier.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 18,118 at Staples Center saw the Kings
complete a four-game season sweep of the Flames and solidify their
sixth spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But for the third consecutive game, the Kings did not score on
the power play. Four times during that span, including twice
against Calgary, the Kings failed with a five-on-three.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a man advantage. That's Christmas morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play is what wins playoff games,'' captain Rob Blake
said. ``It just has to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who close out their season-long seven-game homestand
Monday night against Vancouver, are 3-2-1 in the first six games.
That could be better if they weren't 0 for 8 Saturday, 0 for 19
with just two goals in their last 35 power-play chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our timing has to be better and we have to crash the net
more,'' said Luc Robitaille, who had two assists, including one on
Aki Berg's third-period goal. ``It isn't hard work. We're doing
that. We have to get more rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (33-27-8) did get first-period goals from Ziggy Palffy
and Craig Johnson, who beat Flames goaltender Grant Fuhr making his
first start since mid-November when he went out with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuhr stopped 35 of 38 shots and allowed the Flames to hang
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has the reflexes,'' said Johnson, a former teammate.
``He is a great talent. When I played with him in St. Louis it was
always fun to play against him in practice. He still has it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames (28-33-8) entered the game just three points behind
San Jose for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West but were
coming off dismal losses against Colorado (8-3) and Toronto (6-2).
Now, they are eight points behind the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they play so hard you can never let up,'' Kings coach Andy
Murray said. ``I look at this game as a four-point swing in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary cut the lead to 2-1 midway through the second period on
a goal by Jarome Iginla, the NHL Player of the Month for February.
</P>
<P>
   Iginla, who had a league-high 16-game scoring streak stopped by
the Avalanche, took a long pass in front from Phil Housley and
poked it past Jamie Storr for his 24th goal of the season. Iginla
had 28 all last year.
</P>
<P>
   Again the Kings power play failed them from holding off the
Flames. With 4:03 remaining in the second and Derek Morris already
off for cross checking, former Duck Bobby Dollas was whistled for
holding the stick.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Kings a five-on-three advantage for one minute and
31 seconds. They didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy scored first at 12:19 when he skated across the Flames
crease as Rob Blake fired from the slot. The rebound popped out and
Palffy slipped it under Fuhr's right pad for his 26th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Palffy, Johnson rarely gets to show off his offense. But
with less than two minutes left in the period, he and Ian
Laperriere converged in front of the Calgary goal. The puck landed
on Johnson's stick and he slid it between Fuhr's legs for his ninth
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But without the power play, the Kings could not pull away. The
first five-on-three came at 14:04 of the first when Eric Charron
went off for roughing. Darryl Shannon already was in the box from
cross checking, but the Kings couldn't capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get frustrated,'' Storr said. ``You have to take
what you are given and do your job.''

N. ARIZONA HOLDS OFF NORTHRIDGE IN OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. - It was one final amazing, stomach-twisting run
in a hard-to-believe season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge men's basketball team gave it a go in
its second serious bid to make the NCAA Tournament in the last four
years, but the Matadors just didn't have enough in an 85-81
overtime loss to Northern Arizona in the Big Sky Conference
tournament final Saturday night at Dahlberg Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the 3,316 fans who stuck around to see the wild
finish had to collect their breath when it was over. The teams, who
tied at 70 in regulation, combined for 16 points in the final
minute, and NAU had to make two free throws in the last three
seconds to secure its second tournament title since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad somebody has to lose a game like this,'' CSUN coach
Bobby Braswell said. ``I'm very, very proud of this team ... not
only for the way (the players) fought back, but the way they fought
back this whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Matadors must wait until tonight to see if their season
is over. They are hoping for an NIT bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all anticipating going to practice on Monday, getting
ready for the next (game),'' Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   NAU had the tournament savvy, playing in its third consecutive
tournament final, but it was the Matadors who showed grit down the
stretch. Northridge (20-10) scored the final nine points of
regulation to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And CSUN had a chance to win in the final seconds, but Markus
Carr's running jumper in the lane bounced off the back of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   The shot was similar to one Carr made in CSUN's 69-66 win over
NAU at Northridge in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I about had a heart attack,'' said NAU guard Adam Lopez. ``I
thought it was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ross Land, NAU's all-time 3-point shooter and the school's
second-leading scorer all-time, thought his career might be over
when the ball left Carr's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just froze,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting, because Land had the night's most magic moment.
He sank an 85-foot shot at the halftime buzzer to give the third-
seeded Lumberjacks (20-10) a 38-29 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Land, the tournament MVP, was 5 of 9 on 3-point attempts and had
20 points. He played all 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I happy to see (Land) gone? You bet,'' said CSUN forward
Brian Heinle. ``I wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinle, who made the all-tournament team, had 14 points.
However, he did not make a shot in overtime. The Matadors were
lifted in the extra period by Carr, who had the team's last eight
points.
</P>
<P>
   Carr played 42 minutes. Sure, he regretted missing the final
shot in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same play. This time it didn't drop for me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell: ``There was no question whether we were going to run
(the play). This doesn't come down to Markus winning or losing the
game. Northern Arizona won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   NAU coach Mike Adras also thought the Lumberjacks made a
statement after they started conference play 0-4 and rallied to win
14 of their final 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the best team in the Big Sky,'' Adras said. ``I'm
convinced of that. We proved it. (We) did it on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lumberjacks set a tournament single-game record with 16
3-pointers. They made an amazing 49 percent of their attempts from
beyond the arc in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona, which shot 62 percent in its semifinal win
over Eastern Washington, made 53 percent of its shots against
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping they wouldn't be able to shoot the ball well two
nights in a row and they did,'' Braswell said. ``You have to give
them a lot of credit. Ross Land, (Dan) McClintock, those guys are
veteran guys who have been to the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Adras thinks Northridge belongs in the postseason, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conference should do the best it can to get (CSUN) an NIT
bid,'' he said. ``That team deserves it.''

MARTIN'S INJURY IS A CHILLING REMINDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the best player in college basketball, Cincinnati's Kenyon
Martin, went down in a heap the other day shattering his right
fibula and ripping several ligaments in the leg one immediately
thought of the widespread impact of such an untimely injury.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it probably wipes out any chance of the Bearcats
winning the national championship and even figures to deny the team
a No. 1 seeding in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And for another, it reaffirms once again what agents and
advisers are constantly telling talented college underclassmen and
even a select group of high school seniors that they should turn
pro and take the money rather than risk a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Martin himself had benefited from staying at
Cincinnati, improving dramatically as a senior and enhancing his
status to the point he might have been the first player selected in
this year's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   He still might be, or at least might be a lottery pick, but
there also is a possibility that he might go lower because teams
might be fearful of his now uncertain physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Guys who have torn up their legs and stand 6-foot-9 and weigh
240 pounds aren't exactly sure bets to retain their former skills,
much less be able to withstand the demanding rigors of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Kenyon Martin serves as a chilling reminder of the
risks that can curse an extraordinary athlete who, for one reason
or another, decides to remain in college and pass up an opportunity
to become an instant multi-millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor jocks finishing their college education will
tell you that the four years spent in the halls of academia will
give them the opportunity to grow mentally, physically and
spiritually and also will prepare them for a vocation to fall back
on when their athletic careers are finished.
</P>
<P>
   And, certainly, in some cases this is true maybe even in the
case of the ill-starred Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But did Magic Johnson make the wrong decision opting for the NBA
season after his sophomore season at Michigan State? Did Michael
Jordan ruin his life not completing his senior season at North
Carolina? Have Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant, both of whom have
become fabulously wealthy, hurt their financial standing joining
the NBA out of high school?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   It long has been the strong feeling here that an athlete should
forgo college or at least depart prematurely if he has a chance to
earn the type of wages far beyond the reach of the rest of us mere
mortals.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if the heralded 7-foot center at Dominguez High in
Compton, Tyson Chandler, finds out next spring that he will be a
certain NBA lottery pick, can anyone with even the faintest
financial acumen blame him if decides to skip college?
</P>
<P>
   Why should Chandler spend a couple of years at, say, UCLA
earning tons of revenue for the Westwood university and for the
NCAA when he can be earning tons of money for himself?
</P>
<P>
   Why should any of the college athletes do anything for the NCAA,
a nit-picking, narrow-minded, tyrannical organization that seems to
spend all its time these days busting athletes for loans they
received in high school?
</P>
<P>
   Wow!
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the NCAA, which receives more than a billion dollars for
its basketball TV contracts and shamelessly exploits athletes, is
out trying to purify amateur sports with its ridiculous edicts and
unctuous snooping makes me sleep calmer at night.
</P>
<P>
   Why, it turns out only this week the NCAA, the reigning model of
Lord Acton's fabled
power-corrupts-absolute-power-corrupts-absolutely aphorism,
perpetuated still another petty act when it informed basketball
star Rebecca Lobo she couldn't work its women's tournament for
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   What heinous crime had Ms. Lobo committed to deserve such a
blackballing?
</P>
<P>
   Why, of course, she happens to be a professional athlete,
drawing a paycheck these days from the New York Liberty of the
WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   No way the NCAA wanted any of its telecast besmirched by such a
wretched soul!
</P>
<P>
   As you watched Kenyon Martin writhing on the floor against St.
Louis, you felt a sense of sorrow for him.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to determine how much money the injury will cost
him, but it could be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure youngsters like Tyson Chandler around the
country are looking at Martin, and thinking that such a tragic
injury also could happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   What if Kenyon Martin's leg is permanently damaged?
</P>
<P>
   What if he no longer has the spring in it that made him the most
menacing defensive player in college basketball this season?
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that any NBA team that now decides to draft
Martin will make sure he's 100 percent healthy before giving him
the standard four-year, $11 million contract that a player of his
caliber normally would be able to command?
</P>
<P>
   You also can be sure a lot of young basketball players who can
generate seven-figure contracts are now more anxious than ever to
join the NBA rather than stay in college and be savagely
scrutinized by a dictatorial governing body that should have been
forcibly disbanded by its members long ago.

 &HT;    Milledgeville celebrates its home-grown genius
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga. _ She likely would have thought it silly, but
they're naming a year after her, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In Milledgeville, where she grew up, studied, and wrote many of
her most enduring works, 2000 is ``The Year of Flannery O'Connor.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was made by Georgia College &AMP; State University,
O'Connor's alma mater. Throughout this year, the school is
sponsoring a variety of events celebrating the life and themes of
the famous writer.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, which would have been O'Connor's 75th birthday (she
died in 1964 at the age of 39), there will be a party to mark both
her memory and the release of a new book, ``Flannery O'Connor: In
Celebration of Genius.'' The book is a compilation of tributes to
O'Connor by writers influenced by her works or by her personally.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the university is sponsoring a series of seminars,
``Southern Cultures,'' in which nationally recognized experts speak
about the region upon which O'Connor drew so heavily. The lectures,
which continue through April, are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In April, there also will be an exhibit sponsored by the
university's art department of paintings by California artist Laura
Lasworth, whose works were inspired by O'Connor's writings. And in
the fall, O'Connor's works will be celebrated in the annual Arts
and Letters Festival sponsored by the university's English
department.
</P>
<P>
   All the fuss is further evidence of O'Connor's enduring and
increasingly prominent place in American literature, said English
professor Sarah Gordon, an O'Connor scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in her popularity has amazed us,'' Gordon said.
``She's become almost a cult figure.''
</P>
<P>
   In academia, it is becoming common to find one or more of
O'Connor's stories among the required readings in basic literature
courses, Gordon said. She is the editor of ``The Flannery O'Connor
Bulletin,'' a 26-year-old literary journal published at the
Milledgeville college, and this fall, her study of O'Connor's works
will be published in a book, ``Flannery O'Connor: The Obedient
Imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Connor boom has spread far beyond the literary world,
Gordon said. Celebrities including Bruce Springsteen, Tommy Lee
Jones, Holly Hunter, the rock group U2 and avant-garde film
director John Waters have all commented in recent years on how
they've been influenced by O'Connor's works. Also, O'Connor has
legions of intensely devoted fans in Europe and especially in
Japan, Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest tribute a writer can have, that people see
the world the way she saw it,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of O'Connor's characters were rural Southerners, and her
plots sometimes included twists of violence or bizarre humor.
Gordon said that led some to dismiss her writing as Southern Gothic
and her characters as ``grotesques.''
</P>
<P>
   That frustrated O'Connor, who said such labeling made her feel
``like Tar Baby stuck to Br'er Rabbit,'' Gordon said. But her
enduring popularity indicates that most people find something much
deeper in her work, Gordon added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people find something spiritually compelling
about her work,'' she said. ``She deals with issues people know
they need to think about. She jolts them back into a sense of their
own dependence on God.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon edited ``Flannery O'Connor: In Celebration of Genius.''
Some of the contributing authors will be at the March 25 birthday
celebration to sign copies of the book. Some of the writers knew
O'Connor, while others wrote of how her life and work helped shape
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Lott, South Carolina-based author of ``Jewel'' and other
novels and stories, wrote that O'Connor's essay ``The Nature and
Aim of Fiction'' became for him ``the cornerstone for my writing
life.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said writers needed to have ``a grain of stupidity,''
or something that caused them to stare at life. Such observations,
Lott wrote, have ``taught me to battle the sad and blinded belief
that at times I knew what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coles, a Harvard University medical school professor of
psychiatry and medical humanities, wrote about how and why he
teaches O'Connor to medical students.
</P>
<P>
   Coles quoted one of his students who was deeply touched by
O'Connor: ``You read her, and she won't let go of you! She has you
thinking of your real rock-bottom self _ who you are and what you
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Mairs, whose autobiography ``Waist-High in the World: A
Life Among the Nondisabled'' describes her struggle with multiple
sclerosis, writes of how she was inspired by O'Connor, who was
stricken with lupus for her last 14 years. ``You got on with the
life your illness shaped for you,'' Mairs wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mairs, who never met O'Connor, quoted a line of a poem that the
deeply religious O'Connor sent to a friend about a month before she
died: ``Raphael, Angel of happy meeting, lead us by the hand toward
those we are looking for.'' And in a postscript, Mairs added, ``And
so I close this letter in the hope that you and I will meet,
happily and soon.''

   HISTORY-COMING-CLEAN _ ``God bless you all. I am a innocent
man.'' Those were the words of Ed Johnson before he was hanged from
a metal girder on the Walnut Street Bridge in downtown Chattanooga.
The year was 1906, a time of lawlessness and vigilantism, of mob
violence directed toward blacks often wrongly accused, as was
Johnson, of raping a white woman. Johnson had been tried for the
crime and, despite a dearth of evidence _ even the victim could not
positively identify him as the assailant _ he was sentenced to die.

   UNCONVENTIONAL-PROFESSOR _ On a late-winter day of blue skies
and crisp, dry air, Roger Shattuck poses for a photographer on the
faux-Gothic campus of Oglethorpe University. He is a thinker, so
she asks him to sit with his hand to his 76-year-old face. He
amiably complies. One can be a contrarian without being contrary.
Shattuck is an unconventional thinker, as resistant to academic
fashion as he is gentle in manner. Principled disagreement he can
accept, but not the dogmas he finds seeping into the ground water
of American cultural life. One is that there can be no common
literary heritage in a country built on the banishment of the red
man, the enslavement of the black man, the exploitation of the
working man and the suppression of women of whatever color. (Skube,

musicianship to R&AMP;B music five years ago, plays the first of two
shows at the Fox Theatre tonight. We explain how this 25-year-old
with only two albums under his belt has managed to: lay a pathway
for the Maxwell and Lauryn Hills that followed his debut; attract
an older audience with his Marvin Gaye feel; receive airplay on
varying formats of radio (R&AMP;B, pop, rap and jazz) _all while his
current album ``Voodoo'' snags the no. 1 pop position atop Britney
Spears and Celine Dion. (With a little help from his seemingly
naked body in current music video, ``Untitled''). (SoMurray,

   DVD _ The handwriting is on the wall, and so are the DVDs. About
18 months ago, retail stores and video rental shops had shelf after
shelf of videotapes for sale or rent. If they carried DVDs at all,
the ratio was usually about 20 videotapes to every one DVD. Now the
shelf space ratio is down to about three to one in favor of
videotape. And don't be surprised if the margin tips in favor of
DVD in another 18 months. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 34. MOVED.

 &HT;    Across the country, people are facing up to brutal and violent
acts of the past.
 &HT;    By Jeff Dickerson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``God bless you all. I am a innocent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the words of Ed Johnson before he was hanged from a
metal girder on the Walnut Street Bridge in downtown Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1906, a time of lawlessness and vigilantism, of mob
violence directed toward blacks often wrongly accused, as was
Johnson, of raping a white woman. Johnson had been tried for the
crime and, despite a dearth of evidence _ even the victim could not
positively identify him as the assailant _ he was sentenced to die.
Abandoned by his court-appointed lawyers who feared for their own
safety, Johnson's case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by
two black Georgia lawyers. A stay of execution was granted,
angering the locals. A mob, aided by the local sheriff, spirited
Johnson from his jail cell and headed for the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson swayed from the end of a rope, bullets riveted his
body, with one severing his noose. Still uncontent, a gunman
approached Johnson's limp body after it crashed to the ground and
fired five slugs into his skull.
</P>
<P>
   The young man's last words have survived the test of time. Two
weeks ago, before a courtroom of whites and blacks and young
children, a Chattanooga judge overturned Johnson's conviction.
``The object was to bring in a black body, not necessarily the
person who had committed the crime,'' declared Judge Douglas A.
Meyers in reversing the ruling. ``And I think that's what happened
in this case. There was a rush to find somebody to convict and
blame for this.''
</P>
<P>
   With its magnanimous, albeit century-old act of contrition,
Chattanooga joins a growing list of other cities and small towns
seeking to come clean with ugly instances of their racial pasts.
From Arkansas to Oklahoma, Missouri to Florida, the nation is
experiencing a mini-wave of localities facing up to brutal, violent
acts of the past, with a few even offering compensation to victims
and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1882 and 1968, some 4,742 Americans were lynched, the
overwhelming majority of them black, according to the Census
Bureau. Race riots _ in New York and New Orleans in 1900, Atlanta
in 1906 and many others _ took the lives of thousands more. Over a
six-month period in 1919 alone, there were mass attacks on blacks
in 25 towns in the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for rattling skeletons in these long-shut closets
are varied. Sufficient time has elapsed so that fact-finding is
more an historical purging of guilt than a search for culprits,
most of whom are dead. African-Americans who grew up hearing
stories of brutal lynchings and mass killings have gained political
power and forced communities to confront their past. And older
Americans are coming clean with their consciences instead of going
to their graves with secrets that haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   Even corporate America is clearing its conscience. On Thursday,
Aetna Inc. apologized for selling policies in the 1850s that
reimbursed slave owners when their slaves died. ``We express our
deep regret over any participation at all in this deplorable
practice,'' said Aetna spokesman Fred Laberge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go forward and race problems to be made right, I
think we need to talk about these things and embrace them,'' says
Georgia Supreme Court Justice Leah Sears, who has asked that
portraits be hung in the state Judicial Building of the black
lawyers who helped Johnson. ``The truth has to come out.
Forgiveness and reconciliation really only come to pass once these
things are examined, apologies are made _ in some cases even a
proper payment is made, and I'm not talking about (reparations). I
think all that has to happen for us to go forward as a people
together. Maybe this is just the time for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that seems to be of international scope, possibly
brought on by a turn-of-the-millennium sense of contrition. Today,
for instance, Pope John Paul II is expected to deliver an apology
for centuries of sins committed by Roman Catholics in the
Holocaust, the Inquisition, the Crusades and in wars against other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   'A 21ST CENTURY THING'
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has undergone a similar fact-finding mission
through its Truth and Reconciliation Commission. ``One of the
fundamental issues of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was
to say this is what was done, and to whites, this was what was done
in your name,'' said Naomi Tutu, program coordinator of the
Institute for Race Relations at Fisk University and daughter of
former South African Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we are at a point globally, and it might be a
21st century thing, that people feel far enough removed from the
real horrors of slavery and of violence against people of color
that it feels a little bit safer to say `Let's search our souls,'''
says Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   James Allen, an Atlanta antiques collector, has also found
Americans willing to peer into America's ugly racial past. His
exhibit of some 60 photographs of lynchings, most of them picture
postcards, attracted national attention and lured thousands to a
small New York gallery. A book that includes 98 images of
lynchings, ``Without Sanctuary,'' went through two printings in its
first six weeks on the shelves. And on March 15 his collection,
usually housed at Emory University, moves to the New York
Historical Society, with far more space and 40 additional images.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest hope is that Americans will acquire a visual
vocabulary of racial violence and include that in their discussions
about contemporary issues, like racial profiling, the death
sentence, the ratio of blacks on death row ... and eventually there
will be restitution paid to these families that were decimated by
racial violence,'' says Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Rosewood, Fla., seems to have provided the catalyst for what
Tutu terms ``restorative justice.'' In 1994, the Florida
Legislature accepted responsibility for failing to protect the
victims of a mass murder that began New Year's Day 1923, when a
white mob raged into the tiny town southwest of Gainesville, intent
on avenging the rape of a white woman in neighboring Sumner. It was
later learned the alleged victim, a married woman, had been having
an affair with a railroad man, who may have beaten her.
</P>
<P>
   The mob burned every building in Rosewood except for the only
white-owned home. A minimum of six blacks were killed _ possibly as
many as 150. Accurate records of mass racial murders are virtually
nonexistent. The Florida Legislature awarded $150,000 each to nine
survivors and $500,000 to heirs of Rosewood property and created a
$100,000 scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
   Following Florida's lead, the Tulsa Race Riot Commission last
month recommended reparations to heirs and survivors in what was
possibly America's deadliest race riot. On May 30, 1921,
19-year-old shoeshiner Dick Rolland boarded an elevator in downtown
Tulsa and, legend has it, brushed against Sarah Page, a white
17-year-old elevator operator. Page screamed, ran into a nearby
clothing store and called police, who arrested Rolland.
</P>
<P>
   Page quickly labeled the whole affair a misunderstanding, and
she refused to press charges against Rolland. But rumors of
Rolland's lynching circulated, and a racial confrontation outside
the courthouse turned into a conflagration. Within a day or so,
Tulsa's storied black business community, once known as ``Black
Wall Street,'' was destroyed, and some 300 blacks were murdered.
One Tulsan described the swift carnage as the town's ``temper
tantrum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma Legislature last week voted to extend the life of
the riot commission, and will have to approve any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days after the Tulsa Commission recommended
restitution, some 200 academics and community leaders assembled in
Helena, Ark., to search for details of a 1919 murder spree in
Elaine, in which several dozen to several hundred blacks were
killed. The origin of the Elaine riot is a subject of debate.
Witnesses are dead, memories are dimmed, records are nonexistent.
``There was a systematic purging of the historical record of the
riot'' in Tulsa and elsewhere, says collector Allen. Arkansans,
therefore, will have to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUE OF REPARATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The search for truth is also under way in Springfield, Mo.,
Sherman, Texas, and closer to home, in Athens, where the biracial
Moore's Ford Memorial Committee labors to commemorate two black
couples brutally lynched at Moore's Ford Bridge in Oconee County on
July 25, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   A constant undercurrent to this unearthing of blood and pain is
the issue of reparations. U.S. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has
asked Congress to appropriate $8 million to establish a panel to
study whether African-Americans should be compensated for slavery
and the lynchings and mass murders that followed. Randall Robinson,
president of TransAfrica, has written a new book favoring
reparations, ``The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks,'' arguing
that restitution could also come in the form of uplift programs. A
precedent for reparations was set when Congress authorized $1.8
billion in payments to Japanese-Americans interned during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are unsympathetic to the idea of cash payments,
arguing that restitution has and continues to be made in the form
of civil rights guarantees and billions of dollars in
social-welfare programs. But Naomi Tutu believes some payback is
essential, though it need not take a pecuniary form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying you're sorry has to come with something,'' says Tutu.
``It doesn't necessarily have to come with money, but it has to
come with some tangible thing that shows people that you're being
contrite _ not to be politically expedient _ but that the
contrition comes from somewhere deep within you.''
</P>
<P>
   For Richard Rusk, secretary of the Moore's Ford committee, part
of restitution is commemoration. His group held a military service
for George Dorsey, who had arrived home from World War II just nine
months before his lynching at Moore's Ford Bridge in Oconee County.
</P>
<P>
   ``History like this tars an entire race of people, in my case
the white race,'' says Rusk. ``Every American out there killed in
this fashion ought to have a marker. This story's been well told in
the history books and in documentary films. But the real work needs
to be done _ and the memorials need to be held _ in the communities
where these killings occurred, where the descendants of the victims
and the killers live on.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nothing is more predictable in a case like the one
involving football star Ray Lewis than this: Eyewitness accounts
will vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with a chaotic, dimly lit scene,'' said
defense attorney Jack Martin. ``It would be more suspicious if
everyone had the same story.''
</P>
<P>
   And the stories do vary widely in the case of the street melee
that occurred in the early morning hours after the Super Bowl near
a Buckhead nightclub, leaving two men, Jacinth Baker and Richard
Lollar, stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting have been charged
with murder.
</P>
<P>
   In some versions, Lewis is described as a ``peacemaker'' who
tried to stop the fight. In others, he's an angry bystander, unable
to ``control his boys.'' In another, he's an assailant, throwing
punches.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen people saw part or all of what transpired that
morning. But finding witnesses and getting them to speak has been a
daunting task for both the prosecution and the defense. One of
Lewis' attorneys, Ed Garland, has resorted to buying an ad in the
free metro Atlanta paper Creative Loafing. Prosecutors have begun
offering grants of immunity to those who may have played some role
in the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Through interviews, court hearings and investigative records,
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has obtained statements from nine
witnesses who were in Buckhead the morning Baker and Lollar were
stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly other witnesses who will testify at trial,
now scheduled for mid-May. Neither the prosecution nor the defense
is necessarily building a case solely around these witnesses. But
these nine have all been interviewed by either the prosecution or
the defense and are expected to be on the witness list for trial.

 &HT;    Products' popularity continues to grow at an explosive rate
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The handwriting is on the wall, and so are the
DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, retail stores and video rental shops had
shelf after shelf of videotapes for sale or rent. If they carried
DVDs at all, the ratio was usually about 20 videotapes to every one
DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Now the shelf space ratio is down to about three-to-one in favor
of videotape. And don't be surprised if the margin tips in favor of
DVD in another 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   SALES SKYROCKET
</P>
<P>
   Though DVD players have been on the market only three years,
nearly 5 million people have DVD players in their homes, according
to the Consumer Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most successful product introduction in electronics
history, the association said. In 1997, the first year DVD players
came on the retail market, 349,000 of them were sold. The second
year more than a million were sold, and last year sales were 3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, CD players, introduced in the early 1980s, sold
35,000 units their first year and 1 million in their third.
</P>
<P>
   VCR sales didn't take off as fast as DVD sales when VCRs were
introduced, but VCR sales still far outweigh DVD sales at this
point. Nearly 23 million VCRs sold last year, according to the
Consumer Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of DVDs in the marketplace is dramatic. The selection
of DVD players has exploded in the past year, prices are falling
and they were one of the hottest technology gift items last
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   DVD prices are not falling nearly as fast as prices of competing
formats. If you haven't shopped for a VCR or CD player you may be
shocked by the bargains currently available.
</P>
<P>
   Super VHS players, for example, are available for less than
$300, about half what they sold for a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   CD player prices are similarly depressed. As mentioned earlier,
CD players were introduced in the early 1980s, so many of the
first- and second-generation players are reaching the end of their
lifespans.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of buying new CD players, many consumers are opting
for DVD players. DVD players, whose prices are comparable to those
of CD players a couple years ago, not only play DVD movies, but
also CDs. Replacing a CD player with a DVD player provides extra
entertainment options without spending much extra money.
</P>
<P>
   VCRs aren't going to go away completely any time soon, however.
Nearly 23 million VCR decks sold last year, according to the
Consumer Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback of DVD at this point is that you can't make your
own DVD recordings the way you can make recordings with your VCR.
Recordable DVD may show up someday, but that's not expected within
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Greene, a spokeswoman for Blockbuster Entertainment said
Blockbuster expects to carry both formats for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster stores started carrying DVDs last year, and Greene
said the average store in the chain carries about 200 DVD titles
for rental and 50 for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Projections say that by the year 2007, VCRs will be in 90
million homes,'' Greene said. ``DVDs should be in 40 to 50 million
homes by that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason people shouldn't have both. DVD and
videotape complement each other.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD BASICS
</P>
<P>
   DVD originally stood for digital video disc, and a few marketing
types for a while tried to get consumers to call them digital
versatile discs. But like VCR and CD, the initials have become the
name.
</P>
<P>
   A DVD is a thin, rigid plastic disk about 4 inches wide, just
like a CD or a computer CD-ROM or a digital game system disc, but a
DVD can be packed with more information.
</P>
<P>
   Information is stored digitally (as a numeric code) on the shiny
surface of the disc. A laser device scans the information, and a
processor interprets the data as video and audio signals.
</P>
<P>
   DVD movies also often come with extra footage not seen in
theatrical releases, movie trailers, interviews and related music
videos.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of DVDs are movies. They sell for
about $10 to $35, with most selling for about $19.99 and $24.99.
</P>
<P>
   DVD player prices start at about $170 in local stores, and
several high-end models fall in the $2,000 to $5,000 range. A few
models cost more than $25,000. Most sell for $200 to $800, and
prices are dropping.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the market for a DVD player you should be aware
that DVD still is a developing technology, and DVD players five
years from now probably will be completely different than those
being sold now.
</P>
<P>
   One big question is how DVD will interface with high-definition
television. DVD is a digital format that produces higher picture
resolution than VHS videotape and current broadcast television
signals, but DVD players currently don't produce the picture
quality level needed to meet the official high-definition standard.
</P>
<P>
   By the time basic television broadcasts are in high definition a
few years down the road, DVD players may also be capable of
high-definition performance.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is networking. A major trend in home electronics
is convergence _ the linking of computers, home entertainment
equipment and other home appliances into a single network that
allows all the electronic gear to work together better.
</P>
<P>
   Because a single standard for networking has yet to be widely
adopted, electronic components sold today may not connect easily to
network-ready components when they become available.
</P>
<P>
   One strategy is to buy a moderately priced DVD player with the
understanding that it probably will be replaced within five years.

 &HT;    iPhone helps simplify confusing online navigation

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Not everyone who wants to use the Internet wants
to own a computer, but just about everybody wants to own a phone.
</P>
<P>
   InfoGear Technology Corp. of Redwood City, Calif., offers the
iPhone, a telephone with a 7.4-inch touch-sensitive screen that can
bring consumers most of the benefits of the Internet without the
complexity, expense and space-hogging bulk of a full computer.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone occupies an area on a desk about the same size as an
office telephone, and it performs all the functions of a phone. It
has caller ID with call blocking, a digital answering machine with
remote message access, a built-in directory for storing phone
numbers and other information and a log to store a list of incoming
and outgoing calls.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone also has programmable speed-dial keys and speaker
phone functions and is compatible with network voice mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to its voice line for the telephone system,
iPhone has a separate data line and all the equipment to access the
Internet even while talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone has a full-size keyboard that slides into a
compartment at the bottom of the phone when not in use. The
keyboard can be used to write e-mail or type Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The screen of the iPhone is touch-sensitive so the users doesn't
have to use a mouse to point and click icons on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the controls are one-touch buttons, so it's easy to call
up and use the phone's various functions. The device has a built-in
56k modem, and Internet access is fairly fast.
</P>
<P>
   InfoGear says iPhones also are easy to install. They are simply
plugged into phone lines and a power supply. Software included with
the phone helps the user register the product and access InfoGear's
iPhone Web site. From there the user can use InfoGear Network
services.
</P>
<P>
   InfoGear supplied iPhones to the media during the International
Consumer Electronics Show in January, and they were a big hit.
Their best feature is probably ease of use; even novice users were
able to master them quickly without instruction manuals.
</P>
<P>
   The main limitation of iPhone is its relatively small,
black-and-white liquid crystal screen. It's fine for e-mail, but it
doesn't deliver all the colorful excitement of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone, which won a Best of Show award at the Consumer
Electronics Show, is available through several online retailers.
Check www.infogear.com for more information and links to retailers.
The product's suggested retail price is $399.
</P>
<P>
   Big Planet sells iPhone by phone. Call (800) 487-5200 and refer
to item number 468 645 4001.

 &HT;    Professor out to put 'learning' back into education
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a late-winter day of blue skies and crisp, dry air,
Roger Shattuck poses for a photographer on the faux-Gothic campus
of Oglethorpe University. He is a thinker, so she asks him to sit
with his hand to his 76-year-old face. He amiably complies. One can
be a contrarian without being contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck is an unconventional thinker, as resistant to academic
fashion as he is gentle in manner. Principled disagreement he can
accept, but not the dogmas he finds seeping into the ground water
of American cultural life. One is that there can be no common
literary heritage in a country built on the banishment of the red
man, the enslavement of the black man, the exploitation of the
working man and the suppression of women of whatever color.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that children learn little from old-fashioned
memorization and step-by-step drills, but would be eager to
discover entire worlds on their own if only the teacher would get
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   From all such notions Shattuck dissents, and he had come to
Oglethorpe to say why.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, he was there to present the plenary address at a
symposium whose theme was ``Celebrating the Liberal Arts: Making a
Life, Making a Living,'' part of Oglethorpe's inauguration of its
new president, Larry D. Large. His address, titled ``The Phony War:
Rote Learning vs. Critical Thinking'' and delivered to an audience
of about 200 faculty members and alumni, had none of the rancor
that often attends debates about American education. Indeed, its
quiet good sense could have fooled a person into thinking Shattuck
was an accommodationist.
</P>
<P>
   But a man willing to divide books into the good and the bad does
not accommodate easily. Shattuck, in fact, has set out to practice
what he preaches _ this at a time when others would be enjoying
retirement. Professor emeritus of modern languages and literature
at Boston University, he is running for the school board in
Lincoln, Vt. (population 974), all because he thinks public schools
in the United States have put the cart before the horse _ or, to
park the cliche, have abandoned a subject-centered classroom for a
child-centered classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to friends, the idea of running for the school
board came up,'' he says. ``There was no opening at the time, and
now there is. I felt I should follow up in the real world what I
had been saying in the academic world.'' The election is in April.
</P>
<P>
   CURRICULUM HARD TO FATHOM
</P>
<P>
   A man who has critics does well to have credentials. Shattuck
has been elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and honored by the American Academy and Institute of Arts
and Letters. One of his eight books, ``Marcel Proust,'' won a
National Book Award in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   So here is this well-laureled scholar in his retirement poring
over thick volumes of educationese churned out by Vermont's
curriculum experts. ``I wanted to know what they believed a proper
curriculum should be,'' he says. ``But it's impenetrable. In all
those pages upon pages,'' he says, ``the words `to study,' `to
learn' never appear. Nor does the word `fact.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery to Shattuck that American high school students
do poorly on achievement tests when compared with students from
Japan and Korea, the Czech Republic and Singapore. ``They've never
been taught anything,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   They've been doing paper-and-scissors ``projects'' and all
manner of busy work, but nothing that furnishes the mind with a
coherent understanding of the world or hones it to think with
discrimination. That's why Shattuck thinks the debate between rote
learning and critical thinking is bogus: Memorization of the
multiplication tables, the capitals of the states and the
succession of American presidents does not by itself make one
educated. But you can't very well think ``critically'' if you don't
know anything _ and public education in the United States has
de-emphasized rudimentary knowledge of fact for ambiguous knowledge
of self.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our schools fail, we just scatter in all directions,''
Shattuck says. ``The function of an education is to transmit a
heritage, not to undermine it. But we've being doing it backward.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CANDID AND PERVERSE
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck does not separate the two, education and literature,
education and the arts. They are all part of a web that defines how
we make a living and how we make a life. Which is why he is willing
to say there are books whose influence has been morally harmful,
and others whose moral influence goes by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   This being the case and this being the United States _ home of
Top 10s in everything from college football teams to summer
vacation spots _ why not make a list? When his book ``Candor &AMP;
Perversion: Literature, Education and the Arts'' came out last
year, Shattuck amiably complied in this, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Bob Weil's idea,'' he says, referring to his editor at
W.W. Norton &AMP; Co. ``He wanted me to do it because he said it would
help interest people in the book. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't _
I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   A smart publicist might say that the book's title was not one
conceived with high sales in mind. If a sweetener would pique
curiosity, a Top 10 list of ``candid'' books and ``perverse'' books
would seem to fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I originally did 12,'' Shattuck says, ``but Bob wouldn't have
it. `Nope,' he said, `it must be 10.'''
</P>
<P>
   Evil being more interesting than good, the eye turns first to
the side of Shattuck's ledger that says ``Perverse.'' Among its
entries: ``Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,'' by Alfred Kinsey.
The pioneering sex researcher ``was a charlatan twice over,''
Shattuck says. He not only made false claims about the scientific
nature of his work, but argued for the moral equivalence of all
sexual behavior. And of E.O. Wilson's widely reviewed, much praised
``Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge,'' he says: ``The world's
greatest authority on ants has written a book that seeks to make
ants out of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't much use for Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx or Michel
Foucault, either.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck would rather see college students reading Albert Camus'
``The Stranger,'' Helen Keller's ``The Story of My Life''
(``Combined with Annie Sullivan's remarkable letters, 'The Story of
My Life' gives a double account _ inside and outside _ of how a
profoundly disadvantaged child learns to learn, to speak, to love
and to respect others.'') and Tolstoy's ``War and Peace'' (``How do
we learn about life? The media distort life so often and rely so
heavily on stereotype that we live with a caricature of ourselves
... (From) Tolstoy's great bear hug of a book ... we learn about
life at its fullest.'')
</P>
<P>
   Top 10 lists are fun, but the real point of ``Candor &AMP;
Perversion'' was a critique of easy assumptions and the pursuit of
knowledge that only debases life. He encapsulates much of that
critique in 19 theses that form the bases of both it and an earlier
book,
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbidden Knowledge: From Prometheus to Pornography.'' Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Across millions of years we have evolved a fairly stable
human nature, which contains an elusive element of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Works that have survived for centuries cannot be dismissed
out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Like our terrestrial environment, our literary, intellectual
and moral environment needs to be wisely cultivated and
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Let us eschew the freestanding word text. Let us take
advantage of terms like novel, poem, play, essay.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We teach what we hope to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Reliance on methodology tends to eliminate the experience
and the love of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``In a free society, the primary role of education is the
transmission of a heritage, not its primary subversion.''
</P>
<P>
   `CULTURAL CONSERVATIONIST'
</P>
<P>
   You can size him up rather easily _ or you think you can. He is
a Great Books man, and he is a conservative. Shattuck smiles,
knowing the latter word is often an epithet, and says: ``I'm a
political liberal and a cultural conservative _ no, what I'd really
say is that I'm a cultural conservationist. I don't know how you're
going to explain that to your readers, though.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, some would say, a man who doesn't know which way the wind
blows. ``I've debated with Roger on this subject, and I think he
exaggerates the importance of the texts we teach,'' says Gerald
Graff, a literary critic and associate dean of curriculum and
instruction at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``What I
tried to persuade Roger of _ unsuccessfully, I guess _ is that the
problem is not which books we teach but books themselves. Because
American students grow up in an anti-intellectual environment, any
kind of reading poses a challenge. When this is the case, it
doesn't make much difference whether you're teaching Shakespeare or
Alice Walker. There is a deeper problem here and that's the problem
of literacy itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Graff ready to join in Shattuck's criticism of public
education _ that it is more concerned with how something is taught
than what is taught. ``I'm a content man myself,'' he says, ``but
we've all had bad teachers ... people who know the subject but
didn't know how to teach. So I think the education people have a
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In his little township of Lincoln, Shattuck knows very well
which way the wind blows and he intends to walk directly into it.
``That's why I'm running for the school board,'' he says. ``If
people don't try to change things, they're just going to get
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the practical and the intellectual must meet.
``It comes down to how you view the world,'' he says, ``and what
you believe about human life.''

 &HT;    Parents have gotten the message about car seats for babies, but
many older children still face terrible risks
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Theresa Driscoll-Miller pulled her Chevy Suburban into
the car pool line outside Atlanta's New Century School.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, her 8-year-old son, Frankie, climbed into the
spacious back seat next to the family dog, Moe, snapped on the seat
belt and started playing his GameBoy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a daily routine played out every day in cars all across the
nation. And it puts thousands of children at risk for serious
injury or death
</P>
<P>
   Too big for most child car seats and too small for standard seat
belts, children from preschoolers to third-graders are literally
being put in harm's way. Too many sit in the front seat, where an
exploding air bag could kill them if a crash doesn't. Others sit in
the back, where it's safer, but have shoulder belts rubbing against
their necks, lap belts stretched across their delicate stomachs, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   That's despite recent pediatric and highway safety
recommendations that children who are under 9 years old and weigh
less than 80 pounds use either a booster seat or a ``youth'' seat _
a step up from a car seat _ when riding in a car. Experts say that
at least half of the approximately 500 children a year who died in
auto accidents from 1994 to 1998 might have survived if they had
been properly restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Most people have gotten the message about properly restraining
babies in cars, says James Nichols, director of research at the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But many parents
are still unsure about the best way to buckle up older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear we haven't done a very effective job in
getting the message out,'' Nichols said. ``Parents have no idea how
important this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Seat belts were designed for people weighing at least 80 pounds
and at least 4 feet 8 inches tall. That's tall enough to sit
squarely against the back of the seat and have the knees bend at
the end of the seat. The lap belt is meant to go across an adult's
lap, and the shoulder belt to fit over the chest. In an accident,
the force of impact is spread out over the rib cage and the pelvic
region as the belts tighten down and across.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a young child's size, the lap belt falls across
the abdomen _ one of the softest and weakest parts of the body. In
a wreck, the force of the crash can be concentrated in the lap
belt, causing it to squeeze the child like a rope wrapped around a
pillow. As a result, the child can sustain internal injuries and a
broken back.
</P>
<P>
   Children in the front seat are also at risk. They tend to be
more active than adults, playing with the dashboard or radio. In a
crash, they can be propelled forward, improperly restrained by a
loose-fitting seat belt designed for adults. If the car has a
passenger-side air bag, the 200-mph force of the deploying bag can
break their necks.
</P>
<P>
   As of December 1998, almost 70 children had been killed by
passenger air bags, according to National Safe Kids. And statistics
show that, very often, when a child has been killed riding in the
front seat, law enforcement officers have found the back seat clear
_ meaning the youngster could have been sitting in a more safe
position. ``In over 90 percent of the cases, there is an available
seat in the back,'' said Dr. Kyran Quinlan, a pediatrician and a
medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials also remind parents _ especially those
who have bought, in Driscoll-Miller's words, ``mondo-tank''
sport-utility vehicles _ that the dynamics of a crash don't change
much, regardless of the automobile's size.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents said they haven't bought into the child-booster
advice because they wonder if they make that much difference. Some
flinch at the cost of paying $25-100 for a booster or ``youth
seat,'' after shelling out $35-100 for a child safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply remember when children tumbled about in the
station wagon _ without seatbelts, car seats or boosters - when a
youngster's greatest protection was a mother's arm thrust across
his or her chest as the car came to a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the `In my day' argument,'' Quinlan said. ``Well, in those
days, the death rates were significantly higher than they are now.
And to be honest, I could never understand why any of us would
reject new ideas about safety that clearly saves lives just because
that's not what we're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   State legislators have been slow to follow the science. Although
the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration has outlined booster seat guidelines for
children older than 3 years old, not a single state requires that
kids be restrained in such seats.
</P>
<P>
   All states do require that children under the age of 4 be
restrained. And 25 require that children up to 16 be restrained _
that is, wearing a seatbelt at all times.
</P>
<P>
   But many child-safety experts believe the letter of the law is
too narrowly drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first battle line is most likely to be drawn
between parents and their kids. Nichols, of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, has a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old.
The 8-year-old is not happy at all about his dad's beliefs on
booster seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a lot of problems with him about this,'' said
Nichols. ``There isn't a child in his class who's in a booster seat
and he's embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   But like another child safety issue _ bicycle helmets _ experts
say parents need to stick to their guns and explain why it is
important that their child do this. And eventually, what was seen
as odd becomes routine.

 &HT;    `Once and Again' deserves a place in prime time
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't just watch an episode of ``Once and Again'';
you survive it. Death, divorce, sullen teenagers, difficult
parents, economic insecurity, sexual infidelity, job stress _ it's
push-the-boomers' buttons time, writ large but writ well.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, and it started off as such a nice little romance.
</P>
<P>
   When the ABC drama debuted in September, it drew a major
audience for the story of Rick (Billy Campbell), a cleft-chinned,
divorced architect who always knows the right thing to say, who met
and wooed Lily (Sela Ward), a 41-year-old separated mom of two who
looked like a former Wilhelmina model but was still very
believable, very identifiable, as a middle-aged woman who really
needed to be wooed by a sensitive, cleft-chinned architect.
</P>
<P>
   They made love in episode two, but since then their onscreen
love life has been pretty dismal _ they've been too busy fouling
off life's curveballs. But Rick and Lily's loss has been viewers'
gain, as ``Once and Again'' has morphed into a rich, challenging
meditation on modern families.
</P>
<P>
   It's also become The Sela Ward Show, as her Lily (who can look
drawn and worried and still have fab cheekbones) has become the
hub, and everyone else, even Rick, a Lily satellite. (Heck, all of
TV has become The Sela Ward Show. She starred in a CBS movie last
week, has a Lifetime documentary called ``The Changing Face of
Beauty'' coming Sunday, and then there's those damnably ubiquitous
``Nickel Nights'' phone commercials she does.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week Lily's dad died of a stroke, and tonight we get the
funeral, the shiva (a Jewish period of mourning) and the kind of
messy complications that make ``Once and Again'' so delightfully
squirmy. Turns out Lily has to cope with a mentally handicapped
brother who's in a group home; and the turbulent feelings of her
young daughters, who react to everything like insect antennae; and
a fiendishly complicated financial-emotional situation with her
almost-ex-husband Jake involving the restaurant jointly owned by
Lily, Jake and her parents.
</P>
<P>
   When it's over, you'll have watched an hour of TV that will
leave you and your box of Puffs Super Plus empty. This is fun? This
is escapism? Not even, but it's intense.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers seem to be ambivalent about such intensity, however.
``Once and Again'' started with Nielsen ratings that put it in the
Top 10. But between its move to Mondays in January and the
darkening and deepening of the series, the ratings have been
falling, from almost 17 million when it debuted to less than 10
million in February sweeps. Last Monday's episode showed an upward
bounce, though, and ABC is pleased that it wins its time slot in
adults 18-49, the age group advertisers most covet.
</P>
<P>
   The knock on ``Once and Again'' is that everyone is whiny and
self-absorbed, which was the same knock on ABC's
``thirtysomething'' a decade ago, and isn't any more true now than
it was then. Of course, both shows are from the same creative team,
Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, who are the Rodgers and
Hammerstein of middle-class narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' has evolved into ``thirtysomething'' with an
extra decade of wear and tear. You could sense the similarity in
the first weeks, but in the last month it's become inescapable.
They even imported Miles Drentell, the Mephistophelean boss from
``thirtysomething,'' to torment poor Billy for a few episodes.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``thirtysomething'' the kids were young and peripheral;
on ``Once and Again,'' they've muscled onto center stage,
particularly Grace (Julia Whelan), Lily's 14-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, gawky and insecure, unconventionally beautiful but
painfully unaware of it, a trial to her mother but with a soul to
treasure, Grace is the most fully realized adolescent on TV since
Angela in ``My So-Called Life'' (whaddya know _ another
Zwick-Herskovitz show).
</P>
<P>
   Whelan is so good that viewers don't notice how good she is;
people just assume she is Grace, when really ABC should be putting
up billboards touting the most promising young actress discovery
since Claire Danes in ``Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of ``Once and Again'' is uncertain; ABC likes it, but
network execs cancel shows they like all the time if they don't
clear the Nielsen bar. If all television were like this, we'd bug
out. But there ought to be room for an hour a week for a show so
steeped in integrity.
</P>
<P>
   `DOONESBURY' CHARACTER GOES LIVE ON `LARRY KING'
</P>
<P>
   ``Doonesbury'' comic strip character Uncle Duke will appear on
CNN's ``Larry King Live'' at 9 tonight in King's first live
interview with a cartoon character. In Garry Trudeau's politically
oriented strip, Duke has been running for president, and he will
discuss his candidacy tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is being handled by DotComix, a San Francisco
technology firm. DotComix's Buzz Hayes, who says his title is
``executive producer of the Duke 2000 campaign,'' won't go into
much detail about how Duke will talk to King live (and take viewer
phone calls), except to say that an actor in an electronic suit
will listen and respond to King, and the actor's image will be fed
through a computer to give the appearance of animation.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau's spokesman, Eddie Michaels, said that the cartoonist
had written some material in advance for Duke's appearance but that
Trudeau will not be the voice of Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Duke will be on a separate screen from King for tonight's show,
but if it goes well, Hayes said they are considering how they can
get Duke on King's show live and sitting across the desk from the
host.

 &HT;    Retro soul man D'Angelo back in fine form
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazing what a newly chiseled chest can do.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, R&AMP;B singer D'Angelo bared his soul on his debut,
``Brown Sugar.'' The album was centered around a Hammond organ and
other instruments the then-20-year-old actually played _ unlike so
many R&AMP;B acts who filter most sounds through a computer. And by
covering Smokey Robinson's classic ballad ``Cruisin''' and speaking
well of his ``Lady,'' he was lyrically much more accessible than
his peers.
</P>
<P>
   What the casual listener might not know is that ``Brown Sugar''
is widely credited in the industry for launching the retro soul
trend for which rapper/singer Lauryn Hill received so much praise.
Her album, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' won five Grammys
and has sold more than 7 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2 million-selling ``Brown Sugar'' didn't win any Grammys
for which it was nominated, and it never hit No. 1 on the pop
charts.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, D'Angelo is baring more than his soul for his
second album, ``Voodoo.'' His well-defined body _ no longer
slightly pudgy or hidden by bulky leather jackets _ is showcased on
both his album cover and new video. He's moved from behind the
keyboard to center stage. And if he is wearing a stitch of clothing
in the ``Untitled (How Does It Feel)'' video, the sleepy, early
Prince-sounding first single from his album, the director sure
doesn't want you to think he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people think I did that for shock value or something,''
D'Angelo says of the video, in which he claims he does have
``something mini'' on. ``And don't get me wrong, I wanted to get
the people's attention. I want to entertain. But I don't want the
exterior to overshadow the music that's coming out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at a lot of treatments for that single,'' the
25-year-old Richmond native continues, ``and the only suggestion
that I really liked was the one that had just me and the song. And
I think it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Powered by the anticipation over a five-year hiatus and heavy
rotation of ``Untitled'' on Black Entertainment Television and MTV,
``Voodoo'' debuted at the top of the Billboard pop charts Feb. 12.
And D'Angelo _ unlike many of his fellow R&AMP;B singers _ covers a
broad swipe on the radio dial. He can be heard on an Atlanta
hip-hop' station in the morning, a pop station during the day and
on R&AMP;B and adult urban contemporary stations at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Maxwell are throwbacks to that era of Marvin (Gaye),''
says longtime DJ Youngblood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as long as he can keep the music outfront _ I mean Marvin
got into that sex symbol thing, too _ if D'Angelo doesn't let that
nakedness lead him, I think he'll go far.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and about that: If D'Angelo's earlier shows are any
indication, he won't take his shirt off tonight until the end of
his almost three-hour performance.

   Man with flesh-eating strep in critical condition
</P>
<P>
   By Mara Lee
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Daily News
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON _ A 42-year-old man remained in critical condition
Saturday with a Strep A infection that has evolved into its most
severe type, known as ``flesh-eating'' bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, health officials continue to investigate an outbreak
of 23 cases of strep throat infections in the Cincinnati area that
led to two deaths. The Ohio Department of Health and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention are examining the cases for a common
link.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, about 500 cases a year of life-threatening strep
infections occur. About 100 die from those diseases. Only 5 to 10
percent are of the ``flesh-eating'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   But while milder strep infections, and even asymptomatic
carriers of strep bacteria, are somewhat common, there is no reason
to worry, according to Dr. Sherman Alter, director of infectious
diseases at Children's Hospital. ``It usually does lead to critical
infection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strep is not that easy to transmit,'' he said. Someone's
sneeze or cough would have to land directly on a cut for someone to
get the flesh-eating variety.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of patients with the flesh-eating infection
will die, partly because the early symptoms are similar to the flu
or a muscle strain. By the time black blisters form, the disease is
advancing rapidly, and amputations are often necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Alter said the best way to prevent the infection is through
standard hygiene practices _ plenty of handwashing, covering one's
mouth when coughing or sneezing, and putting anti-bacterial salve
and adhesive bandages on small cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Strep can cause several life-threatening diseases: scarlet
fever, rheumatic fever, a virulent strain of pneumonia, a form of
toxic shock syndrome, and a flesh-eating type that attacks deep
layers of skin and muscle.

   NKOREA-CIRCUS (Changjon, North Korea) _ The circus has been a
very popular form of entertainment in socialist countries,
particularly in the former Soviet Union, because everyone,
including laborers and farmers, can easily understand and enjoy it,
unlike operas and classical music performances. Whatever its
function in a Communist country, the Moranbong Circus, which has

Boston, where it was seen last fall. The show comes with a detailed

companies moved into a handful of stages carved out of shuttered
massage parlors on West 42nd Street. In the years that followed,
the theaters suffered through stickups, recessions and aborted
development projects and survived to see a renewed Midtown rise
around them. But now the redevelopment of 42nd Street is altering
the theaters' future. The local development corporation that helped
create the strip now known as Theater Row is closing four of the
playhouses as it prepares to break ground on an apartment tower and

 &HT;    Captivating colorful wildlife and dark waters of Brazil
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE RIO NEGRO, BRAZIL _ ``Bubbles, bubbles. Big fish, big
fish,'' hissed Samuel the guide. They weren't really bubbles, but
hundreds of tiny peacock bass flicking on the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   This was no time to argue over semantics, though, because where
there are baby peacocks, there usually are adults. The sun, blocked
much of the week by the beginnings of the Amazonian rainy season,
had just come out and illuminated the movements of the fingerlings.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, often outsized Goliaths with attitudes to match,
tend and care for their young to protect them in a river system
where everything, even other peacock bass, is out to eat them. Any
intrusion upon their offspring's space is greeted with enthusiastic
anger. To paraphrase Robert Ruark's description of Cape buffalo,
the parent peacocks act as if that lure owes them money.
</P>
<P>
   Something was herding this shoal of baby fish across a hidden
lagoon watered by the Rio Negro, and before Samuel could point, the
big orange and black Woodchopper was in the air. It landed smack in
the midst of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen heavy rips failed to produce a strike and it seemed
the trick might fail this time. But a second cast had hardly hit
the water before the earth literally opened up in a flash of red
and green and the Chopper disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you know what's coming and even though it may have
happened dozens of times before, no one can be completely prepared
for the explosiveness and pure savagery that is the strike of a
trophy peacock bass. It actually isn't a bass at all, but a giant
cichlid, a cousin to aquarium fish such as tetras, known to
Brazilians as tucunare.
</P>
<P>
   With its brilliant green sides, black bars, red and orange gills
and red eyes, the peacock has become a target fish for trophy
anglers worldwide. They are willing to brave the heat of the
Equator and the threat of yellow fever, Dengue fever and malaria _
not to mention terminal heat rash _ for the chance to catch a giant
peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-pounders are common. Twenty pounds is rarer but they're out
there. All of them strike with a ferocity and fight with a power
the average bass fisherman just is not prepared to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Janes, on his first peacock trip, caught a 15-pounder
during our vacation trip on the Amazon Clipper. The 80-foot
houseboat sleeps 14 anglers, plus crew and cooks. Fishing is out of
17-foot bass boats equipped with 60-horsepower engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never experienced anything like that big fish,'' Janes
said. ``They are unbelievably strong. You land the fish and you're
just drained.''
</P>
<P>
   Janes caught his big fish by casting into a group of baby
peacocks being herded along by an adult pair. ``They move them from
place to place to protect them,'' said Gilberto Castro, a veteran
river guide who oversees the operation aboard the Amazon Clipper.
``The adults tend them, maybe eat the ones that have a fungus and
could infect others.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro said no one actually knows a great deal about tucunare.
``We know they breed all year and we know they must grow very
quickly because the growing season never stops. But nobody knows
how old they are or how quickly they reach trophy size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said he keeps a thermometer at his house that measures
minimum and maximum temperatures each day. ``In 26 years on the Rio
Negro, it has never read lower than 72 degrees and never higher
than 90 degrees. That's perfect for the fish,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   The fish are perfect for the environment, too. They compete for
space with piranhas and pink dolphins, electric eels and freshwater
sting rays. In the seemingly placid, black waters of the Rio Negro,
the going is always tough and the tough better get going _ or get
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, peacock bass are not active at night. They sleep in
their favorite spots, making them vulnerable to the spears and gigs
of native fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the topwater strike that is the drug of choice for
non-resident anglers. They come during two fishing seasons, January
into early March and late August to early October.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers begin their trip by flying to Miami, then taking a
five-hour flight to the historic city of Manaus. From there, it's a
one-hour plane ride to Barcelos for the Rio Negro trip. The
houseboat that serves as home for the next week docks at Barcelos
to start the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of choice that provokes the strike is the Woodchopper,
a nearly seven-inch-long, cigar-shaped stick of wood with a
propeller at the rear end and three sets of giant treble hooks in
the middle. Heavy rods, 60- to 80-pound braided line and top-dollar
reels with smooth drags are necessary equipment for handling the
first powerful runs of the largest fish.
</P>
<P>
   So many things can go wrong landing a peacock bass that actually
catching a 20-pound-plus fish is a combination of luck and
providential attendance. The fish that slammed my Woodchopper was a
whopper, which was evident the first time it rolled to the surface
and made itself visible. ``Big fish,'' Samuel said.
``Twenty-pounder.''
</P>
<P>
   The fish had spent most of its power deep in the waters of the
lagoon and was just lolling on the surface. I was already adding up
the money I was going to collect from everybody else on the boat.
That's a stupid thing to do with peacock bass.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel and I both saw the iffy hookup at the same time, a single
hook lodged up under the outside of the tough bone on the fish's
lower jaw. ``Careful,'' the guide said. ``Not hooked good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the fish could hear the words, because at that
moment he (it was a giant male) turned his belly toward the boat to
enter the net. But that move gave the slightest bit of angle to the
hook, which was only looped over his jaw. The Woodchopper popped
out and the fish disappeared again into the black water from which
it came.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel was more shocked and more rubbery-legged than I was. He
let out a huge sigh and sank back onto his cushion. ``That was a
big fish,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, the literary agent Michael V. Carlisle
struggled to achieve something unheard of in the publishing
industry, where secrets are made to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to conceal efforts to develop and find a publisher
for ``The Bodyguard's Story,'' Trevor Rees-Jones' 336-page account
of the events surrounding his own survival of the 1997 Paris car
crash that killed Diana, princess of Wales, and her companion, Emad
Mohamed al-Fayed, who was known as Dodi.
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy came from fear that Fayed's father, Mohamed
al-Fayed, would squelch the effort if he knew that his son's former
bodyguard intended to publish an account that conflicted with his
own view that a conspiracy led up to the car crash.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, Fayed did try to halt the sale of the book this
month in England, although he failed. The book is scheduled for
publication in the United States this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gambled a lot,'' Carlisle said. ``If people had betrayed us,
the book would have been stopped. The gamble of all our time and
expectation of success would have been lost, and Fayed would have
been litigating my client.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of months, Carlisle arranged for Moira Johnston, a
writer who is one of his clients, to meet secretly with Rees-Jones
and to research the first three chapters and an outline for a book.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to approach publishers in London, the
recognizable former bodyguard _ with a face scarred by the crash _
met in the St. James Club hotel conference room with executives
representing seven companies.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives signed a confidentiality agreement and were
not allowed to take the proposal out of the room, Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that several British publishers rejected the project
because of fears that Fayed might mount a court battle against it.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, three publishers made offers and the winning bidder,
Time Warner Inc.'s Little, Brown &AMP; Co. unit, continued to conceal
the incendiary topic, even keeping it secret from its own sales
representatives until earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I have more white hair than I did before,''
Carlisle said. ``Keeping a secret in publishing _ it's
unbelievable.''

   FORBES USES 4 COVERS FOR A CELEBRITY ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine had a pair of firsts last week. Not only did the
magazine showcase its first cover to feature a pierced navel _
belonging to the pop star Britney Spears _ but it printed four
different covers, becoming part of the latest trend in magazine
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The March 20 issue of the magazine featured Kobe Bryant, Anna
Kournikova, Regis Philbin and Spears on separate covers under the
headline ``The New Stars of Money.'' The covers were sent to
subscribers and newsstands at random and were not aimed at specific
regions, as is often the case, according to Lewis D'Vorkin, the
executive editor. (Last year, Fortune sent a cover featuring the
Nascar driver Jeff Gordon to the South and Midwest and an alternate
cover featuring a woman clad in tight Levi's jeans to the
presumably more relaxed West and East Coasts.)
</P>
<P>
   D'Vorkin said the magazine chose four covers ``because we had
four different stories to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he noted: ``We've gotten a lot of attention. We did four
nights on CNBC, each night focusing on a different person. It's
more bang for the buck. Celebrities sell, and we've got four of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes joins several magazines that have run multiple covers the
last year. To celebrate its 15th anniversary, Spin's current issue
has four different covers. TV Guide has gone so far as to run 26
different covers for a football issue. Last year, Sports
Illustrated even ran 50 covers _ one for each state _ for a
year-end issue.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the Forbes cover, said Samir Husni, a
professor of media at the University of Mississippi and a close
observer of the magazine industry, is that Forbes does not
prominently indicate that the four covers are all the same issue
inside. This might confuse readers at the newsstand, causing them
to buy the same magazine twice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Vorkin said he had not heard any complaints and pointed out
that the headlines are almost identical on each cover. D'Vorkin
said that the only drawback had been the cost of shooting the three
additional photographs _ ``and doing these kinds of people, well,
they bring along a fair amount of entourage, although it was not as
bad as some of them get.'' &QL;

<P>
   PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING VS. HARRY POTTER
</P>
<P>
   Think Harry Potter has a stranglehold on children's best
sellers? Think again. When Barnes &AMP; Noble recently convened a focus
group of boys aged 11 to 14, the one hardcover each boy had bought
in common was about a character named Mankind.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the World Wrestling Federation's Mankind (aka Mick
Foley), whose autobiography ``Have a Nice Day!'' was published in
October by ReganBooks, a unit of News Corp.'s HarperCollins, and
now has 700,000 copies in print.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``The Rock Says ...,'' a ReganBooks offering by the
wrestling icon the Rock (actually Dwayne Johnson), joined Foley's
book on the New York Times best-seller list in January. There are
600,000 copies in print. Both books also weigh in on best-seller
lists in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the books has not been lost on the American
Library Association, which is about to feature the Rock, Mankind
and the female wrestling star Chyna on a poster to encourage young
people to read. When Johnson was at the Bookends store in
Ridgewood, N.J., for a signing on a Sunday in January, 6,000 people
lined up outside the store, among them school bus loads of 8- to
12-year-olds with chaperones, the store's proprietor, Dana
Gilligan, said.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is by no means limited to boys. Half the fans
hoping to catch an autographed Rock collectible were women and
girls, Gilligan said. The next title to appear in the five-book
contract the WWF negotiated with ReganBooks is about Chyna, to be
published in August.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is getting into the ring with ``I'm Next,'' a
memoir by Bill Goldberg, star of Ted Turner's rival World
Championship Wrestling, which will be published by Crown, a unit of
Bertelsmann's Random House Inc. in November.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's vice president for merchandising, Bob Wietrak,
called the books ``the new celebrity bios.'' He predicted sales
would remain strong if professional wrestling's television ratings
keep up. And all signs indicate that they will.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Man with flesh-eating strep in critical condition
</P>
<P>
   By Mara Lee
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Daily News
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON _ A 42-year-old man remained in critical condition
Saturday with a Strep A infection that has evolved into its most
severe type, known as ``flesh-eating'' bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, health officials continue to investigate an outbreak
of 23 cases of strep throat infections in the Cincinnati area that
led to two deaths. The Ohio Department of Health and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention are examining the cases for a common
link.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, about 500 cases a year of life-threatening strep
infections occur. About 100 die from those diseases. Only 5 to 10
percent are of the ``flesh-eating'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   But while milder strep infections, and even asymptomatic
carriers of strep bacteria, are somewhat common, there is no reason
to worry, according to Dr. Sherman Alter, director of infectious
diseases at Children's Hospital. ``Strep is not that easy to
transmit,'' he said. Someone's sneeze or cough would have to land
directly on a cut for someone to get the flesh-eating variety.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of patients with the flesh-eating infection
will die, partly because the early symptoms are similar to the flu
or a muscle strain. By the time black blisters form, the disease is
advancing rapidly, and amputations are often necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Alter said the best way to prevent the infection is through
standard hygiene practices _ plenty of handwashing, covering one's
mouth when coughing or sneezing, and putting anti-bacterial salve
and adhesive bandages on small cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Strep can cause several life-threatening diseases: scarlet
fever, rheumatic fever, a virulent strain of pneumonia, a form of
toxic shock syndrome, and a flesh-eating type that attacks deep
layers of skin and muscle.

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider it a classic Bill Schrader moment.
</P>
<P>
   At a big telecommunications convention in Geneva last October,
William L. Schrader, chairman of PSINet Inc., the biggest
independent Internet service provider, announced that PSINet had
just struck a deal to offer high-speed Internet access in Europe.
The partner, he said, was Winstar Communications Inc., an American
wireless carrier, allowing PSINet to bypass the Continent's
traditional phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Winstar's top executives in New York knew nothing
about a deal with PSINet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bill was predicting the future,'' William L. Rouhana
Jr., Winstar's chairman, said lightheartedly in an interview last
week, noting that his company never announced such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   All Schrader would say, by way of explanation, was that PSINet
had indeed negotiated a European deal with Winstar. ``The fact that
Rouhana didn't know isn't my problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Odd? Bizarre even? From another chairman at another company,
perhaps. But for Schrader, it was simply business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   In building PSINet from its modest roots in upstate New York to
international Internet powerhouse with a stock market value of $7.3
billion, he has never been afraid to get a bit ahead of himself _
or to risk alienating a potential partner. In fact, PSINet and
Winstar are now in preliminary discussions about working together,
according to executives close to those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, whose hobbies include target shooting, is an executive
who often fires from the hip, so to speak, aiming verbal shots at
allies and enemies alike and establishing a reputation as perhaps
the most iconoclastic executive of his stature in the
communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet, with fiber-optic lines around the globe, some of the
world's most advanced Internet systems and a fast-growing customer
base, looms as a highly attractive acquisition candidate _ one
whose shares are up nearly 300 percent since October, as investors
have noted its potential takeover value. It is the biggest of the
Internet access providers not already snatched up by telephone
companies looking to expand into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But PSINet has been valuable for years. And Schrader, who owns
7.45 percent of the company, has always refused to sell, sometimes
leaving prospective buyers to walk away wondering if he is shrewd
or headstrong _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real reason PSINet is still independent is Bill
Schrader,'' said Richard G. Ellenberger, chief executive of
Broadwing Inc., the former Cincinnati Bell. Broadwing recently
filed to reduce its stake in PSINet to about 11 percent but would
still be its largest shareholder. ``He has built it from the ground
up, and he's not through. He believes he's one of the new age of
executive leaders, and he's not ready to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, 48, may not be ready to quit because he has already
come so far. A biologist by training, he was a co-founder in 1985
of one of the first Internet operations, called Nysernet, which
initially linked academic computing centers in the cold reaches of
upstate New York. In 1989, when for-profit activity was still
ostensibly banned from the government-financed Internet, he founded
what was then called Performance Systems International Inc., moving
it to northern Virginia to be closer to the Federal agencies then
overseeing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet was not only one of the first providers of Internet
access service but one of the most innovative. In 1995, for
instance, PSINet was a pioneer in offering unlimited Internet
service at a fixed monthly fee to consumers across the nation. The
pricing was set in typical Schrader fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I asked him how they chose what to charge for
the flat fee,'' Ellenberger said. ``And he said, `Well, it was 1995
so we chose $19.95, and $19.95 sounded good to us.' And I asked
him, `You didn't do any economic modeling?' And he said, `Nope.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, PSINet's tactical focus has changed; the company got
out of the consumer Internet business in 1996, selling its consumer
unit to Mindspring Enterprises so it could focus on serving
business customers and acting as a carrier's carrier for smaller
Internet service providers. More recently, instead of merely
providing raw Internet links, PSINet has begun to add more advanced
and lucrative services by managing Web servers and computer systems
that deliver corporate software applications across networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's ultimate goal has remained constant. ``I would
like to build a system,'' Schrader said, ``that can deliver all the
media to all the customers on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold S. Wills, PSINet's president and chief operating officer
and a former executive at IBM and Xerox, first met Schrader in the
spring of 1996. ``I thought he was crazy,'' Wills said, recalling
his job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said, `We're going to kill the phone companies and we're
going to be bigger than AT&AMP;T, and it will be a lot of fun.' And I
said, `How much revenue have you got?' and he said, `Well, last
year we had $35 million.' And I said, `Well, how are you going to
do what you want to do?' And he began to explain in ways that I
hadn't understood before the power of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other people did not understand either. PSINet's stock
traded below $10 throughout 1996, 1997 and 1998. It was not until
last year, when PSINet generated more than $550 million in revenue,
that investors began climbing onto the PSINet bandwagon as a way to
play the growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And to ride the PSINet bandwagon is to hear none of the bland
modulations of boardroom-speak.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, as he drove his silver-gray Lincoln Town Car (he
also owns a Porsche Boxster) from PSINet's headquarters in Herndon,
Va., to one of the company's nearby network centers, Schrader was
asked about one of his competitors, John W. Sidgmore. Sidgmore runs
Uunet, the No. 1 Internet carrier, which is now part of MCI
Worldcom Inc. and is also based in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of where the market's going, we see eye to eye,''
Schrader said. ``But John is a typical executive who will say what
he thinks people want to hear and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   (In an interview later, Sidgmore said, ``I'm willing to bet that
on Bill's report card in sixth grade it said something like,
`Doesn't play well with others.''')
</P>
<P>
   And do not even get Schrader started on Stephen M. Case,
chairman of America Online Inc. and another Virginia neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case is a perfect example of someone who misrepresents the
truth for his own interest,'' Schrader said as he drove.
</P>
<P>
   He cited what he saw as America Online's about-face, after it
agreed to acquire Time Warner Inc., on the need for the government
to regulate the delivery of Internet data over cable television
systems. Before the deal, America Online had called for a
government role; after hooking up with Time Warner, the nation's
second-largest operator of cable systems, many people in the
industry perceived America Online as changing its stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like hypocrites, and Case is a hypocrite,'' Schrader
said. He peered over the wheel, then added: ``He is a self-serving
businessman who's into hypocrisy and I'm not. That's why he decided
to stop competing against us as an Internet service provider and
get into the content business.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement responding to those comments, America Online
said, ``Mr. Case's position on open access has been consistent from
day one.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schrader reserves his deepest ire, however, for local telephone
incumbents, which he says are monopolists holding back the digital
future. Bashing the Bell companies is hardly unusual among smaller
communications carriers, but Schrader's company must also deal with
the Bells on a daily basis, renting their local communications
lines in order to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly outspoken about Bell Atlantic, the East Coast
giant with which PSINet does a significant amount of business. ``I
call them `Bell Atlantis,''' Schrader said, still dishing as he
drove. ``Bell Atlantis is dead. They cannot exist in tomorrow. We
know the customer better than they do and they can't keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why lash out at a such an important supplier?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm honest,'' Schrader said. Referring to Bell
Atlantic's chairman, he said, ``It's not in my best interest to
tell you that Ivan Seidenberg is a poor manager of a
multibillion-dollar company, because they're our major supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a corporate response, Susan Kraus, a Bell Atlantic
spokeswoman, replied: ``This is not even worth commenting on but
I'll say this. Consider the source. It's hard to take anything he
says seriously. This guy has a long history of making irrational
statements and taking gratuitous potshots at his competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Schrader's blunt style is
that it has not prevented him from garnering the deep respect of
his peers, even those he does not treat gently. As someone who
spoke up for and invested in the Internet early and often, Schrader
is often considered one of the handful of true Internet
visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enormous courage and he's as smart as a fox,'' said
George H. Conrades, chairman of Akamai Technologies Inc. and former
chairman of BBN, one of the big three early independent Internet
companies, along with Uunet and PSINet. ``I admire him,'' Conrades
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sidgmore, of Uunet, also offered a compliment of sorts. ``I'm a
big supporter of Bill's, as wacky as he is,'' Sidgmore said.
``Whatever else you say, good or bad, he is steadfastly committed
to his vision for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sidgmore said, ``I would not be surprised if you read
soon that we will do some investments together.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of all he has built, Schrader has been reluctant
to sell it, despite the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars
such a deal could bring him, considering his personal 7.45 percent
stake in PSINet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Internet providers of all size and
description have been snatched up by more traditional
communications companies. Uunet agreed to be acquired by MFS
Communications in 1996 just before MFS itself was acquired by
Worldcom Inc. In 1997, BBN was acquired by GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That has essentially left PSINet as the last of the Mohicans,
holding out against assimilation with the communications giants.
Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has explored acquiring PSInet, but
those discussions were strictly preliminary. Far more likely
suitors are the new breed of communications carrier in the United
States, companies like Level 3, Qwest, Broadwing and Nextlink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to buy PSINet at least 10 times over the last few
years,'' Sidgmore said. ``Right after MFS bought us we tried to buy
him. I tried after Worldcom. I tried a bunch of times and he would
never sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, it comes down to Schrader being Schrader. ``He
always had the opinion that PSInet is worth 10 times whatever his
stock price is,'' Sidgmore said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that other Internet companies have sold out _ beyond
the financial incentives _ has been their executives' notion that
integrating into a bigger company can give them access to a broader
set of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wills, PSINet's No. 2 executive, takes a slightly more pragmatic
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day, they will buy us and we will be sold, and my job is
to make it more expensive for them every day that they wait,''
Wills said. ``What they could have bought for $200 million, they
will now probably have to pay $20 billion for.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Schrader about selling his company _ well, maybe it's better
not to ask. ``Why should I sell the company?'' he said, bristling.
``Tell me.''

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unlikely prophet is voicing a plea for reason and restraint
in the increasingly chaotic stampede toward the technological
future.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking ranks with the customarily optimistic and
self-congratulatory high-technology industry, Bill Joy, the chief
scientist of Sun Microsystems, has issued an impassioned critique
of uncontrolled progress in digital, biological and material
sciences. He has challenged scientists and engineers to rethink
their ethical standards and step back from advances that might
ultimately threaten the human species.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20,000-word essay in the April issue of Wired magazine,
which goes on sale Monday, Joy, a computer industry pioneer and one
of the nation's leading technical authorities, writes that although
the world has survived any number of potentially devastating
technologies developed in the 20th century, several new branches of
research pose threats of technological devastation at the hands of
a small group or even an individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 21st century technologies _ genetics, nanotechnology and
robotics _ are so powerful they can spawn whole new classes of
accidents and abuses,'' he writes in the article, titled, ``Why the
Future Doesn't Need Us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most dangerously, for the first time, these accidents and
abuses are widely within the reach of individuals or small
groups,'' he writes. ``They will not require large facilities or
rare raw materials. Knowledge alone will enable the use of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings about unbridled progress are not new, but until
now they have typically come from social critics or scientists
outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Joy is a leading computer researcher who developed
an early version of the Unix operating system while a graduate
student at the University of California at Berkeley. He helped
found Sun Microsystems and more recently has been involved in the
development of powerful software technologies like the Java
programming language and Jini, a system for linking hundreds of
thousands of appliances and other devices by way of the Internet.
He also served as co-chairman of a presidential commission on the
future of information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Joy also wrote a more generally optimistic cover article
titled ``Digital Wonders'' for the March 6 issue of Fortune
magazine. In a telephone interview, he said the Fortune piece was
focused on short-term issues in the computer industry, while the
Wired article addresses long-term forces that will be more
difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Aspen, Colo., where he moved in 1989 from Silicon
Valley to set up a small laboratory that explores new technologies
for Sun, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's critique is striking because computer industry
technologists, almost without exception, take a more sanguine view
of the social consequences of advances. They typically argue that
any negative effects will be far outweighed by the positive effect
of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Myhrvold, a physicist who is on leave from his job as the
chief technology officer at Microsoft Corp., said in an e-mail
interview, ``People have made apocalyptic predictions about
technology constantly for as long as there has been technology. I
think it is because change frightens them. What is more, the most
common form these dire predictions take is `this next generation of
stuff _ wow! that is really different and really scary.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the new technologies will be more difficult to control in
the future, Joy argues, because most are being driven by the
commercial sector, not by the military, which in the past has
controlled many potentially dangerous technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who founded Thinking Machines
Inc., an early supercomputer company, said of Joy: ``Bill is pretty
unusual. There are very few technologists who step back and try to
look at the whole picture. Most who do tend toward optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Joy argues that advances are now on the horizon in each of the
three areas he addresses. In the field of robotics, he warns of a
generation of superintelligent machines that could compete with
their human creators for resources. Such possibilities have
recently been addressed by other technologist-authors, including
Ray Kurzweil (``The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers
Exceed Human Intelligence''), Hans Moravec (``Robot: Mere Machine
to Transcendent Mind'') and George Dyson (``Darwin Among the
Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence'').
</P>
<P>
   In genetics, Joy worries that the widening availability of
knowledge about powerful genetic engineering will lead to a ``white
plague'' _ a human-designed disease that can kill selectively.
</P>
<P>
   In nanotechnology, he describes the increasing possibility of an
accidental or intentional release of a submicroscopic
self-replicating mechanism that could cause widespread destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Such a calamity was first suggested by Kurt Vonnegut. In his
novel ``Cat's Cradle,'' a substance called ice-nine sets off a
thermal chain reaction that leads to the freezing of the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have looked at all of this as science fiction,
and as a result they haven't taken it seriously,'' Joy said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his warning, he writes, is an attribute that has
not been true of destructive technologies until now but is a part
of all of the most compelling 21st-century technologies: the
ability to self-replicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``While replication in a computer or a computer network can be a
nuisance,'' he writes, ``uncontrolled self-replication in these
newer technologies runs a much greater risk: a risk of substantial
damage in the physical world.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy insists he is not a Luddite, and yet he also argues that the
issues raised by the convicted bomber Theodore Kaczynski have not
been adequately addressed by the nation's technologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaczynski's actions were murderous and, in my view, criminally
insane,'' he writes. ``But simply saying this does not dismiss his
argument; as difficult as it is for me to acknowledge, I saw some
merit in the reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy suggests parallels between the ethical dilemma faced by
nuclear physicists in the invention and the use of the atomic and
hydrogen bombs and similar challenges facing technologists today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have learned a lesson from the making of the first
atomic bomb and the resulting arms race,'' he writes. ``We didn't
do well then, and the parallels to our current situation are
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that today's scientists must find a path that was not
taken by physicists during World War II: ``I feel, too, a deepened
sense of personal responsibility _ not for the work I have already
done, but for the work that I might yet do, at the confluence of
the sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only realistic alternative I see,'' he writes in Wired,
``is relinquishment: to limit development of the technologies that
are too dangerous, by limiting our pursuit of certain kinds of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the precedent of the decision by the U.S. government to
abandon the development of biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Verification in the case of genetics, robotics and
nanotechnology, however, will require that scientists adopt strict
codes of ethics, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the telephone interview last week, Joy said he doubted that
the development of advances could be reined in in the commercial
world, and he criticized scientists as being largely silent on the
inherently destructive potential of rapidly evolving technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought a technological species could expect to
survive the ever-accelerating evolution of its market-driven
technologies, Joy said: ``The answer is `yes, but not without
additional care.' I think it's possible _ but it's not a given.
Survival won't come for free.''

ADVERTISING: MARTINA NAVRATILOVA IN A CAMPAIGN FOR SUBARU 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martina Navratilova will be featured in a general campaign for
Subaru of America, in another sign of the increasing appearance in
mainstream advertising of imagery associated with gay men and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar campaign, scheduled to begin this week,
includes Navratilova along with three other female athletes: the
golfers Juli Inkster and Meg Mallon and the skier Diann
Roffe-Steinrotter. The television and print advertising, with a
humorous tone, is being created by the Subaru general market
agency, Temerlin McClain in Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During her years as a top women's professional tennis player,
Navratilova had been outspoken in asserting that being a lesbian
cost her consideration as an endorser or pitchwoman by consumer
marketers. Though she was seen occasionally in campaigns for
advertisers like Apple Computer, L.A. Eyeworks and The New York
Times, Subaru represents her first appearance in a national
television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``All most other advertisers could see was the fact I'm a
lesbian,'' Navratilova said in a telephone interview on Friday from
Aspen, Colo. ``Everything else, they threw out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Subaru doesn't care,'' she added. ``They see me as everything
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That is indicative of a change in attitudes that has led to gay
men and lesbians being featured in campaigns aimed at all consumers
in addition to appearances in ads aimed specifically at homosexuals
as a niche market. The advertisers include Diesel jeans, the
Hartford insurance company, the retailer Ikea, Levi Strauss, the
MTV cable network, the furniture maker Mitchell Gold and Naya
water.
</P>
<P>
   Some campaigns, like Subaru's, show familiar faces from the
singer Elton John to the cyclist Missy Giove to the drag performer
Ru Paul.
</P>
<P>
   The Subaru campaign is ``a clear acknowledgment of the
importance in Subaru's broader marketing strategy of gays and
lesbians as they work their way into the mainstream advertising,''
said Howard Buford, president and chief executive at Prime Access
in New York, an agency specializing in campaigns aimed at
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Subaru, each of the four celebrities appeals to a
different constituency,'' he added. ``The aggregate of them all
gives Subaru the broadest reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Subaru executives and Navratilova knew each other through the
company's founding sponsorship of the Rainbow Endowment, an
organization that receives donations as consumers charge purchases
on a credit card called the Visa Rainbow Card. In 1995, Navratilova
became the nonpaid spokeswoman for the card program, created by Do
Tell Inc., a marketing company in Conshohocken, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina is the consummate professional,'' said Tim Bennett,
marketing programs director at Subaru of America in Cherry Hill,
N.J., a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries. ``Besides being an
exceptional athlete, she personifies the attributes of our brand as
a go-anywhere, do-anything type of individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view her as an active lifestyle woman, and the other stuff
as no one's business.''
</P>
<P>
   In that instance, ``lifestyle'' is intended not as a euphemism
for homosexuality but rather to refer to a propensity to pursue
outdoor sports like tennis, golf, skiing, hiking and kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did research on the advertising and got an extremely
positive response from the target audience,'' said Dennis McClain,
chief executive and executive creative director at Temerlin
McClain, part of True North Communications. ``Martina has a
wonderful overall image as a superb athlete and someone who for a
long time has been in the forefront of women's causes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it goes beyond that,'' he added, ``to the person she is,
the strength she has as an individual. We see that as a very
attractive and attention-getting aspect of the advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Subaru's print ads, to run in publications like Runner's World,
Sports Illustrated for Women and USA Today, depict the women
separately, each pursuing her own sport. The headline designates
Subaru as ``a proud sponsor of women who kick'' a certain part of
the anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, to appear on networks like ESPN, the Golf
Channel and the Outdoor Life Network, shots of the women at play
are interspersed with them asking rhetorically about attributes
like performance, grip and control, meant to refer to both their
sports and their Subarus.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Navratilova asks, smiling: ``But what do we know?
We're just girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford of Prime Access said he thought it was significant that
Navratilova was ``the most well-known of the four'' and took the
lead in the spot by delivering the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McClain said he was considering additional spots that
would ``focus exclusively on Martina'' and each of the other women.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru is one of only three automakers, along with Saab and
Saturn, that have aimed sales pitches at gay men and lesbians as
part of efforts to reach segments of the general consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're unique in the way we target different audiences,''
Bennett said, listing among them teachers, nurses, golfers and
members of more than 18 organizations like the American Canoe
Association, the American Association of Snowboard Instructors, the
International Mountain Biking Association and the Professional Ski
Instructors of America.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's niche marketing.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, UPN was left for dead _ a ratings failure, the sixth
among six networks.
</P>
<P>
   Then the World Wrestling Federation, like one of its star
behemoths, dived in over the ropes and reinvented the network,
giving it a viable and potentially lucrative identity: the network
of the young male viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the future of UPN _ a 50-50 partnership between Viacom and
Chris-Craft Industries _ looks promising. But it is up for grabs in
a battle that extends from the boardrooms of the partners to the
offices of the Federal Communications Commission and includes such
characters as the CBS chairman, Mel Karmazin; the USA Networks
chairman, Barry Diller; the Chris-Craft chairman, Herbert J.
Siegel; and the WWF ringmaster, Vince McMahon. It is a battle that
has implications for the proposed CBS-Viacom merger and is one that
could deal a serious blow to the USA cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom and CBS want the network all to themselves or not at all.
They have given an ultimatum to Chris-Craft that comes due next
Monday: sell your share to Viacom or buy Viacom out.
</P>
<P>
   Chris-Craft wants to maintain the partnership to help absorb the
financial losses that continue despite the network's improving
prospects. It has gone to court to stop the merger because it
believes that if Viacom acquires CBS, UPN would no longer receive
proper attention.
</P>
<P>
   The legal point it is making is this: Viacom is violating a
clause in the partnership agreement that Chris-Craft says forbids
Viacom from making a deal with any competing network.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's position is that the merger is only proposed at this
point, not put into effect, and therefore it never violated its
noncompete deal.
</P>
<P>
   If all that spins your head, think about this: The titanic
corporate struggle is over a fledgling network, made up of mostly
weaker stations, that has piled up losses of about $800 million in
the five years of its existence.
</P>
<P>
   But one year of wrestling has done much to reverse what had been
looking like a death spiral. With a two-hour block of WWF wrestling
every Thursday night leading the way, UPN is showing the biggest
rating gain of any network of any size this season, more than 30
percent overall but almost 200 percent among male teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The growth comes on what UPN executives concede is an
exceedingly small base (last year, the network had a Nielsen rating
of 2 _ about 2 million homes _ this year, it has a 2.7) but, with
wrestling at least, UPN has proved it can play with the big boys.
Last Thursday, for example, the network finished just a fraction
behind Fox for the night in the national ratings and easily won the
night outright among those male teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   That is significant, because young males are a group avidly
pursued by advertisers selling everything from soft drinks to video
games. These advertisers are willing to pay a premium to reach
them.
</P>
<P>
   And now wrestling figures as another tangled subplot to the
ownership battle, with CBS and possibly other suitors lining up to
try to take the WWF cable programming away from the USA cable
network, possibly to link up all the television rights under one
corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF, which under McMahon has expanded aggressively in recent
years into clothing stores and restaurants, has increasing leverage
in television because of the popularity of its programs. On cable,
three weekly editions of WWF events are invariably the
highest-rated programs in all of cable every week.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon recently informed USA Networks that he planned to open
up the cable rights for next season to other bidders. Diller
retains the right to match any competing offer, but several
executives close to the deal said the offers might include elements
that would be difficult to match, possibly including an equity
stake in whatever channel McMahon chooses as his next partner.
</P>
<P>
   CBS could be best positioned to negotiate with McMahon if Viacom
winds up acquiring UPN outright, completes the CBS merger
agreement, and gets the FCC to waive its prohibition on one company
operating two networks.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom and CBS have asked for the FCC waiver, and many of the
parties involved say there is a good chance the FCC will agree,
mainly to ensure UPN's continued survival. One reason: UPN has
become the favorite network for black viewers; about 40 percent of
its audience are African-Americans who watch such shows as
``Moesha'' and ``Malcolm and Eddie.'' Senior executives on both
sides of the UPN ownership battle said the FCC would be loath to
put a network with that kind of minority following at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring UPN could be the path to a wider wrestling deal for
CBS. No CBS executive will comment for the record on the network's
plans for wrestling. But another CBS unit, the cable channel TNN,
is moving aggressively into this form of programming, having
already acquired the rights to events like Arena Football League
games and Extreme Championship Wrestling bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Several executives familiar with both the negotiations for UPN's
future and CBS's interest in wrestling tied the strategy to
Karmazin. Victor Miller, a broadcast analyst for Bear, Stearns,
said, ``Mel Karmazin would be very interested in operating both
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that UPN fit into Karmazin's broad strategy for reaching
consumers with advertising in multiple media in all parts of their
lives. This could be accomplished best by linking CBS assets, like
its television network, its Infinity Broadcasting radio stations
and its outdoor advertising business, with those of Viacom, like
the cable channels Nickelodeon, MTV and VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You start out as a kid, you're watching Nickelodeon,'' Miller
said. ``Then you get acne, you watch MTV; you get a little older,
you watch UPN; so then you get married, have a couple of kids and
you watch VH-1; finally you get older still and you watch CBS. And
it's a fabulous lifestyle play. You start the day listening to
radio, and that's an Infinity station. You listen to another
Infinity station on the drive to work, and while traveling you see
billboards owned by Viacom/CBS. At work, you get into some
streaming audio, or link into Web sites that CBS may have an
interest in. Then you come home and you watch all these TV
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several executives also tied the decision to trigger the
buy-sell move over UPN to Karmazin, who had previously been
involved in fruitless negotiations to buy Chris-Craft's broadcast
interests outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Karmazin all over,'' one executive said of the deal,
citing the pressure put on UPN either to agree to swallow the
losses still being incurred by the network by buying out Viacom's
share or to sell out for a truly modest price: $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris-Craft hopes it will never come to that. The company
requested an injunction in the state Supreme Court in New York,
seeking to blow up the entire Viacom-CBS merger agreement.
Chris-Craft contends that it will be irreparably damaged if it
loses either the network or a deep-pocketed partner just as UPN is
turning the corner and moving toward success.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Valentine, UPN's president, said that even with the
network's turnaround this season, ``We're still going to lose money
for the next year or two.'' He expressed confidence that the
network's recent success can be sustained because the young male
viewers it is reaching now supply much of the audience for the
stations that make up the UPN network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He also said UPN would tailor upcoming programs to young men,
but would not limit the appeal to them. That was a mistake that the
WB network has made, he said, in aiming its shows exclusively at
teen-age girls. ``We want to be male friendly, not male
exclusive,'' he said. And he intends to retain a skew toward
minority viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be a broadcaster or a narrow-caster,''
Valentine said. ``We want to be a mid-caster.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected Chris-Craft to try to retain its interest in
UPN. But that may depend on whether a settlement with Viacom can be
reached, or another corporate partner can be found. Chris-Craft
would not be anxious to swallow the network's continuing losses
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Other suitors may appear _ Diller and his USA Networks have been
mentioned in speculation about UPN's future. But for the moment,
Chris-Craft wants the court to force Viacom to remain its tag-team
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a media analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said
Viacom and CBS would not allow the UPN morass to stand in the way
of their deal. ``Nothing is more important to them to get the
merger closed, with or without UPN,'' Wolzien said. ``They would
prefer to do it with UPN, but if it has to go away, it goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said the network had come too far now to be forced
into oblivion, a fate it might have faced had UPN not found its
identity. ``Under any scenario, we're now too valuable an asset to
disappear,'' Valentine said.

POST-SOVIET RUSSIA, TOO, INSISTS ITS JOURNALISTS FOLLOW THE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two news reports out of Moscow last week _ one probably false,
one sadly true _ served as reminders of the rise of Russian
journalism in the years just before the collapse of communism, and
its paradoxical retreat these days.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a small plane carrying the journalist and media
executive Artyom Borovik crashed soon after takeoff from Moscow.
Borovik's burial over the weekend was laced with eulogies by
Russian officials recalling the path-breaking reports that he wrote
in 1987, at age 27, on the faltering, brutal campaign in
Afghanistan for the magazine Ogonyok.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, word came that the Russian procurator's office had
filed criminal charges against Andrei Babitsky, a Radio Liberty
reporter, for aiding the enemy while covering the war in Chechnya.
The procurator's office denied the report, carried by the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Babitsky, who was captured by Russian soldiers
as he left Grozny, the Chechen capital, and held incommunicado more
than a month, still seems a government target. In an interview
published on Friday in the newspaper Kommersant, the acting
president, Vladimir Putin, said, ``What Babitsky did is much more
dangerous than shooting a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   One war correspondent declared a hero, one reviled. Why the
difference? The kind of government involved? The kind of war? And
is Russia different from other societies in not being objective
about the people killing its sons? Peter Arnett's CNN reports from
Baghdad during the Persian Gulf War starting in 1990 did not endear
him to many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the adulation of Borovik, a son of the Soviet elite, and
the demonization of Babitsky, who covered Russian setbacks from the
Chechen side, both reflect journalism's fragility in Russia. They
underscore Moscow's willingness, then and now, to control
journalists and journalism. Whether the instrument of control is
permission or punishment is less relevant than the raw willingness
to exercise control.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev permitted Borovik's reporting, which touched a
popular chord and prepared the country for the army's withdrawal
from Afghanistan. Putin, or perhaps rogue soldiers, punished
Babitsky for reporting that contradicted the government and could
have undermined support for the second Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechnya is a popular war in the eyes of most Russians,'' said
Emma Gray, European program coordinator of the Committee to Protect
Journalists in New York. The apartment bombings in Moscow, linked
in the popular mind to Chechen terrorists, helped make it so, and
Chechen kidnapping of Russian journalists in their region provided
little incentive for enterprising reporting.
</P>
<P>
   With notable exceptions, Gray said, Russian coverage of this war
was dominated by ``self-censorship'' by journalists who felt ``they
would be branded unpatriotic traitors'' if they contradicted the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Masha Lipman, deputy editor of the Moscow newspaper Itogi, one
of the few news outlets to offer critical war coverage, distrusts
comparisons between Borovik and Babitsky, in part because of their
different audiences. Borovik's Soviet audience numbered in the
millions. The programs of the U.S. government-sponsored Radio
Liberty, she said, are heard by a small group of listeners in the
big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was reading Borovik,'' she said in an interview last
week. ``Who is listening to Babitsky?'' His obscurity and his
Western ties, she said, made him an easy mark. What happened to
Borovik _ and his later success as a television correspondent in
Russia and on the CBS program ``60 Minutes'' _ was a reflection of
his talent, his connections and the government's needs. ``What
happened to Babitsky,'' Lipman said, ``was the result of a system
with bad instincts and poor operations'' and a visceral fury at
reporters who contradict the military.
</P>
<P>
   She points to her own publication, and to some programs on NTV,
the independent television network, as proof that not all news
outlets parrot government pronouncements. Gray agreed, but added
that the treatment of Babitsky, who spent more than a month in
captivity, might be a harbinger of more trouble for contrary-minded
reporters. Borovik's fame did not deter the government television
network from canceling his program, ``Top Secret,'' last year,
after it looked into possible Kremlin corruption.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to Chechnya, contrary-mindedness was relatively
rare. ``In the main, journalists were content to be a mouthpiece of
their government,'' Gray said. ``It's a tragedy.''

FIAT WEIGHS SALE TO GM OF A STAKE IN ITS AUTO LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Fiat is close to selling a minority stake in its car
operations to General Motors after apparently failing to sell the
entire division to DaimlerChrysler, auto industry officials and
investment bankers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat's board is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the
proposed transaction with GM and is fairly likely to approve a
deal, industry executives and bankers said Sunday after insisting
on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting could last into Tuesday, and the board might ask
its negotiators to continue working beyond then, especially if
DaimlerChrysler comes back with a more attractive proposal at the
last moment, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Italy, where the troubles of Fiat's car division
have been a long-running national story, reported Sunday that Fiat
would hand over a 20 percent stake in its car operations in
exchange for a 5 percent stake in GM and possibly a seat on GM's
board. The transaction would also involve some sharing of engines
and auto parts and Fiat's use of the Internet buying service for
parts that GM, DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor are setting up, the
papers reported. But auto industry officials said Sunday that these
and other provisions of the deal were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino of Italy said that some
alliance between Fiat and a foreign carmaker was ``an inevitable
move.'' He told La Repubblica, a daily in Rome, that ``whoever
wishes to hold on to Fiat in its present form risks marginalizing
it further and further.''
</P>
<P>
   GM, DaimlerChrysler and Fiat representatives declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If Fiat sells part or all of its car business, it is likely to
focus on its profitable divisions, which make heavy trucks and
tractors. Fiat is considering whether to make a bid for Volvo AB,
the world's second-largest maker of heavy trucks, executives close
to the company said Sunday. Fiat had tried unsuccessfully last year
to buy all of the Swedish company, which decided instead to sell
its car-building division to Ford and focus only on heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is widely expected to use antitrust
concerns to block Volvo's $7.4 billion acquisition of Scania,
Sweden's other big truck maker. If the commission does so, Volvo
would be a ripe target for a takeover, and Fiat might make an
unsolicited offer, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Volvo has made preliminary contact with several
rivals, including Renault's truck unit, about a possible
combination, the executives said, though talks are not expected to
begin in earnest until the European Commission makes its final
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat, Italy's largest company with investments across many
industries, has been struggling for nearly a year with the question
of what to do with its car operations, which have been gradually
losing market share in Italy and in Europe for years. Having
publicly adopted the General Electric Co.'s management philosophy
of abandoning markets in which it does not hold a commanding market
share, Fiat has courted every big automaker in the world in recent
months in search of an alliance or buyer for its car operations.
Fiat still sells Ferraris in the United States but stopped selling
new Fiat brand cars here in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat's attractions are its strong market share in South America,
its shrunken but still large market share in Italy and its lineup
of freshly redesigned small cars, auto executives have said in
interviews in recent months. While Fiat held 11 percent of the
European market last year, it had nearly 38 percent of the Italian
market last year and 30 percent of the promising Brazilian market.
</P>
<P>
   And while the small-car market around the world is extremely
unprofitable because manufacturers in South Korea and other
recently industrialized countries are producing too many of them,
rising oil prices are beginning to reawaken auto manufacturers'
interest in the market segment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But potential buyers have been leery of Fiat's reputation for
overstaffed, inefficient factories in Italy, with powerful unions
and mediocre quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government's recent enthusiasm for a Fiat deal with
a foreign automaker has sparked hope that government money might be
used to help unionized workers retire, allowing Fiat to slim down
its factory work forces, said an American executive who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   GM has embarked on a global strategy of tying itself to midsize
automakers with large stakes in their home markets or with valuable
technology. In Japan, it has long had minority stakes in Isuzu and
Suzuki and a technology alliance with Toyota Motor. This winter it
took a stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars and
is a leader in all-wheel-drive technology, and agreed to start
buying six-cylinder engines from Honda.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced in early January that it was exercising an option
to buy the half of Sweden's Saab that it did not already own. And
in a single week in mid-January, the company entered into marketing
partnerships with Sony, America Online and NetZero.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman, articulated the new strategy
in a speech on Jan. 17, repudiating the company's nearly
century-old strategy of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is to develop long-term relationships with other
companies that offer a unique advantage to the General Motors group
of brands and businesses,'' Smith said then. ``This alliance
strategy is our major thrust, and it is clearly a different
approach to growth than most people have associated with General
Motors _ or with the rest of the industry, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has been losing market share rapidly in the small-car segment
in the United States to Korean producers and recently canceled
plans to redesign the small Chevrolet Cavalier because it could not
figure out how to make a profit on it. Even GM's Saturn unit has
been cutting back output because of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has also been looking for alliances and
acquisitions lately, both to penetrate difficult markets and to
respond to regulatory pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Because its Mercedes and Chrysler divisions both make fairly
large cars and sport utility vehicles, DaimlerChrysler faces
difficulties in meeting the tighter fuel-economy requirements
planned by the European Community, and has been looking for ways to
increase its share of the small-car market as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Like GM, DaimlerChrysler also needs to sell more small cars so
as to lure younger, less affluent buyers to its brands.

WHAT'S IN A NAME? ARCANE INTERNAL BICKERING, INTERNET AGENCY GRIMLY
LEARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ The battle-weary group of appointees who have
spent more than a year trying to invent a democratic charter for
the Internet's first administrative body arrived here in Egypt last
week eager to finish a major part of their mission _ completing
plans for an election that would choose their successors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as they were bombarded with calls for delay, 18 months
of setbacks and of frustration exploded into a tense, sometimes
hostile showdown between the group _ the founding board of the
Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann _ and the
people they were supposed to represent.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was created by the Clinton administration to administer
the Internet's address, or domain-name system, and at the same time
produce a plan for turning that responsibility over to a fully
elected successor board.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, it found itself resisting rather than embracing
real consensus among public interest groups over popular election
of the 50 percent of the new 18-member board that is supposed to
represent the global network's tens of millions of users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the board bowed to the pressure, agreeing on Friday
at the end of a four-day meeting to slow the election process and
study ways to improve it .
</P>
<P>
   But it was clearly an unwelcome extension of terms for the
initial 10 appointed board members who had planned to hand over
Icann's reins on Sept. 30. Appointed late in 1998, the board's
first meeting, in Cambridge, Mass., offered a taste of the acrimony
that lay ahead. The members were greeted by a hostile crowd of
several hundred, some of whom saw Icann as part of a secret
conspiracy to advance big-business interests at the expense of the
Internet's freewheeling traditions.
</P>
<P>
   And since then, the board's every action seems to have evoked
controversy. Last year, the group was summoned before Congress and
forced to open board meetings to the public and to drop plans for
financing its operations through a $1 annual fee on each of the
more than 6 million addresses registered in the popular .com, .net
and .org domains.
</P>
<P>
   Its very first charge _ to break up Network Solutions'
government-sanctioned monopoly in the highly lucrative domain-name
registration business _ got bogged down in protracted negotiations
after the Herndon, Va., company refused to recognize Icann's
authority.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps its biggest trial has been the tug of war between
special interests wanting the board to move quickly to add new
levels of competition in the registration of domain names and those
calling for more attention to getting the process right.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the appointed board members are accused almost
daily, on postings to e-mail lists, of everything from professional
ethics breaches to criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   But such tensions, said Jerry Berman, executive director of the
Center for Democracy and Technology, which led the call for an
overhaul of the general election process, were simply growing
pains. The board's animosity toward his group last week, he said,
amounted to ``shooting the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once everybody calmed down, they made their decision on its
merits,'' Berman said. ``I think they will be surprised at how much
applause they get. I think it will be a unique experience for
them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The showdown had been brewing since March 3, when two public
interest groups, Berman's Center for Democracy as well as Common
Cause, jointly issued a 30-page report criticizing Icann's plan for
letting computer users around the world elect nine of the 18 board
members by Sept. 30. The first nine have already joined the interim
board; they were elected last fall by three so-called supporting
organizations representing different interests: Internet service
providers, domain-name registration companies and intellectual
property interests concerned about protecting their brands online.
</P>
<P>
   Icann's plan called for letting any Internet user 16 or older
with a permanent e-mail and postal address vote for a special
council that would in turn select the nine at-large members. But
the March 3 report said the plan was plagued by conflicting goals,
an unclear mission and a lack of accountability and safeguards
against the election's being captured by special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   It urged the group to put aside deadline pressures and to
instead concentrate on improving the process to ensure that the
election would be legitimate. The report urged Icann to replace the
electoral council system with direct voting, to more clearly define
the organization's role as an Internet administrator and to better
educate the public about its role in administering the Internet's
address system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the board agreed to hold direct elections for five
new members by Nov. 1, then study how best to elect the four others
and create a permanent process.
</P>
<P>
   Berman's counterpart at Common Cause, Scott Harshbarger, said
the board's compromise set the stage ``for holding open and
democratic elections on an international basis in the new online
world of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear if Icann can set aside the animosities that
erupted here last week and work with the Center for Democracy and
Technology, Common Cause and The Carter Center's election
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The board's acting chairwoman, Esther Dyson, told her colleagues
on Friday that ``there is a wealth of experience being offered,''
adding, ``I know some people don't appreciate it, but I hope we
will continue to draw on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other board members, however, felt that the Center for
Democracy, Common Cause and some other consumer-related interests
had arrived in Cairo asking for too much too late.
</P>
<P>
   The public interest groups only started attending Icann meetings
last August. And their study of the at-large elections was not
begun until the board had already adopted its two-tier plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Kraaijenbrink, a Dutch board member, reacted with hostility
as people lined up on Thursday to oppose the plan, which Icann had
hoped to make final on Friday. He angrily told the crowd, ``I don't
want to be back to square one,'' and emphasized that he was eager
to hand the reins to a fully elected board.
</P>
<P>
   Icann's charge, said Kraaijenbrink and a fellow board member,
Gregory Crew, is to oversee the narrow technical functions of the
Internet. But these functions are not easily isolated from broader
policy issues. One of the first decisions the interim Icann board
made was to prohibit cybersquatting _ the bad-faith registration of
domain names based on others' trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   After a night's rest, the full board decided to streamline and
stagger the elections _ a move that many of those attending saw as
a key test of Icann's legitimacy as a bottoms-up governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not persuaded by the arguments,'' Kraaijenbrink said.
``But I observed the reality of the situation.''

PUSH FOR NEW MAGAZINE MAY TEST AOL-TIME WARNER SYNERGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Wyland, managing editor of Real Simple, a new magazine
from Time Inc. that will arrive on newsstands in two weeks, sat in
her austere office last week and showed off proof pages of the
first issue. She pointed to an artful, stylishly minimalist
photograph illustrating the article ``The Fastest, Easiest Way to
Clean Your Bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you have never, ever seen such a beautiful picture of a
toilet bowl,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Do beautiful photographs of toilet bowls _ complete with a
toilet brush jutting jauntily from the lip _ make a magazine? The
editors of Time Inc. think so, and so does their prospective
partner, America Online, which has been working with the Real
Simple staff to plan promotion for the magazine since AOL and Time
Warner announced their plans to merge in January.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the affiliation with AOL helps the introduction of Real
Simple will be closely watched at Time Inc. It is, in its
relatively small way, a test run of the larger possibilities for
synergy between America Online and Time Warner, a company that has
had a reputation for preventing the easy meshing of internal
corporate cultures. It will also test how AOL balances the
interests of Time Warner properties against those of other content
providers on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ann S. Moore, president of the People division of Time Inc. _
the group that includes People, People en Espanol, Teen People and
In Style _ said that the magazine, the first to be introduced after
the merger announcement two months ago, would use AOL as a
promotional platform and also look to AOL members for feedback on
editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   In the first month of Real Simple's arrival on newsstands, for
example, the AOL welcome page, which has some of the highest
traffic on the Internet, will contain a link to a Real Simple Web
site. The site will feature the cover, table of contents, a
sampling of articles, AOL message boards and chat rooms concerned
with Real Simple issues. It will also have a special subscription
offer for AOL subscribers that is now planned to last at least a
year. AOL has more than 20 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. as part of a broad arrangement across all its
magazines, will begin to distribute AOL discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL and Real Simple have the same mission: to simplify the
consumer's life,'' Moore said. ``We can leverage the Time Inc.
assets to promote the magazine, and when you crank up AOL on top of
that and use the power of their 21 million subscribers _ well, put
it this way, I have not broken out in a sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple is based on what might appear to be a paradox: if
your life is complicated, buy more stuff _ or at least a
subscription to a new magazine that may gather dust bunnies under
the bed along with all the other magazines you have not had the
chance to throw out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine's advertising media kit, Real Simple
is ``about streamlining, refining and distilling your life to the
essence of what pleases you.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a hybrid, combining the lifestyle approach of Martha
Stewart Living, the common-sense housekeeping guidelines of Good
Housekeeping, the shopping opportunities of In Style (with ``800''
numbers and Web addresses in captions so readers can easily buy
featured merchandise) and the Internet service articles of PC
Magazine. An article concerned with bathroom grout _ beautifully
photographed, of course _ mixes with a fashion feature about the
classic white shirt and a guide to paying household bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Sareyan, the magazine's publisher, said Real Simple
was not about ``move-to-the-wilderness kind of simplification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people who feel that their lives are out of
control, and the idea of simplifying your life is such a wonderful
vehicle for so many advertisers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple's target demographic group _ mostly working mothers
in their 30s and 40s who are fairly affluent and, for the most
part, college-educated _ happens to match up neatly with AOL's
family-oriented approach, Sareyan noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're all about is so close to what AOL's brand equity is
all about,'' he said. ``We both embrace the Internet as a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., said
that while the demographic profiles meshed, it was not yet clear if
the cross-promotional plans would yield results.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the promotional benefits for both companies were
potentially enormous, especially once subscribers to Time Inc.
magazines _ titles as various as Time, Baby Talk, Cooking Light,
Sports Illustrated, Wallpaper, Life, Mutual Funds and Weight
Watchers _ received the free AOL disc.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said one advantage of using AOL as a promotional tool
would be instant response from AOL members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get research back from their membership, and their
members get to tell our editors story ideas, give us feedback on
ideas we may want to do, submit their favorite recipe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Time Inc., the promotional push has been fierce.
Subscription copies of Money, Entertainment Weekly, In Style and
People went out with cover wrappers offering subscriptions to Real
Simple, and 20 of Time Inc.'s 30 magazines carried ads for Real
Simple.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how the deal with AOL will affect other Time
Inc. magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stephen M. Case, chairman of AOL, and Norman Pearlstine,
editor in chief at Time Inc., have said that AOL would not depend
on Time Warner alone to supply content and that Time Inc. would not
use AOL alone as a consumer outlet.
</P>
<P>
   One potential source of concern is that AOL has investments in
both iVillage Inc. and Oxygen Media Inc., whose women's Internet
sites are aimed at the same demographic groups as Real Simple is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Real Simple promotion does raise the specter of being in
a lot of businesses and targeting the same audience and having to
cross-promote everything to that audience,'' said Mark Mooradian,
an analyst at Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Redling, senior vice president of AOL brand marketing who
has been overseeing the Real Simple project, said that while AOL
had always been built on partnerships, there was now a mandate of
sorts to talk about marketing opportunities with the Time Inc.
magazines in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one focus at AOL and that is to deliver the best
content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redling pointed out that AOL featured Sports Illustrated's
swimsuit issue on AOL last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most successful promotion AOL has ever done in the
sense of traffic,'' he said. ``So we are talking to all the other
titles.''

`TALK IS NOT ENOUGH': DEMYSTIFYING SESSIONS ON THE COUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Although we live in a society that has become psychologically
saturated, psychotherapy still seems to have a somewhat clouded
image,'' writes Willard Gaylin at the opening of his expert and
instructive new book, ``Talk Is Not Enough: How Psychotherapy
Really Works.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this cloudiness are several, he continues:
first, the growing confusion over what exactly constitutes mental
illness (we have engineered ``the medicalization of woe,'' he
writes); second, the decline of psychoanalysis's standing over the
last 40 years and the emergence of ``quirkier, trendier, slicker
treatments'' (``EST and other forms of cathartic weekend cures'');
and finally the sinking of Freud's reputation to ``its lowest point
since he achieved early fame at the beginning of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of Gaylin's book is to demystify psychotherapy and
explain it _ as he puts it, ``to examine the complex and often
perplexing interactions between therapist and patient that produce
significant changes in the patient's behavior and perceptions.'' It
is ``a book about psychotherapy by a man who still passionately
believes in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaylin translates his passion by defining the fundamentals of
therapy and the theories of the school he happens to belong to. A
graduate of the Columbia Psychoanalytic Center and now a clinical
professor of psychiatry at Columbia College of Physicians and
Surgeons, he illustrates his more elusive points with lively case
histories from his experience as a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentals seem obvious: how to pick a therapist; how the
initial interview usually goes; what purpose dreams serve; the
roles of catharsis, insight, free association, transference, and
the ``much-maligned couch,'' which he argues can free patients to
fantasize but can also sink them into passivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``One intriguing area of nonverbal communication with which we
are all familiar is lateness, a commonplace personality trait,'' he
writes. ``Chronic lateness is a planned event,'' and ``is the
quintessential passive-aggressive mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the patient often feels hostile toward the therapist,
``the therapist will have some negative emotional responses even to
his most cherished patients,'' Gaylin writes. ``Often it will be
impatience (`For God's sake, why doesn't he finally take the woman
to bed. She has been waiting for this for weeks.'). For the most
part these must not be explicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But from such practical observations Gaylin can plunge rather
suddenly into his own fundamental theories.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, writing about the seemingly simple phenomenon of
insight, he recalls the offhand observation of a mentor of his,
wondering ``if insight isn't really the product of change rather
than the cause of it,'' by which he meant ``that the recovered
unconscious memories which were presumed to initiate the process of
change were actually the products of unconscious changes that had
already occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   With similar plunges Gaylin takes us back to his training as an
analyst at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Center. And he introduces us
to the ideas of the center's founder, Dr. Sandor Rado (1890-1972),
who rejected Freud's theory of the libido, in which human
development was viewed in a psychosexual perspective, and replaced
it with a theory that focused on childhood dependency as its
central concern.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of his training, Gaylin sees the cure of
neuroses as involving the recognition in the present of distorted
perspectives that trace back to childhood. Then once patients see,
therapists must encourage them to act on their insights in the real
world. Because therapists are far from neutral agents, Gaylin
insists, they are required morally to do so.
</P>
<P>
   So by summing up his techniques Gaylin attempts to dispel the
clouds obscuring psychotherapy. As for Freud, Gaylin writes that he
may have been ``an imperfect psychiatrist with a somewhat narrow
view of mental illness,'' but he remains ``the father of all modern
knowledge of human perceptions and behavior,'' and his current low
standing guarantees ``an early rediscovery and resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   What is puzzling about Gaylin's defense of psychotherapy is that
he does not directly address its severest critics: the sleep
theorists, for instance, who argue that dreams have nothing to do
with the unconscious, or the pharmacologists who say that drugs are
the only solution to psychological problems, or the empiricists who
insist that the efficacy of psychotherapy can never be measured.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, he does not draw on helpful evidence to the contrary,
like the latest dream research, which at least allows for the
possibility that Freud was right; or experiments with snails
suggesting that by inducing certain behavior one can produce
physiological changes; or pharmacological research indicating that
so far most psychotropic drugs tend to attack symptoms rather than
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Gaylin simply asserts: ``Psychotherapy is not a fraud.
It does work.'' And then he sets about to prove it by identifying
what he calls ``the common therapeutic maneuvers that are operative
under the general rubric of psychotherapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, as things turn out, he does considerably better than mere
identification. He makes clear how more than talk goes on in the
therapeutic session and why the oddly asymmetrical exchanges of the
therapist and the patient can theoretically effect change. But mind
and matter are converging faster than is dreamed of in Gaylin's
philosophy. One of these days, we'll understand scientifically why
psychotherapy can be so healing.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CONSIDERS BUYING BACK SOME OF ITS OWN SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FlOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren E. Buffett is not particularly enamored of the stocks
that Berkshire Hathaway owns, even though they have declined
substantially in price. But he has found a stock he thinks is cheap
_ one that Berkshire may begin buying soon: Berkshire Hathaway's
own shares.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a dreadful one for Berkshire. Its major 1998
acquisition, General Re, had poor results and many of the stocks in
the portfolio that brought fame and wealth to Buffett, the
Berkshire chairman and chief executive, lost value even while the
overall market was rising. Overall, Berkshire reported profits of
$1.56 billion, or $1,025 a share, in 1999, down from $2.83 billion,
or $2,262 a share a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Berkshire's Class A stock fell during the year for
the first time since 1990, and it has continued to fall this year,
closing Friday at $41,300, less than half the $84,000 peak it
reached in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to shareholders in Berkshire's annual report,
released over the weekend, Buffett again warned that stock prices
are generally high, reflecting investors' ``wildly optimistic''
expectations. As for the companies in which Berkshire has large
positions, ``the prices of the fine businesses we already own are
just not that attractive,'' he wrote. ``That's why we haven't added
to our present holdings.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire has never bought back any of its own shares, and
Buffett said that he thinks that share repurchases are often done
by companies interested in pumping up the price of their shares
even though they are already overvalued and buying back shares
will, in the long run, hurt those shareholders who stay.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffett said that when the share price fell below $45,000 in
February, he considered making purchases, but decided against doing
so until shareholders could be told of the possibility. The
February plunge came on rumors regarding Buffett's health. The
price soon recovered when those rumors were denied, but in recent
days it has begun falling again.
</P>
<P>
   By setting a price below which he deems the shares attractive,
Buffett may have provided some support for the stock even if the
company does not make purchases. ``I view it as an IQ test for
investors,'' said Alice Shroeder, an analyst for PaineWebber. ``If
Warren Buffett is a buyer, would you be a buyer or a seller?''
</P>
<P>
   That comment reflects Buffett's legendary status as an investor.
It is a reputation that has made Berkshire's annual meeting
something of a pilgrimage for thousands of investors _ so much so
that this year's annual meeting is being held on a Saturday, rather
than on a Monday as in past years, because Buffett feared the
crowds would tie up traffic in downtown Omaha if it were held on a
weekday.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffett's recent performance as a money manager leaves
something to be desired, as he wrote in his letter to shareholders.
Buffett has long measured his performance against the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index. It gained 19.5 percent last year, not including
dividends, while Berkshire's book value, largely reflecting the
value of the investments, rose just 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the worst absolute performance of my tenure and,
compared to the S&AMP;P, the worst relative performance as well,''
Buffett wrote in the company's annual report, released Saturday.
``Even Inspector Clouseau could find the guilty party: your
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the company's seven largest investments at the beginning
of 1999, only one _ American Express _ rose as much as the S&AMP;P did
during the year. Two others, The Washington Post Co. and Wells
Fargo, showed more modest gains, and four declined: Coca-Cola, Walt
Disney, Freddie Mac and Gillette. During 1999, Buffett did not add
to any of the positions. He appears to have sold all _ or at least
most _ of the Disney stake and to have made smaller sales of Wells
Fargo and Freddie Mac shares. So far this year, all of the six
still held have gone down in price, while Disney has recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Buffett has avoided technology investments. ``We
share the general view that society will be transformed by their
products and services,'' he wrote in the annual report. ``Our
problem _ which we can't solve by studying up _ is that we have no
insights into which participants in the tech field posess a truly
durable competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Berkshire did invest in Microsoft preferred
stock that was later converted to common stock. If the company
still owns that stock _ and Buffett did not discuss it in his
letter _ it would be worth $19 million now. But that is a small
amount relative to Berkshire's six major equity investments, whose
market value at the end of last year ranged from $960 million for
The Washington Post to $11.7 billion for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Berkshire Hathaway remains very much an ``old economy''
company. Its major business is insurance, as the owner of a number
of companies including Geico, an auto insurer that has been gaining
market share and in the process making life harder for other
insurers with higher cost structures. In 1998, Berkshire Hathaway
bought General Re, which suffered an underwriting loss of $1.2
billion last year. Buffett blamed industry conditions, but said
there were signs that pricing of reinsurance policies was starting
to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett said the company's other operations generally performed
well, with the exception of its shoe business. As the owner of
Dexter and H.H. Brown, Berkshire is now the largest shoe
manufacturer in the country _ a dubious distinction given the
decline of that industry. He said the company was trying to
maintain American operations, but had shifted some production to
other countries.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Wyland, managing editor of Real Simple, a new magazine
from Time Inc. that will arrive on newsstands in two weeks, sat in
her austere office last week and showed off proof pages of the
first issue. She pointed to an artful, stylishly minimalist
photograph illustrating the article ``The Fastest, Easiest Way to
Clean Your Bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you have never, ever seen such a beautiful picture of a
toilet bowl,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Do beautiful photographs of toilet bowls _ complete with a
toilet brush jutting jauntily from the lip _ make a magazine? The
editors of Time Inc. think so, and so does their prospective
partner, America Online, which has been working with the Real
Simple staff to plan promotion for the magazine since AOL and Time
Warner announced their plans to merge in January.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the affiliation with AOL helps the introduction of Real
Simple will be closely watched at Time Inc. It is, in its
relatively small way, a test run of the larger possibilities for
synergy between America Online and Time Warner, a company that has
had a reputation for preventing the easy meshing of internal
corporate cultures. It will also test how AOL balances the
interests of Time Warner properties against those of other content
providers on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ann S. Moore, president of the People division of Time Inc. _
the group that includes People, People en Espanol, Teen People and
In Style _ said that the magazine, the first to be introduced after
the merger announcement two months ago, would use AOL as a
promotional platform and also look to AOL members for feedback on
editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   In the first month of Real Simple's arrival on newsstands, for
example, the AOL welcome page, which has some of the highest
traffic on the Internet, will contain a link to a Real Simple Web
site. The site will feature the cover, table of contents, a
sampling of articles, AOL message boards and chat rooms concerned
with Real Simple issues. It will also have a special subscription
offer for AOL subscribers that is now planned to last at least a
year. AOL has more than 20 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. as part of a broad arrangement across all its
magazines, will begin to distribute AOL discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL and Real Simple have the same mission: to simplify the
consumer's life,'' Moore said. ``We can leverage the Time Inc.
assets to promote the magazine, and when you crank up AOL on top of
that and use the power of their 21 million subscribers _ well, put
it this way, I have not broken out in a sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple is based on what might appear to be a paradox: if
your life is complicated, buy more stuff _ or at least a
subscription to a new magazine that may gather dust bunnies under
the bed along with all the other magazines you have not had the
chance to throw out.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine's advertising media kit, Real Simple
is ``about streamlining, refining and distilling your life to the
essence of what pleases you.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a hybrid, combining the lifestyle approach of Martha
Stewart Living, the common-sense housekeeping guidelines of Good
Housekeeping, the shopping opportunities of In Style (with ``800''
numbers and Web addresses in captions so readers can easily buy
featured merchandise) and the Internet service articles of PC
Magazine. An article concerned with bathroom grout _ beautifully
photographed, of course _ mixes with a fashion feature about the
classic white shirt and a guide to paying household bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Sareyan, the magazine's publisher, said Real Simple
was not about ``move-to-the-wilderness kind of simplification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people who feel that their lives are out of
control, and the idea of simplifying your life is such a wonderful
vehicle for so many advertisers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple's target demographic group _ mostly working mothers
in their 30s and 40s who are fairly affluent and, for the most
part, college-educated _ happens to match up neatly with AOL's
family-oriented approach, Sareyan noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're all about is so close to what AOL's brand equity is
all about,'' he said. ``We both embrace the Internet as a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., said
that while the demographic profiles meshed, it was not yet clear if
the cross-promotional plans would yield results.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the promotional benefits for both companies were
potentially enormous, especially once subscribers to Time Inc.
magazines _ titles as various as Time, Baby Talk, Cooking Light,
Sports Illustrated, Wallpaper, Life, Mutual Funds and Weight
Watchers _ received the free AOL disc.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said one advantage of using AOL as a promotional tool
would be instant response from AOL members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get research back from their membership, and their
members get to tell our editors story ideas, give us feedback on
ideas we may want to do, submit their favorite recipe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Time Inc., the promotional push has been fierce.
Subscription copies of Money, Entertainment Weekly, In Style and
People went out with cover wrappers offering subscriptions to Real
Simple, and 20 of Time Inc.'s 30 magazines carried ads for Real
Simple.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how the deal with AOL will affect other Time
Inc. magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stephen M. Case, chairman of AOL, and Norman Pearlstine,
editor in chief at Time Inc., have said that AOL would not depend
on Time Warner alone to supply content and that Time Inc. would not
use AOL alone as a consumer outlet.
</P>
<P>
   One potential source of concern is that AOL has investments in
both iVillage Inc. and Oxygen Media Inc., whose women's Internet
sites are aimed at the same demographic groups as Real Simple is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Real Simple promotion does raise the specter of being in
a lot of businesses and targeting the same audience and having to
cross-promote everything to that audience,'' said Mark Mooradian,
an analyst at Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Redling, senior vice president of AOL brand marketing who
has been overseeing the Real Simple project, said that while AOL
had always been built on partnerships, there was now a mandate of
sorts to talk about marketing opportunities with the Time Inc.
magazines in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one focus at AOL and that is to deliver the best
content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redling pointed out that AOL featured Sports Illustrated's
swimsuit issue on AOL last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most successful promotion AOL has ever done in the
sense of traffic,'' he said. ``So we are talking to all the other
titles.''

   CHINA-WINE (Shanghai) _ Red wine is the drink of the moment in
China, and winemakers around the world are feeling the effects.
Demand for wine picked up after the government began promoting
fruit-based alcohol a few years ago, and Western winemakers rushed
in, shipping wine in giant 22,000 liter containers. But now the
Chinese want domestic wine, so much of the Western supply is being
sold at happy-hour prices by Customs after sitting for months in
government warehouses. This isn't doing much for the wine
exporters, and it isn't exactly helping the Chinese develop a taste
for the grape. It's common for Chinese wine drinkers to mix red
wine with Sprite and white with Coke and to drink the concoctions
in gulps. By Craig S. Smith.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the late 1970s when Times Square belonged to the
prostitutes and peep shows, a collection of theater companies moved
into a handful of stages carved out of shuttered massage parlors on
West 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed the theaters suffered through
stickups, recessions and aborted development projects and survived
to see a renewed Midtown rise around them.
</P>
<P>
   But now the redevelopment of 42nd Street is altering the
theaters' future. The local development corporation that helped
create the strip now known as Theater Row is closing four of the
playhouses as it prepares to break ground on an apartment tower and
collection of new stages between Dyer and Ninth Avenues. There are
no definite plans for the western half of Theater Row, between Dyer
and 10th Avenues, but the property owners and the theater companies
that make their homes there say development is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Although actors and stagehands are eagerly anticipating working
in the new spaces that will rise on Theater Row, many said they
would miss the idiosyncrasies of their current homes. Others fear
that the most experimental theaters, which are also generally the
poorest, will be pushed out of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would moan about the lousy dressing rooms, but there is
something that is very actor-friendly and theater-friendly about
these spaces,'' said Anita Keal, who performs in ``The Countess,''
a play about a 19th-century love affair. The show plans to move to
Lamb's Theater on West 44th Street after its current home, the
Samuel Beckett Theater, closes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Keal spoke, crew members preparing the stage for the next
performance offered their assessments of the theater, with its
slightly-too-small stage, oddly sloping ceiling and unpredictable
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got its quirks,'' said Juliet King, the assistant stage
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Carhart, the master electrician, added, ``But the quirks
are what give it its charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit theater company, opened the
first stage on the strip in 1975. Three years later the 42nd Street
Development Corp. opened several more theaters in an attempt to use
the performing arts to renew a desolate block. The development
corporation offered inexpensive, often below-market rents to
theater groups, which in return stabilized the neighborhood and
brought in new, paying visitors. Theater Row became one of the
early successes in the continuing effort to reinvigorate 42nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight playhouses on Theater Row, Playwrights Horizons has
been the most significant, giving a start to Broadway productions
like ``Driving Daisy,'' ``Sunday in the Park With George'' and most
recently, ``James Joyce's `The Dead.''' Other theaters have also
had success. ``Nunsense'' ran for nine years at the Douglas
Fairbanks Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of purpose; we were united on this bizarre
block of Manhattan,'' said Andre Bishop, who worked at Playwrights
Horizons from 1975 to 1991 and is now the artistic director at the
Lincoln Center Theater. ``Real estate gentrification was the last
thing on our minds. We were just putting on plays.''
</P>
<P>
   But the theaters did renew the neighborhood, and now the more
recent Midtown boom has opened the way for more lucrative
development. The first theaters to be affected will be the four
owned by the development corporation: the Theater Row, Judith
Anderson, Harold Clurman and Beckett Theaters.
</P>
<P>
   All four will close this month to make way for the redevelopment
project. Although the contracts are not complete, the developement
corporation is planning to rebuild much of the block between Ninth
and Dyer Avenues and create four 99-seat stages, a 199-seat
theater, a 499-seat playhouse co-owned by the Shubert Organization
and an apartment tower. Some theater hands wonder aloud if the
nonprofit theaters that built the row will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theaters held that area together when no one wanted to go
there,'' said Tom Herman, who has directed shows at the Beckett and
at the Pulse Ensemble Theater. ``But it will be difficult for the
small producers to get back into Theater Row.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Papert, president of the development corporation, disputed
that prediction. The proposed theaters will continue to offer
discounted, affordable space to nonprofit theater productions and
will not change what has made Theater Row a vibrant artistic
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that is nice and cozy about Theater Row,
and that is not going to disappear,'' he said. ``It will be just as
it has always been.''
</P>
<P>
   But the current weekly rent for nonprofit groups, $1,800, will
probably rise when the the old, worn stages are replaced with new,
well-equipped performance areas, Papert acknowledged. It is also
unclear how much office space will be available in the new complex
for nonprofit groups to rent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Theater of New York has until next Monday to move its
offices from Theater Row, and Tuvia Tenenbom, the artistic
director, is desperately hunting for a new home. The real strength
of Theater Row, Tenenbom said, was that it gave small companies
access to a mainstream, suburban audience that the small downtown
stages have a harder time attracting.
</P>
<P>
   ``On 42nd Street you get a different audience, people from New
Jersey and Long Island,'' he said. ``Here we were trying to
convince the general public that pure theater isn't dead.''
Tenenbom said he feared that the Jewish Theater would have trouble
finding the money to rent the new stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be all commercial; it will be Merrill Lynch in the
theater,'' he said. ``It is sad. It is a little bit of the death of
the theater.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Max Ferra brought the Intar
Hispanic-American Arts Center to Theater Row in 1978, leaving last
year to make way for the renovation. But he said that he had been
promised space in the new complex and that he believed it would
attract a bigger audience and help his organization grow. ``We will
be part of the new 42nd Street,'' he said. ``It will be a complete
uplift of the whole street from east to west.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Sprecher, the Off Broadway theater manager who will run the
new 499-seat theater, said the larger theater would bring a new,
bigger audience to the smaller theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building an ideally suited playhouse for plays and
small musicals,'' he said. ``Off Broadway is entering into what
people think of as mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no specific plans for the block between Dyer
and 10th Avenues, tenants there are on short-term or month-to-month
leases. William J. Condren, the general partner of Theater Row
Phase 2, which controls the property, said he anticipated
conducting a beauty pageant among developers interested in building
on the land. `` Right hasn't shown up yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the theater companies on the block worry that Right
will come along shortly. Alexa Kelly, the artistic director of the
Pulse Ensemble Theater at 432 West 42nd St., said she feared her
company would lose its space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked very hard to help the community, and now we are
feeling very upset that we are just being ousted,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Krebs, the owner of the John Houseman and Fairbanks
Theaters, said his stages would remain open at least two more
years. He said he hoped that whoever was chosen to rebuild the
block between Dyer and 10th Avenues would create new spaces for Off
Broadway theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inevitable that the whole block will be changed,'' Krebs
said. ``The only hope is that the Off Broadway need will be met and
the vision will be realized with a string of theaters along 42nd
Street.''

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin
KleiDf(K &Cx1f; '',igourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood in suburban Connecticut appeared idyllic from the
outside, but he confesses to harboring ``demons,'' suffering
frequent illnesses and being overly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity that plagued him in his youth has served him
well as an adult observer of human emotions. He credits his
``finely calibrated compass that picks up what's going on in a
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Moody began to write in earnest, producing short
stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Son of literary parents, he majored in English at Brown
University and began to write ``Garden State'' in 1986 while living
in Hoboken, N.J., holding down a day job in the editorial
department of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job slowed work on his novel, it taught him the
intricacies of the publishing business _ how to find an agent, how
to write a contract. It did not help sell his book, which was
rejected 22 times in a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Moody despaired of drowning in the seas of rejection. Then, a
small press called Pushcart threw him a lifeline and even awarded
him its Pushcart Editors' Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' began in 1990.
Having quit his day job, he was able to write more swiftly,
completing the book in just two years. He was single then,
supporting himself on freelance editing and living hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Storm'' was accepted by big-time publisher Little,
Brown and Co., and Moody forged a relationship with an editor who
respects his distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   Moody became proficient at his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out how to tell a story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Moody tries to do something different with each of his works,
their thread ``fealty to human emotions and human psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden State'' is the story of disaffected youth lost in
suburban New Jersey, contemplating life, death and rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple America'' is a deeply emotional book that examines how
one family's remorse ``trickles down through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Veil,'' a non-fiction work due out this summer,
comes from family folklore about the Rev. Joseph Moody, said to
have inspired ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' a short story by
American author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Ice Storm'' has been his bestseller, thanks in part to
the movie. The grim saga traces a brief span in the life of
Benjamin Hood, a suburbanite bored with marriage who dallies with a
neighbor, struggles to rein in his precocious daughter, Wendy, and
tries to discover himself during the sexual liberation of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was warned to fear the worst from Hollywood, and ``I DID
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the respected Ang Lee, who also directed ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' allayed those fears. One red flag raised was the
casting of Christina Ricci, who had appeared in such films as ``The
Addams Family'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ricci's teen sexpot portrayal impressed Moody, as did the
film as a whole. Now he is waiting to hear about options on his
other works. Buoyed by his positive experiences with ``The Ice
Storm,'' he would happily return to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With such success comes book tours, not the choicest part of the
profession. One tour took Moody on the road for five grueling
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys meeting his readers, most of whom are under age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is an isolating profession, after all, he notes as he
sits alone in his home on Fishers Island, while Amy lives across
the water in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is Amy who reads his work first and then filters the reviews,
passing along only those that offer constructive criticism.
Although wary of shaping his style to please critics, Moody says he
sometimes can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust in the possibility that some harsh criticism will give
me an opportunity to improve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And improvement brings joy. &QL; Reach the reporter at

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Approaching Thunderstorm,'' which greets the visitor at the
Martin Johnson Heade retrospective at the National Gallery of Art
in Washington, is one of the high points in 19th-century American
painting. It is also the hands-down winner in what might be called
the dark-before-the-storm category, which is saying something,
considering that Heade lived in an era rife with meteorologically
correct landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The painting achieves this status by being both correct and not:
that is, palpably naturalistic yet dramatically decorative and
artificial. It places us a little distance inland from the edge of
a bay on which a man and dog sit, their backs to us, watching the
approach of a great storm across the water. From bottom to top the
image is a progression of curving bands of color: yellow sand,
eggplant-black water and gray-on-gray sky and clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The progression is divided midway by the bay's sandy outer arms,
which cut into the black water with a pincerlike sharpness that
also suggests twin flashes of lightning. Silhouetted against the
black, the man's red shirt and yellow vest and hat add to the
visual drama.
</P>
<P>
   The stillness of the image is beyond natural. The even, prestorm
light creates the feeling of a stage set, with each band of color
functioning like a separate painted stage flat. And it is a tiny
stage at that. Although a sizable painting, the scene feels small,
as if it were a model rendered at actual size. The man might almost
be a little leprechaun who sits more in our space than the
painting's, transfixed not only by the natural wonder of the storm
but by the abstract wonder of the colors and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approaching Thunderstorm,'' which was acquired by the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1975, is the kind of painting that
you give your heart to before you know anything about the artist
who made it. Thus it is a little disappointing that the Heade show
contains nothing else that is quite like it and little else that is
quite as good. Closest in kind and quality is ``Thunderstorm on
Narragansett Bay,'' from 1868, which has the same purple palette
but fewer of the beguiling spatial tics.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first big Heade survey in 30 years and only the
second ever assembled. It has been organized by Theodore E.
Stebbins Jr., a leading Heade scholar and former curator at the
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where it was seen last fall. The show
comes with a detailed catalog and coincides with the publication of
Stebbins' magnum opus, ``The Life and Work of Martin Johnson Heade:
A Critical Analysis and Catalogue Raisonne.''
</P>
<P>
   The show and books provide a great deal of information about
Heade (pronounced heed), who was a busy man and turned out not only
hundreds of paintings but dozens of articles for the magazine
Forest and Stream under the pen name Didymus. In the end, one's
disappointment about the seeming singularity of ``Approaching
Thunderstorm'' is diluted by the deluge of fact and art, and the
bizarre tale of hard work, inspiration and obsession that they
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Heade was born in 1819 in Lumberton, Bucks County, Pa., and died
in St. Augustine, Fla., in 1904. He studied painting with the
Quaker preacher and folk painter Edward Hicks in Newtown, Pa., and
then struck out on his own, working as a portrait painter (one of
his subjects was Sam Houston), traveling to Rome, where he painted
street urchins with unmistakable American simplicity, and
exhibiting his first landscape at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1856.
</P>
<P>
   In 1858 he met Frederic Edwin Church. a leader of the Hudson
River School. Contact with Church and his work ignited Heade's
deep-seated passion for nature. ``Approaching Thunderstorm,'' which
he painted in 1859, is the first work of his artistic maturity.
</P>
<P>
   A final fascinating fact suggests a personal innocence that
echoes the professional innocence of his folk art beginnings: Heade
did not marry until 1883, when he was 64. He and his new wife, a
woman 20 years his junior named Elizabeth Smith, settled in
Florida, where his painting continued, unabated, until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Heade's work sank into obscurity after his death, and in the
decades after its rediscovery in the 1940s he was usually
considered a tangential member of the Hudson River School or a
latecomer to the American Luminist style. But this show sets him
apart, in a hermetically sealed compartment of his own creation. He
pursued a finely wrought realism from one interrelated motif to
another: landscapes, flower still lifes, hummingbirds, hummingbirds
chaperoned by orchids or passionflowers and, finally, recumbent
magnolia and lotus blossoms, painted a bit larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Heade was particularly obsessed with hummingbirds, describing
his lifelong interest as ``monomaniacal.'' He collected them,
dissected them and made three trips to South America, where the
species was abundant, to study and paint them. His Forest and
Stream bibliography lists nine articles on the subject, including
``Hummingbirds as Pets'' and ``More Hummingbird Phantasies.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Before his marriage, or for two-thirds of his long career, Heade
was something of a hummingbird himself. He never stayed more than a
year or two in one place, living and working in a string of U.S.
and European cities, summering in different locales and traveling
to Jamaica and South America.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his changes of address, he moved slowly as an artist
and sometimes did not seem to move at all. Whether to please
clients or to satisfy some inner urge, he painted his chosen motifs
again and again, often with very little variation and sometimes
with rotelike results. He was especially devoted to the salt marsh
landscape, painting his first in 1859 and his last in 1904. (The
catalogue raisonne reproduces more than 80.) But it is the birds
and flowers that account for nearly half the catalog's 619
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which runs through May 7, proceeds in clear-cut
chapters, with one subject to a gallery, beginning with the marine
paintings and ending with the magnolia still lifes. As it
progresses, it gets weirder and weirder. With all the hummingbirds
flirting with one another and buzzing about their nests and the
implicitly female flowers, it's hard not to think of procreation,
and not just for the survival of the species. By the final gallery
the reclining magnolia blossoms, whose petals fall this way and
that, seem to exude an aura of postcoital dishabille.
</P>
<P>
   But to a great extent the real tension in Heade's work is
spatial. Each new subject inspired a markedly different treatment
of pictorial space, one that was usually smaller, clearer or more
confined than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The layered space and bands of color of ``Approaching
Thunderstorm,'' with its suggestion of miniaturization and its
contrast of far and further, was a sign of things to come. In the
marshland paintings Heade carefully takes the measure of
illusionistic space, marking off perfectly flat fields with neatly
conical haystacks as if placing rooks on a chessboard. And
miniature becomes almost microscopic: we see these images as if
through the wrong end of a telescope. The men harvesting the hay
are so far away they register as tiny dots of red and sometimes
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The red shirt, whether small, as in the marine paintings, or
infinitesimal, as in the salt marsh landscapes, almost amounts to a
Heade signature.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With his hummingbird paintings, which began to proliferate after
his trip to Brazil in 1863-64, Heade brings the dots of color
forward as brilliantly colored and plumed birds, setting up a
dramatic contrast of near and far. The birds are depicted up close,
at actual size and in earnest detail. (They sometimes seem stuck to
the surfaces, like decals.)
</P>
<P>
   Behind them is a misty Andean Eden, where the earth, when
visible at all, presents a steep diagonal. When the hummingbirds
are joined by the big passionflowers and orchids, the images become
more real and the painting more windowlike than ever. The tour de
force in this series _ and nearly as good as ``Approaching
Thunderstorm'' _ is a horizontal painting that depicts 10 different
species of hummingbird darting in and out of a network of vines and
bright red flowers that suggest a decorative grille. (It can make
you think of such contemporary decorative naturalists as Philip
Taaffe and Fred Tomaselli.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the paintings of magnolia blossoms, Heade dispenses
with pretense: space itself has become actual size. It is
completely closed off, velvet lined, a little coffin, which turns
the big white flowers from postcoital to embalmed.
</P>
<P>
   The progression toward claustrophobic space is perhaps forced by
the installation of this show, which obscures the fact that Heade
worked on most of his subjects throughout his life. But it's clear
that he tended, with each new motif, toward contraction,
elimination and control. In the end the contained, finite volume,
so transfixingly hinted at in ``Approaching Thunderstorm,'' is made
real. Between the adored exotic birds, the boxlike space and the
prevailing aura of innocence and obsession, you may leave this show
feeling that you have met the Joseph Cornell of the 19th century.

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVING IN THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin Klein
and Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood in suburban Connecticut appeared idyllic from the
outside, but he confesses to harboring ``demons,'' suffering
frequent illnesses and being overly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity that plagued him in his youth has served him
well as an adult observer of human emotions. He credits his
``finely calibrated compass that picks up what's going on in a
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Moody began to write in earnest, producing short
stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Son of literary parents, he majored in English at Brown
University and began to write ``Garden State'' in 1986 while living
in Hoboken, N.J., holding down a day job in the editorial
department of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job slowed work on his novel, it taught him the
intricacies of the publishing business _ how to find an agent, how
to write a contract. It did not help sell his book, which was
rejected 22 times in a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Moody despaired of drowning in the seas of rejection. Then, a
small press called Pushcart threw him a lifeline and even awarded
him its Pushcart Editors' Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' began in 1990.
Having quit his day job, he was able to write more swiftly,
completing the book in just two years. He was single then,
supporting himself on freelance editing and living hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Storm'' was accepted by big-time publisher Little,
Brown and Co., and Moody forged a relationship with an editor who
respects his distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   Moody became proficient at his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out how to tell a story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Moody tries to do something different with each of his works,
their thread ``fealty to human emotions and human psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden State'' is the story of disaffected youth lost in
suburban New Jersey, contemplating life, death and rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple America'' is a deeply emotional book that examines how
one family's remorse ``trickles down through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Veil,'' a non-fiction work due out this summer,
comes from family folklore about the Rev. Joseph Moody, said to
have inspired ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' a short story by
American author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Ice Storm'' has been his bestseller, thanks in part to
the movie. The grim saga traces a brief span in the life of
Benjamin Hood, a suburbanite bored with marriage who dallies with a
neighbor, struggles to rein in his precocious daughter, Wendy, and
tries to discover himself during the sexual liberation of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was warned to fear the worst from Hollywood, and ``I DID
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the respected Ang Lee, who also directed ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' allayed those fears. One red flag raised was the
casting of Christina Ricci, who had appeared in such films as ``The
Addams Family'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ricci's teen sexpot portrayal impressed Moody, as did the
film as a whole. Now he is waiting to hear about options on his
other works. Buoyed by his positive experiences with ``The Ice
Storm,'' he would happily return to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With such success comes book tours, not the choicest part of the
profession. One tour took Moody on the road for five grueling
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys meeting his readers, most of whom are under age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is an isolating profession, after all, he notes as he
sits alone in his home on Fishers Island, while Amy lives across
the water in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is Amy who reads his work first and then filters the reviews,
passing along only those that offer constructive criticism.
Although wary of shaping his style to please critics, Moody says he
sometimes can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust in the possibility that some harsh criticism will give
me an opportunity to improve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And improvement brings joy. &QL; Reach the reporter at

   CHANGJON, North Korea _ It sounded like quintessential circus
hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Before the performance of the Pyongyang Moranbong Circus, which
is in residence at this tourist village at the base of Mount
Kumgang, an announcer warned the audience of mostly South Koreans
that taking photographs was strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Camera flashes, the announcer said, could cause serious injury
to the performers, who must maintain absolute concentration while
engaged in some of the most dangerous physical feats ever
attempted.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was also reminded that it was in communist North
Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world. ``Clapping
and cheering are appreciated,'' the announcer said, ``but please
stay in your seats until the end of the performance, and please no
suspicious movements.''
</P>
<P>
   The circus has been a popular form of entertainment in socialist
countries, particularly in the former Soviet Union, because
everyone can easily understand and enjoy it, unlike operas and
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circuses were a medium to criticize the bourgeoisie and praise
the socialist revolution, thereby strengthening the ideological
beliefs of the masses,'' said Choi Dai-seok, a professor of North
Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its function in a communist country, the Moranbong
Circus, which has won international acclaim for its artistry and
acts of skill and daring, lived up to its billing in a recent
90-minute performance of eye-popping acrobatics that seemed to
thrill the audience.
</P>
<P>
   With grace and precision the nimble acrobats soared through
seemingly impossible double and triple somersaults off bars and
seesaws, and majestic flips from flying trapezes. The amusing
juggling and balancing acts evoked standing ovations and tears of
joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was skeptical and thought this circus stuff was
just a bunch of North Korean communist propaganda,'' said Lee
Chung, a retailer from Seoul. ``But it was really impressive, a
real testament to their hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Byung Ha-min, a homemaker from Seoul, said: ``It's difficult to
explain, but this was different from other circuses that I've seen.
It was more artistic. It felt like the ballet, theater and circus
all fused together.''
</P>
<P>
   Since late 1998, when North Korea opened scenic Mount Kumgang to
South Koreans, the Moranbong troupe has been performing in a
620-seat dome theater built by the South Korean Hyundai Group,
which operates sightseeing boat tours.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day tours, which cost about $800 a person and are now
open to non-Koreans, provide the only public access to North Korea,
which is still technically at war with South Korea although an
armistice was signed in 1953. For an extra $25 tourists can see the
Moranbong Circus, one of North Korea's major cultural icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In North Korea the circus is considered a high form of
entertainment, and performers are held in the same regard as
accomplished actors and dancers,'' said Lee B.H., Hyundai's
entertainment manager. ``The circus performance itself is primarily
physical and contains many beautiful body movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Choi said, ``In a nation like North Korea, which lacks
widespread television distribution and other facilities, circuses
naturally became very significant modes of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moranbong Circus, which is operated by North Korea's Culture
Ministry, was established in 1962 and has 500 members, 120 of whom
perform at Mount Kumgang. It also includes a 14-piece orchestra and
a master of ceremonies, a woman with a distinct high-pitched North
Korean accent. The remainder of the Moranbong troupe performs in
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Western circuses, which may include many individual
performers like magicians and clowns, those in North Korea feature
mainly ensemble performances. Five, six or more performers take
part in a single act, and their coordination is amazingly precise,
especially during difficult routines.
</P>
<P>
   For example the Moranbong troupe's seesaw jump involves at least
six acrobats performing four somersaults in the air. According to
the troupe's promotional material, that act won first place in the
Monte Carlo Circus Festival in 1985 and first place in the Chinese
International Circus Festival in 1987.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the most physically demanding routines, which proved a
big crowd pleaser, was the pole-climbing act in which performers
appeared to defy gravity while scurrying up a network of poles.
During the act, acrobats unfurled a banner that read ``One Korea,''
which brought a roar of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular with the audience was the Snow Fairies act, in
which four women soared above the audience in various acrobatic
feats that produced the effect of snow falling at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece of art contains the sincere will and hope of the
people for the well being of the great Gen. Kim Jong Il who always
stays up the entire night for our happiness,'' a promotion sheet
said, referring to the country's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Behind North Korea's skilled circuses is a highly selective and
regimented government training program. Children are taught circus
routines at an early age in primary school. Those under 10 who have
a special talent for acrobatics are sent to circus schools. After
six to seven years of training the top students are chosen to join
the Pyongyang or Moranbong troupes, Choi said, where they are
guaranteed a stable lifestyle as long as they excel.
</P>
<P>
   The most talented are often awarded the highly revered title of
``meritorious'' or ``people'' actor. As a result, Choi added,
circus performers are highly regarded in North Korea, and
performers train hard to maintain their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The acts obviously involve danger to the acrobats, and circus
officials said that at least three or four are injured, either
slightly or seriously, each month.
</P>
<P>
   Park Sae-hwan, a former member of the Dong Choon Circus, South
Korea's premier troupe, said the Moranbong Circus was one of the
best in the world, but he also criticized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their showmanship is very awkward because they have lived in a
rigid society and their stage attitude reflects that social
atmosphere,'' he said. ``They cannot breathe with the audience.
They cannot draw natural and spontaneous laughter. But their
trapeze act is world renowned.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the performance, as the troupe took its bows, many
South Korean tourists, wiping tears from their eyes, rushed to the
edge of the stage to take photographs and shake the hands of the
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a moment during the performance, it really did feel as if
we were one nation again,'' said Byung Joo-min, who had accompanied
her cousin Ha Min on the trip.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: CASE ILLUSTRATES ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY'S
COPYRIGHT POWER

  (ms) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, after 62 days in operation, the Canadian Internet
company iCraveTV.com was shut down by a lawsuit filed by the Motion
Picture Association of America. Its business, apparently legal in
Canada, is to redistribute live broadcast television programming on
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association sued iCraveTV in federal court
because it is illegal in the United States to redistribute
television without first obtaining permission from the programs'
owners. And it claimed that viewers in the United States could
circumvent iCraveTV's simple barriers to non-Canadians, such as
entering an area code. If the company had not stopped operations
immediately, says its president and co-founder, William Craig, it
could have been liable for ``hundreds of millions of dollars in
damages.''
</P>
<P>
   The most chilling aspect of the case, and there are many, was
Craig's response. That is, he did not argue the legality of the
action against him, but instead responded by inventing a technology
that could stop the discussion dead in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that the Internet's ``haphazard'' design makes it
impossible to determine precisely where a user's computer is
located, and thus the copyright laws that he or she is subject to.
If he wanted to keep his business, he says, ``we had to find
another barrier to determine that someone is indeed in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   So his company promptly developed a technological protection
mechanism _ he says patents are already being filed _ that will
pinpoint where users of iCraveTV are located geographically, thus
barring anyone under the jurisdiction of United States-style
copyright restrictions from viewing protected programming outside
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although he would not provide specifics about the new system,
Craig said he was convinced that this ``enhanced geographic
screening technology'' would soon be required to make the Internet
attractive enough for rights holders to put their content on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, the Internet has to evolve and adapt,'' Craig
says. To effect that evolution, he says, ``what we're trying to do
is create `country-area networks' where you can have a computer
just serve a certain territory.'' This, he says, would enable
conventional content providers to ``control their rights within
that territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are likely to object strongly to Craig's balkanized
Internet. Privacy and free speech issues aside, they might say _
for good reason _ that such a system would devolve the Internet
into a model very much like the restricted, centralized control of
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   That is a business model with which the $65 billion media and
entertainment industries _ the very ones that nearly sued the pants
off Craig _ are quite familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every context that it can, the entertainment industry is
trying to force the Internet into its own business model _ the
perfect control of content,'' wrote the constitutional scholar
Lawrence Lessig, whose column about the iCraveTV case recently
appeared in The Industry Standard, the Internet-focused business
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The industry obviously has the influence to do so. ``I think we
want to nail them to the wall now,'' said Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Association, at the time the iCraveTV suit
was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, iCraveTV pulled the programming from
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   What is most alarming, however, is that the content industries
seem to have successfully secured the legal means by which they
will be able to enforce this perfect control.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which was heavily
promoted by the entertainment industries, contains a provision
called ``anti-circumvention.''
</P>
<P>
   It imposes ``a new kind of liability even in situations of fair
use'' of copyright-protected information, says Peter Jaszi, a law
professor at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In copyright terms, ``fair use'' describes the conditions under
which someone can legally use or excerpt a copyrighted work. But
under the anti-circumvention provision, it is illegal to crack a
copy protection technology for any reason. And anyone who makes,
sells or uses a device _ including a computer _ that is capable of
circumvention is engaging in a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   It was the anti-circumvention law, for example, that allowed a
DVD industry group to call for the arrest of a 16-year-old
Norwegian boy who had deconstructed and published the protection
code for a DVD movie, even though his intent was not to make
illegal copies. He cracked the code because he wanted to watch the
movie, which he legally owned, on his Linux computer, but no DVD
decoding software existed for the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   What is worrisome about the DVD story is that in one fell swoop,
the content industries completely eliminated fair use _ any
situation in which the making of a copy might be considered legal _
from the discussion. If they use technology to lock up their
content, the mere unlocking of it is an actionable offense. End of
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a copyright case, the Linux people might be able
to demonstrate the social utility was high and the commercial harm
was low,'' Jaszi says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is so clearly weighted toward proprietary
interests, people who want to argue they're making responsible
unauthorized use of copyrighted materials have no place to stand,''
Jaszi says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if Craig's protection technology makes it to market,
anyone who attempts to circumvent his system _ even, for example,
for a broadcast that would be perfectly legal to watch free on a
television _ could also be subject to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, innovation has been linked conclusively with
the free exchange of information and ideas _ by means of the public
library system, in the previous millennium, and certainly via the
Internet today. If everyone hermetically seals their content with
technology, Jaszi says, ``we could well end up with a world where
we have very strong protection for a rather limited range of
ultimately not very interesting content.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig wrote: ``We could build a network to give content
providers perfect control. We could design a network that would be
the envy of the Soviets, encoding content control far more
effectively than any possible law. But that is not our tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Copyright law was never meant to grant owners perfect control,
and such control is certainly anathema to the free-flowing Internet
and the entrepreneurs who are enthusiastically making it work to
their advantage. The content industry's traditional method of
dealing with these challenges _ trying to extinguish or suppress
new technologies _ did not work with the introduction of video and
audio cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   And Jaszi says it never will. ``There's a tremendous opportunity
to cooperate with, and not resist, this technology,'' he says.
``What people want is choice, the ability to control the experience
of cultural consumption. You can't force them back into the box
that they have now escaped.''  &QL;

`WASTE': FORBIDDEN MATTERS THEN AND THORNY MATTERS NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review.)

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the middle of the first act of ``Waste,'' the
nearly century-old drama by Harley Granville Barker at the American
Place Theater, a vivid and effective discord begins to take hold. A
play that opens as a mannered, drawing-room period piece _ the
hostess of a weekend gathering is at the piano playing Chopin for
her guests _ turns suddenly, with narrative grace but rather
shocking frankness, into a complicated and unnervingly contemporary
morality tale. When one guest, a rising politician, seduces a
self-dramatizing young woman who happens to be married, if
willfully separated from her husband, the events that unspool give
the credibility of the national government a threatening shake.
</P>
<P>
   The play, written in 1906, was banned by the lord chamberlain,
Britain's official censor, before it could be performed; revised by
the author 20 years later, it was not given a full production until
1936, and it has been rarely seen since then. It is almost too easy
to say that it is a work that has been waiting for its time, and
one of the pleasures of this ambitious and satisfying production by
Theater for a New Audience, under the wise direction of Bartlett
Sher, is that it never makes too much of the obvious. With elegant
period costuming by Martin Pakledinaz and a design by John Arnone
that features three elaborately windowed walls on rollers, braving
unwieldiness to suggest the lingering weight of Victorianism, the
staging is firmly rooted in the time.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, who was just 29 when he wrote ``Waste,'' was interested
in exposing the hypocrisies of that tradition, the secrets of the
powerful that were privately held behind such windows. But he was
gifted enough not to oversimplify. If the play is something of a
position paper, it also looks with sympathy and exasperation at
behavior informed by human foible that is shaded by issues of
politics, religion and class.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Trebell, the urgently idealistic and personally caddish
politician at the center of the story (played by Byron Jennings),
is the leading advocate of legislation to disestablish the church
and reallocate the state's money to the creation of new schools.
(In 1907 such a plan passed the House of Commons only to be
squashed by the House of Lords; the play was of its time as well as
ours.)
</P>
<P>
   A liberal bill with popular appeal and thus on the verge of
being embraced by the conservative prime minister and his cabinet,
it unleashes all manner of debate on issues like freedom of
religion, English-Irish rancor and progressive education, not to
mention, when Trebell's indiscretion becomes consequential, women's
rights. Without giving too much away (it happens before
intermission), today's pro-choice abortion stance couldn't be more
directly and succinctly expressed than it is here. The play regards
these things from the left, to be sure, but the point is less
ideological than humane; the anguishing ripples of the illicit
affair, with their steady, upward movement through the echelons of
power, and its tragic personal consequences, constitute the titular
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Barker's play is well constructed along formulaic lines; its
four acts take the form of introduction, conflict, confrontation
and climax, and denouement. And with the exception of Trebell and
the wronged woman, Amy O'Connell (Kristin Flanders), his characters
are not quite rounded; they're carefully delineated by social
standing and political stripe. But they are written with
Shavian-tinted panache and the verve of a shrewdly observant young
man.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a great play; it does lapse into didacticism from
time to time. And wrapping up all its loose ends and making sure
each character gets his just desert, it proceeds to a conclusion
with meandering sentimentality. (There is one particularly
egregious scene between Trebell and his devoted spinster sister.)
But until then the speechifying is passionate, the gossip witty,
the private conversation conducted with conspiratorial eloquence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The salvation of this country so far has been its
imperviousness to abstract ideas,'' says the play's most
reactionary character, a blowhard member of Parliament named, with
Dickensian cheek, Blackborough. ``The difficulty of doing anything
definite by party politics, strange as it sounds, is what keeps us
sane and lets us get on with our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackborough, a relatively small but crucial role, is played by
Jordan Charney with the wheezy presumption of an aristocrat, a
performance that, like all of them here, tiptoes right up to the
line of caricature and stops just short of it.
</P>
<P>
   All of the actors, one can only assume encouraged by Sher, bring
to their parts a wink of hyperbole, a nod to the play's century-old
Britishness, and it is this ensemble attitude that lends this
production the subtle archness that makes the bridge between then
and now, here and there. Among other things, they all seem to be
having great fun.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly delicious are Pamela Nyberg, as a delicately
snobbish political wife, and Richard Easton as Lord Charles
Cantilupe, the Anglican Church's wryly progressive cabinet
minister, who is torn by admiration for Trebell and repugnance over
his transgression.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Malcolm does an effectively stern turn as a stiff-spined
Irishman whose quiet rage at both his wayward wife and the
politicians who would publicly stifle him seems to be what keeps
his posture so erect; and as Sir Gilbert Wedgecroft, trusted
physician to the wealthy and powerful, Henry Stram manages to
suggest the kind of loyalty to his clientele that is both
submissive and Hippocratically sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Flanders has the play's most difficult role. Amy, as an orphan
and a woman on her own, has reason to feel insecure in the
established company she is keeping, and she is aware she is being
condescended to.
</P>
<P>
   She is Barker's most fully drawn character here, and that is
perhaps conscious; that she is so easily looked down upon and
discarded makes a point about the collective presumption of
privilege. And it would be a hackneyed, sympathetic part if Amy
didn't wear her insecurity so unflatteringly, with a poor-me flair
for grandiose self-deprecation.
</P>
<P>
   Flanders attacks the part busily; there seems to be a separate
idea behind every gesture, a contrived quirk to each line reading.
You can see the seams, but it is hard to discern whether the
actress or the character is chewing the scenery. In any case, why a
man such as Trebell would find Amy both available for conquest and
irritating to have around afterward is amply evident.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, coiffed and tailored as playboy patrician, plays
Trebell with an energetically presumed charisma that is as hard to
trust as it is to resist. It's a strong performance, eerie for its
modern resonance; only in Trebell's demise does Jennings seek for
audience sympathy. Until then, he expects it.
</P>
<P>
   At a climactic moment he declares a willingness to confess
publicly to his misdeed. But you can easily imagine him changing
his mind and uttering something like this: ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.''

 &UR; By Colin Harrison (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about thrillers is that so many of them are bad.
Abysmal, even. It's a genre so plagued by hack writers and
bush-league prose that when you find one like this, you want to
call it by another name. But a thriller it is _ the long, patient
kind, with underplayed dialogue and characters who sidestep
stereotype every time it shows up to claim them. The protagonist is
Charlie Ravich, a former Vietnam fighter pilot and POW now in his
late 50s who faces crisis in his private life and in his
multimillion-dollar corporate affairs. Harrison spends much of his
book establishing a thin connection between Charlie and a young
woman named Christina Welles, who has just been released from
prison and who, with her former boyfriend, is suspected of stealing
from a mobster who really, REALLY, wants his money back. There's
sex. There's violence (we don't want to spoil your fun if you have
a taste for it, but for the sake of the squeamish, we'll mention a
little torture scene involving an electric drill and a circular saw
_ and that's not the last of it). If you can take the gore, this
book is enough to give a weak genre a good name. &QL;

~i? aMA SOUTHWEST'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John A. Murray (Northland, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo on the cover is of John Ford making a scene from ``The
Searchers'' in 1956, but that's just the predictable side of
filmmaking in the American Southwest. Think of the alternatives. In
1965, Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, delivered the Sermon on the Mount on
Utah's Green River Overlook in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.''
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda camped in Anasazi ruins on their way
east in ``Easy Rider.'' Robert Duvall turned his life around on the
Texas prairie in ``Tender Mercies,'' and in ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway robbed an actual bank in the rural
community of Pilot Point, Texas _ the same bank that the real
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow had robbed about 40 years earlier.
In this book, due out at the end of the month, Murray looks at the
Southwest and its starring role in so many American films. Included
are some great photographs _ our favorite, we confess, is of John
Wayne (in ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'') looking grandly out at that
mist-shrouded Big Daddy of film locations, Monument Valley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Weil (Knopf, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a chapter here in which Weil sets out to devise what he
calls ``the worst diet in the world,'' which after a few paragraphs
sounded so suspiciously like our own bill of fare that we began to
wonder whether Weil had us under surveillance. It was humbling, but
more fun to read than, say, the section called ``A Healing Story:
From French Fries to Kale,'' or ``The Macronutrients: An
Overview.'' But we are not hopeless, no siree. We love broccoli. We
love salmon. Unfortunately, we have learned from Weil that not all
salmon are equal, that we need to worry not only about our own
diets but about the diets of the fish we eat, which is one step
further down the food chain than we care to go. Eggs are another
research project. ``Eggs of chickens,'' Weil writes, ``(are) good
sources of omega-3 fatty acids if they come from free-range
chickens or chickens whose diets are supplemented with omega-3-rich
algae.'' Are we up to this task? No, but we know that Weil has made
many converts-to-wellness, so rush to the store: His new book is
out, with the author looking hale and hearty on the cover.

   &UR; ``TIGERS IN THE SNOW''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Matthiessen (North Point, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know that the tiger is beautiful, but we also have
been raised with an unshakable idea of its fierceness, the
fearsome, predatory aggression of Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's
``The Jungle Book.'' But Matthiessen points out that the hunter,
Jim Corbett, in his book ``The Man-eaters of Kumaon,'' refers to
the tiger as ``a large-hearted gentleman of bottomless courage.''
That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In their early incarnations, Internet retailers were chided for
spending more time creating pretty and entertaining sites than
actually delivering quality products, on time, to the right place.
Duly chastened, they spent 1999 building stronger fulfillment and
customer service systems.
</P>
<P>
   Now that those systems are mainly in place, many Web merchants
are devoting an increasing amount of time and money to implementing
audio and video features _ hoping to provide so entertaining an
experience that users will stay glued to the computer, credit cards
at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are taking advantage of faster connection speeds
and better technologies from audio and video providers to feed
users a multimedia experience that would have choked their
computers as recently as a year ago. But while technology is making
it easier for sites to create that experience, retailers are still
grappling with hard questions about how much media to mix with
their commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very fine line between offering an entertaining
interactive experience and alienating people who aren't as tech
savvy or who may not have the connection speed to make it work
well,'' said Ian Yolles, vice president of Nike.com. ``It's a very
delicate balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's audio and video efforts have been steadily building since
the site's official rollout last summer. Now Nike.com includes
several multimedia programs, the most notable example being the
company's ``Cliffhanger'' promotion that worked in conjunction with
Nike television ads. The ads showed famous athletes involved in
chase scenes, and directed viewers to a Nike Web site to see
various endings of the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Yolles said the campaign was somewhat risky because it required
``a certain amount of technical sophistication'' on the part of the
users, including the most up-to-date software for viewing Internet
multimedia presentations. ``And the higher the bandwidth, the
better the performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're interested in the younger consumer,'' Yolles said,
noting that those types of consumers are more apt to have both
high-speed connections _ as do most college students _ and the
newest software. ``So we really hit that sweet spot.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of that and other multimedia presentations,
Yolles said Nike's traffic to the site increased 50 percent in
January over the previous month, ``and we expect the same in
February.'' Yolles declined to cite sales figures, but said that
``the risk really paid off for us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Elaine Rubin, an e-commerce consultant and
chairwoman of Shop-.org, an industry trade group, ``users are going
to see a lot more of this type of thing in the future,'' as Web
sites try to emulate the store environments made popular by Barnes
&AMP; Noble and NoodleKidoodle, a toy store ``where you take the kids
when there's nothing to do, and oh, by the way, buy four or five
things while you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that on the simplest level, e-commerce sites were
starting to include background music, just as stores do. Barnes &AMP;
Noble's online store (www.bn.com), for instance, recently rolled
out its ``BN Radio'' feature, enabling users to listen to a
selection of background music while browsing. Notably, the feature
allows users to continue listening as they surf other sites, since
the audio technology, made by RealNetworks, streams music in the
background of the Web browser's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also see extending this to other areas,'' said Daniel
Blackman, vice president of music, video and software for
barnesandnoble.com. ``People could listen to a tax expert give
advice while they are looking at tax software.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a ``buy'' button displays the artist or speaker featured
in the audio, Blackman said, ``It not only extends our brand, but
it's a fantastic way to capitalize on the impulse buy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such virtues aside, Rubin said e-commerce sites must approach
multimedia with caution. ``Sites that are doing this have been
careful, as they ought to be, to put audio and video in parts of
their site where users can choose to use it or avoid it if they
just want to shop,'' Rubin said. ``Otherwise you'll lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   One site giving users that choice is Victoria's Secret
(www.victoriassecret.com), which analysts say is at least partly
responsible for the growing interest in multimedia entertainment in
e-commerce. The company's online fashion show in February 1999
attracted such a swarm of visitors that some users were not able to
access the site at the time. And even though viewers were not given
the chance to purchase lingerie directly from the fashion show,
traffic to the site remained high for weeks following the Webcast,
as did sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Weil, vice president of new media for Victoria's Secret,
said the company would hold another online fashion show in May, and
planned to let visitors purchase the clothing being modeled as the
show proceeded. Meanwhile, he said, the site's Glam Lounge
currently offers visitors a selection of multimedia presentations
that changes regularly; this month's feature is a behind-the-scenes
video of models during a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Other e-commerce executives note the power of multimedia. Matt
Hyde, vice president of online sales for Recreational Equipment
Inc. (www.rei.com), acknowledged that in recent multimedia tests
``most people, when given the option, chose to look at
nonmultimedia.'' And yet, those who did choose to view video
product presentations bought ``significantly more'' than those who
did not view the video, he said. ``So we're still figuring out how
to do it so there's a real benefit to the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   As are many others. Companies like AudioBase, RealNetworks and
Yahoo Broadcast (formerly Broadcast.com), all of which provide
Internet multimedia services, have seen a recent surge in interest
from e-commerce companies. AudioBase, which sells audio services to
sites including those of Nickelodeon and Starwood Hotels and
Resorts Worldwide Inc., charges between $750 and $27,500 a month,
depending on the total number of hours of music use.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks, which provides multimedia services for sites like
Gap's and Holland America Line's, charges $3,000 a month to start,
with rates increasing ``drastically from there, with more
customization,'' according to a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Broadcast, which conducted the Victoria's Secret fashion
show, as well as a Webcast of a Cranberries concert on the Ford
Motor Co.'s site, charges between $7,500 and $100,000, depending on
the extent of production assistance required.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers with their roots in merchandising, not media,
expenditures like that may be difficult to swallow. But according
to at least one e-commerce executive, retailers should prepare
themselves for a new online environment. Chris Edgar, chief
operating officer of Delia's Inc. (www.delias.com), a retail and
catalog company geared toward girls and young women, is trying to
gauge the extent to which his company's Web site will include
multimedia entertainment in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle cry of making shopping fun again requires retailers
to do it,'' Edgar said. ``And we recognize we have to run our
merchandizing business like a media business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``you have to be careful _ not to tell consumers the
reason they should buy something is that they can see someone
famous on the site,'' he said. ``Successful marketing of a product
still ultimately relies on the quality of the product.''

That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

<P>
   If John Mark Byers were a rich man, you might think he had
bought his way out of trouble. But Byers, as he would be the first
to tell you, is just plain folks. An apparently uneducated,
overalls-wearing Arkansan who once owned a small jewelry store, he
is the reason HBO's documentary ``Paradise Lost 2: Revelations'' is
so horrifying and fascinating. It is also as disturbing as a film
can be.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the original HBO film ``Paradise Lost: The Child
Murders at Robin Hood Hills,'' three teen-agers were in prison,
convicted of the 1993 murder of three 8-year-old boys. One of the
teen-agers, a 19-year-old, was on death row. But everything in the
film had begun to point toward Byers, the stepfather of one of the
murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1994. Many viewers, learning that a sequel has been
made, may expect it to be the story of how the young men were
exonerated and the real murderer or murderers arrested. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, ``Revelations'' looks as if it will follow the
pattern of another real-life case, that of Hurricane Carter as seen
in the film ``The Hurricane.'' A group of young people became
convinced of Carter's innocence and devoted themselves to winning
him a new trial and getting him out of prison. Happily, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the three young men convicted in Arkansas _
Damien Echols (then 19, now 24), Jason Baldwin (now 21) and Jessie
Misskelley Jr. (23) _ a similar support group springs up. But when
these advocates come to Jonesboro, Ark., bearing ``Free the West
Memphis Three'' T-shirts, they appear to be greeted with the same
reaction that met early civil rights workers arriving in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some are from faraway states like Ohio, New Jersey
and California is not in their favor. There may be a knee-jerk
reaction to the term ``West Memphis Three,'' reminiscent of the
1960s radical left.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps local residents suspect the group of being a cult. As
a teen-ager Echols believed in Wicca, a religion that worships
nature and advocates a kind of benevolent witchcraft. The
prosecutors decided that the murders (in which one of the victims
was sexually mutilated) had been ritualistic, committed by devil
worshippers; they equated Wicca, and the fact that Echols was a fan
of the rock group Metallica, with Satanism.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed for the sequel, the chief investigator for the
original trial says he is sure the young men in prison are the
murderers. For one thing, Misskelley confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Even local television personalities seem convinced of the young
men's guilt. When Burk Sauls, a leader of the support group, says
on the air that Misskelley's confession was coerced, a man at the
KAIT anchor desk says skeptically, ``What was coercive about it?''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Sauls, who often seems to be smirking,
answers with a reference to ``a time-line problem'' instead of
reiterating that Misskelley was questioned for hours. And when
Misskelley did finally agree with the police officers who were
saying he did it, he told them that the murders were committed at
noon (when the victims were still at school). Misskelley has an IQ
of 72.
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing part of the sequel concerns bite-mark evidence.
When the defense, with the support group's help, brings in a
criminal profiler, he looks at photographs of the crime and sees
bite marks that were either overlooked or ignored during the first
trial. The three men in prison give bite impressions for analysis;
none match.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution and the defense bring in dueling odontologists.
One says yes, these are bite marks; the other says they are not.
The judge decides the prosecution odontologist is telling the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   As for Byers, he now has false teeth. But, he says, he has had
them since before the murders. Then he says his teeth were knocked
out in a fight. Then he says he lost his teeth because of
periodontal disease. According to the film, dental records show
that an oral surgeon removed Byers' teeth in April 1997, almost
four years after the murders.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the film, Byers takes a polygraph test with
questions about the murders. The man who conducts the test tells
him that he appears to be telling the truth about these matters
``as far as you see them.'' (Byers turns to the camera and declares
himself vindicated, those last six words apparently not having
registered with him.) It is established that Byers has a brain
tumor and is taking several medications.
</P>
<P>
   More than once Byers kneels beside a grave and speaks to the
deceased. In the first film it was his son's grave. In
``Revelations'' it is that of his wife, Melissa, who died in 1996
of an undetermined cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know your heart was broken,'' he says as the camera rolls.
``I know you couldn't stand the death of your child. But oh God, I
wish you hadn't left me.'' The impression is of a very bad actor
imitating grief. If Byers is indeed innocent, he is doing himself
no favors with these performances.
</P>
<P>
   Byers was arrested last June for selling prescription drugs to
an undercover narcotics agent. Sentenced to eight years, he could
be paroled in October. Meanwhile Damien Echols is still on death
row. He could be executed by lethal injection as early as May.
Hearings for his last possible appeal on the state level end on
Sunday.

</P>
<P>
   Aetna also said it would sell some of its overseas health-care

   THE FRAGILITY OF RUSSIAN JOURNALISM
</P>
<P>
   Two news reports out of Moscow last week served as reminders of
the rise of Russian journalism before the collapse of communism,
and its paradoxical retreat these days. During a funeral for Artyom
Borovik, who died in a plane crash, officials praised his reporting
on the campaign in Afghanistan. Then came a report that criminal
charges had been filed against Andrei Babitsky, a Radio Liberty
reporter, for aiding the enemy while covering the war in Chechnya.
While officials denied the report, Babitsky is still seen as a
government target. The adulation of Borovik and the demonization of
Babitsky both reflect journalism's fragility in Russia.

   A TEST RUN FOR AOL-TIME WARNER
</P>
<P>
   America Online has been working with the staff of Real Simple, a

synergy between America Online and Time Warner, which announced
their plans to merge in January.

   MORE GROWING PAINS FOR ICANN
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months of setbacks and frustration exploded into a
tense, sometimes hostile showdown between the appointees who have
been trying to invent a democratic charter for the Internet's first
administrative body _ the founding board of Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers _ and the people they were supposed to
be representing. The board bowed to the pressure, agreeing at the
end of a four-day meeting to slow the election process for a
successor board and study ways to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   A COPYRIGHT THREAT TO THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   The case of a Canadian company that redistributes TV programming
on its Web site illustrates how U.S. media and entertainment
industries, using copyright law, could turn the Internet into a
model like the centralized control of cable television. The Motion
Picture Association of America sued the company, iCraveTV.com,
contending that viewers in the United States could circumvent the
company's barriers to non-Canadians. The company responded by
inventing technology that could create a ``country-area network.''
</P>
<P>
   RETAILERS FOCUS ON SITE DESIGN AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   After being criticized for spending more time creating
entertaining sites than delivering high-quality products, on time,
to the right place, Internet retailers spent 1999 building stronger
fulfillment and customer-service systems. Now that those systems
are mainly in place, many Web merchants are devoting an increasing
amount of time and money to implementing audio and video features.

OUTSIDE INVESTORS TO HELP FINANCE PURCHASE OF DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The YankeeNets will use outside investors to help finance the
$175 million acquisition of the New Jersey Devils, which has been
pending since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the transaction comes to fruition, 12 investors will put up
the majority of the purchase price for John McMullen's Devils. But
the YankeeNets would retain control of the team, a person involved
with the sale said.
</P>
<P>
   The YankeeNets raised $200 million last week by selling
seven-year junk bonds to institutional investors, but the proceeds
back the Nets owners' investment in the YankeeNets, pay off the
first six payments on the bonds and provide working capital. The
initial intention of selling $250 million in the high-interest
bonds was scaled back in the face of investor reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the higher figure, the offering was never intended to
help finance acquisitions. Another $75 million to be raised by
selling an 8.6 percent stake in YankeeNets to private investors is
also not designated for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the YankeeNets will not pay a $15 million bonus to
McMullen if the Devils win the Stanley Cup, contrary to published
reports, the person said. McMullen intends to use $15 million from
the sale of the team to pay bonuses to his employees.
</P>
<P>
   One employee who will benefit most from the sale is Lou
Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager, who owns 20
percent of the team, which would be worth $35 million. His
post-sale future with the Devils has not been determined, although
YankeeNets officials are impressed with his record.
</P>
<P>
   A binding agreement to buy the Devils, which has been slow to
complete, is expected soon, but it is not likely to be announced
until after the National Hockey League playoffs.

IDEAS INTO PRODUCTS, WITH THE WEB; WORKS IN PROGRESS BY YOUNG
INVENTORS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's say you own a widget company whose research and
development team has invented a machine grease that was a failure
on the factory floor but unexpectedly turns out to be a superior
formula for furniture polish.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, you might have made some informal phone calls
to your network of business associates, discreetly trying to
license the idea to a more appropriate company. Now, however, you
have the option of posting the invention on one of a growing number
of online intellectual property trading sites that promise to make
such technological matchmaking swifter, easier and more precise.
</P>
<P>
   The newest of these sites, run by a privately held company in
Cambridge, Mass., contends that it offers a fundamentally different
approach to the swapping and selling of intellectual property
online. The company, yet2.com (www.yet2.com _ and, yes, that is
pronounced ``yet to come''), says it offers a place to trade not
just patents but also trade secrets, unpatented inventions and
simple technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old model was that nobody shared anything with anybody,''
said Ben du Pont, the president of yet2.com and an
eighth-generation descendant of E.I. du Pont, the founder of the
DuPont Co. ``The new model is that anybody can register for free
with yet2.com to hear about new technologies and to hear about them
right away. It's a fundamental shift.'' Du Pont said he got the
idea for the site when he was an employee at DuPont and grew
frustrated in trying to license a promising new polymer.
</P>
<P>
   Chris De Bleser, the chief executive of yet2.com, said the
site's approach was influenced by the practices of patent lawyers,
who typically pride themselves on being able to disclose enough
information about a new technology to get a patent, but not so much
that a competitor can build a workable prototype by simply reading
the patent.
</P>
<P>
   A certain patent might disclose the formula for a new polymer,
for example. But what the patent will not say, De Bleser said, ``is
that in order to get the goo to come out of the vat, you need to
kick it a couple of times and twist the nozzle to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to patents, the site will trade in technology
packages that might include engineering expertise or advice on
regulatory compliance. Du Pont says companies and inventors can
also use yet2.com to sell inventions long before they receive
patents. ``Because we're not only about patents, it's possible to
post very recently discovered technologies,'' he said. ``DuPont
will be posting over 100 recently discovered technologies, all of
which are patent-pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would companies post their unprotected technology on a Web
site where any corporate spy could take a peek? What you see on the
site are simply marketing documents that contain no real
proprietary information and that do not identify the company that
owns the technology.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more information, you have to pony up $1,000 for an
initial one-on-one meeting. If a deal is struck, yet2.com gets a 10
percent cut, capped at the first $50,000 of the deal. ``We want
these people to post their billion-dollar technologies,'' du Pont
said.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont co. has a minority stake in the site, which thus far has
more than $20 million in financing that also comes from Venrock
Associates, 3i Group, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and Honeywell
International. On Monday, the company is announcing a roster of 25
new recruits to the site, among them Arthur D. Little and British
Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical companies are heavily represented on the site, but
Boeing, TRW, Porsche, Ford Motor and others also hawk their
research and development on yet2.com. Collectively, yet2.com
contends, the companies on its site account for nearly 10 percent
of global spending on research and development.
</P>
<P>
   But the company expects to draw postings from small companies
and individual inventors as well. ``The most brilliant ideas,'' De
Bleser acknowledged, ``can come from the smallest research
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Works in Progress By Young Inventors
</P>
<P>
   College-age inventors descended upon Washington last week for a
convention sponsored by the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center and the
National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance. A dozen
teams displayed their works in progress. Among the inventions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bubble-imaging technology from the California Institute of
Technology that gives a lava-lamp quality to digital displays.
</P>
<P>
   _ A crescent-shaped pillow from Hampshire College that provides
needed arm support for women who have just had breast surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ A battery-powered cart from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology that will lower an aging gardener into a kneeling
position, then lift him back up again.
</P>
<P>
   _ A special swing from the University of Colorado at Boulder
that enables a person who is unable to pump her legs to swing
without assistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ A permeometer _ a device that measures how quickly a fluid
flows through a material _ from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
It enables the paper-making and fabric industries to measure
permeability 10 times more accurately than is now possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ A combination toilet seat and bathroom scale from the
University of Nevada at Reno. ``It was sort of a practical joke to
start with,'' explained Phil Weilerstein, program manager at the
collegiate inventors alliance. ``But then it became more serious
when the students realized it could be used in hospitals to monitor
the weight of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   NOMINEES SOUGHT FOR INVENTOR OF YEAR
</P>
<P>
   The nomination deadline for the 27th annual Inventor of the Year
Award, sponsored by the Intellectual Property Owners Association,
is April 12. A nominating form can be downloaded from the Web site
www.ipo.org. The award will be presented on June 28 on Capitol
Hill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be

MENDOZA TRADE AND A POOR YARNALL OUTING CONCERN YANKEES

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ The Yankees' winter theory was that they could
afford to trade Ramiro Mendoza because they have enough pitching
talent to replace him. The rookie Ed Yarnall would become the No. 5
starter and someone else would fill Mendoza's role in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But after a month of spring training, the Yankees have
ascertained they that they do not have as much depth as they first
thought. No candidate to replace Mendoza in relief has developed,
and Yarnall stunk in his first outing of spring Sunday, as he
acknowledged with more colorful words, allowing 10 runs in one
inning, including three home runs. Toronto crushed the Yankees,
14-3.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall's one horrible inning _ his first after missing two
weeks with back trouble _ will not alter his status as the probable
No. 5 starter, but the Yankees are keenly aware of their fragile
nature of their pitching staff. Allen Watson, one of the Yankees'
two left-handed relievers, has soreness in his throwing shoulder
and his condition will be monitored in the days to come. Scouts
watching Watson's last outing felt he was laboring, as if he could
not throw freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not concerned yet,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager. ``I think it's just something that pitchers get, a cranky
shoulder. If it goes a few more days and it's not getting better,
then maybe it'll be time to be concerned. I have a feeling he's
pitched with this maybe a time or two.''
</P>
<P>
   One person in the organization said that in the course of his
treatment Sunday, Watson may have been sent for magnetic resonance
imaging; Torre said he did not know if this was the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall said his back felt fine Sunday, and as he warmed up, the
pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre thought his stuff was good, his
fastball alive. Yarnall had good movement on his fastball against
the first few hitters he faced, and the Blue Jays had two outs and
two on and no runs. Yarnall appeared to be in command, even
dropping a changeup over the plate for a strike with a two-ball,
no-strike count.
</P>
<P>
   But Yarnall fell behind in the count to David Segui, fired a
fastball inside, and Segui blistered it. There was another hit and
then another home run, by Tony Batista, and after the Blue Jays
scored another run and loaded the bases, Raul Mondesi blasted a
grand slam. Yarnall threw 52 pitches, reaching his limit in only
one inning. All in all, the left-hander decided as he mused over
his outing in the dugout, it was the worst outing of his career, at
any level.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall seemed to be able to keep the outing in perspective; he
realizes that Torre and Stottlemyre will continue to count on him
as their No. 5 starter. ``It's just one outing,'' Yarnall said.
``Just one inning. I just can't be making a habit out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said, ``He got here and he's trying to impress, and that's
understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have all but resolved to keep Mendoza, at least for
now, because he provides depth in the rotation and the bullpen at a
time when the organization possesses very little quality, major
league-ready pitching depth. They were reluctant to trade him to
the Oakland Athletics for minor league prospects. They have
declined to swap him in a deal for Anaheim's Jim Edmonds, although
the Angels and Yankees continue to talk; the Yankees want to work
out a trade that does not include Mendoza or Alfonso Soriano, their
top infield prospect, while Anaheim wants players ready to
contribute in the majors right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not want Mendoza to be included in discussions
for Jeromy Burnitz, the All-Star right fielder for the Milwaukee
Brewers. The Yankees offered Soriano as part of a package for
Burnitz, but when the Brewers asked for an outfielder and a pitcher
_ Milwaukee wanted Mendoza _ the talks ended.
</P>
<P>
   Torre spoke obliquely about possible deals today. He did not
specifically mention the discussions regarding Edmonds, but what
Torre told reporters Sunday underscored what others in the
organization are saying: that he and the major league staff, as
well as front-office members in New York, are strongly opposed to
unloading assets like Mendoza and Soriano for someone who could
augment the offense marginally.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, pitching is what our strength has been,'' Torre said.
``Can we become a better offensive team? Possibly. But at the
expense of your strengths? Then you have to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have a ``gaping hole,'' Torre said, ``I'm a little
reluctant to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the Yankees have a gaping hole on their roster? ``No,'' Torre
replied firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Torre undoubtedly remembers that in the first half of last
season, the Yankees' left fielders had the worst production of any
position on any team in the majors, and the Yankees still won 98
games and the World Series, after Ricky Ledee played better in the
second half. The question remains whether the Yankees' front office
_ George Steinbrenner, the principal owner _ will be willing to
give Ledee more time to find himself.

   CHINA-WINE (Shanghai) _ Red wine is the drink of the moment in
China, and winemakers around the world are feeling the effects.
Demand for wine picked up after the government began promoting
fruit-based alcohol a few years ago, and Western winemakers rushed
in, shipping wine in giant 22,000 liter containers. But now the
Chinese want domestic wine, so much of the Western supply is being
sold at happy-hour prices by Customs after sitting for months in
government warehouses. This isn't doing much for the wine
exporters, and it isn't exactly helping the Chinese develop a taste
for the grape. It's common for Chinese wine drinkers to mix red
wine with Sprite and white with Coke and to drink the concoctions
in gulps. By Craig S. Smith.

`BRATISLAVA DANCE THEATER': FROM SLOVAKIA, A MEDLEY OF SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The year is young, but it is unlikely that New York
will see many companies as charming and savvy as the Bratislava
Dance Theater, which made its U.S.debut on Friday night at Kaye
Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Bratislava Dance Theater was founded in 1997 by Robert
Mesko, a Slovak-American dance impresario. It is the first
modern-dance troupe in Slovakia to be built on corporate rather
than state support, the main sponsors being two mobile-phone
businesses, EuroTel Bratislava and Ericsson Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe's artistic director, Nora Gallovicova, was a
principal dancer with the Slovak National Theater. In addition to
their folkloric dance training, her wonderfully loose-bodied,
unassuming dancers were schooled in academies supported by the
thriving modern-dance culture of Bratislava. The company's
repertory includes works by Slovak choreographers Jan Durovcik and
Peter Mika, Czech choreographer Jan Kodet, and two Americans,
Daniel Ezralow and Bill Young.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's program opened and closed with bookend dances by
Ezralow that teased one's expectation of an evening of Slavic folk
dance. ``Lady Lost Found,'' set to a gentlemanly score by Percy
Grainger, is a sweet-tempered idyll for loving lads and lasses
dressed in soft, creamy white and a kilt-wearing soloist, Zdeno
Galaba, who tosses off multiple pirouettes as nonchalantly as a
shepherd batting a fly.
</P>
<P>
   Did the world of ``Lady Lost Found'' ever exist? Ezralow and the
dancers manage subtly to suggest both the dream and its
unlikelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Ezralow's closing ``Familia Kalashnikov'' is a wild romp whose
cheerfully battling, lumbering, line-dancing antics match the
nuttiness of Goran Bregovic's folk-tinged score in a kaleidoscopic,
fractured charge through hallmark steps and formations of
Mediterranean folk dancing. Only modern dancers could perform it,
however, and these dancers (Zuzana Herenyiova, Jan Mrnak, Jan
Sevcik, Radovan Vagac and Lenka Vagnerova) sailed through ``Familia
Kalashnikov'' with delicious comic timing.
</P>
<P>
   Young deftly evokes the spirit of popular music texts in ``Bound
To,'' choreographed with Colleen Thomas, set to music by Cole
Porter, and ``Two a T,'' performed to songs sung on tape by Ray
Charles and Betty Carter. Young pours his dancers out onto the
stage in ``Bound To'' and sets them to milling, jabbering,
leapfrogging and even sleeping, interspersed with passages of plain
movement identifiable as jazz and modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   In one highlight, set to ``You Do Something to Me,'' stretchy
red bands link one dancer to another in couples who are then forced
into sleek partnering upheavals and reversals and loving encounters
that are both serene and feisty.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kolar and Katerina Vlnieskova are the lovers of ``Two a
T,'' one moment sparring wittily and the next interacting in ways
that capture the subtle vagaries of romantic love with unexpected
depth. Young's movement vocabulary is full and rich. All in all the
program suggested that these performers _ who also included
Marianna Paulikova, Vlastimil Golias, Roman Lazik and Beata
Geffertova _ can do just about anything. May they return soon and
for a longer engagement.

ENTREPRENEURIAL SIBLINGS; `PUSH TECHNOLOGY' RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENTREPRENEURIAL SIBLINGS TAKE TO THE NET AGAIN  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, when an entrepreneur says he has a revolutionary
business plan that will forever change commerce using the Internet,
it's wise to raise an eyebrow, if not hit the mute button.
</P>
<P>
   But when the entrepreneurs in question are the brothers Jay and
Paul Shen, it may be worth listening in.
</P>
<P>
   The latest venture from the siblings Shen, each of whom already
has a hundred-million-dollar dot-com success to his credit, is
called myCustoms.com.
</P>
<P>
   The business, which is in a market test and set for a summer
rollout, is designed to enable e-commerce companies to expand their
overseas business by automating the import-export function.
</P>
<P>
   The Shens say they are seeking to solve what they describe as a
major kink in the international e-commerce pipeline. Most
e-commerce companies, they say, do not even entertain the idea of
overseas customers because they do not want to take the time and
energy to navigate myriad customs laws or calculate the duties and
value-added taxes of countless nations.
</P>
<P>
   Enter myCustoms.com, which the brothers say will calculate taxes
and inform buyers and sellers on import-export laws. ``Now the
entire process is very manual, very labor intensive, not applicable
to online,'' said Jay Shen, 27, the company's co-founder and
president. MyCustoms.com will enable people to ``trade globally as
they do locally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers say the site could also enable themselves to get
even richer _ even if the Shens could afford to retire already. In
1998, Jay founded Billpoint, a service that allows person-to-person
credit card transactions online, and sold it last year to eBay for
$125 million.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother Paul, 37, who is myCustoms.com's chief
executive, co-founded the iMedia Corp. in 1994. He sold iMedia,
which makes digital video software, to Terayon Communication
Systems last year for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The third co-founder of the new venture is Manoj Karamchandani,
formerly vice president for international operations at eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Given their previous successes, why don't the brothers do what
so many other wealthy technology executives are doing these days _
sit back and invest their money in other people's entrepreneurial
efforts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just looking for a financial gain,'' Jay Shen said.
``This product will really help society as a whole.''
</P>

   `PUSH TECHNOLOGY' RETURNS IN A FORM THAT IS MORE POLITE
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago now that Pointcast's ``push''
technology was touted as the next big thing. But at the end of this
month the Pointcast news and information service will officially
become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Pointcast has been living on borrowed time since last May, when
Launchpad Technologies acquired the company for $7 million and
formed a new company, Entrypoint. Now, Entrypoint has informed the
some 400,000 remaining Pointcast users that the service is being
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Pointcast, introduced in February 1996, automatically delivers
news and other information from the Internet to users' screens. But
while push technology quickly gained fame and garnered numerous
industry awards, it consumed more than five megabytes of the user's
hard drive and was notorious for clogging corporate networks. And
many people complained that Pointcast was simply too obtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great idea in there,'' said Francis Costello,
president and chief operating officer of Entrypoint and former head
of Launchpad, which itself was a spinoff of the technology
incubator Idealab. ``They had not done some things that were fairly
obvious, like make it smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrypoint is hoping that it can avoid losing Pointcast's
customers altogether by converting them to its own information
delivery service. Called Entrypoint 2.0 (www.entrypoint.com), the
service displays information in an on-screen toolbar that has
various buttons linking users instantly to shopping, financial and
news sites of their own choice. Users can make purchases using
credit card information stored in an ``eWallet,'' _ technology that
Launchpad developed to simplify online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pointcast, which transmitted those megabytes worth of
data to an individual's hard drives whether the person wanted it or
not, Entrypoint sends only information the user has requested _
like updates on stock activity and the latest shopping deals.
</P>
<P>
   It is push technology, in other words, that is intended to be a
lot less pushy. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, which
will be transmitted on Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of
a weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service. The new
map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and is 6 inches
deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits the
insertion of cloud cover information and the addition of many new
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information. A sample of the new map is available at Wieck,
Newscom, Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE NBA SHOULD HAVE MORE LOVE FOR DUNCAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I may have made a bad career decision when I agreed
to cover the Knicks-San Antonio game Sunday at Madison Square
Garden, instead of the Knicks-Lakers game next week.
</P>
<P>
   I chose Tim Duncan over Shaquille O'Neal, and that, I suppose,
means fewer readers for me Monday morning than for whoever will be
writing the Shaq column next week.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told that Shaq and his Lakers, as a rule, rate higher than
Duncan and his defending champion Spurs, and while I realize that
ratings rule, I happen to be an unabashed Duncan fan. I admit this
is not fashionably cool or the expedient means of landing in a seat
next to Ernie Johnson in those yuk-it-up sessions on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if I had any vocational sense, I would have bypassed
Duncan and not given Shaq and the Knicks a second thought, and
informed the office that every basketball column from here to
eternity or at least the duration of Toronto's playoff run will
feature Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   I would attach myself to Carter, the chosen one, and hang there,
like Jeff Van Gundy on Alonzo Mourning. Like the National
Basketball Association on, well, Vince Carter.
</P>
<P>
   What do I do? I tell my editor, ``Put me down for Duncan,'' the
soft-spoken giant who, it has been said, will single-handedly bring
down all of professional basketball if he is allowed to
methodically work the NBA finals the way he did last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Actually _ and I don't know what the heck is wrong with me _ I
found Duncan's performance in the finals to be riveting. Every
night, he was far and away the most complete player in the house.
The young Michael Jordan didn't have the impact on his team that
Duncan had, but last season's ratings were down, way down, from
those of Air Jordan's climactic flight.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, getting a low television rating seems to
be a worse offense than head-butting a ref. A star athlete who
doesn't score well with the commissioner of all sports, His
Excellency, Mr. Nielsen, is sent to a purgatory for the
incorrigibly mundane. And that is part of the perverse message that
provokes John Rocker, encourages Dennis Rodman and brainwashes the
public with the nonsense that a player like Duncan isn't sexy
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all say we want role models but people go out and watch
Rodman,'' groaned Van Gundy, sitting up straight in the posture of
the basketball purist. ``There's a certain segment that wants the
superficial and hopefully a larger segment that wants to watch Tim
Duncan. I don't agree that Duncan isn't sexy enough. I would think
that over a period of time, people will come to appreciate him and,
if not, let's say who we are. We're about selling Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   In his second pro season, Duncan wasted Shaq and the Lakers last
spring and no such dominance has been seen from an NBA neophyte
since the Magic-Bird days, 20 years ago. Anyone who loves
basketball should love Tim Duncan. Does the NBA? Not enough.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told Duncan is not the most cooperative soul with the news
media, but that is pretty much across the board these days with the
young NBA stars. Panicked by the realization that is no more immune
to the fluctuations of the marketplace than is Wall Street, the NBA
is too busy trying to milk Vince Carter and mike its coaches. If
David Stern wants to elevate his league's exposure, he should
forget the coaches and get his players out of the training room for
people who don't have NBA dot.com television on their credential.
</P>
<P>
   The league's ratings are down, and what a shock. It took years
for Magic-Bird to take root, and years for Jordan to become
must-see TV. And there is something else that the NBA _ and every
other mainstream sport used to certain levels of television
viewership _ had better understand. Games are no longer alone as a
means of providing live prime-time entertainment. Contrived human
dramas _ from shock culture wrestling to shows like ``Who Wants to
be a Millionaire?'' _ are successfully competing for target
audiences. Kids are finishing their homework and deciding whether
to go on line or to the television set.
</P>
<P>
   But what the NBA and other team sports should always have going
for them is the legitimacy of competition, the notion that its true
fan base knows game is not based on gimmickry and trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made money because people wanted to watch
basketball,'' said Van Gundy, not thrilled about being miked for
Tuesday night's game on cable against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the invasion of privacy would soon make it
impossible to have a team meeting, which sounded a bit
sanctimonious. The miking thing is one thing. Not having enough
faith in your core product is another. The NBA needs to embrace the
players who hold up its game, not just those who hang from the
rim. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush attacks Gore's call for campaign finance reform
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANT CITY, Fla. _ Coming just short of calling Vice President
Al Gore dishonest, Texas Gov. George W. Bush repeatedly accused
Gore Sunday of being ``a man who will say whatever it takes to get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was so astonished by Gore's call Saturday for
campaign finance reform that at first, he thought it was some kind
of ``April Fools joke.'' He said Gore adopted reform this week only
because the vice president's own money raising tactics have come
under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have long memories,'' said Bush who promised that if he
wins the presidency he will ``set a high standard in the Oval
Office'' for personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments during a visit to the Plant City
strawberry festival with his wife Laura and younger brother, Gov.
Jeb Bush. The Texas governor, ill from a head cold, greeted
hundreds of festival goers who eagerly shook his hand, gave him
babies to hold and posed for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his younger brother then entered the St. Clement
Catholic Church ``make your own strawberry shortcake'' pavilion
where, for $2.50, you can have all the strawberries and whipped
cream you can put on your plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brothers made their own desserts and ate outside while
scores of people hovered over them. ``I just can't believe they are
here,'' said Judith Archer of Tampa. ``I loved President Bush and I
think Jeb has done a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   The good mood was set aside when Bush held a news conference
after dessert. The New York Times reported Sunday that Gore said he
was taking up the issue of campaign finance reform because of the
``pain'' he felt over his role in raising money for the 1996
Clinton-Gore campaign. Last week, one of Gore's friends was
convicted for excesses in raising money that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a passion for campaign finance reform,'' Gore said,
``that is fueled in part because of the pain of those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reacted harshly to Gore's statements. ``I'm surprised he is
talking about campaign finance reform,'' Bush said. ``I think he
must think that the American people have been asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush later headed to Knoxville in Gore's home state of
Tennessee, where he was picking up the endorsement of Sen. Fred
Thompson, who had supported Arizona Sen. John McCain until he
suspended his campaign last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, went to church in Houston and later to a health
care forum near Dallas. Gore arrived in Miami late Sunday and will
talk about health care today at Jackson Memorial Hospital. He
leaves Florida this afternoon and will return Tuesday to spend
primary night in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the Associated Press Bush's five-year, $483-billion
tax-cut plan would put Social Security, Medicare and health care in
general at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the words of John McCain, he doesn't put one penny into
Social Security, one penny into Medicare or one penny into
expanding access to health care,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said Gore's appearance in Tallahassee is another
indication that Republicans should not take Florida for granted in
November. ``This is going to be very competitive here,'' Bush said.
``I don't think the vice president is just going to lay down.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida and five other states hold presidential primaries
Tuesday. With McCain out of the Republican race and Bill Bradley
out of the Democratic race, the results are already clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said that after Tuesday, his campaign will
begin working on the strategy for the November election. ``I think
it's going to be a very interesting election.''
</P>
<P>
   The story includes material from the Associated Press.

WINE, WITH ASSORTED ADDITIVES, IS POPULAR IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Yao Yun pulls the cork on a bottle of red wine
in a fashionable restaurant here and does something that might
horrify a Frenchman: He pours himself half a glass and tops it up
with Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine tastes too bitter, but the more we drink mixed wine, the
more we like it,'' says the young graphic designer, pouring a
second glass for his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine is a la mode in China's increasingly prosperous cities
these days, particularly at wedding banquets and karaoke bars. It
has replaced the cognac that people here downed by the tumblerful a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to lax regulation and unscrupulous vintners, much of
the wine in China is of poor quality. Many people mix white wine
with Coca-Cola or red wine with Sprite to make the wine more
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Though Yao's bottle of wine carries a local label, it might
contain cheap table wine from Spain that has sat for months in a
giant plastic shipping bag. Or it might not hold what people in the
West would consider wine at all: There is no law that red wine must
be made from grapes, though there is a ``recommended standard''
that grapes be used for at least half the content.
</P>
<P>
   Bottlers are supposed to list the ingredients on the label, but
there is often plenty left unsaid. Some wine is made from cheap
apple-juice concentrate, with grain alcohol and color added,
viticulturists say. Some is just colored sugar water, with
flavoring and alcohol but no fruit juice at all. Counterfeiting is
rife, with only a printing press needed to turn cooking wine into
``claret.''
</P>
<P>
   That disturbs Western merchants who had hoped to cultivate a
billion wine-bibbers after Beijing began promoting fruit-based
alcoholic beverages as an alternative to traditional 160-proof
Chinese spirits a few years ago. Chinese liquor is made from grain
that the government would rather people ate than imbibed.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by reports of the health benefits of moderate wine
consumption, the government's nudge started a stampede for red
wine. The Chinese do not ascribe any special aphrodisiac qualities
to wine, as they do to some hard liquor, but as in the West, wine
has a romantic aura.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden demand quickly sucked dry China's small vineyards,
which are mostly vestiges of Western wineries from pre-communist
days. Wine factories even used up Chinese grape varieties like
Cow's Nipple or Dragon's Eye, which are considered too sweet for
dry Western wines.
</P>
<P>
   To slake the sudden thirst, Chinese bottlers started importing
cheap European wine, shipped in huge 22,000-liter bags that each
fill a 20-foot steel freight container.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Rovira was in charge of international sales at the
Bodegas Felix Solis winery in Spain at the time. The dapper
Spaniard says his fax machine began whirring with order after order
from China in 1996. ``People wanted four, five containers in the
first order, no sample required,'' he says now from his mostly
empty warehouse just west of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The world's wine business quickly fell under the spell of the
potentially vast China market. Winemakers from Australia to Peru
came to scout for customers. Rovira moved to Shanghai, established
a bottling plant and began pumping wine from truck to tank as if it
were home-heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Soon even China's best-known local labels were wrapped around
bottles of cheap Western table wine, though they continued to claim
that they were made in China. ``China doesn't have enough grape
fields to meet the market demand, so it's hard to believe that any
of the big companies aren't importing from other countries,'' said
Wang Jiajian, an official at the Alcohol Monopoly Agency in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Chinese winemakers grew from a few dozen to more
than 300, bottling such wines as Grand Dragon and Tonghua, whose
label carries the ambiguous English phrase ``save and preserve five
years in oak wood bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dipsomania ran out of control: Though wine consumption
nearly tripled from 1996 to 1997, imports grew sixfold. China was
soon swimming in surplus wine. Twenty-year-old French wines
appeared on supermarket shelves at $3 or $4 a bottle, cheaper than
even local wines. Some were fake but some were genuine, smuggled in
and later dumped by cash-starved importers.
</P>
<P>
   China tried stemming the flow, first by enforcing
often-underpaid duties that more than double the cost of imported
wine, and then by banning French wine imports after detecting
traces of cow's blood in a few bottles. (Blood is sometimes used to
clarify wine, but the practice is outdated and is limited to a few
small regions of Europe.)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Chinese press was soon warning consumers that
they could catch mad cow disease by drinking French wine. China
lifted the ban after just two weeks last year, but the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid to drink any imported wine,
especially French wine,'' says Sun Cheng, manager of the Golden
Gate, a brightly lighted Shanghai restaurant that only serves
Chinese wines _ including one listed on the menu as French
Champagne Wine, though it comes from northern China.
</P>
<P>
   With the customs service cracking down and the market saturated,
importers began abandoning shipments at the docks. Wine executives
estimate that as much as 10,000 metric tons _ the equivalent of
about 12.5 million bottles _ was abandoned last year. A lot of it
is still sitting in government warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've imported so much wine that if they stopped today,
there's enough in the warehouses to last three or four years,''
said Rovira, whose profit margins and market have withered because
of competition from cheap wine.
</P>
<P>
   If no one claims the wine after three months, customs agents are
free to sell it _ which they do, at happy-hour prices. By that
time, the wine has been in plastic shipping bags for at least four
months, including time on the water. A lot of the wine on the
market today sat in shipping bags through the sweltering heat of
summer.
</P>
<P>
   That does not matter to most Chinese, who drink wine as they do
traditional Chinese spirits, in a ritualized swallow meant more for
show than for sensation. In the second-floor ballroom of the New
Asia Thomson Hotel in Shanghai recently, tables of flushed young
women and crew-cut young men gulped goblets of Imperial Court wine
_ produced by a grapefruit farm _ to a chorus of ``gan-bei,'' a
toast-cum-challenge that literally means ``dry cup.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it does concern those people trying to educate China's
palate. Sam Featherston, head of marketing for Montrose Food and
Wine Co., an American-owned importer and distributor of fine wines
in China, recalls that he was awakened one night by a bartender at
a karaoke club in Beijing who wanted a case of Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild at roughly $170 a bottle wholesale for the
cheapest vintage, one of Montrose's most expensive wines.
</P>
<P>
   Featherston delivered the wine personally by taxi and was
invited to spend the rest of the night with a party of toughs and a
dozen hired women, who swilled the wine mixed with Sprite and
watermelon slices.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `It's just like drinking the local stuff, so why
spend so much money?''' Featherston said, referring to such
ill-fated fine wines. But when they drink the local stuff on its
own, he adds, their eyes water and their throats burn and they
decide they do not like wine.
</P>
<P>
   Montrose is nurturing a growing band of oenophiles with its
60,000-bottle cellar _ actually a Mao-era bomb shelter in Beijing.
The company holds frequent wine tastings and caters to a few
connoisseurs. A director of the state arms-trading company buys
$100 bottles of sauternes by the case, Featherston says.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the wine is consumed in places like Shanghai's
Famous Grouse karaoke club, where black-clad young women carry $10
bottles of El Guardamonte from Spain through the bright yellow
halls to dark private rooms. Such nightclubs across Asia were once
the main drain for much of the world's brandy and plenty of
whiskey. ``No one wants to drink cognac anymore _ most of our
customers want red wine now,'' the club's general manager, Huang
Jianmei, said.
</P>
<P>
   The real losers are people trying to produce quality wines in
China. In the 1980s, Group Pernod Ricard of France began coaxing
villages near China's Great Wall to switch from sweet Chinese grape
varieties to chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon, which the company
could use to make quality wines. They taught farmers to bury the
frail European plants in the sandy soil during the frigid northern
Chinese winters and to dig them out in spring.
</P>
<P>
   The company now makes about a million bottles a year under the
Dragon Seal label, using strict European standards _ even aging the
wine in oak casks imported from France. But the market is
increasingly difficult. ``The price is always decreasing,'' says
its winemaker, Gerome Sabate.
</P>
<P>
   Rovira of Felix Solis has decided to approach the market another
way: He is selling gallon jugs of sangria.

ALBRIGHT AIDE TELLS ALBANIANS TO HALT ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, arrived in Kosovo Sunday with a tough message, warning
Albanian leaders that they were losing the respect of their backers
in Washington and Europe and risked forfeiting Western support if
they did not do more to stem ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's three-day visit comes almost a year after NATO started
bombing Yugoslavia to halt Serbian repression of Kosovo's
Albanians. Nine months after the alliance declared victory, the
province is succumbing to an increase in violence and tension. ``We
did a lot to convince the West and the U.S. to act on behalf of the
Albanians. Now all of us, the biggest supporters, are
disappointed,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian leaders failed to ``use their leadership to take hard
decisions'' because they were the sort of decisions that could cost
them friends, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, as assistant to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
was closely involved in negotiations with Albanian leaders before
the NATO air intervention and after the war, traveling to Kosovo
last summer to help negotiate the disarmament of the Albanian
guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be repeating the message to political leaders
in the next few days, because continued violence could cost Kosovo
Western aid and support. ``Every time a Serb is mauled, every time
a Serb is shot, every time we hear a story about ethnic violence,
our determination to help Kosovo weakens,'' he said.''

POPE GIVES UNPRECEDENTED APOLOGY FOR CHURCH'S WRONGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Saying ``we humbly ask forgiveness,'' Pope John Paul II
on Sunday delivered the most sweeping papal apology ever, repenting
of the errors of his church over the last 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot not recognize the betrayal of the Gospel committed
by some of our brothers, especially in the second millennium,'' the
pope, dressed in purple robes for Lent, said in his homily.
``Recognizing the deviations of the past serves to reawaken our
consciences to the compromises of the present.''
</P>
<P>
   The public act of repentance, solemnly woven into the liturgy of
Sunday Mass inside St. Peter's Basilica, was an unprecedented
moment in the history of the Roman Catholic Church, one that the
ailing 79-year-old pope pushed forward over the doubts of even many
of his own cardinals and bishops. He has said repeatedly that the
new evangelization he is calling for in the third millennium can
take place only after what he has described as a churchwide
``purification of memory.''
</P>
<P>
   To underline the religious significance of the apology, seven
cardinals and bishops stood before the pope and singled out some of
the key Catholic lapses, past and present, including religious
intolerance and injustice toward Jews, women, indigenous peoples,
immigrants, the poor and the unborn.
</P>
<P>
   The pope also mentioned the persecution of Catholics by other
faiths. ``As we ask forgiveness for our sins, we also forgive the
sins committed by others against us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of his pontificate, John Paul's boldest
gestures were on the political front, confronting communism in the
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Latin America and also challenging
human rights violations and the economic injustices of capitalism.
But the apology, issued in the twilight of his papacy, is
theologically more daring.
</P>
<P>
   His effort to cleanse his church's conscience for the new
millennium has already drawn criticism, but it is almost certain to
mark his legacy deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apology does not just apply to individuals, but the church
as a whole, and that is very important,'' the Rev. Lorenzo
Albacete, who teaches theology at St. Joseph's seminary in Yonkers,
N.Y., said. ``Because it reflects this pope's desire to reconcile
with other Christians and other religions, people are tempted to
view it as a tactic, but its immense spiritual importance to this
pope lies in the fact that it did not come within a diplomatic or
theological agreement, but in the liturgy of the Mass during Lent
and the Holy Year.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, broadening a process of reconciliation that began in
the 1960s during the Second Vatican Council, has issued apologies
before, notably regretting in a 1998 document the failure of many
Catholics to help Jews during the Holocaust. That document, ``We
Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,'' disappointed many leading
Jewish groups, which complained that the pope did not go far enough
in apologizing for the silence of church leaders, including the
wartime pope, Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in the prayer dedicated to ``confession of sins against
the people of Israel,'' John Paul did not mention the church's
behavior during the Holocaust, just as he did not specify other
sins of the church. He said, ``We are deeply saddened by the
behavior of those who in the course of history have caused these
children of yours to suffer, and asking your forgiveness we commit
ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the Covenant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, called
Sunday's apology a ``bold and important step forward,'' but added
that he was disappointed that the pope had not mentioned the
Holocaust explicitly. ``The church still wants to steer clear of
dealing with the role of the Vatican during World War II,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope also acknowledged that church followers had ``violated
the rights of ethnic groups and peoples and shown contempt for
their cultures and religious traditions.'' He deplored divisions
between Catholicism and other branches of Christianity, and also
discrimination against women. ``Given the number of sins committed
in the course of 20 centuries,'' Bishop Piero Marini, who is in
charge of papal ceremonies, said before the Mass, ``it must
necessarily be rather summary.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope stated, ``Christians have at times given in to
intolerance and have not been faithful to the great commandment of
love, sullying in their way the face of the church.'' But he did
not note specifically episodes in the church's history like the
Crusades or the Inquisition, which in certain parts of Europe
lasted for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who rode up the basilica aisle on a rolling platform,
a strength-saving device he has been using since Christmas, read
his homily in a clear, firm voice that belied the palsied trembling
of his hands, a symptom of Parkinson's disease. After the Mass, he
went to his balcony to deliver the Angelus, telling the crowds
below him, ``Forgiven and ready to forgive, Christians enter the
third millennium as more credible witnesses to hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's act of repentance was so unprecedented that many
Catholics predict that it will take time for its full importance to
sink in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an entirely new thing,'' said the Vatican spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Valls. ``I think it will take years for the church
to absorb it.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The need for Catholics to examine their collective conscience is
something that this pope has been thinking about for years, and he
laid out his rationale for it in a 1994 apostolic letter on the
third millennium called ``The Coming of the Third Millennium.'' He
also raised the subject privately in meetings with key cardinals,
and his proposal was sufficiently groundbreaking that they
requested that the theological and historical implications first be
studied in depth.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a dense 31-page treatise by the International
Theological Commission, which, with Vatican oversight, ground out
the theological precedents and also the limits to the apology.
</P>
<P>
   Written by a committee and released earlier this month, the
document addresses concerns that the apology will be misunderstood
or misused by those ``hostile to the church.'' It also reflects
other worries of theologians, who had to grapple with such complex
issues as how a church that considers itself holy can admit
mistakes, and whether it is fair for today's church to condemn acts
by previous generations made in good if misguided faith.
</P>
<P>
   The document explains that the church is holy, but is stained by
the sins of its children, and requires ``constant purification.''
It implies but does not directly address the delicate issue of
whether past church leaders also erred. ``The document should have
put it in bold print that `children of the church' includes popes,
cardinals and clergy, and not just people in the pews,'' the Rev.
Thomas Reeves, editor of the Jesuit magazine America, commented.
``The pope had a great idea that some in the Vatican are obscuring
with a fog machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The document also cautions against judging past generations by
today's moral or religious standards, and says today's believers
cannot be held responsible for sins committed by Catholics hundreds
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It nevertheless concedes that there is ``an objective collective
responsibility'' for past errors that modern Catholics should
acknowledge and repent.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads the Vatican's Congregation
of the Doctrine of the Faith, the modern successor to the
Inquisition, addressed the issue of why the church felt ready to
concede error now, and not in earlier times, at a news conference
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Protestantism and the Enlightenment ``created a new
historiography of the church, claiming that it was not just stained
by sin but completely corrupt, so the church had to build up a
Catholic historiography to combat it,'' he explained. He said the
collapse of atheist, totalitarian systems had left the church ``in
a new situation of freedom to return to our sins.''
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty for theologians and church historians to
determine what exactly constituted knowable error during the
Crusades, the Inquisition, holy wars, the burning of heretics and
the forced conversions of Indians and Africans, led to a more
elliptical reference to ``sins committed in the service of truth.''
Ratzinger prayed that Catholics would recognize ``that even men of
the church in the name of faith and morals, have sometimes used
methods not in keeping with the Gospel.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry, but colder weather will return to the Northeast as brisk
breezes from the northwest diminish quickly in southern New
England. Sunshine will be abundant, but readings will average 5 or
more degrees below seasonal levels. High pressure crested near the
nation's capital will circulate cool, dry air into the Southeast.
Freezing temperatures will be common inland as far south as the
Florida panhandle. A cold front will move slowly into the Bahamas
so that clouds and scattered showers will persist in southern
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The return of milder air into the Plains and Mississippi Valley
will be marked by increasing clouds. A warm front moving across the
Great Lakes region will promote patches of light snow and snow
showers, mainly in Michigan and northern Ohio. A few sprinkles will
dampen Indiana. A humid air stream from the Gulf of Mexico into
Texas and New Mexico will trigger drizzle and patches of light rain
in southern sections.
</P>
<P>
   Bright and pleasant conditions will dominate the central and
northwest Plains as a ridge of high pressure covers the region.
Advancing polar air will reach the Dakotas later Monday, preceded
by clouds and flurries. Meanwhile, a center of high pressure over
Nevada should control the weather over much of the West. Dry and
warmer winds from the east will bring sunny, mild conditions to
southern and central California. A milder air flow from the south
will be accompanied by thickening clouds and showers along the
Northwest Coast. The interior of Washington and Oregon will turn
dull, but mild.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Spring Snow
</P>
<P>
   The half a foot of wet snow that fell from central Missouri to
northern Ohio on Saturday will be nothing but soggy lawns and
fields Monday. Even though the calendar indicates that it is still
winter, the weekend storm was characteristic of a spring snowfall.
This snow came after an early season warm spell and much of it fell
at readings just below freezing. Spring snows melt rapidly because
of the higher sun angle of March, now similar to September, and the
rapid changes of air masses. In fact, readings may reach 60 degrees
Tuesday in the recently snow-covered areas of the Ohio Valley.

Sunday of being ``a man who will say whatever it takes to get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was so astonished by Gore's call Saturday for
campaign finance reform that at first, he thought it was some kind
of ``April Fools joke.'' He said Gore adopted reform this week only
because the vice president's own money raising tactics have come
under scrutiny. (Crowley, Palm Beach Post). MOVED

evolved into its most severe type, known as ``flesh-eating''
bacteria. Meanwhile, health officials continue to investigate an
outbreak of 23 cases of strep throat infections in the Cincinnati

   HISTORY-COMING-CLEAN _ ``God bless you all. I am a innocent
man.'' Those were the words of Ed Johnson before he was hanged from
a metal girder on the Walnut Street Bridge in downtown Chattanooga.
The year was 1906, a time of lawlessness and vigilantism, of mob
violence directed toward blacks often wrongly accused, as was
Johnson, of raping a white woman. Johnson had been tried for the
crime and, despite a dearth of evidence _ even the victim could not
positively identify him as the assailant _ he was sentenced to die.

   UNCONVENTIONAL-PROFESSOR _ On a late-winter day of blue skies
and crisp, dry air, Roger Shattuck poses for a photographer on the
faux-Gothic campus of Oglethorpe University. He is a thinker, so
she asks him to sit with his hand to his 76-year-old face. He
amiably complies. One can be a contrarian without being contrary.
Shattuck is an unconventional thinker, as resistant to academic
fashion as he is gentle in manner. Principled disagreement he can
accept, but not the dogmas he finds seeping into the ground water
of American cultural life. One is that there can be no common
literary heritage in a country built on the banishment of the red
man, the enslavement of the black man, the exploitation of the
working man and the suppression of women of whatever color. (Skube,

an older audience with his Marvin Gaye feel; receive airplay on
varying formats of radio (R&AMP;B, pop, rap and jazz) _all while his

   DVD _ The handwriting is on the wall, and so are the DVDs. About
18 months ago, retail stores and video rental shops had shelf after

the ratio was usually about 20 videotapes to every one DVD. Now the
shelf space ratio is down to about three to one in favor of
videotape. And don't be surprised if the margin tips in favor of
DVD in another 18 months. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 34. MOVED.

he said, frustrated about the 6 hits and 4 runs (3 earned) he
surrendered Sunday in 3 innings in the Mets' 9-3 loss to the
Montreal Expos at Roger Dean Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to hurry up and try to make some money,'' he said.
``Then you can let baseball just be baseball. The pressure goes
down, way down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher has a 1-year, $575,000 contract plus incentives, not
bad for a guy who won't be 27 for another 7 months, but paltry by
the standard of some of his contemporaries. After all, by his
timeline, this is supposed to be his sixth year in the major
leagues, not his fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets first began promoting him - along with fellow promising
pitchers Jason Isringhausen and Paul Wilson _ in 1995, but never
got to see that combination realize its potential. Now, after arm
surgery and a trade to the Brewers, Pulsipher is anxious to make up
for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you came up with all the hype and believe all the
accolades, you want it,'' he said. ``When you have friends sitting
across the clubhouse from you that you grew up with basically and
they're doing it _ Gold Gloves and multimillion-dollar contracts _
you want that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher believes a lucrative contract, with all the security
that brings, would make him a better pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I get money, it's not going to turn me down a notch,'' he
said. ``That's going to turn it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now he is part of a four-way battle for the Mets' No. 5
starting spot along with Bobby M. Jones, Glendon Rusch and Dennis
Springer. Pulsipher is anxious to have the list of candidates
``weeded out,'' but that's not likely to happen immediately, even
though Jones had no joyride either Sunday, yielding 4 hits and 4
runs in 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The first inning was chock full of bad memories for Pulsipher.
Leadoff hitter Peter Bergeron hit a slow bouncer toward Todd Zeile,
making the transition to first base. Pulsipher, making eye contact
with Zeile, stopped his charge to the base for a moment, thinking
Zeile could take it unassisted. It was just enough to allow
Bergeron to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Mickey Morandini, hit a bouncer to second
baseman Edgar Alfonzo, who made a rare fielding error. Pulsipher
struck out Patrick Lennon, but then on an 0-2 pitch, the feared
Vladimir Guerrero laced a curveball for a run-producing single.
</P>
<P>
   That irritated Manager Bobby Valentine, who described it later
as a ``down- the-middle'' pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could say it's spring training and I just felt like trying a
curveball there,'' Pulsipher said. ``But I'm not afforded these
mistakes. You've got to make every pitch and that's the bottom
line. It was a dumb pitch in a dumb situation and I paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher, who realized his goal of not walking anyone, felt he
made just one other mistake in the game - a pitch that catcher
Charlie O'Brien hit for a run-producing double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, I really kept the ball pretty much where I
wanted to keep it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt this was even better than I threw my last time out,''
he said of a two-inning stint in which he allowed no runs.``But I
don't know what I can take out of this game. I can't be
disappointed with the way I threw the ball, because I covered the
outside corner with consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's aware that the 6 hits _ even 2 of the infield
variety _ and 4 runs make for a messy-looking linescore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say the numbers don't count,'' he said. ``But I think
that's a lot of baloney sometimes. What good is it when you think
you've pitched well, but they're scoring on you anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Mets pitching coach Dave Wallace said his main concern about
Pulsipher is his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got good stuff - there's never a question of that,''
Wallace said. ``The command thing is the question for him and for a
lot of guys. Only a select few have the kind of command where they
can put the ball in the strike zone where they want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with his occasional rough edges, Pulsipher said he is a
much more complete pitcher now than when he made his major league
debut for the Mets in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hurt my arm, I began working on my mechanics,'' he
said. ``I know now about being able to have your body in the right
position and having your hand in the right position to make the
ball do what you want it to do. I used to have no idea. I used to
just throw it and people would say it had great movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulsipher said he has always been treated warmly by Mets fans,
who he feels are pulling for him in a big way to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been with me a long time,'' he said. ``It would be
especially sweet to get back to where I was before all the injuries
and bad luck.'' &QL;

DUKE'S RETURNING PLAYERS KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO KRZYZEWSKI 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BARRY JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The championship run began inconspicuously
last April in the wake of the largely unexpected departure of five
of Duke's top seven players. The holdovers Chris Carrawell, Shane
Battier and Nate James went to Mike Krzyzewski's home to wish their
coach well as he recovered from hip-replacement surgery, and to
pledge their loyalty and reaffirm their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The trio has made good on its vows, culminating with a decisive
81-68 victory over Maryland Sunday afternoon in the championship of
the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The victory raised Duke's record to 27-4 and earned the Blue
Devils the No. 1 seed in the East Regional of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament. Friday they will meet
Lamar, the 16th-seeded team, at Joel Coliseum in Winston-Salem,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   By defeating Maryland (24-9), Duke became the first team since
the 1973 and 1974 North Carolina State teams of David Thompson and
Tom Burleson to finish first during the regular season and win the
ACC tournament in consecutive years. Duke has finished first in the
conference four straight times, and captured Krzyzewski's fifth ACC
tournament title in nine tries.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, in which the Blue Devils led for the final 33
minutes, avenged their only ACC loss over the past two seasons, a
98-87 Maryland triumph at Cameron Indoor Stadium in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us at Cameron, celebrated on our court,'' said
Carrawell. ``To come out and win today, we beat the team that beat
us last. That's the first time in two years; my record in the ACC
is 37-1. Yeah, that's proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils reached the final by dispatching ninth seeded
Clemson and fifth-seeded Wake Forest with a barrage of 3-pointers,
converting a sizzling 50.8 percent (30-of-59). With the Terrapins
understandably intent upon stopping Duke's perimeter game, the
nation's top-scoring team (89.1 points a game) went inside.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set with Duke's first two baskets, both from close
range by Carlos Boozer. The freshman center finished with 21
points, 10 in the first half. The Blue Devils also ran sets and
isolations for point guard Jason Williams, who repeatedly
confounded Maryland's defense en route to a game-high 23 points and
the tournament's most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I let him get into the lane too much today,'' Steven
Blake, the Maryland freshman, said of his Duke counterpart. ``He
penetrated and made things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, from Ridgefield, N.J., also had six assists Sunday,
and his 27 for the tournament was one short of the tournament
record. He became the fourth freshman to win the most valuable
player award, after North Carolina's Phil Ford (1975), Sam Perkins
(1981) and Jerry Stackhouse (1994).
</P>
<P>
   Maryland achieved its last lead, 9-8, on a Blake 3-pointer just
six minutes and 42 seconds into the game. Williams responded with a
3-pointer half a minute later, putting Duke ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring inside while limiting the Terps' fastbreak
opportunities, the Blue Devils led by 37-36 at halftime despite
missing 10 of 11 3-pointers in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Williams opened the second half with a 3-pointer and Duke pushed
to a 48-40 lead at the 16-minute-52-second mark on a 3 by Battier,
a junior forward who finished with 10 points, 5 steals, 5 rebounds
and a sterling defensive job on the Terps' Terence Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland rallied within 48-44 barely a minute later on a jumper
in transition by Juan Dixon, the darting guard who paced his squad
with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Duke quickly built the lead to 54-44, capped by a Williams layup
in a halfcourt set with 13:42 to go. Again the Terps rallied,
closing to 56-52 with 8:50 left on a Morris follow.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Krzyzewski called timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Maryland to stop scoring, that was the first thing,''
Krzyzewski said. ``We got a 10-point lead and we lost our focus. I
tried to stress poise during that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Point made. Over the next seven minutes Duke broke the game
open, keyed by Williams, whose 3-pointer gave the Blue Devils a
74-61 advantage with 1:40 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapped in part by the loss of starting forward Danny
Miller, who sprained his left ankle and did not play in the second
half, Maryland allowed Duke 63.6 percent accuracy in the second
half, including 6 of 9 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils meanwhile held the Terps _ appearing in their
first final since 1984 _ to 33.3 percent shooting in the period.
Morris and center Lonny Baxter combined for 10 of 31 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we won the tournament because of our defense, not
because of our offense,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   This Duke team does not overwhelm opponents with talent or
numbers like the 1999 group that lost to Connecticut in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association title game. Yet it has won
nearly as often with three freshmen among its top six players.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this so special,'' said Carrawell, who finished
with 13 points and a team-high seven rebounds, ``is nobody expected
it this year.''

FIAT WEIGHS SALE TO GM OF A STAKE IN ITS AUTO LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change sourcing in 1st and 2nd grafs.)  
(mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Fiat is close to selling a minority stake in its car
operations to General Motors after apparently failing to sell the
entire division to DaimlerChrysler, auto industry officials and
executives close to the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat's board is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the
proposed transaction with GM and is fairly likely to approve a
deal, industry and other executives said Sunday after insisting on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting could last into Tuesday, and the board might ask
its negotiators to continue working beyond then, especially if
DaimlerChrysler comes back with a more attractive proposal at the
last moment, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Italy, where the troubles of Fiat's car division
have been a long-running national story, reported Sunday that Fiat
would hand over a 20 percent stake in its car operations in
exchange for a 5 percent stake in GM and possibly a seat on GM's
board. The transaction would also involve some sharing of engines
and auto parts and Fiat's use of the Internet buying service for
parts that GM, DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor are setting up, the
papers reported. But auto industry officials said Sunday that these
and other provisions of the deal were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino of Italy said that some
alliance between Fiat and a foreign carmaker was ``an inevitable
move.'' He told La Repubblica, a daily in Rome, that ``whoever
wishes to hold on to Fiat in its present form risks marginalizing
it further and further.''
</P>
<P>
   GM, DaimlerChrysler and Fiat representatives declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If Fiat sells part or all of its car business, it is likely to
focus on its profitable divisions, which make heavy trucks and
tractors. Fiat is considering whether to make a bid for Volvo AB,
the world's second-largest maker of heavy trucks, executives close
to the company said Sunday. Fiat had tried unsuccessfully last year
to buy all of the Swedish company, which decided instead to sell
its car-building division to Ford and focus only on heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is widely expected to use antitrust
concerns to block Volvo's $7.4 billion acquisition of Scania,
Sweden's other big truck maker. If the commission does so, Volvo
would be a ripe target for a takeover, and Fiat might make an
unsolicited offer, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Volvo has made preliminary contact with several
rivals, including Renault's truck unit, about a possible
combination, the executives said, though talks are not expected to
begin in earnest until the European Commission makes its final
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat, Italy's largest company with investments across many
industries, has been struggling for nearly a year with the question
of what to do with its car operations, which have been gradually
losing market share in Italy and in Europe for years. Having
publicly adopted the General Electric Co.'s management philosophy
of abandoning markets in which it does not hold a commanding market
share, Fiat has courted every big automaker in the world in recent
months in search of an alliance or buyer for its car operations.
Fiat still sells Ferraris in the United States but stopped selling
new Fiat brand cars here in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat's attractions are its strong market share in South America,
its shrunken but still large market share in Italy and its lineup
of freshly redesigned small cars, auto executives have said in
interviews in recent months. While Fiat held 11 percent of the
European market last year, it had nearly 38 percent of the Italian
market last year and 30 percent of the promising Brazilian market.
</P>
<P>
   And while the small-car market around the world is extremely
unprofitable because manufacturers in South Korea and other
recently industrialized countries are producing too many of them,
rising oil prices are beginning to reawaken auto manufacturers'
interest in the market segment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But potential buyers have been leery of Fiat's reputation for
overstaffed, inefficient factories in Italy, with powerful unions
and mediocre quality.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government's recent enthusiasm for a Fiat deal with
a foreign automaker has sparked hope that government money might be
used to help unionized workers retire, allowing Fiat to slim down
its factory work forces, said an American executive who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   GM has embarked on a global strategy of tying itself to midsize
automakers with large stakes in their home markets or with valuable
technology. In Japan, it has long had minority stakes in Isuzu and
Suzuki and a technology alliance with Toyota Motor. This winter it
took a stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars and
is a leader in all-wheel-drive technology, and agreed to start
buying six-cylinder engines from Honda.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced in early January that it was exercising an option
to buy the half of Sweden's Saab that it did not already own. And
in a single week in mid-January, the company entered into marketing
partnerships with Sony, America Online and NetZero.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman, articulated the new strategy
in a speech on Jan. 17, repudiating the company's nearly
century-old strategy of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is to develop long-term relationships with other
companies that offer a unique advantage to the General Motors group
of brands and businesses,'' Smith said then. ``This alliance
strategy is our major thrust, and it is clearly a different
approach to growth than most people have associated with General
Motors _ or with the rest of the industry, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has been losing market share rapidly in the small-car segment
in the United States to Korean producers and recently canceled
plans to redesign the small Chevrolet Cavalier because it could not
figure out how to make a profit on it. Even GM's Saturn unit has
been cutting back output because of slow sales.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has also been looking for alliances and
acquisitions lately, both to penetrate difficult markets and to
respond to regulatory pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Because its Mercedes and Chrysler divisions both make fairly
large cars and sport utility vehicles, DaimlerChrysler faces
difficulties in meeting the tighter fuel-economy requirements
planned by the European Community, and has been looking for ways to
increase its share of the small-car market as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Like GM, DaimlerChrysler also needs to sell more small cars so
as to lure younger, less affluent buyers to its brands.

ARAB LEAGUE STATEMENT ON ISRAEL'S ROLE IN LEBANON DRAWS BITING
RESPONSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Israel's ties with the Arab world received a
fresh jolt Sunday when a brusquely worded Arab League communique
condemning Israel for its role in Lebanon prompted equally biting
responses from leading Israeli politicians, one of whom called the
Arab countries' attitude ``surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of polemics came a week after the Israeli cabinet
endorsed Prime Minister Ehud Barak's pledge to withdraw Israel's
1,500-member force from the ``security zone'' it occupies in
southern Lebanon by July, ending a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Israeli pledge had been expected to improve the
atmosphere for the Middle East peace talks, it has so far produced
only recriminations from the two countries primarily affected by
the Israeli pullout _ Lebanon and Syria, which maintains 35,000
troops here.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalent attitudes of the governments in Damascus and
Beirut were reflected in the communique issued by foreign ministers
of the 22-nation Arab League after a meeting here in the Lebanese
capital on Saturday. The meeting, held twice a year, normally in
Cairo, was shifted to Beirut as a show of solidarity after Israel
destroyed three Lebanese power plants on Feb. 8. The Israeli
bombing followed stepped-up attacks on Israeli troops in southern
Lebanon, since attenuated, that killed seven Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League statement, issued after six hours of
consultations, contained some of the harshest condemnation of
Israel from the league in years. Among other things, it blasted
Israel for its ``continuing aggression'' against Lebanon and for
its ``vicious'' threats to Lebanon, a reference to warnings by
Barak and the Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, who have
promised further retaliation if more Israeli soldiers are killed
before the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   The communique said, in effect, that the Lebanese guerrillas of
Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Party of God, had every right to
continue their attacks on Israel's forces since the Israelis were
an occupying force in Lebanon, in defiance of a 1978 United Nations
Security Council resolution demanding their immediate withdrawal.
``The Arab League fully supports Lebanon in its resistance and its
fight against Israeli occupation until Lebanese soil is fully
liberated,'' it said. ``The resistance is the natural result of the
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   If this was a well-established Arab viewpoint, it was what
followed that most piqued Israeli leaders. Echoing a demand
previously made by Lebanon's president, Emile Lahoud, the Arab
ministers demanded that Israel pay a price for the right to
withdraw its troops in peace. The communique warned of the
possibility of escalating war if Israel pulls out without first
reaching an agreement over the future of the large Palestinian
refugee population in Lebanon. The Palestinians _ who number at
least 200,000, and more than 360,000 by official Lebanese count _
have mostly been in Lebanon since the 1948 war that led to the
founding of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, which has denied most civic rights to the refugees, has
repeatedly demanded that Israel agree to their ``repatriation,''
meaning their return to what is now Israel. Israel has rejected the
demand, saying that Lebanon should accept the Palestinians as
permanent residents. But since Israel's pullout announcement last
week, Lebanese leaders have said that failure to settle the issue
now could expose Israel to a resumption, after the Israeli pullout,
of the attacks on Israel by the Palestinians that led to Israel's
original invasion of Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab League ministers said the Palestinians, if not assured
of repatriation, ``will remain a time bomb threatening peace in
Lebanon and the threatening the peace process.'' Lahoud, the
Lebanese president, put the point more bluntly in an interview
published on Saturday in Al Hayat, an Arabic newspaper published in
London. If the Palestinians attacked after the pullout, he said,
``How will Israel respond? Will they bomb the refugee camps? Will
they reoccupy the country? A unilateral Israeli withdrawal will not
work, and will lead to another war.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, even senior Lebanese military officers
concede that the Palestinian refugees are not in shape to resume
attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said the demand that Israel repatriate the
Palestinians was part of a strategy worked out with Syria, one that
sees Israel, having announced its pullout, as dealing from a
position of weakness. By raising the specter of attacks, Damascus
and Beirut are trying to exact as much mileage from the situation
as possible, the diplomats said. For Syria, the prize would be a
more flexible Israeli position on the return of the Golan Heights,
the issue that led to the collapse of the Israel-Syria talks in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions from Israel Sunday were withering. Barak told his
cabinet, according to a Reuters report, that ``declarations of this
kind do not contribute to the atmosphere required to advance the
peace process, and we do not need any approval from our
neighbors.'' The justice minister, Yossie Beilin, called the Arab
League demands ``surreal.'' Levy, the foreign minister, said that
the Arab states' ``double talk of war and peace casts a shadow on
their real intentions towards the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most telling response came from Shimon Peres,
Israel's former prime minister, who was one of the initiators of
the peace process in the early 1990s. ``In all my life, I've never
heard of a country which wants to put an end to an occupation being
threatened,'' he said. ```Woe betide you if you get out of there' _
have you ever heard of anything like that in history?''

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Bike Week 2000 headed for the finish wire
Sunday, leaving a trail of broken bodies and smashed motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just on local roads and city streets. Indeed, the
damage on the track at Daytona International Speedway, where
professional cyclists zip around a long cantilevered track at
speeds well over 100 miles an hour, was nothing compared with the
deaths and injuries that resulted when an estimated 600,000
motorcyclists crowded into this Atlantic resort for 10 days of
racing thrills and full-throttle partying.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday night, 13 bikers had died in traffic accidents,
local police agencies reported, and scores more were injured, the
highest toll in the 59-year history of the popular event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very alarming,'' Officer Rick Gregory of the
Florida Highway Patrol said about the traffic deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But cyclists said much of the blame for the accidents rested
with motorists who ignored or failed to notice bikers as they made
turns or passed other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a touchy subject for motorcyclists everywhere: accidents
caused by car drivers oblivious to the presence of bikers. It is
also a rationale for the supercharged exhaust blasts that announce
the arrival of the bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loud Pipes Save Lives'' is a ubiquitous decal plastered on
helmets and leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed impossible, however, for unnerved motorists not to
notice bikers on Daytona Beach's sun-washed streets this past
weekend. The bikers hurtled across the city and the Halifax River
bridge connecting the beaches with the mainland, thousands on the
move at any time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Some darted in and out of lines of slower traffic, sped along
highway shoulders and threaded crowded intersections.
</P>
<P>
   Riders can leave behind a cone of noise that rips the air with
ear-splitting thunder, even when accelerating at legal speeds.
Eighty-eight cubic-inch engines, twin Mukini carburetors and Wimmer
velocity stacks have a deep-throated gargle at idle, the pride of
every biker, and the va-va-ROOM is a sweet melody to their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from accidents, the Daytona Beach police said, this year's
crowd was well-behaved and cooperative. ``It's an older crowd who
come here for the weather, and they're not looking for trouble,''
said Sgt. Craig Buth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always some hotheads and some bar fights when people
drink too much,'' he said, ``but this has been the mildest group in
my memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlaw image persists more in legend than in the reality of
a conclave like Bike Week, where grandmothers and grandfathers
could be seen checking out exhibits of candy apple Harley-Davidson
Softriders and chrome-laden Fat Boys alongside tattooed younger men
and women wearing cutoff leather vests and fringed riding chaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the bad guys 40 years ago when bikers, for good
reason, intimidated people,'' said Bennie Bauer, a burly man in his
mid-50s with a full sandy beard going gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have mellowed with the times,'' he noted, with only a
whisper of regret, adding that some of Bike Week's participants
showed up riding $40,000 customized bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything down to the last stud on their saddlebags is done
for them, and they don't know what they're paying for with their
gold credit cards,'' he said in a good-natured growl as he motioned
toward a knot of middle-age men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the do-rag off one of their heads and you'll find a
doctor or a businessman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The men stood on a sidewalk on Main Street along with thousands
of other spectators, admiring an endless stream of motorcycles and
their riders cruising by in raucous procession. In addition,
thousands of bikes were parked handlebar to handlebar on both sides
of the street, buffed and brushed to a high-polish.
</P>
<P>
   What really seemed to be on parade was a national economy that
fuels weekend extravaganzas like Bike Week, enabling more than a
half-million hobbyists to spend an estimated $300 million on the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a Harley unless you can afford one,'' said
Debbie Torpey, a self-described computer networker from Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Bike Week, she added, ``is just a chance for a lot of
middle-class and educated people to dress up and let loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women here, from outward appearances, seemed to buy
into the dirty fingernail and rowdy image that bikers acknowledge
as a cultural inheritance. There was topless exhibitionism,
beer-swilling and macho swagger on parade, as well as
skull-and-crossbones insignia and Confederate battle flag regalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where can you put 600,000 people together for 10 days and
have as well-behaved and peaceful crowd as this group?'' said Tom
Guest, owner of Chopper World, a biker's boutique on Main Street.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Decades after smokestack industries largely
disappeared from the Hudson River valley, leaving behind an
environmental and economic mess that took years to reverse, plans
are afoot to build more than a dozen industrial plants in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals _ including a $500 million power plant in the town
of Athens, a $680 million paper recycling and power plant in
Ulster, and a $300 million cement factory in Greenport _ have
sharply divided towns up and down the river that have struggled,
and slowly recovered, since the decline of heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose the plants say they threaten to undermine the
effort to reclaim the Hudson from industrial pollution and to
rebuild the region's economy through tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But others welcome the return of manufacturing _ particularly
the Pataki administration, which has vigorously wooed the companies
with promises of state-sponsored tax-exempt bonds and local tax
breaks. They say it will lure better-paying blue-collar jobs to a
region where employment has improved markedly in recent years, but
where wages still lag behind those of more prosperous areas.
</P>
<P>
   And they are adamant that the factories will not harm the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought a plant would destroy the natural beauty of the
Hudson River, I would act,'' Gov. George Pataki said in an
interview. ``But it's not got to the point where anyone has told me
this is destroying the scenic beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pataki said that since the governor took office
in 1995, the state had spent $256 million on cleaning and
protecting the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pro-business, pro-industry,'' said Pataki, whose family
home overlooks the river in Garrison. ``We are also
pro-environment. There isn't any dichotomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and many residents are unconvinced, saying
that the administration has oversold the promise of factory jobs
and tax revenue and underestimated the environmental cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of everyone saying the river's never been cleaner, we
should be saying the river's never been under such threat,'' said
Alan Neumann, president of Hudson River Heritage, a preservation
group established 25 years ago. ``It's been decades since we've
been faced with such a concentrated series of proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed plants, most of which would use the river for some
part of their operation, are early in the approval process. A
spokesman for the Public Service Commission said a decision on
whether to build the 1,080-megawatt Athens plant _ it would be the
largest-capacity power plant in the country _ has been postponed
for the third time, until April 30. But the final approval on air
quality standards has already been granted, as has the draft permit
for water discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with St. Lawrence Cement Co., which plans to ferry
cement along two miles of conveyor belts to the riverfront, say
they hope to conduct public hearings this summer. They filed their
final environmental impact study on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the final decisions are months or years away,
emotions are running high. Twelve New York environmental and
preservation groups, led by Scenic Hudson, wrote to Pataki recently
urging a moratorium on industrial development until the state
issues an overall plan for the development of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In towns along the river, opposing sides have mounted expensive
public relations campaigns. In Athens, a group collected 4,000
signatures and produced a video lambasting the proposed power plant
there. In Saugerties, a citizens' group gathered 1,500 signatures
against the recycling plant and claims credit for the company's
decision to move to Ulster. And preservationists aligned with
Olana, the Hudson River School painter Frederic Church's
Moorish-style villa in Greenport, have joined in a lawsuit against
the gas-fired electrical plant, which they say will despoil the
view from the property.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective plants even played a role in a handful of
elections last fall, in which voters in Hudson and Newburgh ousted
mayors who had supported factory proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In Hudson, an anonymous group opposing the cement plant only a
few miles away prominently placed eight cinder blocks around town
with one-word labels that together formed the questions: ``Who will
really pay? Who will really profit?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, the people of the Hudson Valley have
tried to balance industry and the scenic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Poets, painters and philosophers trumpeted the virtues of the
wilderness and the beauty of the river, and along the way the
industrialists built their railroads and factories.
</P>
<P>
   First came brick factories, iron mines and riverside quarries,
then cement factories and later General Electric, all in search of
cheap, unlimited river water.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, the Hudson River was in trouble. Industries had
been dumping chemicals, and municipalities had been dumping sewage.
Scientists found fish full of PCBs from the General Electric plant
in the Upper Hudson, cadmium from a battery factory near Cold
Spring, diesel fuel from the Metro-North yards near Croton-Harmon.
The authorities banned commercial fishing and advised people not to
eat striped bass caught in the river.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, groups committed to saving the Hudson sprang up, and
by the early 1990s the river was being reclaimed. Billions of state
and federal dollars built state-of-the-art municipal treatment
plants. Chemical dumping was curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the deregulation of the electric industry, and
eager to compete for business, New York state in 1992 created a
board to expedite permits to build environmentally sound power
plants. More recently, with the economy in New York City booming
and demand for cement and computer chips growing, the Pataki
administration began courting more industry.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, aided by local towns, has extended a range
of tax breaks and support dollars to the companies. For instance,
Besicorp Co., which has proposed the paper recycling plant in
Ulster, says it has been promised a $300 million tax-exempt bond, a
$400,000 technical assistance grant and other benefits, including
employment tax credits and utility discounts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration has tried in particular to lure
microchip-manufacturing plants, by creating four ``shovel-ready''
sites near the river, with licenses and environmental permits
completed, so that a plant can move in quickly when a deal is
struck. No companies have yet committed to the sites.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have used different methods of persuasion. In
Athens, for example, the town board initially opposed Athens
Generating, and its promise to pay only modest taxes. But the town
fathers changed their minds after the power company promised the
town a $3 million ``community benefits grant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring towns of Hudson and Greenport, the dispute
over the St. Lawrence cement plant is a microcosm of the broader
debate.
</P>
<P>
   It has involved young and old, rich and not-so-rich. Dave Eger,
one of 15 children raised to farm the rocky fields here, likes the
idea of the $300 million factory set to be built about a mile from
his spinach and strawberry fields. The new plant in Greenport would
replace a shuttered plant across the river and would produce three
times as much cement as the old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other industry has all been run out,'' Eger, 43, said.
``People around here need jobs, and frankly, I could use the lime
from the cement dust to sweeten my soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door in Hudson, the town that once thrived on the jobs
provided by the defunct Atlas Cement Co., Albert Cook is far less
enthusiastic. Cook, who operated a crane for Atlas for 24 years,
says things have changed since his old company packed up and left.
The glue factory closed down, too. So did the match factory. Even
the junkyards left.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson has been saved over the last decade, he said, by the
people who came up from New York City and turned the
down-at-the-heels town into a hive of antiques shops in restored
brick buildings. He said a new factory would drive the tourists
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a ghost town without them,'' Cook said. But he knows
that not everyone in Hudson agrees. ``My wife feels the cement
plant is a blessing,'' he said sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One issue the two sides have argued over is the matter of jobs,
and both sides freely admit that unemployment has gone down in
Ulster, Greene and Columbia Counties since the early 1990s. In
fact, the Hudson Valley region enjoyed the state's greatest job
growth _ 5.5 percent _ in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in Hudson, for example, wages still lag behind the state's
average by almost 14 percent. And St. Lawrence's starting wage of
$15.50 an hour looks good: Deena Pewtherer, the executive director
of the Columbia County Chamber of Commerce, said that most area
industry paid minimum wage or slightly above.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening its operations in Greenport and Hudson, St.
Lawrence will close the plant it still operates in Catskill. Thus,
while people on the east side of the river may snag jobs, the net
effect for the state will be a loss of 25 jobs, St. Lawrence
officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Eger and others like William First, 54, remain unmoved.
First, who has just sold the family construction business he ran
for 27 years, said the new industry would be a boon to a region
suffering ever since IBM laid off thousands of workers starting in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the taxes,'' First said, ``it's the business
spinoff to the restaurants, the motels, the hotels. The benefits
just go on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The debate over industrialization is fierce, and not apt to end
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's polarizing the community in a really bad way,'' said
Carole Clark, the chef at the Charleston Restaurant in Hudson and a
member of the opposition. ``It's been too easy to portray the
issues in terms of the gentrifiers versus the real people.''

CONSERVATIVE IS DECISIVELY RE-ELECTED IN SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spanish voters gave Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar a decisive victory Sunday, opting for another four years with
a leader whose conservative fiscal policies have steered the
country during a sustained period of economic growth and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's win was far greater than had been predicted in last
week's polls and will give him majority control of the country's
350-seat parliament without having to collaborate with any other
party as he has had to for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   In giving Aznar such a mandate, Spanish voters appeared to be
voting with their wallets and abandoning long-entrenched patterns.
Polls show that most Spaniards are still left-leaning but that a
significant number crossed over to vote for Aznar, apparently
embracing his record and perhaps still disgusted with the numerous
scandals during the 14-year rule of the Socialists who preceded
him.
</P>
<P>
   With 81 percent of the vote counted, Aznar's center-right
Popular Party had captured 44 percent of the vote, or 183 seats. In
1996, when Aznar wrenched power from the Socialists, his party won
only 156 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish people have deepened their confidence in us,''
Aznar said in his victory speech to hundreds of cheering supporters
at his party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But Aznar, who has worked hard to sell his party as a centrist
organization, also reached out to mend fences. ``The attitude of
the government will be open to dialogue with all political and
social groups,'' he said, ``because everyone will need to see Spain
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a particularly sweet victory for Aznar, who was a
virtual unknown when he took office four years ago. At the time
many were doubtful that Aznar, a former tax collector and a
colorless campaigner, would be able to last.
</P>
<P>
   But Spain has flourished under his administration. One of the
few conservatives in power in Europe, Aznar successfully guided
Spain into the European monetary union and set about privatizing
state assets and lowering taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years the country's unemployment rate has
dropped from 23 percent to 15 percent. While the average Spaniard
is still poorer than the average European, the gap is closing.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar campaigned on the strength of this newfound prosperity,
promising that he would continue to trim the state's bloated
bureaucracy, cut taxes and provide a pro-business environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists, who accused Aznar of ``sleight of hand'' and
cronyism, were the major losers in Sunday's vote. Small regional
parties maintained their seats, but the Socialists won only 125
seats, down 16 seats from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after the polls closed, the Socialist candidate for
prime minister, Joaquin Almunia, conceded defeat and resigned as
head of the party, saying it was time for the left to come up with
new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not able to motivate the leftist and progressive
voters enough to win this election and take office,'' he said. ``We
were not able to get our message across.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists tried a French-style coalition with the
Communist-led United Left bloc to try to bring out more leftist
voters. But the attempt was a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, who had 21 seats after the last elections, lost
more than half of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that there is a clear conservative trend in Spain,
economically socially, culturally and politically,'' said the head
of the United Left, Francisco Frutos.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign was hardly gripping. With Spain's economy
predicted to grow at a healthy 3 percent this year, neither Aznar
nor the Socialists proposed big changes. Instead, the candidates
squabbled over marginal issues _ a windfall tax and the rights of
pensioners, for example. Many Spaniards complained of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Early evening figures indicated that turnout was slightly lower
than that of 1996, when about 62 percent of voters cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowing the campaign has been the recent resumption of
violence by the Basque separatist group ETA, which has killed three
people in car bombings since late January.
</P>
<P>
   ETA's political allies urged Basques to boycott the polls to
protest the government's refusal to negotiate demands for an
independent Basque state carved out of northern Spain and
southwestern France.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of security officials was stepped up in
anticipation of possible violence. But by late evening no major
incidents had been reported. Some 3,000 police officers were
guarding 2,600 voting stations in the Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   Glue was poured into door locks at several polling places in the
area, and gasoline bombs were thrown at a government office
overnight in the Basque city of San Sebastian. But no injuries were
reported.

POPE MEETS A JEWISH LINK TO HIS BOYHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also POPE-APOLOGY) 
(mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Visiting his boyhood home in Wadowice, Poland, last
summer, Pope John Paul II nostalgically pointed out to followers
the house where he grew up. Explaining that it had belonged to a
Jewish landlord, the pope said: ``I don't know what happened to
him. I think he died.'' The pope went on to explain that many Jews
in Wadowice ``were killed in ghettos and then in camps.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the 79-year-old pope had a private audience with Ron
Balamuth, a New York psychiatrist and the grandson of Yechiel
Balamuth, who rented rooms to Karol Wojtyla and his father before
World War II, and who died in a concentration camp in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Balamuth, whose father survived the Holocaust and moved to
Israel, has been struggling for years to regain his family's title
to the house, which now serves as a papal museum and is curated by
local nuns.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope mentioned Balamuth's grandfather in Poland last
June, the case became public, but Balamuth has yet to formally
regain title to the house.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants a plaque to be placed at its door, explaining
that it was both the boyhood home of the pope and the property of
the Balamuths, most of whom died in concentration camps. ``There
has not been much movement,'' Balamuth said of his efforts to
persuade Polish officials to recognize his claim and put up a
plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Before last summer, Balamuth had written to the Vatican, seeking
the pope's support, but had received letters from Vatican officials
redirecting him to local officials in Poland. He renewed his
efforts after the pope's public mention of his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Sunday, Stanislaw Kotarba, a member of Wadowice's city
council, said he had received Balamuth's proposed text for a plaque
and deemed it ``very good.'' He said it might be attached to the
house next month.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at the Vatican on Friday, arranged by Aharon Lopez,
the Israeli ambassador to the Holy See, and Jerzy Kluger, a Jewish
boyhood friend of the pope who survived the war and lives in Rome,
did not deal with Balamuth's legal claims. Instead, Balamuth said
he requested the meeting to cull the pope's memories of his
relatives before the war. Balamuth said the pope lit up when he
showed him an old photograph of the storefront beneath the house,
and said he remembered it well, pointing out the local church in a
corner of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him about my father, who died in 1969, whether he got
into mischief,'' Balamuth recalled. ``He looked at me and said,
`No, he was a good boy.' He was almost reproachful, as if saying,
`Don't be disrespectful to your parents.'''
</P>
<P>
   Balamuth said the pope stood and held his hand throughout their
15-minute discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very moving,'' he said. He said he was struck by the
pope's physical fragility, and also by his determination to keep
working. ``When you see him close up,'' Balamuth said, ``he is so
single-mindedly focused on what he seeks to accomplish.''

POOR CHILDREN IN DETROIT ENTER THE COMPUTER AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Small hands shot up when Daniel S. Varner asked his
after-school class of mostly poor, mostly African-American children
here, ``Who can tell me what the Internet is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a big dictionary,'' said Jordan Nichols, 9. ``A new
way of communication,'' offered Stacey Blair, 12. And across the
room, Terrell Brazier, 13, said, ``It's a superhighway to anything
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   To these children, and others like them who grow up poor, the
Internet is all that and much more. It can be a path to the future,
all right, but its effect may be more profound on those who do not
know how to use it. With more and more jobs requiring computer and
Internet literacy, experts fear that children not exposed to those
skills will be left further behind in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Detroit lawyers who wanted to keep that from
happening have chucked their law careers to start an unusual
program here that helps poor children join the information age.
They draw hundreds of children into after-school sports leagues,
then offer free computer training. The children learn not only how
to use the computers, but also how to take them apart, fix them and
put them together again. The trophy they bring home is a
hand-me-down computer _ there are enough for everyone on the sports
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew kids needed the character that comes with team sports,
and we knew they needed the tools of the future that come with
access to technology,'' said Michael F. Tenbusch, who founded the
nonprofit group Think Detroit with Varner in 1997. Early on, the
group organized sports leagues for children.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the group began setting up 17 computer
laboratories in churches, schools and nonprofit agencies _ enough
to serve 2,000 people last year _ filling them with used computers
donated by area companies. But it became clear that closing the gap
in computer access would require reaching homes.
</P>
<P>
   So in November, Think Detroit switched strategies and began the
Balls and Bytes program _ combining baseball, soccer and basketball
leagues with computer classes for children over 10. The group has
donated about 30 computers and plans to give away 200 more this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Blair, a seventh grader at Westside Christian Academy,
said that when she joined the group's baseball team, she didn't
know she would also get a computer. spends about an hour a day on
the computer, and she came back to Varner's class to learn how to
use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Her first computer classes were intimidating. ``I can't do
this,'' Stacey remembered thinking. After the instructor took the
machines apart and ``showed us which spaces were for the
motherboard and the cards,'' she said, ``then I was like, this is
pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show children like Stacey are at risk of being
bystanders inthe digital age. Although virtually the same
percentage of all children have some access to computers at school,
poor and African-American children are far less likely to use a
home computer, according to a poll conducted last month by National
Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the computer and the Internet can be such an important
set of skills to be marketable for the economy,'' said Mollyann
Brodie, a vice president of the Kaiser foundation. ``Any digital
divide will further exacerbate the gaps we've always had in our
country between the haves and have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is a good example, since it is the nation's poorest big
city. Many poor children here will not go to college. In the past,
they might have had a Ford factory in their futures, at best. Now
few workers with only a high school diploma can pass the screening
tests auto makers require.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers say the gap may be even more acute for poor
people who are already out of school and have had little contact
with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Carris M. Carey, a social worker at Focus: Hope, a nonprofit
organization in Detroit that trains poor people to work in the auto
industry, said, ``The kids who are in the younger generation _ the
18-to-25 range _ have had some type of exposure to computers,''
even if it is not as much as the children of wealthy families have.
But, Carey said, older poor people are seldom familiar with
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That observation was echoed in the new national poll, Brodie
said. ``The gaps by income are just profound,'' she said. The poll
found that 56 percent of those in the 18-40 age group earning less
than $30,000 a year had a home computer, while 87 percent of those
earning more than $50,000 a year had one.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools here are struggling to keep up with their
counterparts in school districts that are better off. All 263
schools in the district have now been wired for computer access,
but not all schools have computers, particularly up-to-date ones,
to attach to the wires, said Stan Childress, a spokesman for the
Detroit Public Schools. ``None of our schools have computers in
every classroom, and that is a goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the secondhand computers from Think Detroit will help
close the gap between technology haves and have-nots in two ways
First, more children each month are being given computers to take
home. Second, they are teaching older family members how to use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Brazier, a sixth grader at George Crockett Academy, a
charter school here, brought home one of the Think Detroit
computers after playing baseball and basketball on one of the teams
set up by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   His mother works at a Target store and an older brother is a
security guard, so when he got the computer home, ``I had to teach
them, my mom and my brother, how to use it,'' Troy said during a
break from Varner's Internet class. ``I'm still trying to learn a
little more.''

GREER LEAVES CAMP AFTER INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Left-fielder Rusty Greer joined relievers
John Wetteland and Mike Venafro on the Rangers' list of
exasperating injuries this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Greer returned to Texas yesterday afternoon after aggravating
his injured right ankle during his first-inning at-bat in the
Rangers' 7-5 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Charlotte County
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan for Greer to be examined today by Dr. Charles
Cook and do not expect him to play again until Wednesday at the
earliest. Greer hung his cleat in the batter's box when attempting
to run to first base and aggravated his inflamed ankle. Manager
Johnny Oates removed Greer from the lineup after the at-bat and
replaced him with Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the doctor's hands now,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland continues to be slowed by significant tightness in his
right groin after throwing Friday, and did not throw yesterday.
Venafro (ligament strain, left middle finger) threw off the mound
for the fourth time in eight days. _ Johnny Paul
Catalanotto shines
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Frank Catalanotto hit a home run yesterday and
also made a terrific diving catch on Michael Cuddyer's bases-loaded
line drive in the ninth inning. He realizes the defensive play
might have been more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I can do defensively is only going to help me,''
Catalanotto said. ``I know and I think they know if given a chance,
I can hit. Anything I do defensively is only going to help my
chances of getting playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto, acquired from the Detroit Tigers in the Juan
Gonzalez trade, is a utility infielder who came to the Rangers with
a reputation of being a good hitter but needing to improve
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming down here, I said to myself, I've got to impress
somebody defensively and do a lot of extra work defensively,''
Catalanotto said. ``It's on my mind. I don't put pressure on
myself, but I have to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates, ``He can swing the bat, he hasn't
hurt himself defensively and he runs pretty good.''
No platoon at third
</P>
<P>
   Oates acknowledged that third base is up for grabs. He also said
a platoon is not an option even though Mike Lamb is a left-handed
hitter and Tom Evans is right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're locked into playing one position, it's tough to
platoon in today's game when you need 11 or 12 pitchers,'' Oates
said. _ T.R. Sullivan
Early retirement
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league outfielder Antwon Rollins, the Rangers'
fourth-round selection during the 1998 draft, shocked those in the
organization yesterday by announcing his retirement six days before
his 20th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he never really wanted to play baseball,'' said
Reid Nichols, the Rangers' director for player development. ``He
said he never really had a dream of playing in the major leagues.''

CYCLONES BREEZE BY SOONERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Marcus Fizer snipped the final cord from the
net and waved to a legion of screaming Iowa State fans lingering in
the afterglow of the Cyclones' victory in yesterday's title game of
the Big 12 basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath him, the school's cardinal mascot outfit busily whisked
a broom across the floor at Kemper Arena, symbolizing the Cyclones'
sweep through a tournament field littered with Top 20 teams. As he
peered up at the scoreboard one last time to confirm that his team
had, in fact, beaten Oklahoma, 70-58, to seal the Big 12's
automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament, Iowa State coach Larry
Eustachy had a flashback.
</P>
<P>
   He reflected to last season, when the Cyclones were a .500 team
and not invited to any postseason tournaments, much less
characterized as ``a team that can go all the way to the Final
Four,'' as Oklahoma forward Eduardo Najera suggested yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to put the Cyclones' 29-4 season into historical
perspective, Eustachy offered a nod toward the reigning Super Bowl
champions from St. Louis, who went from worst in their division to
best in the NFL in a one-year span.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-every 20 years story. We're right up there
with the Rams. I really believe that,'' Eustachy said. ``It's
phenomenal what these kids have done. Even with all they've
accomplished, they keep surprising me at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Add yesterday's title cakewalk to Eustachy's latest list of
pleasant surprises. The Cyclones dominated from the outset,
sprinting to a double-digit lead midway through the first half and
maintaining control thereafter. Eventually, Iowa State built a
51-31 lead before Oklahoma (26-6) rallied to close the final
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 12-point game, but it was never close. They took it
to us,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``Iowa State proved
today what they've proved all year. They're the best team in this
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both teams were playing their third game in three days,
Iowa State had the fresher set of legs throughout. The Cyclones
outscored the Sooners, 14-0, in fast-break points before
intermission and regularly got the ball inside for layups to Fizer
(22 points, nine rebounds) when forced to run a half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma shot just 34.9 percent, which Sampson credited in part
to fatigue from an overtime victory on Friday, coupled with an
emotional triumph over rival Texas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids aren't lawn mowers. You don't just pull their
string and they start running on horsepower,'' Sampson said. ``It
affects some teams more than others and that definitely affected
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones took full advantage, with Fizer, Michael Nurse (14
points, six rebounds) and Jamaal Tinsley (13 points, six rebounds)
doing most of the damage in helping Iowa State become the first
school in Big 12 history to sweep both the men's and women's
tournaments in the same season. The Iowa State women beat Texas,
75-65, in Saturday's title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a great weekend to be a Cyclone,'' OU's Sampson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, said Nurse, who did little to downplay the
Final Four hopes seeping out of the ISU locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Sampson had predicted his team would ``be a handful''
for any NCAA opponent, Nurse smiled and offered a correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're two handfuls,'' Nurse said.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, they're more basketball team than any of their
Big 12 peers could handle. In the regular season or in Kansas City.

PALMEIRO SAYS OFFENSE STILL FORMIDABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The demise of the Rangers' offense could
be greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers parted company with right-fielder Juan Gonzalez and
third baseman Todd Zeile during the winter, but what remains of the
heart of their order compares favorably to any in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   Left-fielder Rusty Greer, catcher Ivan Rodriguez, first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro and designated hitter Lee Stevens combined for 443
runs batted in last season, the second most by any four players on
an AL roster this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that we scored 945 runs last year,'' said
Palmeiro, who accounted for 148 of the runners who crossed the
plate. ``We were so good offensively, and there's a chance that
we'll be as good this year. Even if we're not as good, we're still
going to be very good. We shouldn't lose much.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's bases that statement on this among many other facts:
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Rangers' order _ left fielder Rusty Greer,
catcher Ivan Rodriguez, Palmeiro and designated hitter Lee Stevens
_ remains among the American League's best.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Cleveland Indians, who scored a major-league-best 1,005
runs in 1999, claimed a more prolific collection of four run
producers. Manny Ramirez, Richie Sexson, Jim Thome and David
Justice combined for 477 RBI last season.
</P>
<P>
   The projected fearsome foursomes in Oakland (Jason Giambi, John
Jaha, Matt Stairs and Ben Grieve), Tampa Bay (Greg Vaughn, Fred
McGriff, Vinny Castilla and Jose Canseco) and Toronto (Carlos
Delgado, Tony Batista, Raul Mondesi and Darrin Fletcher) did not
produce as many runs as the aforementioned Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's expectations appear rather bold considering the
Rangers' lineup no longer includes two significant cogs from the
major leagues' second-most prolific offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers traded Gonzalez to the Tigers in November for fear
of losing the two-time American League Most Valuable Player as a
free agent after this season. Zeile snubbed the franchise during
the 11th hour of negotiations and signed as a free agent with the
New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   What did the Rangers lose?
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez averaged 140 runs batted in per season during his final
four years with the Rangers. Zeile, who served primarily as the No.
6 hitter in his only full season with the Rangers, averaged 100 RBI
the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the departures of Gonzalez and Zeile, ``there's nobody
in here panicking,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ruben Mateo and right fielder Gabe Kapler cannot
be expected to replace the run production of Gonzalez and Zeile,
but ``it's important that Ruben and Gabe are able to provide us
with some offensive help, and I'm confident that will be the
case,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers don't expect to be so offensive-dependent this
season with the additions of left-handers Justin Thompson, Kenny
Rogers and Darren Oliver to their rotation, and Oates also
anticipates better defensive play. A significant improvement in the
Rangers' team earned-run average, say approximately a run, would
reduce the offensive burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 162 fewer runs we would have to score,'' Stevens said.
``That's 162 RBI we might not need.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Rangers are expected to score their share of runs with
a lineup that includes Greer, Rodriguez, Palmeiro and Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried at all,'' Palmeiro said. ``Our offense is
going to be good. It's going to be good enough to win.''

BUSH RIDICULES GORE ON ISSUE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALCOA, Tenn. _ Declaring that Vice President Al Gore would ``say
anything to get elected,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ridiculed
Gore on Sunday for stating that reform of the nation's campaign
finance system would be a centerpiece of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has repeatedly sought to turn the Clinton
administration's ethical lapses into an albatross around the vice
president's neck, pounced on Gore's decision to champion more
restrictions on the role of money in politics, which Gore disclosed
in an interview that appeared on Sunday in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that when he saw the article, ``I wasn't sure if it
was an April Fool's edition, or not, of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe that he is going to make campaign funding
reform a cornerstone of his campaign,'' Bush said at a news
conference in Plant City, Fla., where he was campaigning at the
state's annual strawberry festival before flying to a rally in
Tennessee, Gore's home state. Florida, Tennessee, Texas and several
other Southern states hold primaries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, it was not all that long ago that he went to a
Buddhist temple to raise money,'' Bush said. ``One of his close
friends was indicted and convicted of fund-raising excesses. I
think the vice president is somebody who will say anything to get
elected. At least that's my interpretation of how he handles
things. I look forward _ the more he talks about campaign funding
reform, the better off it will be for my campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, chief strategist for the Bush campaign, in an
appearance Sunday on the ``Fox News Sunday'' program, said,
referring to a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in
California: ``This is more than just a little teensy-weensy
mistake. Sometimes Vice President Gore has a big problem telling
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buddhist temple involved violations of law,'' Rove said.
``Fifty-five thousand dollars in illegal contributions were
funneled through that fund-raiser, and the vice president has
consistently not told the truth about his involvement in that
fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   In the interview in The New York Times on Sunday, Gore said he
had learned from his involvement in past campaign finance problems
and would vigorously try to change the system. He also said that
Bush, who has twice been elected governor of Texas, lacked the
experience to be president.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring over campaign finance reflected the extent to which
Sen. John McCain's candidacy in the Republican primary is affecting
the general election. Both sides are eager to court McCain's
supporters, many of whom indicated that they were attracted to the
Arizona Senator because of his campaign against what he deemed the
increasingly corrupting influence of money in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore appears to hope that by acknowledging his involvement in
past fund-raising situations and proclaiming that he was redoubling
his efforts to change the system, he can head off Bush's attempt to
portray him as unprincipled. At the news conference on Sunday, Bush
emphasized his response: nothing that Gore proposes _ and no amount
of mea culpas _ can erase the taint of the Clinton administration's
ethics record.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore referred often to McCain in his comments, seeking to
cast himself as a McCain-style reformer, Bush on Sunday did not
mention his former rival once. In fact, Bush promoted his own
campaign finance proposal, which has been greeted coolly by
advocates for tougher rules, only when asked about it by a
reporter. Aides said later that Bush wanted to keep the focus on
the vice president's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Gore favors prohibiting the largely unregulated
donations to political parties known as soft money. Bush supports a
ban on soft money donations from corporations and unions, but not
from individuals. A soft money ban sponsored in part by McCain has
failed in Congress because of opposition from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing his campaign finance proposal, which also
includes more disclosure of donations, Bush quickly returned to the
theme of Gore's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign funding reform starts with having people who are
going to obey the laws that exist,'' Bush said. ``That is the best
campaign funding reform immediately _ is to obey laws that are on
the books and have an attorney general who will fully prosecute the
laws on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also brushed aside Gore's criticism in the Times interview
that Bush was not prepared to be president. Gore cited as evidence
Bush's economic plan, which Gore said was based on a ``risky tax
scheme'' that would ``threaten our prosperity.'' The vice president
also questioned whether Bush was proposing tax breaks for wealthy
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush characterized those comments as typical of someone with a
Washington mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president, I think, is probably going to make the
case that since he spent so much time in Washington, D.C., that
only he can be the president,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to make the
case that there is life outside of Washington. That being in the
business world is part of an experience necessary to become a chief
executive officer. Being the governor of the second biggest state
in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president obviously believes that all wisdom and
knowledge emanates out of Washington,'' Bush said. `` I don't think
that. I think all wisdom and all knowledge emanates from the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas J. Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign,
contended that Bush would be foolish to campaign on his record as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that George Bush is much of an expert on wisdom
and knowledge,'' Hattaway said. ``Under his so-called leadership,
Texas is one of the most polluted states in the country and one of
the worst places to raise a child. That is not the kind of
experience that America is looking for on the national level.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hattaway also promoted Gore's proposal to Bush to forswear soft
money donations, withdraw all television and radio advertising and
hold debates twice a week. Bush has rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   On another issue, Bush said he was considering supporting a move
by some Republicans in Congress to repeal a 4.3-cent increase in
the gasoline tax passed in President Clinton's first term. The
Republicans have sought to put the administration on the defensive
over the recent rise in gasoline prices, which could turn into an
important political issue in the high gasoline-consumption summer
vacation season.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he agreed with Clinton that the government should not
dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to depress
prices. Still, Bush excoriated the administration for failing to
convince oil-producing countries to export more oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are countries with which we should have enormous amounts
of capital,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, at an airport rally outside Knoxville, Bush
received an endorsement from Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who had
been among the few congressional Republicans to back McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took a few geographic jibes at Gore, who moved his
campaign headquarters to Tennessee from Washington last year when
it seemed that he was stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that Al is in Texas today,'' Bush said. ``I
wanted to go to his home to campaign today as well, but I couldn't
get reservations to Washington, D.C.''

GUNMAN IN IRAN SERIOUSLY WOUNDS A TOP REFORM FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ A close associate of Iran's reformist
president and one of the main organizers of the reformers'
landslide victory in parliamentary elections last month was shot
and critically wounded Sunday by a gunman who dismounted from the
back of a motorcycle in central Tehran and shot him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman and the driver escaped aboard the motorcycle into
heavy traffic, but the intelligence minister said later _ without
elaborating _ that the government knew the assailants' identities.
</P>
<P>
   The attack raised new doubts about the ability of reformers to
carry out their program of broader democracy and respect for human
rights in the face of bitter opposition from entrenched stalwarts
of the rigid system of Islamic rule established after the shah's
overthrow in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Saeed Hajjarian, a 47-year-old newspaper editor who
is a key member of the inner circle of President Mohammad Khatami,
was reported to be fighting for his life Sunday night with a bullet
lodged in his neck. Television reports showed him lying in the
intensive-care ward of Sina hospital, on a life-support system,
surrounded by doctors, relatives and political associates.
</P>
<P>
   News reports gave conflicting reports of Hajjarian's condition,
with some doctors being quoted in Western news agency accounts as
saying he had regained consciousness. But other reports
contradicted this, including one that quoted the senior surgeon
assigned to his care, Dr. Mohammad Reza Zafarqandi, as saying he
remained in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a serious possibility of brain damage,'' Zafarqandi
said, according to a report by the BBC's Tehran correspondent,
carried on the network's Web site. ``We are hopeful, but his
condition is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Reformers won about three-quarters of the 290 seats in
Parliament in the election on Feb. 18. But the reform cause faces a
bitter uphill struggle against hard-liners who control the armed
forces, the police, the judiciary and the courts in Iran, a country
with an overwhelmingly young population of 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   The reform movement under Khatami, who is a Muslim cleric, has
registered a series of election landslides since his triumph in the
presidential vote in 1997, encouraging many in Iran and elsewhere
to hope that the Islamic system can be peacefully reformed from
within. But Sunday's shooting is only one in a series of violent
attacks on reformers that have suggested that some in the hard-line
camp would prefer to settle the political future in a test of
force, however catastrophic that might be for Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who was often criticized in his own camp for treading
too cautiously, abandoned his reserve after being told of the
shooting. During a provincial tour he condemned the attack in angry
terms suggesting that his patience, too, may be wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorists resort to such acts because they and their cause
have been isolated, and because the people hate them,'' he said.
``Their aim is to wreak vengeance and wreck all hope of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence minister, Ali Yunesi, gave no indication of who
the assailants were or what their motive might be. Elsewhere in the
government, in ministries that have come under the control of
reformers, there appeared to be no doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hajjarian was the target of opponents of freedom,'' the
Ministry of Islamic Guidance and Culture, once headed by Khatami,
said in a statement. ``The blind men who carried out this attack do
not know that democracy in Iran cannot be stopped by bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hospital, crowds held aloft copies of a Tehran
newspaper with a banner headline proclaiming ``Hajjarian
Terrorized!'' A number of reformist politicians, newspaper editors
and intellectuals gathered at the victim's bedside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who chose Hajjarian as an assassination target knew they
would create a crisis in the country by doing so,'' Ali Rabiei,
secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, nominally the
country's top security body, said outside the hospital, according
to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This attack, whoever is behind it, was organized by those who
are not happy with the election,'' said Mohammad Soltanifar, editor
of the Iran News, an English-language newspaper that has strongly
backed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The Iran Islamic Participation Front, the political coalition
that carried the reformers to victory in the parliamentary
election, issued a statement that pointed at conservative leaders
who have made or acquiesced in calls for violence against
reformers. ``Those who have used public platforms to call for
violence and killing must know that they cannot bend the will of
their people to reach their goals,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative clerics who have resisted any diminution of the
system of clerical autocracy bequeathed by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, leader of the 1979 revolution, struck back with
allegations of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Khomeini's successor as the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, who has consistently tried to block reforms, sent a
representative to the hospital to offer condolences, but newspapers
controlled by the hard-liners attributed the attempted
assassination on the hard-liners' traditional bogeymen, foreigners
and ``anti-Islamic elements'' out to discredit the system.

</P>
<P>
   The attack on Hajjarian, a member of the Tehran city council,
came as he entered the municipal headquarters. Witnesses quoted by
the news agencies said they had seen a man dismount from the rear
passenger seat of a motorcycle, approach Hajjarian, and fire twice
at almost point-blank range, aiming at the victim's temple. But the
gunman's hand was shaking, according to Mahmoud Ali Tabatabaei,
another municipal councilor, who was just feet away at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said one bullet had hit Hajjarian's left cheek, while
another had grazed his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Associates noted that Hajjarian, in election speeches and in the
reformist newspaper that he publishes, Sobh-e Emrooz, had been one
of the most outspoken critics of those trying to shore up clerical
authoritarianism. Like many others in Khatami's inner circle,
Hajjarian was himself once an supporter of uncompromising Islamic
rule, and thus came to be seen by the hard-liners as an apostate.
</P>
<P>
   From 1984 to 1989 he was a deputy minister in the intelligence
ministry, one of the bastions of Khomeini's rule. Like other former
hard-liners, he turned to the reform movement when he was excluded
from power during the presidency of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani,
who curbed some of the worst excesses of clerical rule, but is
widely seen now as an ally of the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not run in the election, Hajjarian had acted
since then as a sort of informal parliamentary whip. Just over a
week ago he urged newly elected reformers to act swiftly on laws to
curb the conservatives. ``If we're not active, the people will say
we were incompetent, or worse, they will say we didn't really want
changes,'' he said. ``In that event, we will lose all legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1997 election, reformers' concerns about
assassination have focused on Khatami, who is notoriously lax about
his personal security.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998 the reform movement was virtually paralyzed
when five well-known opponents of clerical authoritarianism _
scholars and writers, and a politician and his wife _ were brutally
slain. Under pressure from Khatami, the intelligence ministry
admitted early in 1999 that the killers were ``rogue elements''
from within the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But the ministry's confession only served to underscore that the
security agencies believe that they can act as they please under
the protection of the hard-liners, who take the position that
Khamenei, and those loyal to him, are above the Constitution and
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the disclosures about intelligence-ministry death
squads, have been published in Hajjarian's newspaper. After the
attack Sunday, some of his associates pointed to the fact that
eyewitnesses described the motorcycle used in the attack as a BMW
of the kind restricted by law to the Iranian army and police.

 &HT;    Improbable SEC run ends in Hog heaven
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The chant began with 6.6 seconds left: ``No-LAN!
No-LAN!'' By then, Nolan Richardson was already beaming, already
clapping his hands. In the giddy afterglow, he embraced his wife,
Rose. And then the Arkansas coach began one of the most improbable
ladder climbs of his career, to cut down a most treasured net.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only thing I haven't won,'' Richardson said after
his young Razorbacks won their fourth game in four days and
Arkansas' first SEC Tournament championship with a 75-67 victory
over Auburn Sunday in the Georgia Dome. The Hogs (19-14) also
earned an automatic NCAA Tournament bid, in the only manner they
could have qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won everything else,'' said Richardson. ``When we won the
national championship, I was happy. We won the national junior
college championship, I was very happy. We won the NIT, I was
happy. But I don't think I've ever been as happy inside for a group
of guys that young, that went through all the trials and
tribulations of basketball and family death and all the talk. And
then came over here and put all that behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hogs did, in the building where they'd lost the 1995 and '99
SEC finals to Kentucky. With tournament MVP Brandon Dean scoring 22
points, Arkansas joined Auburn's champs as the only SEC teams to
win four games and the conference tournament. In so doing, the Hogs
ended Auburn's own inspirational run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was proud of our team every time we played,'' said coach
Cliff Ellis, whose Tigers (23-9) lost their last three
regular-season games after Chris Porter was declared ineligible but
upset Florida and survived South Carolina in overtime en route to
the final. ''This weekend was a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   One that should benefit Auburn in the NCAA Tournament, although
the Tigers dropped to a No. 7 seed. One of six SEC teams to receive
at-large bids, Auburn will play Creighton in the first round of the
Midwest Regional at Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, meanwhile, received a No. 11 seed in the South and
will meet Miami at Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks won't enter the NCAAs as they did the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wrote us off,'' said Dean, who had 14 of his
career-high 22 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody expected us to be here,'' said Joe Johnson, the
electrifying freshman swingman who had 10 of his 12 points in the
second half and joined Dean on the All-Tournament team. ''We had
nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet enough energy to win for the fourth time in four days. ''I
think a couple of guys, their legs were tired, including myself,''
said Johnson. ''But we just had to suck it up and go.''
</P>
<P>
   With 1:29 left in the half, Auburn led 32-23. Then Arkansas
closed with a rush, beginning in typical Hog fashion. ''It was
created by a turnover,'' said Ellis. ''All of a sudden,
bap-bap-bap! They're back.''
</P>
<P>
   One of 17 Auburn turnovers, it led to four straight Arkansas'
points. The last two came on Johnson's pullup jumper, his first
points of the game cutting it to 32-27 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second half, we asked them to get into a streetfight,''
said Richardson. ''We were playing a team that was boxing. We're a
streetfighting team.''
</P>
<P>
   His streetfighting men responded. Johnson scored six of
Arkansas' first eight points after halftime. Dean gave the Hogs
their first lead at 37-36, then jammed over Mamadou N'diaye. Auburn
later regained a 58-54 lead on back-to-back 3-pointers by Jay
Heard. But when Johnson's banked foul-line jumper put Arkansas up
to stay 63-62, it also kick-started a decisive 10-2 run by an
undersized champion that was out-rebounded 41-20.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas has but one senior and ample reasons to rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Gipson, who scored 10 of his 14 points in the second half,
lost his father in a Jan. 13 car accident. Backup Charles Tatum's
cousin also died in a car crash and his grandfather recently died.
Dean sprained both ankles this season and also had a stress
fracture in his shin. Johnson was academically ineligible for the
first 10 games, then lost his grandmother a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   All that made this unexpected win that much sweeter for
Richardson and his little piggies. ''I was happy, real happy,'' he
said. ''There's not many coaches in this country that are gonna
walk in here and win four games in a row. Not in the SEC. I've
brought teams over here that were good, real good. So to win the
SEC tournament with a bunch of puppies is unbelievable. I think
it'll go down as one of the all-time things that happened in my
career.''

IN SIX SOUTHERN STATES, PRIMARIES HAVE NO MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was supposed to be the Southern Super Tuesday, the
day when the South finally muscled its way into the primary
calendar and showed itself as a fearsome voting bloc. But Mike
Francis now has a somewhat different name for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it Stupid Tuesday,'' said Francis, chairman of
Louisiana's Republican Party, referring to this week's Southern
primaries. ``The taxpayers of Louisiana are going to spend about $4
million so that maybe 40,000 people can show up to vote in a
meaningless primary. Isn't that ridiculous?''
</P>
<P>
   The primary season effectively ended last week, when the leading
challengers in the Republican and Democratic parties dropped out
after losing on the real Super Tuesday, leaving a pair of
uncontested races for the nominations. But to the disgust of many
in the South, the already scheduled presidential primaries in
Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas will
still go on, even though they no longer serve any practical
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, a formal election is still necessary to select
the delegates the state will send to the national party conventions
this summer. Like a lopsided baseball game that must still be
played to the ninth inning, the voting must go on, even if no one
is watching.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are that Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al
Gore would have won all the primaries anyway, even before Sen. John
McCain and former Sen. Bill Bradley dropped out last Thursday. Both
challengers had essentially written off the home region of the two
front-runners, making little effort to organize in any of the six
states.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, polls already showed Bush and Gore with towering
margins in most of the states, which was one reason the challengers
decided not to embarrass themselves further. A series of
Mason-Dixon polls showed that McCain was behind Bush by 48 points
in Oklahoma, 56 points in Mississippi and 69 points in Texas,
Bush's home state. Gore's margins over Bradley were even larger.
</P>
<P>
   McCain might have done somewhat better in Florida, even though
Bush's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, had pushed the state party into
overdrive for him. Richard Scher, a political scientist at the
University of Florida, said McCain would have done well in some
sections of the state, such as Pasco County, north of Tampa, which
has a large population of retired military personnel and recently
became mostly Republican for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But because of Florida's closed primary system, McCain would
still have lost, Scher said. Democrats who might have wanted to
cross over and vote for him would have had to switch their party
registration more than six weeks ago, when the McCain phenomenon
was still young.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern primary day was established in 1988 to increase the
region's clout in the nominating process and give a boost to
conservative candidates, but it has rarely worked out as planned.
In 1992, Georgia moved ahead of the pack by a week, in a successful
attempt by Gov. Zell Miller to assist Bill Clinton. After that, so
many states began leapfrogging the South that the second Tuesday in
March, which once sounded relatively early, became pointlessly late
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana tried to buck the system earlier this year and hold
caucuses before Iowa, but the national Republican Party would not
hear of it. Several Florida state legislators are sponsoring a bill
to move up the state's primary, but there is a logical limit to how
many states can move themselves in front of other states.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, both parties are considering drastic changes to the
haphazard primary system. One popular proposal that has been put
forward by the National Association of Secretaries of State would
set up a rotating system of regional primaries beginning in 2004.
Under the plan, Eastern states would vote in March, Southern states
in April, the Midwest in May and the West in June. In 2008, the
Southern states would go first, and the rotation would continue
every four years. New Hampshire and Iowa would still be allowed to
go first because of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal would allow smaller states to go first and
larger ones later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the Southern states will have to sit back and
watch as only the most faithful of party loyalists go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is making a swing through the region, and there are
scattered local races on the ballots that may draw a few crowds.
But the reasons to go to the polls are less than compelling, and
turnout is expected to be microscopic.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeppie Barbour, the former mayor of Yazoo City, Miss., and
a longtime Republican, has decided he has something better to do
than vote in his party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be voting in the Democratic primary,'' he said, a
decision that may come as a shock to his brother, Haley Barbour,
the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and an
adviser to Bush. ``There's somebody I need to vote for in the levee
board election.''

DODGERS' PEREZ CHARGED WITH DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Carlos Perez's on-field problems spilled off
the field once again when he was arrested and charged with driving
under the influence late Saturday night, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who pitched earlier in the day against St. Louis in
Jupiter, Fla., was arrested at 11:03 p.m. He spent eight hours in
county jail before posting $500 bond, according to a statement
released by the Vero Beach Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 29, was on his way back from dinner at the Riverside
Cafe, police said, when he stopped at a traffic light at the
beachfront intersection of Ocean Drive and Beachland Boulevard. He
put his car in park and fell asleep, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A concerned motorist called police after witnessing the car go
through a complete cycle of the traffic light without moving,
according to the police statement.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, still owed $12.6 million over the next two seasons, was
released from jail approximately 7 a.m. and was in uniform by 10
a.m. for the day's workout. Afterward, Perez met with Los Angeles
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone and managing partner and CEO
Bob Daly for approximately 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not happy,'' Daly said. ``He said he had a
couple of drinks, got to the light and fell asleep. I'm very happy
that nobody got hurt and nothing else happened, but it's not
exactly what I would have liked to have with my eggs this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly said Perez ``seems to be remorseful about (the incident).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's not going to do it again. We'll see. I don't
know. I want to get the rest of the facts,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's legal limit for driving under the influence is .08.
Perez failed a field sobriety test but refused a breathalyzer test,
according to Vero Beach Police Lt. Kevin Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the officer's opinion, he was impaired and over the legal
limit,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The arresting officer, Charles McFarland, could not be reached
for comment. Perez was charged with a first-degree misdemeanor,
Martin said. The maxium penalty is one year in prison and a $1,000
fine. Martin also said Florida law mandates the suspension of
Perez's driver's license for six months for failing to take a
breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me if they want to do it (administer a
breathalyzer), if I say no,'' Perez said. ``Nobody got hurt, nobody
got hit. I was sleeping at the light, and that's it. I was just
kind of tired. I don't think this kind of stuff is going to happen.
Only thing I can say is I'll be more careful next time and hope it
doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to upset my mind. I'm still working hard and
I'm not going to keep nothing in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing date was not set. However, Adam Katz, Perez's agent,
is scheduled to fly here today to meet with the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake,'' Perez said. ``Everyone can make a mistake.
It's the first time it happened, but I can guarantee it's not going
to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said that since he doesn't know all the facts of the
incident, and with litigation looming, it would be unfair to
address how this affects Perez's status on the Dodgers. Perez
remains in the hunt for a spot in the starting rotation, but team
officials were steaming about this incident.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson opted not to comment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a another in a series of off-the-field incidents
involving the well-compensated Perez, who is trying to rebound from
the worst year of his career. He was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA last
season, and has a 14.40 ERA this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began for Perez the moment he was acquired from the
Montreal Expos in a July 1998 trade. He made his first start with
cotton stuck in his nose, the remnants of a one-car collision he
was involved in days before the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Perez missed a start in Montreal when he
mysteriously injured his knee. Perez said he hurt it shagging balls
on the hard Olympic Stadium turf, but Malone acknowledged hearing a
story that Perez was injured the night before his start when he
fell and banged his knee during a night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the infamous scene of Perez repeatedly bashing a
water cooler with a bat in the Dodgers' dugout after a poor outing
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers management also was not happy about Perez swearing near
spectators after making poor pitches during spring training games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that there is even a hint of something
improper occurred,'' Malone said. ``He needs to show us he's
serious and make a commitment for us to help him return to the form
of old when he was one of the best left-handed pitchers in the
National League. We're there to help him, not only as a pitcher but
as a person, but he's going to have to make a decision this is what
he wants. We're here to help.''

A CHANGING COMMUNIST PARTY TRIES TO WOO CAPITALIST RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The movie theater was plastered with posters for coming
films from Hollywood, but inside there was no attraction for Yuliya
Lysova and Dasha Yegorova, both 18. A decade after the Soviet
collapse, they were being forced, on a school day, to attend a
Young People for Zyuganov rally featuring the Communist Party's
candidate for president, Gennadi Zyuganov. ``Our teacher told us to
come here instead of classes,'' said Lysova, glancing at her watch,
then at the door of the auditorium, trying to determine whether the
coast was clear for a fast exit. ``It was obligatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Yegorova said: ``We heard from our grandmothers and grandfathers
what life was like under the Communists, and we do not want to
repeat it. We are against communism and against Zyuganov.''
</P>
<P>
   The March 26 election to pick a new president from a field
dominated by Acting President Vladimir Putin finds Russia's
Communists again in a swelter about the pasting they are about to
receive and what to do about their future.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' prospects for attracting new members are not
necessarily hopeless. They are out in force this spring,
campaigning across Russia, and in opinion polls Zyuganov leads all
other candidates opposing Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But while many young people at the rally listened attentively _
even cheered _ during several hours of communist proselytizing, the
negative reactions of those like Lysova and Yegorova revealed the
strong generational bias against the party of Lenin, though he
would scarcely recognize the party today.
</P>
<P>
   The organization that dominated life here during 70 years of
Soviet rule is an object of ridicule in much of Russia, and what
remains of the Communists' strength _ though still considerable _
has been sundered by defections and infighting among hard-liners,
nationalists and those trying to craft a more centrist model based
on the social democratic parties of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 19, 12 days before Boris Yeltsin stunned Russia by
announcing his resignation, the Communists won 24 percent of the
vote in elections for the Duma, the lower house of parliament,
finishing just ahead of the centrists backing Putin, then the prime
minister. Although the grand alliance on the left, comprising
Communists, agrarians and Stalinists, lost the majority it had
enjoyed since 1995, the Communists are enough of a force that Putin
needed their help to prevent his closest rivals from becoming
parliamentary speaker. And that deal handed the Communists enough
chairmanships of influential parliamentary committees to ensure
that they remain something of a force, even if they cannot regain
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin delivered a big blow to the Communists because he
resigned and turned over power to a young guy who is relatively
normal,'' said Alexander Gelman, a playwright, social commentator
and friend of Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Yeltsin resigned,'' Gelman continued, ``it was possible
_ at least psychologically _ that the Communists might come to
power,'' especially as the ailing Yeltsin withdrew from active
governance for months at a time. Powerful businessmen gave the
Communists money, just in case they regained power, he said. Now,
he predicted, communist influence will slowly wane.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists see the future less bleakly. They remain the
largest and best organized party in a country where socialist dogma
seems imprinted like genetic code on a large portion of the
intelligentsia and the impoverished working class.
</P>
<P>
   Even Putin, speaking to the Unity Party, formed last fall by his
backers in the Kremlin, noted that the Communists are still the
only party in Russia capable of creating a whole system of ideas
accepted and supported by millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   More than 22 percent of the roughly 70 million voters in
parliamentary elections supported communist candidates in 1995, and
more than 24 percent did so in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said that 1995 was our last hurrah, that our electorate
was dying out because it consisted of only pensioners and that it
was practically impossible for the party to gain strength,'' said
Leonid Dobrokhotov, a former Soviet diplomat and a leading
political adviser to Zyuganov. ``But despite the fact that dozens
of millions have died since then from illness, depression and a
variety of diseases, more people voted for the party in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dobrokhotov added, ``It is clear for all of us that
the Communist Party candidate has no chance to win this election.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Gelman said, is that Russia's aspiring middle class,
year after year, is moving irrevocably into the capitalist orbit.

   ``Slowly they are getting stronger,'' he said, ``but to
understand the middle class in Russia, you must not only count the
people who have money but also the people who hope to have money,
because they will vote and act as if they had it _ because of their
hope. In other words, hope equals capitalism.''

   The modern vote certainly seems to be behind Putin. At 47, he is
fit, a welcome contrast for Russians to their infirm leaders of the
past. He has not only gotten lofty ratings in public opinion polls
_ mostly thanks to the popular war against rebels who had made the
republic of Chechnya a largely lawless region totally independent
of Russia _ but has also eaten into the Communist base.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, schooled in the KGB, has skillfully addressed issues dear
to the Communists' loyal constituency of angry pensioners,
industrial workers, farmers and miners, whose standard of living
has plummeted just as surely as that of a few oligarchs and
nouveaux riches has risen to fabulous heights. He has raised
pension payments, hailed the notion of a strong state and waged
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zyuganov doesn't have troops, he doesn't have tanks, and he
doesn't have a victorious campaign in Chechnya,'' said Alexander
Prokhanov, who both supports and advises Zyuganov as editor of the
newspaper Zavtra, known for its occasional flights toward neo-Nazi
extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov declined to be interviewed for this article and did not
attend the rally at the Moscow movie theater because he had the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Zyuganov's advisers, Prokhanov realizes that Putin
is stealing the ground from under the Communists, but has been
unable to develop any strategy to thwart defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people understand the national psychology of Russians,''
Prokhanov said, referring to the Putin campaign team. ``Putin has a
very strong group of advisers who have employed all of the modern
political technologies of the information age to create this image
of a leader and to place into this image a specific person named
Putin.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, Zyuganov has apparently tried to move toward
the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read the communist program, you won't find a single
word about communism there,'' Prokhanov said. ``In essence, Mr.
Zyuganov is becoming a velvet social democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   On the south side of Moscow, Aleksei Podberiozkin _ until last
fall, a close Zyuganov ally _ disagrees. He is trying to start a
rival Communist Party and he is running for president in hopes of
siphoning away votes from Zyuganov, who he says has been too slow
to change with the times.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, Podberiozkin, a trusted Communist, instructed
ambassadors and KGB officers on political correctness in foreign
policy at the Foreign Ministry's academy. When the communist system
and the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, he devoted himself to a new
nationalistic ideology, the Spiritual Heritage Movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to drive home to the communist leadership some of my
ideas, and for a period of time, Zyuganov was accepting them,'' he
said, taking credit for Zyuganov's rhetorical devotion to the need
to restore ``spiritual values'' in post-Soviet society.
</P>
<P>
   Podberiozkin helped build the left-wing alliance that opposed
the sweeping economic reforms made under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says there is no prospect for growth by staying with the
Communists, and that Zyuganov is in the thrall of orthodox and
doctrinaire advisers. Podberiozkin is now beginning to admire
Putin, and is saying goodbye to the left.
</P>
<P>
   In an elegant suite of offices overlooking the Kremlin, Boris
Kashin, a 48-year-old mathematics wizard, spends most of his day
fine-tuning a computer program he has sold to U.S. investors that
acts like a supercharged day trader, buying and selling thousands
of shares of stock under a secret formula designed to profit from
each fluctuation in the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Kashin, a member of the Russian Academy of
Sciences and the youngest doctor of mathematics in his generation,
is also an adviser to Zyuganov on science and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prestige of scholars and scientists has been so diminished
and the living standards have dropped so low that the only way to
survive is to go to the West, which is so humiliating,'' he
explained about his day job in the markets. But this survival
strategy, one of millions adopted by Russians of all classes since
the ruble crashed in August 1998, has another goal for Kashin: to
keep the flame alive until the time comes for a Communist-led
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In organizing the future, no system will work unless it
recovers the greatest part of what was gained in socialist times,''
Kashin said, citing the example of rent. The whole concept of
paying rent _ or getting evicted for nonpayment of rent _ was too
repugnant for Russians to accept, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has to provide certain minimums or we will face
revolution again or the destruction of a great portion of the
population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For him, Zyuganov is the only man who can save the country.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, he added, ``he has not made any serious mistakes.''

LDS CHURCH OFTEN STILL MISUNDERSTOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: INCLUDES KEY POINTS, LIST OF BELIEFS AT END OF TAKE.
ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY) PHOENIX _ In some ways, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a quintessential
American success story.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing religious and political persecution in the 1840s,
members of this newly established church left Nauvoo, Ill., and
trekked west, setting up colonies and a distinct way of life. A
century and a half later, the little church organized by Joseph
Smith is one of the fastest-growing religions in the Americas &UR; and
across the globe, as well as the richest church per capita in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the Mormon Church still so maligned and little
understood within some Christian circles?
</P>
<P>
   This never-quite-resolved question again moved to the forefront
with an ``East Valley Tribune'' story headlined ``Christian fest
snubs Mormons,'' referring to the Jan. 15 Festival of Faith 2000
event at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix. A gathering billed as the
largest-ever ecumenical assembly of Christians in Arizona history,
it attracted 35,000 people from about 400 Protestant, Catholic and
Orthodox congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, however, were not among these.
</P>
<P>
   Initially included in the festival's planning, the Mormon Church
later found itself excluded, apparently because some conservative
organizers didn't consider Latter-day Saints to be Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be total acceptance, total
understanding, total love,'' said the Rev. Paul Eppinger, executive
director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council and a Festival of Faith
lead organizer. ``But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal
world and therefore, in our desire to make the Christian church
more understanding of each group, there are first steps we must
take, then the second step, the third step, the fourth step.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians to meet with each other was that first
step. Broadening the ecumenical net to include churches such as the
Latter-day Saints clearly would be another.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue lie matters of doctrine and theology
_ and the notion of just WHO is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals who believe in literal biblical interpretation say
the Mormons aren't. The Latter-day Saints, who believe their faith
is a restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and
his 12 disciples, claim they belong to the true Christian church. &QL; 
ROOTS OF DISAGREEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just who creates the yardstick that determines which
denominations are Christians? And what standard are these groups
measured against?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a historical faith believed to be derived from the intent
of Jesus' teachings? Or is it the European-spawned brand of
Catholicism and Protestantism, with its various creeds and
traditions influenced by culture?
</P>
<P>
   And does a church's definition of itself determine where it fits
on the religious landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon Church is neither Catholic nor Protestant,
says Phoenix metro area spokesman Wilford Andersen, it's no less
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand we can respectfully disagree on
matters of Christian doctrine,'' Andersen said, ``but should never
disagree on Christian conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some (churches) who find it difficult to
work together with us, and I respect that as long as we don't have
ill will toward each other and as long as we don't have
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the crux of the rift between Mormons and
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Ostling, co-author of the acclaimed ``Mormon America:
The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $26), says the LDS
Church's ``sweeping policy of secrecy'' contributes to the faith
being misunderstood in mainstream American religious culture. Its
weddings are held in temples that require church-issued
``recommends'' to enter, meaning non-Mormons never get inside. Even
the church's governing documents _ the sort that many denominations
publish on their Web sites _ are off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have this situation, it creates rumors,
speculations, misinformation,'' said Ostling, who wrote ``Mormon
America'' with his wife, Joan K. Ostling. ``There is room for a lot
of confusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mormons and their conservative Christian critics tend
to disagree much on matters of morality and social values. Both
groups stress the importance of family and personal responsibility,
and decry abortion, gambling and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, a coalition of Southern Baptists,
Catholics and Mormons recently joined forces to pass Proposition 22
on Tuesday, which would ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the disagreement is doctrinal,'' Ostling said,
``rather than moral, political and cultural. The fundamental issues
between Mormonism and traditional Christianity are the nature of
God, the doctrine of Christ, the Bible's authority, and the
doctrine of humanity and relating to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to examine the commonalities and differences between
the groups, professors Craig L. Blomberg of Denver Seminary and
Stephen E. Robinson of Brigham Young University wrote the 1997
book, ``How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in
Conversation'' (InterVarsity Press, $11.99).
</P>
<P>
   Their point-counterpoint text includes a ``joint conclusion'' at
the end of each chapter and doesn't dwell on trying to prove the
other wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says this civil tolerance and respect _ rather than
active teaching against other religions _ is central to Mormon
faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ostling says it's ``almost predictable'' that Mormons and
evangelicals butt heads theologically, as both target the same
group of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociology professor at the LDS Church's
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many sociologists believe the animosity between the groups
exists because ``we share the same niche,'' Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use that marketplace language, both Evangelicals
and Mormons share the same target: the unchurched,'' she adds. ``We
compete in the marketplace of religion, and evangelicals want to
make sure their targets realize Mormons are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostling thinks today's Mormon Church, especially under current
President Gordon B. Hinckley's administration, goes ``back and
forth'' on positioning itself closer to ``mainstream''
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL; 
_If the LDS Church were a U.S. corporation, its revenues would
place it No. 243 on the ``Fortune'' 500 list. &QL; 
_The Mormon Church is one of the nation's largest landowners, with
property equal to the size of Delaware. &QL; 
_Unlike most churches, the LDS Church has no professional clergy.
Members take turns speaking at Sunday sacrament meetings, or
worship services. Members also serve in unpaid ``callings,'' or
assignments, that get work done throughout the church. &QL; 
_Some of the church's best-known members include Steve Young, a San
Francisco 49ers quarterback; singers Donny and Marie Osmond and
Gladys Knight; Stephen R. Covey, bestselling author of ``7 Habits
of Highly Effective People''; and Orrin Hatch, a Utah senator and
former presidential candidate. &QL; 
_Until 1978, Black men were not ordained to the lay priesthood _ a
position reversed by official declaration of then-President Spencer
W. Kimball. Today, R&AMP;B singer Knight is probably the Mormon
Church's best-known Black member. &QL; 
_Source: ``Mormon America: The Power and the Promise,''by Richard
N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling. &QL; 
_About 150,000 Mormons live in the Phoenix area, and about 300,000
live within Arizona. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME KEY BELIEFS &QL; 
 &QL; 
_With the revelations delivered by God the father and his son,
Jesus Christ, to church founder Joseph Smith in 1820, a restoration
of the ``truths, powers and priesthood authority of the ancient
church'' was constituted as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Mormons believe they follow Christ's true
gospel, which they say was lost after the deaths of the original 12
disciples. &QL; 
_Divine revelation for the church's direction comes from God to the
president of the church (currently Gordon B. Hinckley). Presidents
are viewed as prophets in the same tradition as Abraham, Moses and
Peter. &QL; 
_In addition to the King James version of the Christian Bible,
Latter-day Saints consider ``The Book of Mormon: Another Testament
of Jesus Christ'' divinely inspired scripture, along with ``The
Doctrine and Covenants'' and ``The Pearl of Great Price,'' other
revelations and writings given since the church's start in 1830. &QL; 
_Mormons don't believe in the traditional concept of ``original
sin'' (that all humans are born sinners because of the Garden of
Eden sin of Adam and Eve), but rather that people are punished for
the sins they commit. &QL; 
_Mormons abstain from using tobacco, alcoholic beverages, tea and
coffee in adherence to ``The Word of Wisdom,'' a health code
revealed to founder Joseph Smith in 1833. &QL; 
_Members are required to tithe, or give a 10th of their income, to
the church to remain members in good standing and gain access to
temples for sacred ordinances. &QL;

<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL;

 &QL; 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL; 
_If the LDS Church were a U.S. corporation, its revenues would
place it No. 243 on the ``Fortune'' 500 list. &QL; 
_The Mormon Church is one of the nation's largest landowners, with
property equal to the size of Delaware. &QL; 
_Unlike most churches, the LDS Church has no professional clergy.
Members take turns speaking at Sunday sacrament meetings, or
worship services. Members also serve in unpaid ``callings,'' or
assignments, that get work done throughout the church. &QL; 
_Some of the church's best-known members include Steve Young, a San
Francisco 49ers quarterback; singers Donny and Marie Osmond and
Gladys Knight; Stephen R. Covey, bestselling author of ``7 Habits
of Highly Effective People''; and Orrin Hatch, a Utah senator and
former presidential candidate. &QL; 
_Until 1978, Black men were not ordained to the lay priesthood _ a
position reversed by official declaration of then-President Spencer
W. Kimball. Today, R&AMP;B singer Knight is probably the Mormon
Church's best-known Black member. &QL; 
_Source: ``Mormon America: The Power and the Promise,''by Richard
N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling. &QL; 
_About 150,000 Mormons live in the Phoenix area, and about 300,000
live within Arizona. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME KEY BELIEFS &QL; 
 &QL; 
_With the revelations delivered by God the father and his son,
Jesus Christ, to church founder Joseph Smith in 1820, a restoration
of the ``truths, powers and priesthood authority of the ancient
church'' was constituted as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Mormons believe they follow Christ's true
gospel, which they say was lost after the deaths of the original 12
disciples. &QL; 
_Divine revelation for the church's direction comes from God to the
president of the church (currently Gordon B. Hinckley). Presidents
are viewed as prophets in the same tradition as Abraham, Moses and
Peter. &QL; 
_In addition to the King James version of the Christian Bible,
Latter-day Saints consider ``The Book of Mormon: Another Testament
of Jesus Christ'' divinely inspired scripture, along with ``The
Doctrine and Covenants'' and ``The Pearl of Great Price,'' other
revelations and writings given since the church's start in 1830. &QL; 
_Mormons don't believe in the traditional concept of ``original
sin'' (that all humans are born sinners because of the Garden of
Eden sin of Adam and Eve), but rather that people are punished for
the sins they commit. &QL; 
_Mormons abstain from using tobacco, alcoholic beverages, tea and
coffee in adherence to ``The Word of Wisdom,'' a health code
revealed to founder Joseph Smith in 1833. &QL; 
_Members are required to tithe, or give a 10th of their income, to
the church to remain members in good standing and gain access to
temples for sacred ordinances. &QL;

SWISS TOWN VOTES TO REJECT DOZENS FOR CITIZENSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A new citizen review of personal details about
foreigners seeking to become Swiss citizens resulted on Sunday in
the rejection of most applicants, including all those from the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Provided with information about each applicant's salary, tax
status, background and hobbies, voters in an industrial suburb of
Lucerne decided that only four families, all of Italian origin,
were suitable to become Swiss _ eight individuals out of a total of
56. The rest, many from the countries that were part of Yugoslavia
under communism, were voted down, most by considerable margins.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the town of Emmen drew notice across the country
because it is viewed as a test of strength for the Swiss People's
Party. The anti-immigration position taken by its leader, Christoph
Blocher, has been compared to that of Joerg Haider, whose
right-wing Freedom Party is now part of neighboring Austria's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Elements of the People's Party, which received an increase in
voter support during last fall's federal elections, hope to spread
the popular vote on citizenship to larger cities, such as Zurich
and Bern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Swiss direct democracy,'' said Urs Ischi, a party
member who promoted the new system, in which voting on citizenship
was conducted with national referendums. But he defended Sunday's
vote, saying, ``It was not only against Yugoslavs but also against
others, including Turks and Hungarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanela Omerhodzic, 20, whose parents came here 27 years ago from
Bosnia, saw it differently. ``I'm very discouraged,'' said
Omerhodzic, one of those turned down, upon learning the results.
``I feel Swiss. I was born in Switzerland, I went to school in
Emmen and I live there now. I work in Switzerland. It's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Omerhodzic, who is a secretary in an international accounting
firm in Zurich, said she was undecided about whether to try again.
``The details they ask are so personal, so private,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials have decided to review naturalization in part
because population growth is dependent on immigration.
Switzerland's current population of 7.2 million people grew last
year only because of an increase in the number of people arriving
to join relatives. The number of Swiss citizens increased by only
.3 percent, according to federal statistics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In other nationwide votes Sunday, the Swiss rejected major
changes, including quotas to ensure that women would hold a certain
percentage of seats in Parliament and other public offices, and
proposals to tighten Europe's strictest laws against artificial
reproduction and to halve the nation's road traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for political offices for women in traditionally
male-dominated Switzerland received only 17 percent of the national
vote. Commentators called the results the ``death'' of the idea,
which was aimed at redressing the fact that there are only two
women in the seven-member governing body, and only about 25 percent
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also rebuffed a proposal to speed the process of bringing
referendums to a countrywide vote; that was opposed by the
government on grounds that it would ignite a new flood of such
votes. The Swiss already go to the polls at least three times a
year to vote on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   The only referendum measure approved Sunday was one to reform
the country's complex judicial system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lucky blue blazer is at home in the closet.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson last wore the raggedy 15-year-old
Brooks Brothers jacket when he was jetting across the Middle East
last month, trying to convince Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that the
dramatic jump in oil prices was threatening the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   The blazer became his sartorial trademark early in the Clinton
administration _ when he was a diplomatic troubleshooter while a
member of Congress, freeing U.S. hostages from Iraq to North Korea
to Sudan _ and later as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he said, the jacket proved its value once more; the
Saudis and the Kuwaitis said they would examine their production
levels, interpreted as a commitment to reopen the spigot for oil,
if only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it work? Sure, it works,'' Richardson said as his
limousine sped across town on Friday afternoon, carrying him to a
television studio for yet another interview to explain the
administration's plans to drive down crude oil prices that have
tripled over the last year. ``I wear it for all my need-to-be-lucky
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the magical powers of his wardrobe, it is difficult to
think of Richardson as lucky these days.
</P>
<P>
   An hour earlier, he had been in the Oval Office with President
Clinton, hashing out the next move in the mess over oil prices; a
report released by the Energy Department this month said gasoline
prices should hit an average of $1.75 a gallon this summer because
of production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. In some states, gasoline is expected to top $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my fault, but I should try to fix it,'' he said. ``A
year ago, oil inventories were high. Nobody expected this. The
states didn't expect it. Consumers didn't expect it. Even traders
didn't expect it. I think everybody should have been better
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson inherited lots of bad news when he left the United
Nations to take over the Energy Department 19 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   First came the reports of security lapses dating back years in
the department's nuclear weapons laboratories and the accusation
that Chinese spies had obtained designs for this nation's most
sophisticated nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the department's admission, after decades of
denials, that government workers making nuclear weapons had been
exposed to radiation and cancer-causing chemicals that probably led
them to an early grave.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the explosion in oil prices has U.S. drivers fuming at
the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up in gasoline prices comes at a politically awkward
time for Richardson, who knows he risks becoming the government's
fall guy for expensive oil just as he was reported to be under
consideration as a running mate for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 52, a collegial, slap-on-the-back politician, has
long been seen as an obvious candidate for the No. 2 slot.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only Hispanic in the Cabinet, a former Democratic
House leader from New Mexico with appeal to the Latino voters who
are being heavily recruited by both parties in the presidential
race. Born in Pasadena, Calif., he grew up in Mexico City, where
his mother was born. His father, a Bostonian, worked as an
executive at Citibank in Mexico for several years.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a boy he was an excellent pitcher, good enough to be
drafted by the Kansas City A's after high school. Instead, he went
to Tufts University outside Boston, where he earned a master's
degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Few of Richardson's rivals could have failed to notice him
beaming behind Gore's confetti-caked shoulder last week as the vice
president gave his victory speech after sweeping the Super Tuesday
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he had nothing to do with his conspicuous
placement on the podium in Nashville. ``I was behind him because
that's where the Gore advance people put me. There was a piece of
tape that said Richardson. I didn't elbow some little old lady to
get there. Somebody put me there. I was flattered.''
</P>
<P>
   While Richardson campaigned for the vice president in Iowa, New
Hampshire and California, often before Hispanic audiences, he
insisted he has no designs on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about the vice presidency, and I'm not
campaigning for it,'' he said. ``I want to discourage speculation
by answering questions like this, because it appears that I'm
overeager. I just think the vice president should have a full, open
search.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Richardson has begun to look more like a national
candidate. After five months on the protein-heavy Atkins diet (``it
works, but I'm starting to get sick of it'') and a daily workout
with a personal trainer, he has dropped 30 pounds, bringing his
weight down to 210 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the lucky blazer, his rumpled wardrobe has been
discarded; he now favors tailored suits and Hermes ties. His unruly
mass of black hair has been styled back. ``I've cleaned up my
act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the charge of overambition, which dates to his
daring _ and usually successful _ hostage-rescue missions when he
was an otherwise little-known member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   He made headlines around the world in 1995, when he traveled to
Iraq and persuaded Saddam Hussein to free two U.S. engineers jailed
there. George Stephanopoulos, the former White House aide, used to
call Richardson ``a diplomatic Red Adair,'' alluding to the famed
oil-well firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Said Richardson: ``I'm as ambitious as anybody else in this
town, but am I excessively ambitious? No. If I don't continue in
public life, I'll be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And he admitted that he might soon find himself out of a
government job. He acknowledged that his chances of winning the nod
as Gore's vice presidential nominee could evaporate if gas prices
continued to soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that gasoline prices at $2 a gallon in August or
September is not good,'' he said. ``But my main responsibility is
to try to fix the problem and be a good energy secretary. If it
becomes a burden, so be it.''

MIGHTY PUTS NEW TURN IN ROAD TO THE DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The road to the Kentucky Derby, which took a
dramatic twist Saturday when Hal's Hope won the Florida Derby at
Gulfstream Park over the favored High Yield, took another turn
Sunday when Mighty won the Louisiana Derby in New Orleans over More
Than Ready.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty, owned by the Claiborne Farm and trained by Frank
Brothers, had run second in all three of his starts this year after
winning the Iroquois at Churchill Downs last November. If that was
an omen, so be it. The colt flashed past big-league competition in
the homestretch of the Louisiana Derby and defeated More Than
Ready, a rookie star last year, and Captain Steve, one of the West
Coast's Kentucky Derby favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Does this give Mighty an edge in the sweepstakes for the
Kentucky Derby, which will be run May 6 at Churchill Downs? Not
necessarily, but it does not hurt. The horse lost to Captain Steve
twice and to More Than Ready once last year, but he evened the
score Sunday when he ran the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:43 1/5 in
the Louisiana Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana Derby field was infiltrated heavily with
California stars who had fled the rain that flooded the West Coast
in recent weeks, led by Captain Steve, trained by Bob Baffert, and
Exchange Rate, who finished fourth, trained by D. Wayne Lukas. But
they could not catch Mighty when he flew down the deep homestretch
on the outside to win one for Churchill Downs, where he scored his
only two successes before Shane Sellers nudged him home at the Fair
Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty paid $14 for a $2 bet to win, $6 to place and $3.80 to
show. More Than Ready paid $7 and $4.60, and the 2-1 Captain Steve
$3.20 for third.
</P>
<P>
   So, the traffic headed for Kentucky did not exactly thin out
this weekend. More likely, it became confused. And much of the
confusion was created by Hal's Hope, the unheralded colt bred,
trained and owned by 88-year-old Harold Rose, who has dealt mainly
with claiming horses during his career in racing.
</P>
<P>
   The rags-to-riches elements to his story are irresistible: a
horse with little pedigree, raised in a stable occupied almost
entirely by claimers bred by a trainer who earned a degree in
mathematics at Bucknell and did not get into horse racing until he
retired from business 30 years ago and moved his family from New
Jersey to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Then he set up a stable of about 20 horses, chiefly claimers
that he sold to anybody who would bid on them. He thought one was
special, so he kept him, gave him the name Hal's Hope and watched
him run sixth and fifth in his first two races last year at nearby
Calder Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   But Hal's Hope raised eyebrows in January when he won the Holy
Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park at odds of 40-1. And he raised
Rose's expectations when he ran a tough second in February to High
Yield in the Fountain of Youth Stakes. The odds were still high,
10-1, and even when he went to the post for the Florida Derby, he
was 6-1. But there he finally won respect when he led all the way
and held off High Yield in a stirring duel down the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's wife, Elsie, who is 85, is writing a book _ her fourth _
and this one naturally features Hal's Hope. When will Rose retire
from racing for a more sedentary life? ``Retire?'' Rose asked
rhetorically. ``Possibly when I'm 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsie Rose was asked Sunday morning what she and her husband had
done after winning their biggest race and their $450,000 share of
the purse of $750,000. ``Well,'' she replied, in her folksy way,
``the children all went out somewhere and celebrated. We had taped
the race at home and watched the rerun. Harold told me this morning
that Hal's Hope ate up all his feed and he's ready to go on to the
next assignment. We're going to Kentucky, hopefully to the Blue
Grass on April 15. That's the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas paid all proper respect to his senior rivals, and said he
and High Yield would see them again at the Blue Grass in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with his effort,'' Lukas said of High Yield,
``although I would have liked to have won the race. I thought we
had it won entering the stretch, when Pat Day looked over his
shoulder. But you have to give Hal's Hope credit. He ran a
tremendous race.''
</P>
<P>
   The casualty list from the Florida Derby included Scottish Halo,
who cut both ankles before finishing sixth, and Hades, who may have
flipped his palate before being eased in the stretch. But so far,
at least, the casualty list did not include Harold Rose and his
life's dream. &QL;

<P>
   DALLAS _ Coach Ken Hitchcock liked what he saw out of his newest
line that joined wingers Brett Hull and Scott Thornton with center
Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Hull's nagging hip-flexor injury has made it
impossible to reunite him with Mike Modano because that line will
continue to carry two-way responsibilities. Hitchcock believes the
new Nieuwendyk line has the potential to be a second scoring line
behind the No. 1 line of Modano, Jamie Langenbrunner and Brenden
Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to win at the end of the day, we have to have
two lines that can play,'' Hitchcock said. ``Brett Hull hasn't been
strong enough in his five-on-five game to warrant playing him the
amount of minutes that we need from that type of player, but he has
the ability, if we can get him healthy, to come underneath as a
support line.'' _ Jeff Caplan
Back-to-back
</P>
<P>
   The Blues were a different team without Chris Pronger. Pronger,
perhaps the leading candidate for the Norris Trophy as the league's
best defenseman, had back spasms yesterday and did not play against
the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously a major part of our team,'' Blues defenseman
Todd Reirden said. ``He's a good leader on and off the ice.
Hopefully, things will be better \Rtoday\S, and he can be back
playing right away. He controls the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger is tied for first in the NHL with a plus-42. He also has
38 assists and 48 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pronger is probably the X-factor here, because he's a
dominant player in his own right defensively,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said, ``but so is \Rinjured Stars winger\S Jere
\RLehtinen\S.'' _ Charean Williams
Back-to-back II
</P>
<P>
   And on the seventh day, Blues goalie Roman Turek rested.
</P>
<P>
   Turek, who has a league-leading 1.97 goals-against average, sat
out the game against the Stars a day after he faced 26 shots,
including seven in overtime, in a 1-1 tie against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we could have played him, but at the same time,
he gets a day off. He gets a break,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville
said. ``He's had a lot of work this year. ... I'm sure he'd like to
have played here, but he wants to play all the time, too, so we try
to control and monitor that going down the stretch here.''
</P>
<P>
   Turek was 30-14-4 in three seasons with the Stars, who traded
him to St. Louis for a third-round draft choice after last season.
He is 35-13-8 this season _ second to New Jersey's Martin Brodeur
in victories _ and includes 4-2 and 3-1 victories against the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played here last game, and we won,'' Turek said. ``I played
\RSaturday\S in St. Louis. When we play back-to-back, usually we
play Jamie \RMcLennan\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more interesting the first game I played against the
Stars, but now, it's not different. It's nothing special after a
few games. They're just another team.'' _ Charean Williams
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Sylvain Cote suffered a bruised shin yesterday. Ken
Hitchcock said Cote would play in tonight's game at the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has decided to drop the Stars-Blackhawks game Saturday in
Chicago as one of its regional telecasts. That leaves no local
television coverage of the game because of the network's
exclusivity during that three-hour window. The 2 p.m. game can be
heard on WBAP/820 AM. _ Jeff Caplan
Defending the Cup
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues came into Reunion Arena yesterday with
injuries of their own, such as to top defenseman Chris Pronger (48
points, tied for third on the team), and center Pierre Turgeon (58
points, second on the team). And starting goalie Roman Turek took
the day off after playing Saturday against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Those are tough omissions for any team.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were minus goalie Ed Belfour, center Guy Carbonneau
and forwards Blake Sloan, Jere Lehtinen and Brian Skrudland. Not
too bad, actually. The Stars, who defeated the Blues, 4-2, are _
believe it or not _ at one of their healthier points in the season.
And playing well without all their top players is why they remain a
legitimate threat to repeat as Stanley Cup champions. _ Jeff Caplan

<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling to keep control of its business, Aetna Inc., the
United States' largest health insurer, on Sunday rejected a $9.9
billion takeover offer and announced plans to split the
147-year-old company into independent health-care and
financial-services companies this year. Each new company would have
its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna also said it would sell some of its overseas health-care
units and use the money to reduce debt and buy back stock later
this year. Aetna wants to placate worried investors who have driven
its stock price down, leading to the replacement of its chief
executive late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after that leadership change, Aetna confirmed
reports that it had received an offer to discuss a takeover from
Wellpoint Health Networks, a health-insurance company based in
California, and ING Group, a Dutch financial-services company.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts said the announcements by the Aetna board
would probably not satisfy investors who have been clamoring for a
breakup of the company and sale of the pieces, possibly in an
auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders are not likely to be thrilled,'' said Todd
Richter, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. ``I would
expect the stock to go down on this news.''
</P>
<P>
   The unhappiness would probably be shared by Southeastern Asset
Management, a money-management firm based in Memphis, Tenn., that
announced last week that it had bought 6 percent of Aetna's shares
and was pressing for measures that would quickly push up the stock
price. Southeastern could not be reached for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors said they needed more information from Aetna
about the reason for rejecting the ING-Wellpoint offer, the size of
the international units to be sold, the way the money will be used,
any plans for stock buybacks, the timetable for splitting the
company, and management's earnings projections.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have raised concerns about the company's
ability to absorb the huge money-losing health-care unit of
Prudential Insurance Co., which it bought last August, and to deal
with a rash of lawsuits by class-action lawyers as well as
patients' rights bills in Congress that would make it easier to sue
health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, Aetna stock rebounded from a 12-month
low of $38.50 a share after it confirmed reports that it had
received the offer to discuss a sale of the company for $70 a
share, about $9.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday the Aetna board decided unanimously to decline the
ING-Wellpoint offer. ``We are going to take the route of improving
our services and building value for shareholders,'' said William H.
Donaldson, chief executive of Aetna, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said the company would ``examine our business model in
view of a rapidly changing environment that increasingly emphasizes
choice and empowerment'' of patients and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A founder of the Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette securities and
banking firm and a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange,
Donaldson replaced Richard L. Huber as chief executive of Aetna on
Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said that the $70, which was mentioned but not
actually offered in a letter last month from ING and Wellpoint,
``significantly understates the value of our company and does not
reflect the current value or future potential of our core
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In private talks with large investors, Aetna officials have
argued that the health-care unit and the financial-services unit
each have assets worth $9 billion, which would value the combined
company's stock at over $100 a share. But some analysts say they
have doubts about many of the company's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   When Aetna is divided, Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president
of A.M. Best Co., an insurance-company credit-ratings firm, said a
stand-alone financial-services unit could attract more takeover
offers. Mayewski said problems in health care had held the credit
rating of the financial (pensions, group life insurance) side of
the business to A, compared with a top rating of A-plus-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint, however, appears to be the only company interested in
acquiring the health-care unit, which accounts for 70 percent of
Aetna's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Richter said investors would now watch to see if ING and
Wellpoint make a formal bid to try to force the issue. ING and
Wellpoint declined to comment.
</P>

<P>
   Company officials said that in addition to splitting the company
in two, Aetna plans to move away from the increasingly unpopular
restrictions of its traditional health-maintenance organizations
and give its customers more choices and more control over their own
care. A growing number of health plans have taken similar steps.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna is also considering changes in rules that have forced
doctors to accept low-paying HMO patients or be forced to drop all
patients in less restrictive Aetna health plans. That plan has so
infuriated doctors that some have sued to force a change in Aetna's
business methods.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna is also considering taking on new partners for its
Internet operations in an attempt to catch the wave of investor
interest in e-commerce companies. Like other health insurers, Aetna
is increasingly using the Internet for communications with doctors,
hospitals and employers using its health plans. It also has a joint
venture in a consumer-information Web site with Johns Hopkins
University.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Sunday that it was ``finalizing plans'' to
develop commercial uses on the Internet for the health-care
information it collects on 22 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna also said it would sell some overseas units that have had
disappointing results. One candidate may be a joint venture in
Brazil that had weak earnings last year. But Aetna is not planning
to sell all its overseas operations, which analysts have said might
bring $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had not decided who would head the new
companies and whether one or both would remain in Hartford, Conn.,
where Aetna is headquartered and where it employs 11,400 people.
But it plans to speed up its cost-cutting program, including a
hiring freeze and the elimination of some layers of management
after the split into two companies. Donaldson said there would be
no large-scale layoffs in Connecticut, however.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland advised Donaldson in a letter last week that
the state would use its regulatory powers to insist that the
company keep ``a continued significant corporate and physical
presence in Connecticut.'' Aetna is the third-largest employer in
Connecticut, after the Stop 'N' Shop grocery chain and United
Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Richter of Banc of America said the split into two companies
would probably be tax-free to Aetna shareholders. He said the split
would have tax advantages as compared with an auction, which could
trigger enormous capital-gains-tax liabilities.

FCC TO PROMOTE A TRADING SYSTEM TO SELL AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the airwaves grow ever more congested with
modern wireless communications, the federal government is
developing plans to open up the spectrum by, in effect, treating
its frequencies as commodities to be bought and sold as routinely
as pork bellies or soybeans in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Federal Communications Commission say they are
preparing rules that would create a trading system in which
telecommunications companies of all kinds, from old-fashioned radio
stations and telephone companies to purveyors of wireless Internet
services, could bid for underused slivers of the spectrum that are
already under the control of other companies.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a radical overhaul of the rules governing one of the
most valuable, if intangible, forms of property in the new economy:
the rights to transmit electronic signals at specific radio
frequencies that constitute the spectrum. It would also have
profound implications, not only for the telecommunications
industries, but for consumers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the federal government licenses each
user and regulates what frequencies and signal power can be used.
Most times these rights have been sold to the industry, although
the oldest license holders got them for free. But they have never
been bought and sold in a secondary market like so many bushels of
grain.
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of cell phones, pagers, satellite
services and other wireless devices, the communications agency's
top officials have warned that demand is so outstripping supply
that it may lead to what they call a spectrum drought, making the
scarce spectrum even more valuable to haves and have-nots alike.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, for instance, the agency reports that the volume of
traffic on the Internet is doubling every 100 days, a stunning
increase considering that telephone traffic has traditionally risen
about 5 percent a year. As consumers increasingly reach the
Internet through wireless connections, like cell phones and
handheld computers, experts fear the heavy use of the airwaves will
begin to create bottlenecks and interference that could greatly
frustrate the further development of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a tragedy it would be if, right as we're on the verge of
the Internet migrating to inexpensive handheld devices and offering
real hopes of truly democratizing the technology, the movement
would be stymied by overloading the spectrum,'' William E. Kennard,
the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in an
interview on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, who has been pushing the agency to consider what rules
need to be changed to help deregulate the spectrum to foster a new
market, said the FCC was just beginning to enable the licensees who
own the rights to a given slice of the spectrum to make money from
any surplus they have, like parts of the airwaves they may not be
using 24 hours each day.
</P>
<P>
   The plan began to take effect last week and will take many
months to complete. In a little noticed announcement last Thursday,
the FCC released rules for an auction this spring of a slice of the
spectrum used by public safety organizations, including police
departments and hospitals, as well as railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Described by Kennard as ``putting our toe in the water,'' the
rules will reserve some of the frequencies to be auctioned to
``guard band managers.'' They would be able to lease and trade the
frequencies they win at the auction to commercial companies or
private wireless users, setting up a system that opens the door to
brokers who could help match buyers with sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Another auction this year for even more valuable frequencies,
those being vacated by broadcasters as they convert to digital
television, is also being prepared in a way intended to encourage
new spot markets. These frequencies, considered beachfront property
by the industry, can be used for a wide variety of technologies
beyond television, including cell phone and Internet
communications.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea works, the trading of spectrum futures could benefit
the telecommunications companies that own licenses and other
companies that cannot function without obtaining access to the
airwaves. And consumers, in theory, would benefit from more capable
communications devices and cheaper bills.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the trade in physical commodities allows farmers to
hedge against abrupt swings in price and enables consumers to count
on steady supplies, economists and communications experts say a new
approach that treated scarce frequencies as a commodity would allow
new and older technologies to continue to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, officials and economists say, the secondary market
would be beneficial to consumers in several ways. Economically, it
would create a more efficient and predictable way of matching
supply and demand, and therefore would result in lower costs for
using any equipment that makes use of the spectrum, like cell
phones and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Technologically, it offers the hope of better reception for
consumers who have begun to encounter greater interference as the
spectrum has become overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a severe spectrum shortage,'' said Peter Cramton, an
economics professor at the University of Maryland who as chairman
of the Spectrum Exchange Group, a Washington company, is involved
in a private effort to auction parts of the UHF television spectrum
in conjunction with the broadcast auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want better services,'' Cramton said. ``They want
high-speed data. They want a connection every time they place a
call on their cell phones, not three-quarters of the time. The
needs for users right now are great.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Federal Communications Commission described a
variety of ways a commodity market in the spectrum would work.
</P>
<P>
   _ News organizations covering political conventions or the
Olympics would be able to buy contracts to use a piece of the
spectrum during the event to give them extra capacity to beam
pictures, sound and data back to their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   _ A large metropolitan airport congesting the local airwaves
around it with everything from air traffic transmissions to car
rentals and cell phone users would be able to reserve space from
other spectrum users who are not fully using their space during
peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nationwide cell telephone companies would be able to buy and
sell pieces of the spectrum in different regions of the country
depending on the available supply and the demands of their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard and executives of some companies that are involved in
creating markets for fiber-optic cable use said they envisioned a
secondary market that could be set up by brokers on the Internet,
much the way a secondary market exists for reserving the excess
capacity of fiber-optic cable. They said the market would exist on
a Web site listing what is available from licensees to trade to
other companies who would want to buy or lease space, an eBay for
telecommunications companies.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Arbinet Communications, Enron and The Williams
Cos. now act as brokers to essentially buy and then sell unused
telephone time on fiber-optic cables.
</P>
<P>
   At a telecommunications conference sponsored by Credit Suisse
First Boston in New York last week, executives from some of the
companies now involved in trading unused telephone time said that
the FCC's proposal held great promise, but that it would take time
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of wireless is that the current system for trading
it is so inefficient,'' said Eric L. Rabb, managing director of AIG
Telecom, a unit of the American International Group that acts as a
broker for access to time on fiber-optic cable. ``What we apply now
to the wired world we can apply to the wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the FCC say they are planning a forum this spring
on ideas and rules changes for encouraging spot markets for the
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just through our licensing records we already have the most
comprehensive list of potential sellers,'' Kennard said. But even
as it seeks comment on changing the rules, he said, the agency is
beginning to take steps beyond just the way it structures spectrum
auctions to encourage the new marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for instance, the agency plans to begin writing rules
for a new technology that could have a profound effect on a
secondary market. The technology is known as digitally defined
radio, and it would allow new kinds of radios and cell phones with
special software to seek out different and broader frequencies than
current radios and phones.
</P>
<P>
   The military has expressed interest in digitally defined radio
because it would enable radios to avoid being jammed by an enemy by
searching for a clean signal. But other companies are also
developing products that rely on the technology.
</P>
<P>
   By making broader use of the spectrum, digitally defined radio
would also encourage telecommunications companies who are not using
all of their licensed frequencies to their full capacity to lease
their underused portions in a secondary market.

STARR'S SUCCESSOR READYING FINAL REPORTS ON CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beginning as early as this week and continuing for
several months, the special prosecutor for Whitewater matters,
Robert W. Ray, will begin filing with a federal court a series of
final reports on his office's investigations involving President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, lawyers who have been informed
of the plan said this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, who are not part of the special counsel's team,
said the first such report, concerning the improper acquisition by
the Clinton White House of about 900 Federal Bureau of
Investigation files, including many dossiers of prominent
Republicans, is expected to conclude that there was no criminal
wrongdoing and that the episode occurred because of a series of
unwitting mistakes initiated by a low-level White House security
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conclusions in that report will probably not pose
any significant problem for Mrs. Clinton, who is a candidate for
the Senate in New York, Ray's office is planning to complete and
file a second report, in July, about how the Clinton White House
came to fire several longtime employees of the White House travel
office.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has maintained that she had little to do with what
occurred, while others have told investigators that she played a
central role. It remains unclear how Ray will reconcile the
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A third report, about issues stemming from the Clintons'
investment in the Whitewater real estate venture before his
presidency, is expected to be filed with the court in late summer,
said the lawyers familiar with the schedule. That would place its
completion near the final phase of Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign
against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York. It is unclear what
conclusions this report will reach.
</P>
<P>
   The reports from Ray's office will not immediately be made
public. Instead, as stipulated by law, they will be sent to the
special panel of three federal judges that oversees the operations
of the Office of the Independent Counsel. The three-judge panel is
then supposed to distribute copies of the reports to the many
people who are named in them for comment or rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   The judges may later release the full reports to the public. But
it is expected that when copies are given to individuals named in
them, the reports' substance would make its way into news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her lawyers will presumably be given a copy of
any parts of the reports dealing with her.
</P>
<P>
   The issuing of several reports rather than one final one will
mean that the Office of the Independent Counsel will be commenting
on the behavior of the Clintons and their associates over an
extended period. As a result, Mrs. Clinton may be obliged to deal
with with these issues throughout her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As the reports become public, they could also pose questions for
Vice President Al Gore about the behavior of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the lawyers outside the office say, Ray has not yet
fully resolved the issue of whether President Clinton could be
charged with crimes after he leaves office. The lawyers who are
familiar with the operations of the office said that Ray and his
associates were planning to take yet another look at that question.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that will be covered in the internal debate over
whether Clinton may be indicted after his presidency are the same
issues that were involved in the impeachment drama played out in
Congress in late 1998 and into last year. They include whether
Clinton lied under oath to a grand jury and whether he pressed
Monica Lewinsky to lie about their relationship in an affidavit she
filed in the sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against Clinton by
Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr, who headed the Office of the Independent Counsel
until October, largely concluded that the proper forum for those
charges to be tested was in the impeachment battle and that there
was no need for any separate criminal proceeding, said two lawyers
familiar with the workings of the office. But Ray, who succeeded
Starr, is said to believe the question should be re-examined. Ray
declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   The third report, to be issued at the end of the summer, is
supposed to involve a host of issues stemming from the Whitewater
real estate venture, which lent its name to the far-reaching
inquiry by the office.
</P>
<P>
   That would include such questions, as yet unanswered, as how
Mrs. Clinton's billing records from her days as a lawyer in Little
Rock, Ark., disappeared for two years while the subject of a
criminal subpoena, only to reappear in the White House. That report
will also deal with her testimony about her actions as a lawyer in
land transactions in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   That report may also deal with the conduct of Nathan Landow, a
Democratic fund-raiser who was being investigated in connection
with accusations that the president had made a sexual advance to a
White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ray, a former federal prosecutor in New York, took over
the investigation from Starr in the fall, he has been operating
under an informal but firm deadline in which most of the office's
work would be completed by the end of this summer. The main reason
for this deadline, other lawyers who have been involved in the
investigation said, is that the three-judge panel that oversees the
office is obliged to review its work at that time and can issue a
judgment on whether the office should be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, one of the three panelists, Judge Richard D. Cudahy
of Chicago, wrote in an opinion that he thought the time had come
to end the investigation. Cudahy, a senior judge on the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, said he saw no need for the
office to stay in operation once the impeachment battle was
concluded. But at that time, he was overruled by his two colleagues
on the panel, also from the Court of Appeals, Judges David B.
Sentelle of the District of Columbia Circuit and Peter T. Fay of
the 11th Circuit, in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, said one of the lawyers, is now keenly aware that his job
is to write the final chapters of the investigation that has taken
more than five years and cost more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The law that provides for the appointment of independent
counsels expired in June, but Ray's office is still governed by its
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, an associate of Starr's said that one final report
was contemplated and that it could be ``blistering'' in its
description of Mrs. Clinton's behavior, even though it would be
only a recitation of events and unresolved issues without any
explicitly stated judgments. That still seems to be the approach
the independent counsel's office is about to take, said one lawyer
formerly with the office. The lawyer, who asked not to be
identified, said that the reports would not make any explicit
judgments, except to clear someone of wrongdoing. In other cases,
the lawyer said, the implications will be hard to miss.
</P>
<P>
   The report about the acquisition of the FBI files, which is to
be filed with the court within a matter of weeks, if not days,
involves a problem that first surfaced in 1996. Congressional
investigators learned that the White House's Office of Security had
requested the files of more than 900 people who once worked at the
White House but no longer did. The files included people like Brent
Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser, and
Marlin Fitzwater, his press secretary.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno asked Starr to investigate that
matter along with his other chores. The independent counsel's
office appears to have concluded that the files were acquired, as
the White House claimed, through a bureaucratic mistake stemming
from the use of an incorrect Secret Service list of White House
pass-holders by a low-level investigator, Anthony Marceca.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the independent counsel has cleared Bernard
Nussbaum, the first White House counsel, of any crime. Reno asked
Starr to investigate whether Nussbaum lied when he swore to a
Congressional committee that he had not told an FBI agent that the
head of the security office, Craig Livingstone, was hired because
of a connection to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office has struggled for months over
the issue of whether to detail its findings, even though they would
be critical of people who are not indicted. Prosecutors typically
render their investigative judgments by indicting or not indicting
someone.
</P>
<P>
   But the original independent counsel law required special
prosecutors to explain why they chose not to indict someone. The
law, as amended in 1987, deleted that requirement, leaving it up to
the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is quoted in William Safire's Monday column in The New York
Times as saying: ``It's not enough to say `we've issued a report.'
Part of my responsibility is to explain our judgments so the
country can evaluate them.''

 &HT;    Blue Devils' `two kids' too much for Maryland
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Memo to all potential opponents of Duke in the
upcoming NCAA Tournament: The Blue Devils have discovered yet
another way to beat you.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Duke (27-4) beat Maryland 81-68 Sunday for the ACC
Tournament championship was really not a surprise. What should
concern the rest of the NCAA field, however, is that the Blue
Devils got behind a pair of freshmen to beat a very good team.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Jason Williams scored 23 points while center Carlos
Boozer added 21 more to give Duke its second consecutive ACC
Tournament title. Duke became the first team since North Carolina
State in 1973-74 to win both the regular season and tournament
championships in consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two kids really stepped up big today,'' said Duke coach
Mike Krzyzewski, whose team repeated as conference champions after
losing four first-round NBA draft choices. ``We're ecstatic about
winning another championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (24-9), the only ACC team to beat Duke this season,
figured it would be in position to win if it could control the Blue
Devils' All-American forwards, Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier,
who combined for only 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Terrapins could not find an answer for Williams, who led
all scorers with 23 points while dishing out four assists. Williams
was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player with 53 points and
27 assists in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Williams) got inside our defense and broke us down,'' said
Maryland coach Gary Williams, in the championship game for the
first time. ``We just couldn't stop them when the game was on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke had won two ACC Tournament games against Clemson and Wake
Forest by making a total of 30 3-point shots. Maryland extended its
defense to handle the long-range shots, leaving room for Boozer to
operate inside. Boozer hit eight of 14 shots from and field and all
five attempts from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go into Carlos and he responded in an amazing
way,'' said Krzyzewski. ``It's kind of nice when your best game is
in the championship game and this was his best game.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, which trailed by 12 early in the first half, got back
into the game and was behind 56-52 with 8 minutes, 46 seconds left.
That's when Krzyzewski called time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had lost our focus after having a 10-point lead
(54-44) earlier,'' said Krzyzewski. ``I just wanted us to keep our
poise.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Duke did as Boozer and Williams scored 10
straight.

GORE ASSAILS BUSH'S PROPOSALS AND CALLS RIVAL INEXPERIENCED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Vice President Al Gore ventured into Gov. George W.
Bush's backyard Sunday and hurled spears at him, portraying his
rival as so inexperienced that he would imperil Social Security for
the sake of an unnecessary tax cut if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Governor Bush have the experience to be president?'' Gore
asked a small group of retirees here at an assisted-living
community. ``No. A proposal like that makes you wonder, because
right now we are heading in the right direction with a strong
economy and continued prosperity.'' He said that Bush would take
the nation in ``the wrong direction'' by trying to satisfy the
wealthy special interests that were financing his campaign and
wanted a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that if Bush cut taxes as much as he proposed, he
would be forced to cut Medicare, dip into the Social Security trust
fund or cut money for environmental and education programs. In any
case, Gore warned, Bush would ``take us back to the Bush-Quayle
recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was courting voters in Texas and across the South this week
in advance of a batch of primaries on Tuesday that he will
undoubtedly sweep. Although these primaries are anticlimactic in
the aftermath of former Sen. Bill Bradley's withdrawal from the
Democratic presidential race last week, Gore was trying to drive up
interest in his candidacy and lay the groundwork for the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the election is eight months away, the two putative
nominees are already locked in battle, and Gore is determined to
try to define Bush while Bush is trying to define him. Bush cast
Gore Sunday as galling in his presumption to adopt the mantle of
campaign finance crusader, saying that Gore had in fact committed
ethical lapses and ``would say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with Gore aides saying that one of the chief concerns
that voters harbor about Bush is his lack of experience, Gore is
trying to stoke those doubts by portraying Bush as so unseasoned
that he would ruin Social Security just to give a tax break to his
wealthy contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would take all of the Social Security surplus and
devote it exclusively to the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush had opened the door to raising the retirement age
for full benefits for Social Security. Gore did not mention that
the age is set to rise over the next few years to 67 anyway. Citing
an article by The Associated Press, the Gore campaign said that
Bush had said in November that raising the retirement age and
creating personal savings accounts might be ``part of a trade-off''
for securing Social Security for the baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that those who were well off might choose to set up
private accounts, but others would be left behind. ``Then you'd
have a two-tier Social Security system,'' he said. ``I say, if it
ain't broke, don't fix it. Shore it up the way we always have.
Social Security is the most popular program and the most successful
program that has ever been enacted in the United States of America.
It doesn't need to be privatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Having congratulated a woman in the audience who was 102 years
old, Gore noted that the average lifespan of Americans was
increasing, so that there are now 75,000 people over the age of
100.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just because lifespans are increasing,'' Gore said, ``that
doesn't mean that someone who works at hard physical labor, whether
it's lifting steel or a waitress carrying a tray, has any less wear
and tear on her skeleton and muscles, on the tendons and on the
body, and that person is ready to retire at the age of 65 and
shouldn't have to wait until the age of 70 to retire. I'm against
raising the retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore reiterated his proposal to Bush that they both refuse to
take so-called soft money, the unregulated donations to the
parties, that they eliminate all campaign advertising and that they
debate each other twice a week, Tuesday nights and Thursday nights
at 8 p.m. He said this approach would prompt ``a renaissance in our
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He is making his arguments every chance he gets these days, both
overtly and subliminally. For example, he used to deride the
Reagan-Bush years that he said led the country to economic
disaster. Now, he talks about the Bush-Quayle administration,
which, he said in Houston on Saturday night, led to ``the worst
depression since the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s.''
</P>
<P>
   By invoking the name of Dan Quayle, the former vice president
not known for his experience or substance, and linking it with the
presidency of Bush's father, Gore is trying to conjure the image of
a candidate who is neither ready for the presidency nor capable of
sound economic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore is trying to pump up his standing with
key Democratic constituencies. He arrived here Sunday afternoon
from Houston, where he rose early to go jogging with Carl Lewis,
the Olympic medalist. He spoke at a black church in Houston, where
he delivered an extended soliloquy on the nature of racism, and
visited a Mexican restaurant before flying to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is courting minority voters, here and elsewhere, because a
high turnout, especially among blacks, is essential if he hopes to
capture any states in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore appears to have no hope of winning Bush's home state
of Texas, he is making a serious foray into that other Bush
territory, Florida, where George Bush's brother Jeb is governor, in
an effort to woo voters in that Republican-leaning state. Gore is
planning to watch the primary returns on Tuesday night in
Tallahassee, a sign that he intends to compete in the state.

 &HT;    It's Earnhardt by a bumper
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Earnhardt was the first Chevrolet driver to take
advantage of NASCAR's rule change.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, the Intimidator, nipped Bobby Labonte in a
photo-finish in the Cracker Barrel 500 for one of the closest
finishes in Winston Cup history. Earnhardt's crew was so unsure of
the outcome that they waited several seconds for the official word
before celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I did beat him,'' Earnhardt said. ``When we were
getting close to the line, I looked over and his car wasn't really
side-by-side with me, as far as looking into the driver's door. So
I felt pretty good about our chances that we had beaten him out by
a nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who was trying to win the second straight Winston Cup
race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, admitted being confused about which
one of the cars would head to victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I had no idea (who won) at first . . . I couldn't
tell,'' Labonte said. ``So yes, there was an element of doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   After three lackluster races to start the 2000 season, NASCAR
was rescued by Sunday's race at AMS. There were 12 cars that left
the race early because of accidents or mechanical problems, plenty
of three-wide racing, and -- most importantly -- 30 lead changes
among 17 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That race was boring, wasn't it?'' Earnhardt joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew all along if we could just get Dale in an equal car,
the same deal (as the others), we can win races,'' team owner
Richard Childress said. ``It proved it today.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last month, Childress has complained publicly about
the Fords having an ``unfair advantage'' over the Chevys. The
complaints by the high-profile owner apparently paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make the playing field more competitive, NASCAR
announced last Monday that the Chevy teams could add two inches to
the front-air dam for a more-balanced ride. Oddly enough, that was
just about the margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Three Chevy drivers, including Steve Park and Joe Nemechek,
finished in the top five, giving the Monte Carlos their best
performance of the season. In the three previous races, Ford
drivers had won twice and captured the pole position in all three
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped, obviously,'' said Jeff Gordon, who had a
season-best finish of ninth in the No. 24 Chevy. ``It's hard to say
what we would've been like at this racetrack without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nemechek: ``I think the rule change helped us some, but
it's hard to judge it off one race.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the Ford and Pontiac teams complained after the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two inches make a big difference, doesn't it . . . in this
game of inches?'' said Doug Yates, engine-builder for Robert Yates
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has taken Ford out of picture,'' said Jimmy Spencer,
driver of the No. 26 Ford. ``Chevrolets get up behind you now, and
they loosen up the Fords. Now, you've got to own a Chevy because
you get everything you ask for if you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Legendary driver Richard Petty, who owns the Pontiac teams of
Kyle Petty and John Andretti, was not happy after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevrolet won, didn't they? Wouldn't you say the change made
the difference? It was pretty obvious, I thought,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who drove the No. 6 Ford to a third-place finish,
became angry when asked about the rule change. Modifications have
been a sore subject since Martin complained several seasons ago
about the Chevys having an unfair advantage over the Ford
Thunderbirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't comment on rule changes since Dale Earnhardt sent me a
crying towel at Charlotte four years ago,'' Martin said. ``I'll
never comment on that again.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of Martin's comments on Sunday, Earnhardt replied,
``That was all in fun. Everybody in this sport is competitive. If I
sat here and (was happy) with second, third or last, then Richard
Childress Racing wouldn't want me to drive my car.''

NO. 1 CONNECTICUT, YAWN, AGAIN GAINS THE TOP BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have dominated and decimated nearly every opponent they
faced this season, never so much as slipping from the top slot in
the polls and missing an unblemished record by just 2 points. So it
was understandable why the members of the Connecticut women's
basketball team were slouched in their chairs Sunday night, looking
as if they were ready for naps, as the brackets for the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament were announced. Yawn,
the Huskies are No. 1 again, this time the top seed over all in the
64-team tournament and the top seed in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (30-1) will play host to the first- and second-round
games at Storrs, Conn., and will face Furman (20-10) _ which earned
an automatic bid by winning the Southern Conference _ in the
opening round. The other top seeds are Tennessee (28-3) in the
Mideast, Louisiana Tech (28-2) in the Midwest and Georgia (29-3),
which was sent to the West for the fifth time in the nine
tournaments, much to the chagrin of Coach Andy Landers, who has
grumbled for the last several days about his team's likely
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (22-7), the runner-up to Connecticut in the Big East
tournament, is the second seed in the West and will play host to
the first two rounds and open against Holy Cross on Friday. Rutgers
will likely then head to Portland, Ore., for its next two games,
and might have to face a hot Mississippi State team, which upset
Auburn and shocked Georgia in the Southeastern Conference
tournament and nearly upended Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said before the selections that I didn't want to go to
Portland, not because of the teams that are out there but because
of how far we have to travel,'' said Rutgers Coach C. Vivian
Stringer. ``I don't know what we are going to do. Our ultimate goal
is to return to the East to play in the Final Four in Philadelphia.
We know we have a tremendous amount of work to do to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament selection committee arranged the brackets so the
Huskies would face Tennessee in the championship April 2 in
Philadelphia. No. 2 Tennessee not only gets to play host to the
first two rounds in Knoxville, but faces the likelihood of playing
in a home away from home _ Memphis _ for the Sweet 16 and Elite
Eight. Connecticut and Tennessee split their home-and-home series
this season, each team winning on the other's home floor, but if
they are the tournament favorites _ and the objects of anticipation
for a rematch, they still face a tough three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, making its 12th straight tournament appearance,
drew an exceptionally tough bracket. To advance the Huskies will
likely need to defeat fourth-seeded Purdue, the Big Ten champion
and defending national champion, and second-seeded Duke, the
Atlantic Coast Conference champion and last year's national
runner-up. Still, there are generally few early-round upsets in the
women's tournament. Last year, all 16 top seeds advanced to the
Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to convince your players that if we play as well as
we did against Louisiana Tech, Penn State, Tennessee at Tennessee
that we will win,'' said Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma. ``Ten or
12 teams have a legitimate chance. I like our chances. We had an
unbelievable year. We have beaten everyone we needed to beat. We
have proven we are the No. 1 team in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State apparently did not. There was speculation that Penn
State deserved one of the top seeds after finishing 26-4. But the
Lady Lions lost to Purdue in the Big Ten final, and the selection
committee chairwoman, Bernadette McGlade, explained that Louisiana
Tech, the Sunbelt tournament champion which remained in the top
four all year, stepped in when Penn State stumbled, even though
Louisiana Tech has declined from its long-time dominance of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penn State did a great job in the Big Ten,'' McGlade said.
``One thing Louisiana Tech had was a nice nonconference schedule.
They beat Tennessee. It was a very close situation. Had Penn State
won the Big Ten, I think it would have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty conferences were granted automatic bids for the 200
championship and the remaining 34 teams were selected at-large. The
SEC and Big 12 Conference each had six teams, and the ACC had five.
The Big East got four in: Connecticut, Rutgers, Notre Dame, the
second seed in the Mideast, and Boston College, the fifth seed in
the Mideast. Unlike the men, the women's tournament opens with
first- and second-round games played at 16 campus sites beginning
Friday. The top 16 teams play host, but because of a scheduling
conflict, Mississippi State, the third seed in the West, could not;
so the hosting assignment went to the next highest seed in the
group of four: Oregon, the sixth seed.
</P>
<P>
   McGlade conceded that this was one of the toughest fields her
committee had ever had, and she said the selectors could have used
68 slots. There were a few surprises, especially from conferences
that typically only place one team in the field. Pepperdine, with a
power rating in the 70s, made the field as an at-large with a 21-9
record from the West Coast Conference, along with Maine (20-10),
from the America East.
</P>
<P>
   Left out were Florida, which had a tough schedule and high power
rating, but just 17 victories. Florida, McGrade said, was a victim
of the improvement in women's basketball. There were simply too
many qualified teams to jam into too few slots.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was so much parity,'' McGrade said. ``A lot of very good
teams had only 17 wins. The competition for the at-large spaces was
so tight. This was an extremely difficult tournament. We really had
more than 34 at-large teams.''

CIA OFFICIALS DIFFER ON DEUTCH CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George J. Tenet, the director of the CIA, has
defended his part in the agency's investigation of his predecessor,
John Deutch, by arguing that he played a largely passive role in
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But former officials of the CIA who were involved in the case
have offered statements that contradict Tenet's version, arguing
that Tenet was more fully informed about Deutch's security breach
than he has publicly acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In their depictions of how the case was handled, the former
officials suggested that Tenet, who was Deutch's deputy and then
succeeded him, had the information and the means to ensure that an
effective investigation of Deutch was conducted, but at important
points failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting statements show how much finger-pointing has
occurred among officials involved in the investigation since the
agency's handling of the case came under question.
</P>
<P>
   The differing accounts come from two former officials who have
been criticized for their actions in the case: Nora Slatkin, the
former executive director of the CIA, and Frederick Hitz, the
former inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tenet's role has not received much attention, because
it appeared that he had not been kept fully informed about the
handling of the investigation by other CIA officials, statements by
Slatkin and Hitz have presented a conflicting picture. Slatkin has
given her version of events to the agency's inspector general, and
Hitz elaborated in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences are significant because, after questions were
raised about how the case was handled, Attorney General Janet Reno
announced that the Justice Department would review the case to
determine whether a criminal investigation should be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   The case began as Deutch was leaving office in December 1996,
when the agency's security specialists discovered that he had
improperly kept classified material on unsecure computers in his
home, including information about some of the government's most
sensitive covert operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Tenet did not take action for more than a year after the
discovery. During that time, the CIA did not formally notify the
Justice Department that Deutch might have broken the law, and, in
1997, officials allowed the agency's internal investigation to
languish, the CIA's inspector general later found.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the Deutch security breach was only revived
in 1998 after the CIA's inspector general was told by a CIA
official that the investigation had not been handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, 1998, the CIA's inspector general finally notified
the Justice Department that Deutch might have broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, the Justice Department decided not to prosecute
Deutch. In August, after the inspector general's report had been
completed, Tenet suspended Deutch's security clearances.
</P>
<P>
   L. Britt Snider, who became the CIA's inspector general in 1998,
concluded in his 1999 report that Tenet ``should have involved
himself more forcefully to ensure a proper resolution of this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has accepted the criticism, explaining that he was
distracted by his protracted struggle for Senate confirmation and
other matters. But he has also suggested that he was not kept
adequately informed by other CIA officials.
</P>
<P>
   He has said, for instance, that no one told him that the CIA's
internal security office had finished its work in summer 1997 and
that it was time for him to act.
</P>
<P>
   But Slatkin has contradicted Tenet's assertion that he was never
told that the investigation had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin has testified that in summer 1997, she reviewed the
security office's final report and ``personally handed it to
Tenet,'' according to the inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet subsequently told the inspector general that he did ``not
remember ever seeing (the security office) report, nor does he
recall any details of the report,'' the inspector general's report
said. ``He said it is possible that someone told him about the
report, or showed it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin and Tenet also provided conflicting statements about
their actions early in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin told the inspector general that she notified Tenet about
the discovery of classified material on Deutch's computers almost
immediately after the material was discovered on Dec. 17, 1996. She
added that there were ``multiple discussions with Tenet over
time,'' about the way the case was proceeding. She said that
``everything had his concurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that she had told Tenet early on that she did not
feel comfortable handling the case, because of her close
professional relationship with Deutch, whom she had worked with for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin told the inspector general that she had explained to
Tenet that handling an investigation of Deutch ``was too sensitive
for her, and Tenet had the responsibility for making the decisions
relating to the Deutch incident.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she was concerned that others at the CIA would
perceive that she and Michael O'Neil, then the agency's general
counsel, were too close to Deutch and should recuse themselves. But
she told the inspector general that Tenet still ``gave her
responsibility for coordinating this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet disputed Slatkin's statements. He told the inspector
general that Slatkin and O'Neil, who had previously been Deutch's
chief of staff, wanted to handle the investigation. He said he
believed that ``Slatkin and O'Neil did not want to place Tenet in
the position of adjudicating a matter involving Deutch,'' the
inspector general's report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Harlow, a CIA spokesman, said that Tenet stands by his
testimony in the face of the conflicting statements by Slatkin..
Tenet's version is ``supported by other peoples' recollections,''
Harlow added. And whatever her concerns, Slatkin did quickly assume
a lead role in the investigation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Frederick Hitz, the former inspector general of the
CIA, said in an interview that in fall 1997, he met with Tenet and
Snider, then a special assistant to Tenet, about the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   Hitz said he told Tenet and Snider that the inspector general's
office was taking an interest in the case. Hitz said he was, in
effect, putting Tenet on notice that the inspector general's office
was monitoring the progress of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Tenet did not respond by moving to revive the case, Hitz
said. In 1998, Hitz launched an investigation into the Deutch case,
just before he was succeeded by Snider.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet and Snider say that a meeting with Hitz did not occur in
fall 1997, Harlow said. While Hitz met frequently with Tenet in
that time, Snider has checked the files of the inspector general's
office for Hitz's memos about those meetings, and they do not
indicate that the case was raised by Hitz, Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Slatkin and Hitz, like Tenet, were criticized in the
inspector general's 1999 report. Slatkin, with O'Neil, was cited
for taking actions that ``had the effect of delaying a prompt and
thorough investigation.'' Hitz, meanwhile, was cited for failing to
``ensure the timely and definitive resolution'' of the case.

INTERNET JAM SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENNY EVANGELISTA  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
``EB'' in London beamed his drum solo across the Internet. A few
minutes later, ``Daze,'' sitting in another part of London, sent
over a base guitar track to accompany the drums.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hearing that mix inspired ``Girlie,'' a singer who was logged on
from her home in San Francisco, to contribute her own blues-style
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday morning, oooohhh Monday morning. Can't seem to get it
together,'' Girlie sang.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical jam session, with the three musicians feeding
off one another's creativity as they would if they sat together in
a recording studio or gathered around a piano.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the artists _ who were thousands of miles and
several time zones apart _ were brought together in a ``virtual
studio'' to demonstrate a new software program made by a small San
Francisco firm called Rocket Network Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The program, RocketPower, lets musicians and producers
collaborate on songs or other projects without having to travel or
ship audio tapes back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   RocketPower works in conjunction with other software programs
designed to turn a computer into a recording studio with the use of
a microphone, keyboard, electric guitar or other instrument plugged
into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this week, a free version of one of those recording
programs infused with RocketPower will be available for download
through a musicians' Web portal,  &LR; www.harmony-central.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The program is called Logic Rocket, a scaled-down version of
more expensive programs for music professionals by Emagic Soft-und
Hardware of Germany. The free version will be available for both
the PC and the Apple Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Using Logic Rocket, musicians can record and mix up to four
digital audio tracks and then mix in up to 12 additional tracks
from other artists on the Internet, said Emagic Communications
Director Bob Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site will also have free virtual recording studios.
Similar to Internet chat rooms, the virtual studios provide a place
in cyberspace where musicians and singers from anywhere can drop in
for impromptu jam sessions, as long as they have the same software.
Both Harmony Central and Rocket Network hope to make money by
leasing secure private Net studios for artists who want to work on
and save their creations.
</P>
<P>
   Professional audio and video producers say such Internet
collaborations will have a dramatic effect on their industry. And
Rocket Network executives hope the virtual studios appeal to the
millions of people who play a musical instrument as a hobby, a
market that by one estimate is as much as one-quarter of the U.S.
population alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone should have thought of this earlier, it makes so much
sense,'' said Eric Cody, owner of New Millennium Music, a New York
music and commercial production company. ``It's almost like being
there when the Model-T was invented.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody said he's excited about ``the possibility of being able to
take care of a session with singers or instrumentalists in L.A.
while I'm here in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody was the first to lease an Internet recording studio two
weeks ago when it was introduced by Steinberg Soft-und Hardware
GmbH, another German firm that has cut a deal with Rocket Network
to offer RocketPower online services to its customers. Steinberg
has sold about 1 million copies of its Cubase, an audio production
program aimed at the professional market.
</P>
<P>
   In just the first week, more than 1,000 people registered for
Cubase's online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in one session with a guy from Belgium, a guy from
Denmark, a guy from Hungary, two guys from the U.S. and three guys
from Japan,'' said Rodney Orpheus, head of Internet services for
Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like Cubase and Emagic, known as audio sequencer tools,
aren't well known to the general public, but they have become key
tools used in the music, television and film industries.
</P>
<P>
   The days when songs were created in one studio session
disappeared three decades ago with the advent of multitrack tape
machines, which allow sound engineers to add new instruments and
other sounds long after the original singers and musicians have
packed up and gone.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, songs from Grammy-Award-winning artists like Christina
Aguilera may take weeks or months of post-production work using
digital audio production tools to blend the right mix of
instrumentals and vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, producers and artists still had to gather in
studios to record their separate tracks, or tape the tracks and
ship the tape back and forth by overnight mail. Another alternative
was to use expensive high-speed T1 lines or even satellite hookups
to connect studios.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocket Network's program lets musicians and producers meet
online at the same time to send sound samples back and forth to be
fine-tuned into a final product.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus said the rise of home computers and various audio
recording and mixing software available has also caused an
``explosion of do-it-yourself music in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Two or three decades ago, ``to make a record cost you $50,000 to
hire a big studio full of big machines,'' Orpheus said. ``Now you
can get the same functionality for $399 (for a music program) that
runs on a home computer.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ability to connect online, ``Now, anybody can make a
record with anybody else in the whole world,'' he said. ``Next
year's Beatles could be living in a basement in Boise, Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocket Network CEO Pam Miller hopes the company can cash in on
leases for the private Web studios to artists who want to create a
constant, secure spot for online collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   Annual leases for the private studios range from $99 to $599 per
year, with rates that depend on how much the studio is used and how
much computer storage space it takes. Miller said that still
compares well to the $100 to $300 an hour charged by some physical
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Miller believes Rocket Networks can tap a $2.6 billion
professional audio production market, which includes voice-overs
for commercials and post-production work done on movies. But she
said there is a potential $16 billion a year market from amateur
hobbiests and musicians who are now playing in their living rooms
but may want to jam online with their counterparts around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket Network, which has 35 employees, was founded in 1995 in
England by British musicians Willy Henshall and Tim Bran with U.S.
software developers Canton Becker and Matt Moller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got interested in the inefficiencies with the way sound
recording is done,'' said Henshall, who is best known as a member
of Londonbeat, a British R&AMP;B group whose best-selling hit was
``I've Been Thinking About You'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in pushing the boundaries
artistically,'' he said. ``This allows music to be created that
could not have been created at all. Your creative options have
expanded because of the people you can reach.''
</P>
<P>
   The company moved to San Francisco in 1998 and attracted
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's attention. Allen's venture
capital firm, Vulcan Ventures, owns a 40 percent stake in Rocket
Networks and also sent Miller to the company to steer its business
development.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Palo Alto's DigiDesign, which makes high-end
software and equipment used by about 85 percent of the audio and
video production industry, announced a development partnership with
Rocket Networks. As part of that deal, DigiDesign bought a 20
percent stake in Rocket Networks, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Malcolm Maclachlan of International Data Corp. said
another online firm, mH2O.com of New York, will soon launch its own
Web music collaboration software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where the Net is ripe to really
start affecting how people make music and allow for more
collaboration,'' Maclachlan said. ``I think there's going to be a
lot of companies competing to be the service provider there.''

U.S. LEADS WORLD IN EXPORT OF TECH PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LAZARUS  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
The United States solidified its position as tech toy store to the
world last year as exports of digital gear reached a record
$181billion, accounting for 26 percent of all U.S. goods sold
abroad, a leading industry group says in a report to be released
today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Electronics Association, representing about 3,000
of the nation's biggest technology companies, based its findings on
analyses of more than 65 world markets where the United States
sells at least $50 million in high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Cybernation 2.0,'' was compiled in
conjunction with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   It finds that the 15-nation European Union was the biggest
market for U.S. tech and telecommunications hardware, with exports
to the region hitting $43 billion and U.S. manufacturers investing
$31 billion in local facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual countries, tech sales to Canada led the way at
$29 billion, followed by Mexico ($22 billion), Japan ($16 billion),
Britain ($11 billion), South Korea ($10 billion) and Germany ($9
billion).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming almost irrelevant what trade barriers may exist
in each country because companies are still buying technology and,
in many cases, that technology now comes from the U.S.,'' William
Archey, president of the American Electronics Association, said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that tech products will account for at least a
third of U.S. exports within just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and computer components are on the shopping lists of
most countries, along with the assorted devices _ servers, routers,
switches and so on _ that provide the plumbing for information
networks. Many developing nations also have active interest in
procuring U.S. medical technologies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising findings in the association's study,
Archey said, was that while Japan remains America's single largest
tech market in the Asia-Pacific region, it has been surpassed by
Singapore in terms of investment by U.S. manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech money tends to flow where it's treated most
warmly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason U.S. tech outfits are turning left at Tokyo
and settling in Singapore is because of Japan's recession, Archey
observed. But he also cited continued barriers to free trade
erected by the Japanese government, as well as a lack of
venture-capital funding and a culture that shuns risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Silicon Valley ethos is something the rest of the
world realizes it will have to adapt to,'' Archey said. ``But in
places like Japan, that ethos flies in the face of government
control and some of the cultural considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   For Japan to return to its former status as an economic
powerhouse, ``there are lots of things that are going to have to
change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   China is another matter. Although U.S. tech exports to China
totaled just $3.3 billion last year, the electronics association
expects the country's appetite for all things digital to surge in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a country that's hell-bent on becoming
more technologically advanced,'' Archey said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, cellular phone use in China soared by 3,600 percent
between 1993 and 1999, the association's study finds. And with just
13 personal computers for every 1,000 of its 1.3 billion people,
China has virtually unlimited growth potential for PC and
chipmakers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Congress still must grant China most-favored
trade status prior to China joining the World Trade Organization
and opening its market wider to American technology firms. While
President Clinton has pushed hard in recent days for legislators to
act, the outcome is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a close vote,'' Archey said, ``but we think it will
get passed.'' A decision is expected by this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. tech exports to China have climbed by more than 120
percent since 1993, other nations have been even more aggressive in
shopping for the latest gadgetry from Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   According to the association's report, the Philippines tops the
list for fastest-growing major tech-export markets, with sales
nearly quadrupling since 1993. Sales to South Korea, Ireland and
Brazil, meanwhile, almost tripled in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The report forecasts that computer use in Asia will surpass that
of the United States and European Union by 2005, but that America
will remain out front in terms of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the United States leads the way in per-capita
computer use with 580 PCs for every 1,000 citizens, while Iceland
is tops online with 493 Internet users per 1,000 citizens.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Archey said world markets will remain hungry for ``anything
that's Internet related'' and added that more countries can be
expected to adopt America's high-speed business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the model for a long time to come,'' he said.

 ONLINE OUTPOSTS FLOCKING TO THE BAY AREA  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
When employees of BlueLight.com, the Internet arm of Kmart, stand
on the balcony of their new San Francisco office building, they
will have a view unlike anything they would see from their parent
company's headquarters in Troy, Mich. Instead of overlooking a
Midwestern prairie, BlueLight's new offices at Fisherman's Wharf
face whitecapped waves and the rugged Marin Headlands.
<P>
   Over the past year, many prominent brick-and-mortar companies
from across the nation have established their dot-com businesses
here. Like Kmart, they often select the Bay Area as their Internet
address rather than simply operating from their corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are diverse, including the availability of quality
workers and the proximity to venture capital. Some executives say
being too near the parent company can stifle creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of these online outposts in the Bay Area
appears to contradict the theory that the Internet makes the
location of an e-commerce firm irrelevant. Many out-of-state
companies are so convinced that the Bay Area is the ideal base for
their online businesses that they are willing to pay higher
salaries and real estate costs to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can recruit faster and more effectively in the Bay Area
than anywhere else in the world,'' said Jim Breyer, a director for
Wal-Mart.com, which recently moved from its parent company's
headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., to a temporary home in Palo Alto
and is looking for a permanent headquarters on the Peninsula.
``When you're trying to turbocharge a brick-and-mortar company on
the Internet, moving at light speed is the central challenge to
being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart.com, which has hired 10 employees and plans to add
another 190 by the end of the year, had considered moving to
Austin, Texas, and the East Coast. But Breyer, who is also a
managing partner at Accel Partners, Wal-Mart.com's major investor,
said the company chose the Bay Area because talented workers were
easier to find and software contractors and investors were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley is the center of the Internet,'' Breyer said.
``That can't be said of Bentonville or any other place.''
</P>
<P>
   Luring Bay Area technology workers out-of-state is difficult,
Internet executives say. Many workers prefer the Bay Area to some
less cosmopolitan corporate hometowns. Others want to live where
there is a high concentration of technology companies so they can
easily jump to another job.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Bay Area's reputation as the capital of the
Internet world can also be its curse. David Karraker, a spokesman
for Kmart's BlueLight.com, which moved to San Francisco in
December, said his company must pay higher salaries and may suffer
greater employee turnover because of its relocation to the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have to pay more, but your site will be better at the
end of the day,'' Karraker said. ``In the long term, it pays quite
well to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   BlueLight.com currently has 60 employees and expects to hire
another 140 to 240.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart moved BlueLight.com to the Bay Area primarily because of
worker availability and easy access to investors. But Karraker
added that being 2,000 miles from Kmart headquarters is also a
bonus, though the two offices are linked directly by videophone and
executives travel between San Francisco and Michigan nearly every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever starting an Internet venture, it's important to be
slightly removed from a retail parent that has been around since
the 1800s,'' Karraker said, ``even if they've been wildly
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some out-of-state companies establish their Internet operations
in the Bay Area from their inception. For example, Macys.com, owned
by the Macy's retail store chain from Cincinnati, has been based in
San Francisco at the Union Square offices of its parent company,
Federated Department Stores, for all of its two years.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms like Encyclopedia Britannica, from Chicago, locate
just part of their online businesses to the Bay Area.
Britannica.com's Internet education unit is currently in the South
of Market neighborhood, but will move to the Presidio in June.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of e-commerce companies in the Bay Area
appears to run contrary to the Internet's early billing that it
would allow people to work on equal footing anywhere in the world.
The reality, according to Rashi Glazer, a marketing professor at
the University of California at Berkeley, is that location still
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Glazer said that technology companies need to be surrounded by
other technology companies to take advantage of what he calls the
``water cooler phenomenon.'' Proximity allows people in an industry
to informally share ideas and keep abreast of the latest
innovations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to think of Silicon Valley is as one big water
cooler,'' Glazer said. ``So much of what people learn needs to be
done face-to-face. Certain things can be automated or virtualized,
but some things can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Though several out-of-state companies have established Internet
outposts in the Bay Area, the economic impact is probably minimal,
Glazer said. The technology industry is so big locally and real
estate competition so fierce that a few hundred jobs does not make
much of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether these companies come or not does not make much of an
impact,`` Glazer said. ``We do not suffer from a lack of Internet
companies.''

   Dates for the NCAA dance
</P>
<P>
   By Tony Barnhart
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Both the SEC and the ACC had reasons to howl when the
64-team field for the men's NCAA Basketball Tournament was released
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC joined the Big Ten and Big 12 in receiving six bids. But
when Arkansas played their way in by winning the SEC Tournament,
the NCAA selection committee dropped out Vanderbilt. The Commodores
were 19-10, with two wins over Tennessee and one each against
Florida and LSU.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the only reason the SEC had to be upset. After a
season of being rated as the nation's No. 1 conference, no SEC team
was seeded higher than No. 4. LSU (West) and Tennessee (South) were
No. 4 seeds, while Florida (East) and Kentucky (Midwest) were
seeded No. 5. Auburn is a No. 7 seed in the Midwest and Arkansas is
a No. 11 seed in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC is steamed as well. Once considered the nation's best
conference, the ACC received only three bids for the second
straight year. Duke, its champion, was the No. 1 seed in the East.
Maryland was No. 3 in the tough Midwest and North Carolina received
its 26th consecutive bid as the No. 8 seed in South. Left out,
however, was 19-11 Virginia which had beaten North Carolina (18-14)
twice and Maryland once during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The anger of the ACC and SEC wasn't eased when it saw UNLV in
the field as an at-large team despite not having a win against a
Top 25 team. Craig Thompson, the commissioner of UNLV's Mountain
West Conference, is the chairman of the selection committee. The
Mountain West does not have an automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also raised some eyebrows with its No. 1 seeds. As
expected, Cincinnati dropped to a No. 2 seed after the
season-ending injury to Kenyon Martin. Duke was No. 1 in the East
and Big Ten champion Michigan State was No. 1 in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee also gave No. 1 seeds to both both Arizona and
Stanford of the Pac-10. Arizona, which beat Stanford twice during
the regular season, remained in the West while Stanford was shipped
South. Temple (26-5), which many thought had played its way into a
No. 1 seed, is the No. 2 seed in the East.

   The last teams to receive at-large bids were St. Bonaventure,
Indiana State, Pepperdine, Dayton, Seton Hall and UNLV. In addition

 OFF-LABEL DRUG USE PUTS FDA IN TUG OF WAR  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Every drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration comes
with a label that says, ``Take only as directed.'' But doctors
often ignore the rules and prescribe medicines for causes the FDA
never approved.
<P>
   AIDS researchers, for instance, have used cancer remedies to
fight HIV infections. These kind of off-label uses _ which the FDA
has no power over _ sometimes provide the only treatments
available.
</P>
<P>
   But when physicians write about these off-label uses in
scientific journals, drug companies want to mail reprints of these
articles to other doctors _ subtly encouraging them to prescribe
the drug in unapproved ways.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the FDA and its opponents _ the drug lobby and some
conservative legal groups _ have disagreed over whether the agency
can regulate this drug company practice of publicizing off-label
research.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., decided
the issue, but since each side claimed victory, the dispute remains
murky.
</P>
<P>
   A government source said the court reaffirmed FDA rules for
mailing out reprints. A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America called that assertion ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the rules themselves are arcane, the off-label dispute
exemplifies an important philosophic divide in our pill-popping
society.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are those who want strong FDA rules, not just on
off-label drugs but on herbal and botanical remedies, to protect
consumers from ``every quack and charlatan,'' in the words of Paul
Stolley, an epidemiologist with the University of Maryland School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, an odd alliance of conservative groups and
alternative medicine activists is doing the drug industry the favor
of painting FDA bureaucrats as the enemy of medical choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If doctors and patients really think something is worth
trying, do we really want the FDA to say no?'' argued Dan Troy,
attorney for the Washington Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the WLF that challenged the FDA's off-label rules in
court, but its allies in the battle include the Competitive
Enterprise Institute (CEI), a libertarian think tank that would
like to diminish the FDA's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody who is sick reads about something and wants the
therapy, they have the right not just to seek these remedies but be
passionate about it,'' said CEI legal director Sam Kazman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the off-label issue is the current focus of debate,
Kazman applies this same patient choice philosophy to
nonprescription botanical or herbal therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress deregulated these products in 1994. Ever since, some
medical experts have argued that these pseudo-drugs aren't
adequately tested for safety or usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Kazman, arguing a point that would resonate with the alternative
medicine advocates, wants to keep the FDA out of the herbal
marketplace. ``It's a matter of making up one's own mind versus
having some bureaucrat in Washington make the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FDA defenders would agree with Kazman on one point _ the
off-label dispute, and the simmering controversy over herbal
remedies, are part and parcel of the same debate over how much
power the FDA should have to regulate and approve health products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA is not without fault, but it is a model for the
world,'' Stolley maintained, arguing that the agency is ``being
weakened by well-meaning people who think that because something is
a botanical it's safer, or that their personal freedom is infringed
because some (off-label drug) has to be tested'' before doctors put
it into general use.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area plays a role in this tug of war over the FDA.
Stolley blames AIDS activists for ``practically wrecking drug
regulation by having special (FDA testing) standards set up to
approve their drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area also remains a stronghold of alternative and herbal
therapies that Congress removed from FDA pre-market testing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, local biotech firms are churning out new
prescription remedies _ and challenging the FDA to hurry its
process for approving them.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the pace of discovery is increasing _ not to mention
the growing consumption of medicines by aging Baby Boomers _ the
FDA seems destined to perform a thankless job.
</P>
<P>
   If it's slow in approving new prescription medicines, industry
lobbyists and patient advocate groups hound it for being too
cautious. But when it approves medicines that turn out to have
deadly side effects _ as seems to be occurring with some of the new
diabetes drugs _ consumer watchdog groups demand safety recalls and
congressional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical experts would like to see FDA-approved safety tests
of deregulated herbal remedies, but conservative groups and
counterculture activists would probably join forces to defeat any
such move.
</P>
<P>
   So we stand in the middle of a medical revolution _ several
revolutions, in fact, from the development of gene-based drugs to
the revival of ancient Chinese herbs. And to all but a few
defenders, FDA officials seem to be the dowdy bureaucrats in the
way.
</P>
<P>
   _BLOWING BUBBLES: A couple of weeks ago, I suggested that the
current bio-mania might be an unsustainable bubble, driven in part
by momentum money flowing into biotech mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, biotech shares have gotten a bit of a
comeuppance. The American Stock Exchange biotech, which reflects
the performance of 15 larger firms, fell from 794 to 688, ending
the week down 13 percent. The Nasdaq biotech stock index, which
tracks 200 firms, posted similar losses.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from mutual fund flows, it's not yet clear whether
this is a temporary pause in a bullish sector or the start of a
decline or plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adler, president of AMG Services, the mutual fund
tracking agency, said $800 million a week was flowing into biotech
mutual funds when we spoke a few weeks ago. That was a 2.5 percent
weekly increase in the amount of money chasing biotech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As of March 1, the inflow had increased to $1.3 billion a week.
``Assets are increasing 4 percent each week on average from new
investor flows,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   The money had been flowing to the sector because of its hot
performance, further inflating the price of biotech stocks. The
question now is whether the inflow of money will stop as abruptly
as it began.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lag in the measurements, but I'll check back soon to
see whether the current cooling in biotech has reversed the funds
flow that has helped drive the rally _ or whether money continues
to pour in, making a rebound likely.

 NEW DRY CLEANING SERVICE SEEKS DOT-COM RICHES  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Some people look at stained suits, crumpled blouses and grubby
slacks and see, well, dirty laundry. Payam Zamani looks at them and
sees a chance to create a nationwide chain of Internet-enabled dry
cleaners.
<P>
   Zamani has founded PurpleTie.com, which will offer dry cleaning
and laundry services to the Bay Area starting in July. Its pitch:
Internet ordering, free pickup and delivery at customers' doors,
next-day service, environmentally sound cleaning practices,
competitive rates.
</P>
<P>
   PurpleTie has plans to open shop in 28 metropolitan markets over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, it wants to expand into other concierge services:
film processing, shoe shining, maybe diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will build a convenience portal,'' Zamani said.
</P>
<P>
   But making big bucks from dry cleaning is harder than getting
motor oil out of a white suede Armani, according to industry
research. And it's not clear whether Pleasanton's PurpleTie or any
potential competitors will find the business lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   David Uchic, spokesman for the International Fabricare
Institute, an industry trade group, said profit margins for dry
cleaners ``are in the single digits _ quite modest.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamani disputes that, saying dry cleaners underreport to the
IRS. He said net margins are 20 to 30 percent; gross margins are
over 60 percent. The IFI says annual receipts total $8 billion,
while Zamani says his analysis shows them to be roughly $24
billion, or about $250,000 per cleaner per year, in line with Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet estimates.
</P>
<P>
   PurpleTie is now building a $16 million dry cleaning plant in
Manteca (San Joaquin County) and spending another $4 million on a
fleet of 170 trucks. The plant will eschew perchloroethylene, or
``perk,'' a toxic solvent and possible carcinogen used by most dry
cleaners, instead using hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide as cleaning
agents.
</P>
<P>
   PurpleTie step vans will come to customers' homes and offices
within a 30-minute window. To streamline the long haul to Manteca,
the company will set up five regional hubs, where the step vans
will deliver laundry for tractor-trailer transport to and from the
dry cleaning plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental question is whether the additional costs of
pickup and drop off will (be less than) what they save by not
having to pay for commercial real estate,'' said Ken Cassar, senior
analyst with Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The highly fragmented dry cleaning industry has never had a
gargantuan chain on the order of Blockbuster or Starbucks. Most of
the 98,000 dry cleaners in the United States are mom-and-pop
operations _ two-thirds of them are so small that they don't have
employees, according to the U.S. Economic Census.
</P>
<P>
   Zamani isn't the only entrepreneur who looks at the staid
industry and sees a chance to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Krasnow, a founder of office superstore chain Staples, last
year started Zoots, a dry cleaning chain that offers 24/7 drop offs
and pickups (at storefronts, not customers' homes), drive-through
service, environmentally friendly cleaning and Internet monitoring
of account status. Zoots now has 18 stores in New England, but it
plans nationwide expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Streamline of Massachusetts, partially backed by Nordstrom,
offers home delivery of groceries, plus dry cleaning and film
processing, in Boston and Washington, D.C. It's now expanding into
Chicago and plans to be in 20 markets by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   And other dot-com companies, notably online grocers Webvan and
HomeGrocer, which already come to customers' homes, are expected to
add dry-cleaning services to fatten their bottom lines. Because
Webvan, which premiered in the Bay Area in June, has a distribution
system, customers and a brand in place, it would have a strong
advantage over another startup, said Evie Black Dykema, online
retail analyst with Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of whether dry cleaning is going out
of style. ``We have dry cleaners hanging on by their fingernails
due to the casualization of American culture,'' Uchic said.
</P>
<P>
   But Valerie Frederickson, president of a Menlo Park career
management consulting company, thinks that there is still a need.
In Silicon Valley, ``people dress in snappy casual,'' she said.
``That means very expensive knits for women, all-cotton Faconnable
shirts for men. That all needs to be dry cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one market segment, however, that will never need dry
cleaning. ``Programmers' managers are lucky if they take showers
daily and fold their T-shirts so they're not wrinkled,''
Frederickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Zamani said he expects to spend $400 million for nationwide
expansion, and he hopes each region will turn a profit within two
to three years of launch. So far, he has largely financed PurpleTie
himself (Xoom.com founder Chris Kitzke is also an investor), but is
now soliciting a new round of capital.
</P>
<P>
   This is Zamani's second Internet startup; with his older
brother, Frank, Zamani founded Autoweb.com in 1994. That company
has suffered from a glut of car-buying sites. Zamani owns slightly
under 14 percent of Autoweb, which has a market cap of about $200
million _ down dramatically from $1.2 billion shortly after its
March 1999 IPO.

WINE, WITH ASSORTED ADDITIVES, IS POPULAR IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes ``12.5 million'' to ``13 million'' in graf that
begins ``With the customs ...'') 
 (lb) 
 By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Yao Yun pulls the cork on a bottle of red wine
in a fashionable restaurant here and does something that might
horrify a Frenchman: He pours himself half a glass and tops it up
with Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine tastes too bitter, but the more we drink mixed wine, the
more we like it,'' says the young graphic designer, pouring a
second glass for his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine is a la mode in China's increasingly prosperous cities
these days, particularly at wedding banquets and karaoke bars. It
has replaced the cognac that people here downed by the tumblerful a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to lax regulation and unscrupulous vintners, much of
the wine in China is of poor quality. Many people mix white wine
with Coca-Cola or red wine with Sprite to make the wine more
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Though Yao's bottle of wine carries a local label, it might
contain cheap table wine from Spain that has sat for months in a
giant plastic shipping bag. Or it might not hold what people in the
West would consider wine at all: There is no law that red wine must
be made from grapes, though there is a ``recommended standard''
that grapes be used for at least half the content.
</P>
<P>
   Bottlers are supposed to list the ingredients on the label, but
there is often plenty left unsaid. Some wine is made from cheap
apple-juice concentrate, with grain alcohol and color added,
viticulturists say. Some is just colored sugar water, with
flavoring and alcohol but no fruit juice at all. Counterfeiting is
rife, with only a printing press needed to turn cooking wine into
``claret.''
</P>
<P>
   That disturbs Western merchants who had hoped to cultivate a
billion wine-bibbers after Beijing began promoting fruit-based
alcoholic beverages as an alternative to traditional 160-proof
Chinese spirits a few years ago. Chinese liquor is made from grain
that the government would rather people ate than imbibed.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by reports of the health benefits of moderate wine
consumption, the government's nudge started a stampede for red
wine. The Chinese do not ascribe any special aphrodisiac qualities
to wine, as they do to some hard liquor, but as in the West, wine
has a romantic aura.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden demand quickly sucked dry China's small vineyards,
which are mostly vestiges of Western wineries from pre-communist
days. Wine factories even used up Chinese grape varieties like
Cow's Nipple or Dragon's Eye, which are considered too sweet for
dry Western wines.
</P>
<P>
   To slake the sudden thirst, Chinese bottlers started importing
cheap European wine, shipped in huge 22,000-liter bags that each
fill a 20-foot steel freight container.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Rovira was in charge of international sales at the
Bodegas Felix Solis winery in Spain at the time. The dapper
Spaniard says his fax machine began whirring with order after order
from China in 1996. ``People wanted four, five containers in the
first order, no sample required,'' he says now from his mostly
empty warehouse just west of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The world's wine business quickly fell under the spell of the
potentially vast China market. Winemakers from Australia to Peru
came to scout for customers. Rovira moved to Shanghai, established
a bottling plant and began pumping wine from truck to tank as if it
were home-heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Soon even China's best-known local labels were wrapped around
bottles of cheap Western table wine, though they continued to claim
that they were made in China. ``China doesn't have enough grape
fields to meet the market demand, so it's hard to believe that any
of the big companies aren't importing from other countries,'' said
Wang Jiajian, an official at the Alcohol Monopoly Agency in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Chinese winemakers grew from a few dozen to more
than 300, bottling such wines as Grand Dragon and Tonghua, whose
label carries the ambiguous English phrase ``save and preserve five
years in oak wood bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dipsomania ran out of control: Though wine consumption
nearly tripled from 1996 to 1997, imports grew sixfold. China was
soon swimming in surplus wine. Twenty-year-old French wines
appeared on supermarket shelves at $3 or $4 a bottle, cheaper than
even local wines. Some were fake but some were genuine, smuggled in
and later dumped by cash-starved importers.
</P>
<P>
   China tried stemming the flow, first by enforcing
often-underpaid duties that more than double the cost of imported
wine, and then by banning French wine imports after detecting
traces of cow's blood in a few bottles. (Blood is sometimes used to
clarify wine, but the practice is outdated and is limited to a few
small regions of Europe.)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Chinese press was soon warning consumers that
they could catch mad cow disease by drinking French wine. China
lifted the ban after just two weeks last year, but the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid to drink any imported wine,
especially French wine,'' says Sun Cheng, manager of the Golden
Gate, a brightly lighted Shanghai restaurant that only serves
Chinese wines _ including one listed on the menu as French
Champagne Wine, though it comes from northern China.
</P>
<P>
   With the customs service cracking down and the market saturated,
importers began abandoning shipments at the docks. Wine executives
estimate that as much as 10,000 metric tons _ the equivalent of
about 13 million bottles _ was abandoned last year. A lot of it is
still sitting in government warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've imported so much wine that if they stopped today,
there's enough in the warehouses to last three or four years,''
said Rovira, whose profit margins and market have withered because
of competition from cheap wine.
</P>
<P>
   If no one claims the wine after three months, customs agents are
free to sell it _ which they do, at happy-hour prices. By that
time, the wine has been in plastic shipping bags for at least four
months, including time on the water. A lot of the wine on the
market today sat in shipping bags through the sweltering heat of
summer.
</P>
<P>
   That does not matter to most Chinese, who drink wine as they do
traditional Chinese spirits, in a ritualized swallow meant more for
show than for sensation. In the second-floor ballroom of the New
Asia Thomson Hotel in Shanghai recently, tables of flushed young
women and crew-cut young men gulped goblets of Imperial Court wine
_ produced by a grapefruit farm _ to a chorus of ``gan-bei,'' a
toast-cum-challenge that literally means ``dry cup.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it does concern those people trying to educate China's
palate. Sam Featherston, head of marketing for Montrose Food and
Wine Co., an American-owned importer and distributor of fine wines
in China, recalls that he was awakened one night by a bartender at
a karaoke club in Beijing who wanted a case of Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild at roughly $170 a bottle wholesale for the
cheapest vintage, one of Montrose's most expensive wines.
</P>
<P>
   Featherston delivered the wine personally by taxi and was
invited to spend the rest of the night with a party of toughs and a
dozen hired women, who swilled the wine mixed with Sprite and
watermelon slices.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `It's just like drinking the local stuff, so why
spend so much money?''' Featherston said, referring to such
ill-fated fine wines. But when they drink the local stuff on its
own, he adds, their eyes water and their throats burn and they
decide they do not like wine.
</P>
<P>
   Montrose is nurturing a growing band of oenophiles with its
60,000-bottle cellar _ actually a Mao-era bomb shelter in Beijing.
The company holds frequent wine tastings and caters to a few
connoisseurs. A director of the state arms-trading company buys
$100 bottles of sauternes by the case, Featherston says.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the wine is consumed in places like Shanghai's
Famous Grouse karaoke club, where black-clad young women carry $10
bottles of El Guardamonte from Spain through the bright yellow
halls to dark private rooms. Such nightclubs across Asia were once
the main drain for much of the world's brandy and plenty of
whiskey. ``No one wants to drink cognac anymore _ most of our
customers want red wine now,'' the club's general manager, Huang
Jianmei, said.
</P>
<P>
   The real losers are people trying to produce quality wines in
China. In the 1980s, Group Pernod Ricard of France began coaxing
villages near China's Great Wall to switch from sweet Chinese grape
varieties to chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon, which the company
could use to make quality wines. They taught farmers to bury the
frail European plants in the sandy soil during the frigid northern
Chinese winters and to dig them out in spring.
</P>
<P>
   The company now makes about a million bottles a year under the
Dragon Seal label, using strict European standards _ even aging the
wine in oak casks imported from France. But the market is
increasingly difficult. ``The price is always decreasing,'' says
its winemaker, Gerome Sabate.
</P>
<P>
   Rovira of Felix Solis has decided to approach the market another
way: He is selling gallon jugs of sangria.

<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Gary Ahlert, an agent for toy inventors, was
in a financial hole. He had lost $400,000 on a plan to market a
material to cover artificial limbs. So in 1998, when a potentially
lucrative mining deal came up, the pitch, from an apparently
credible businessman, seemed worth listening to: invest in an
Arizona mine filled with ore that could be used to make cellular
telephone batteries.
</P>
<P>
   To get a stake, Ahlert called a Georgia company whose newspaper
advertisements offered ``Hard Money. Financing available. $250K and
Up.'' Ahlert sent the company a $5,000 processing fee for a $3
million capital investment loan, and he and a partner invested
about $200,000 of their own money in the mining project.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the offer of a loan was fraudulent, the
mining project was a scam and Ahlert and his partner were out about
$300,000, all the poorer for having proved a law enforcement adage
that a booming economy breeds white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, while violent crime has plummeted nationwide,
white-collar crime, against individuals and small businesses, has
skyrocketed, fueled by the economy and made easier by the Internet,
law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a lot of money around, they are going to go
after the money,'' said Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney. ``So, when you look back and you have high activity in
the market, and we have never seen anything like this, you are
going to have a lot of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generalization is that the honey attracts the bears.''
</P>
<P>
   That has created a difficult situation for a criminal justice
system designed to deal, primarily, with street criminals, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   For Ahlert and others like him, the situation adds insult to
injury.
</P>
<P>
   And because it is so hard to track down this kind of scam
artist, prove the case and recover the money, prosecutors and the
police are sometimes reluctant to try, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to securities regulators, law enforcement agencies and
the National White Collar Crime Center, which studies the
phenomenon, white-collar crime has risen 10 percent to 20 percent
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   And the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, which deals
with investment fraud, reported a 20 percent jump in the number of
complaints from 1995 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the Internet had complicated the
situation for them by making it easier for swindlers to quickly
steal money and disappear into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne A. Hunt, the chief of the financial crimes section for the
FBI, said in an interview that the bureau was investigating more
than 26,000 white-collar cases, using more than 2,400 agents. In a
decade, bureau officials said, the FBI has more than doubled the
number of agents and resources dedicated to white-collar cases.
</P>
<P>
   But, law enforcement officials acknowledged, that is still not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of new technology has really affected us
tremendously,'' Hunt said. ``Traditional white-collar criminals are
now utilizing the Internet to do the same types of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Leighton, a sociologist and professor of criminology at
Eastern Michigan State University, said it was a difficult
transition for law enforcement to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep this image of the street criminal and the idea
of the threat coming from the poor, but we have long had all this
white-collar crime, which is much more likely to affect the average
American,'' Leighton said.

   Ahlert and his partner spent about $220,000 on the mining and
the loan schemes. And, having devoted about another $80,000 to
lawyers and investigators in an effort to recover his losses, he
has lost his business, is considering filing for bankruptcy and is
about to close his office on Main Street here. He and his partner
do not even know if they can afford to hire a bankruptcy lawyer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking about the case is law enforcement's lack
of action.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlert said he had appealed for help from New York to El Paso,
Texas, and had compiled thick files of evidence. In one letter, the
men running the mining project claimed to own more than 700,000
tons of ore in Arizona, ore that really belonged to the Department
of Defense. One Texas police agency considered pressing charges
against one of the men in the mining project, but the El Paso
County district attorney's office dropped the charges because
prosecutors believed they could not make the case, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that a case like Ahlert's was
difficult to investigate because white-collar criminals tended to
be good at hiding their assets, and generally it was not
cost-effective for prosecutors unless they could amass a long list
of victims who had been defrauded of much more than Ahlert and his
partner could reclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in Texas, Georgia and New York who
have looked at Ahlert's case said that it appeared he had amassed
evidence of fraud, but that it was very unlikely the case would
ever go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that investigating even the simplest
white-collar crime case could take years and often involved sorting
through thousands of pages of documents. Furthermore, jurors often
have a hard time understanding white-collar crime or feeling
sympathy for the victims, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Given those realities, the officials said, prosecutors are
reluctant to proceed with small cases or those that involve few
victims. Arrests for white-collar crime, which peaked in 1995,
suggest that after making a strong push to address the growing
number of people being victimized by white-collar crime, the
authorities pulled back and began focusing on bigger cases, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been told by prosecutors that our case was not sexy
enough,'' Ahlert said. He later added, ``We are just two little
guys who can't do anything for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in white-collar crime is felt most acutely in
financial centers, like the New York region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What everyone is worried about is that if the market corrects
downward we are going to be swamped with complaints,'' said Eric
Dinallo, a former Manhattan prosecutor who is now chief of the New
York state attorney general's investor fraud and securities bureau.
``Because people will not even know that they are being scammed
until they take their money out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lambiase, the director of the securities division at the
Connecticut Banking Department, said more street criminals were
moving into the world of white-collar crime because they could get
away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mug someone in Connecticut I could get you arrested
today,'' he said. ``But if you do white-collar stuff, there are so
many ways to hide and shield yourself, and it is much tougher to
convict you in front of a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambiase said that experienced people like Ahlert were
increasingly being defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlert was hardly new to the workings of the business world. One
of the authors of a book called ``Selling Your Idea or Invention''
(Carol Publishing, 1994), which included a chapter on how to avoid
scams, he had worked with Hasbro, Mattel and other major toy
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlert saw the advertisement for the loan in The New York Times
classified section in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton, the sociologist, said that people like Ahlert were
easy targets in good economic times because ``people feel more
comfortable about spending on things that sound risky.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ahlert said his experience had left him far from
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned my life upside down,'' he said as he smoked
cigarette after cigarette in the conference room of his office last
month.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was living on money borrowed from friends and his
daughter, Noel, 33, a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed,'' he said.  &QR;

NETS ENJOY A LAUGH AT MAGIC'S EXPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Stephon Marbury spent much of Sunday
night's game against the Orlando Magic with a towel over his head
and a smile on his face. The dynamic playmaker was an observer and
cheerleader for 20 minutes, and the Nets were still able to cruise
by the Magic, 129-91, before 13,648 fans at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was a critical one in the Nets' flirtation with a
playoff berth and advanced them a full game in the Eastern
Conference standing. Orlando, which entered the game in the
conference's eighth and final playoff spot, is now tied with
Milwaukee at 30-33. The Nets, who have routed both clubs in the
span of three days, are three games back at 27-36.
</P>
<P>
   In winning their third straight game, the Nets became just the
third team this season to whip the Magic by more than 20 points. It
was the worst beating Coach Doc Rivers' hard-working club has
endured this season.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury played 28 minutes and finished with 9 points and 10
assists, marking the second straight game in which he has scored
fewer than 10 points. He had reached double figures in 75
consecutive games before scoring 9 in Friday's 108-80 blowout of
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's low scoring is a testament to the Nets' growing depth
and chemistry. For the second straight game, no starter played more
than 30 minutes. Kerry Kittles led the starters with 14 points.
Keith Van Horn had 13 points and Kendall Gill finished with 11. As
Marbury and the rest of the starters watched from the bench, the
Nets' reserves rolled like a boulder down a steep hill.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman made 9 of 13 shots to tie his season high with 26
points. Scott Burrell added 16 and Lucious Harris had 11. The Nets'
bench accounted for 80 points Sunday, the third straight game in
which they have combined for more than 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   The end was so easy that Coach Don Casey used Gheorghe Muresan
in the fourth quarter. He responded with 9 points and 3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets got a break when they learned before the game that Ron
Mercer, Orlando's starting shooting guard, would be absent while
serving a one-game suspension. Mercer, who has been the Magic's
second-leading scorer (13.5 points a game) since being obtained in
a trade with Denver in February, was suspended by the National
Basketball Association for fighting with Denver's George McCloud
after Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   A Magic spokesman said Mercer entered the Nuggets' locker room
to speak to some former teammates and was attacked by McCloud.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando did not seem to miss Mercer early on. It led for much of
the first quarter, including three times by 5 points, before
settling for a 30-28 advantage heading into the second quarter. In
addition to John Amaechi's offense, it was the Magic's hustle that
kept it in front. It repeatedly beat the Nets to loose balls and
outrebounded them, 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   Already fortunate because of Mercer's absence, the Nets received
another windfall when Amaechi bumped heads with Marbury with 26
seconds remaining in the first. The side of Marbury's head collided
with Amaechi's nose, leaving the Magic's main post threat on the
floor. Amaechi walked to the locker room with his face stuffed in a
towel and did not return until 10 minutes 11 seconds had elapsed in
the second quarter. By that time, however, Orlando was trailing by
57-44.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets pulled away with the help of their second unit. The
combination of Elliot Perry, Burrell, Newman, Harris and Jamie
Feick gave the Nets their first lead of the game when Newman made a
3-pointer early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets led by 39-36 when Van Horn replaced Feick at the 8:29
mark. Van Horn, who played center in the small lineup, and the four
reserves put together a 15-6 run over four minutes that gave the
Nets command for keeps. Burrell led the charge, burying two
3-pointers during the run and scoring 13 points in the quarter. He
made 3 of 4 attempts from behind the arc and 5 of 7 shots over all.
</P>
<P>
   Newman was also hot, scoring 11 in the quarter, to help the Nets
push the lead to as many as 15 points and take a 61-49 advantage at
the break. It was more of the same in the third, as the starters
picked up on the groove set by the reserves. Marbury ran the floor
game tremendously in the period, giving out six assists, including
a couple of sensational no-look feeds that Van Horn finished with
dunks. Gill, Kittles and Van Horn did most of the scoring and gave
the Nets five double-figure scorers at the end of the third.
</P>
<P>
   The balance was especially impressive considering that Marbury,
who was 3 for 8 from the field heading into the fourth, had only 9
points. Orlando cut the lead to 11 twice, but the Nets responded
quickly. &QL;

WORK ABOUT FREE SPEECH, NOT HOLOCAUST, ARTIST SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hans Haacke, the German-born artist whose work is in
an exhibition that is to open soon at the Whitney Museum of
American Art, responded sharply over the weekend to those who said
the artwork trivializes the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trivializing the Holocaust is the last thing I want to do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The work, which is called ``Sanitation,'' will go on view March
23 as part of the Whitney's 2000 Biennial. It includes a wall that
juxtaposes the First Amendment with statements made by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and antiart quotations by three conservative
politicians, written in the Gothic Fraktur typeface once favored by
the Nazis and sometimes used by neo-Nazis. Beneath the passages is
a row of trash cans from which blares the sound of marching troops.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke said the work was meant to focus on the First Amendment
and artistic freedom in the wake of last fall's imbroglio over the
``Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. That show
of cutting-edge British art prompted Giuliani to try to withdraw
city subsidies from the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm very upset about is the attempt to dictate to museums
what they show, and the statements made by politicians in
Washington that have curtailed the freedom of the National
Endowment for the Arts,'' Haacke said. ``The attention to those
issues is deflected by the spin of my supposedly having trivialized
the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Anti-Defamation League protested the museum's
decision to show ``Sanitation,'' saying it denigrated the memory of
those killed by the Nazis. Marylou Whitney, a daughter-in-law of
the Whitney's founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, also denounced
the museum for showing the work. But the two family members most
active at the museum, Flora Miller Biddle and Fiona Donovan,
Gertrude's granddaughter and great-granddaughter, strongly support
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke said his work ``does not speak of the Holocaust; it
speaks about freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   As an artist whose work deals with social and political issues,
Haacke said, ``it would be impossible to speak about anything if
one cannot speak about historical references.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a German citizen and I live with German history and I see
parallels.'' Though he is not Jewish, his wife of 35 years, Linda,
is. ``He has always been accepted by the Jewish family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Haacke said he had always ``taken the Holocaust very
seriously.'' For example, he cited an installation he made for
Graz, Austria, in 1988 that was included in a 1994 show at the
Jewish Museum here called ``The Art of Memory: Holocaust Memorials
in History.''
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, who is known for his provocative works, is in the midst
of another art furor about his historical references, one that
upsets some Germans. Invited to make a work for a courtyard at the
newly renovated Reichstag building in Berlin, Haacke remembered a
moment in 1984, when he walked through a park filled with Turkish
families having picnics, and he recalled a statement inside the
Reichstag building that reads: ``To the German people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood it to mean that the people I was surrounded by
were instructed to stay out, that they did not belong,'' he said.
So Haacke borrowed an idea from Bertolt Brecht: he designed a
dedication in neon letters, using not the German word ``Volk,''
which he said had connotations of strictly describing Germanic
people, but the more inclusive word for ``population,''
``Bevoelkerung.'' Around that inscription, ``to the population,''
he would place soil from each election district represented in the
Reichstag.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that language difference, angry opponents are waging
a campaign against the work, which was accepted by the
parliamentary committee that commissioned it last fall. The full
Reichstag, Haacke said, was expected to vote on it later this
month.

COMMENTARY: TRAGIC CONTINUUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police intercepted the two teen-age boys who were
running up Broadway, near 138th Street, and opened fire. This was
on the night of Feb. 13, 1997. Robert Reynoso, 18, collapsed to the
ground with a bullet in his chest. Juval Green, 17, fell with a leg
wound.
</P>
<P>
   The police would later say they thought the boys had a gun.
There was no gun. And the boys, who survived the shooting, had not
been involved in a crime. Nevertheless, the police arrested them.
The charge _ incredibly _ was criminal possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department tried to keep the shooting under wraps but
I got a tip and wrote about it. When I visited Reynoso at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, he was handcuffed to his bed.
Breathing and swallowing were so difficult for him, and he was in
so much pain, that he would at times whisper to relatives, ``I just
want to die.''
</P>
<P>
   This shooting typified the over-the-top, overly aggressive
behavior that has become the hallmark of policing under Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. The cops were responding to a report of shots
fired at Broadway and 135th Street, three blocks away. Not only
were Reynoso and Green shot, but four other innocent people were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The police were shooting and rounding up people without the
slightest clue as to what was happening. Afterward, the department
tried to conceal the extent of the madness. Top officials would not
even confirm the four additional arrests until I let them know I
had obtained a copy of a confidential memo from a police captain,
Robert T. Varieur, to the chief of the department, Louis Anemone.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said: ``During the confrontation in front of 3395
Broadway, four (4) individuals who were initially thought to be
involved in the incident at West 135th Street were taken into
custody. Upon investigation it was determined that there was no
evidence to link them to that incident and these arrests were
subsequently voided. All four (4) individuals were visiting from
Baltimore, Maryland.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Reynoso and Green were dropped. The
Manhattan district attorney's office investigated the shooting, but
no action was taken against the police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the city quietly agreed to pay $1.8 million to Reynoso
and Green to settle a federal lawsuit they had filed. Their lawyer,
Robert L. Herbst, said, ``We claimed the officers had no
justification for shooting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Servedio and Jose Borrero were the officers who opened
fire on the teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never gone on record to explain what they actually
saw and heard that caused them to shoot these kids down,'' said
Herbst.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers were deposed recently in connection with the
lawsuit, they exercised their Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and refused to answer questions about the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen now is what usually happens. The taxpayers will
foot the bill for a police foul-up and we'll move on. There will be
no acknowledgment from the mayor or the police commissioner that
there is a serious problem with the police that continues to plague
this town and that will result, inevitably, in more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   We are riding a continuum that leads from the harassment of
law-abiding individuals on the street to the arrest of innocent
people like Alton White, the actor from the musical ``Ragtime,'' to
the nonfatal shooting of teen-agers like Robert Reynoso and Juval
Green, to the choking death of Anthony Baez in a dispute over a
football, to the profound tragedy of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fool could fail to see that New York needs to wake up and
deal with this.
</P>
<P>
   Last week four recent Ivy League graduates filed a federal
lawsuit against the city, claiming they were beaten and terrorized
by Street Crime cops in an encounter in Manhattan two months ago.
The cops mistakenly thought the plaintiffs' car had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   When the graduates, two men and two women, saw three men in
plain clothes with guns drawn coming after them, they thought they
were being attacked by criminals and tried to flee. That, according
to the lawsuit, enraged the cops.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of story is no longer the exception in New York. It's
becoming the rule.

RANCOR OVER SELECTION OF CHAPLAIN BUILDS IN THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the political trapdoors House Republicans
have tried to tiptoe around this election year, the selection of
the House chaplain, the man who delivers the morning prayer on the
floor, was one few members ever thought would catch them by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five months after a Roman Catholic priest was passed over
by Republican leaders in favor of a Presbyterian minister, the tiff
has turned into a furor that is dogging Republicans both here in
Congress and, at least in a few cases, back home in their
districts. In its 210 years, the House has never had a Catholic
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has led a group of Catholic Republicans to
express dismay over how the speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, has handled the matter, allowing it to languish. And it
has stoked Democratic fervor on the question of whether
Republicans, dominated by Protestants, are insensitive to
Catholics. The accusation first roiled the party in the
presidential campaign when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas visited Bob
Jones University, a Christian fundamentalist school with
anti-Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just this incident, it was also Bob Jones,'' said
Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, a Catholic who made a speech on the House
floor urging the Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Charles Parker
Wright, to remove himself from consideration. ``You put the two
together, and it's like throwing gasoline on a fire, and they just
fed on each other,'' Ganske said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ought to be dealt with sooner rather than later,'' he said,
adding that he and about three dozen other Catholic Republicans
have pressed Hastert to resolve the matter. ``I have had
constituents back in my district ask me, No. 1, how did we get into
this mess, and why wasn't it taken care of a few months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fade with time, the controversy seems to be growing.
On Wednesday, after staying silent on the matter, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, entered the
fray, further escalating the strain.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hastert, Gephardt wrote that the selection
``process has gone seriously off-track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is the way in which a process ostensibly
designed to result in a chaplain selected by a bipartisan cross
section of the House appears to have gone awry, and how it can be
corrected,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of the chaplain has handed Democrats an
opportunity not only to paint Republicans as anti-Catholic but to
ridicule them for bungling something as straightforward as choosing
a chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a subject that has caused heartache for Hastert,
personally and politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distresses me is that there are some people on that side
of the aisle who have seen they can get political gain on this
issue, and that's exactly what they are doing in an election
year,'' Hastert said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert had broken with tradition and had created a bipartisan
committee to help choose the chaplain instead of simply making the
selection himself. After the committee of 18 _ nine Democrats and
nine Republicans _ winnowed the list to three candidates, the names
were forwarded, in alphabetical order, to Hastert, Rep. Dick Armey
of Texas, the majority leader, and Gephardt. At that point, the
decision rested with the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Armey, after interviewing the candidates, chose
Wright, a Presbyterian who is associated with the National Prayer
Breakfast. Gephardt was inclined to support a different candidate,
the Rev. Robert Dvorak, the regional director of the Evangelical
Covenant Church, but eventually allowed his name to be used on the
announcement about Wright.
</P>
<P>
   None of them initially supported the Catholic priest, the Rev.
Timothy O'Brien, a political science professor at Marquette
University in Milwaukee, although Gephardt later backed him.
O'Brien, however, received the most votes in committee, followed by
Dvorak and then Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats demanded to know why the first choice, O'Brien, was
overlooked. Hastert said he had never received, nor did he need to
know, the vote tally. The final decision belonged to the leaders,
and he said Wright impressed him the most.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was exacerbated when O'Brien complained about
anti-Catholic bias. He also objected to questions from committee
members about his collar and whether he was qualified to counsel
married people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all stunned, really stunned,'' said Rep. Anna Eshoo,
D-Calif., a Catholic who was on the committee. ``I do think there
is some anti-Catholic bias in this.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one Catholic leader, William Donohue, the president of
the Catholic League of Civil and Religious Rights, has not let
Hastert off the hook. He has turned the fracas into an effort to
root out the anti-Catholic bias he said still exists among
Protestants, especially Christian evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a segment of the evangelical Protestant community
that is anti-Catholic,'' Donohue said. ``It has been there for a
long, long time. Everyone is saying, `Let's not talk about it.' I
don't want a strain between Catholics and Protestants, but I'm not
going to paper this over.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's vehemence has led to criticism from other Catholic
leaders who say he is needlessly inflaming passions. It has also
upset evangelical Christians in Congress, who have pressured
Hastert not to back down, further complicating the issue.
</P>
<P>
   To blunt the political fallout, Republican leaders have
instructed members to remind constituents that many Republicans
have voted to outlaw abortion and to send more children to
parochial schools. They have also passed a resolution praising
Catholic schools and granting Cardinal John O'Connor of New York
the Congressional Medal of Honor. Democrats wondered whether it was
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said he was debating what to do because Democrats are
likely to oppose the selection of Wright on the House floor. ``It's
not fair to ask someone to come in and be chaplain when half of the
House won't even talk to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Catholics, already shaken by the Bob Jones University
incident, want him to hurry up and put the issue to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been festering,'' said Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a
Catholic who represents O'Brien's district. He called the attacks
``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It did restoke those old Catholic fears,'' he added.

CINCINNATI COACH IS UPSET THAT HIS TEAM IS NOT A NO. 1 SEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top seeds are vulnerable; at least one No. 2 seed believes
it should be a No. 1 seed, and surging St. John's will try to
capture a wide-open National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament from the sunshine of the West. Such are the perceptions
and truths when the NCAA selection committee paired the nation's 64
best teams against one another Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams from last year's Final Four, Duke (27-4) and Michigan
State (26-7), were awarded No. 1 seeds in the East and Midwest
regions, and two West Coast teams were deemed the strongest in the
other two regions: Arizona (26-6) stays in the West and Stanford
(26-3) was shipped South as the top seed for the first time in the
school's history.
</P>
<P>
   And that did not sit well with Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins. His
Bearcats (28-3), who were ranked No. 1 in the polls for 12 weeks,
were sent South as a No. 2 after their star, Kenyon Martin,
suffered a broken leg in the Conference USA tournament last week.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins did not like that his team's power ratings that quantify
strength of schedule lost out a medically-tinged crystal ball.
``It's ridiculous, totally ridiculous,'' Huggins said, basing his
argument on the ratings power index. ``We must be the first team in
history to be No. 1 in the RPI and not get a No. 1 seed. That's a
historical thing those guys just did. How do they know how good
we'll be without Kenyon?''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA selection committee,
conceded that the Martin injury was the only reason Cincinnati was
not seeded No. 1. ``We try to project what the loss of an
All-America-caliber player like Kenyon Martin would do to a team,''
said Thompson, commissioner of the Mountain West Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (26-5) could also have made a case for a top seed and,
Coach John Chaney made it clear during the weekend that the Owls
were talented enough to take him to his first Final Four ``if we
didn't run across Duke.'' On paper, at least, Temple, the second
seed in the East, would need to beat the Blue Devils in the final.
The Owls will play Lafayette (24-6) on Friday in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which bracket doesn't matter,'' said Chaney, whose teams have
lost four times in the regional finals. ``Everybody will try to be
as good as they can possibly be. Win one, you buy one. Lose, it's
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis also did not mind that the
committee moved his team West as the No. 2 seed. The Red Storm
(24-7) have won 11 of their last 12 games and will play Northern
Arizona (20-10) on Thursday in Tucson, Ariz. In 1993, Jarvis took
George Washington to the West Regional and almost upset eventual
tournament runner-up Michigan, who had Chris Webber and Jalen Rose
among its ``Fab Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis called the McKale Center, where Arizona plays its home
games, a ``mini-Madison Square Garden,'' and he thoroughly enjoyed
how his team was highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams that going in worrying about their seed or worrying
about being upset have a pretty good chance of being upset,''
Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's was one of five Big East teams to make the field _
Connecticut is seeded No. 5 and Miami No. 6 in the South; Syracuse
was sent to the Midwest as a No. 4 and Seton Hall stayed in the
East as No. 10. But the conference was denied a sixth team when
Notre Dame (18-14) failed to make the field despite upsets of
Connecticut twice, Ohio State and St. John's. The Irish, Arizona
State and Virginia were among 12 winning teams to feel the
heartbreak of not being selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough decision,'' Thompson said of Notre Dame.
``We measure quality wins and the unfortunate losses. They didn't
have a winning record in the Big East.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten, Big 12 and Southeastern conferences were deemed the
strongest by the selection committee, and each placed six teams
each in the field. Conference USA and the Pacific-10 eah had four
teams, and the Atlantic Coast Conference had only three teams
selected for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's welcomed the selection as the school's highest seed
since the 1985 team with Chris Mullins and Walter Berry made the
Final Four. If the Red Storm beat Northern Arizona, the Red Storm
will play the winner of the game between No. 7 Louisville (19-11)
and No. 10 Gonzaga (24-8) on Saturday. The region's top seed,
Arizona (26-6), the Pac-10 champion, will play No. 16 Jackson State
(16-15) on Thursday in Salt Lake City
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley, the Red Storm's embattled guard who recently came
under N.C.A.A. scrutiny, said he would approach the first-round
game as he had all the others in his difficult season. ``From the
beginning, I've played every game like my last,'' Barkley said.
``I'm only going to be satisfied if we're in the Final Four or
better.''

DNA DATABASE SAID TO LINK INMATE TO 1979 MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prosecutors in Westchester County say they have
solved the 1979 murder of a young Mount Vernon mother by analyzing
DNA evidence collected along a blood trail from the woman's
apartment and comparing it with the state's database of DNA
profiles of convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence, which is expected to result in charges being
filed Monday against Walter Gill, 49, an inmate at Sing Sing
Correctional Facility in Ossining, provides state officials with
the first DNA match in a cold case since legislation was passed
last fall to expand the state's database of criminal offenders.
Gill is serving a prison term for robbery, an offense that did not
require DNA sampling until December.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, said
Sunday that based on the DNA match, her office would charge Gill
with the murder of Diane Gregory, 22, whose body was found in the
living room of her fourth-floor Mount Vernon apartment in August
1979. Gregory, who had a 2-year-old daughter, had been stabbed four
times. Her case was reopened this year at the request of her
family, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro said the match was a powerful illustration that the
database is maturing as a law-enforcement tool. She predicted that
more old murder cases would be solved as police departments and
prosecutors around the state scoured their files for cases in which
biological evidence had been preserved and could be analyzed and
submitted for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, I think, the beginning of our solving a number of
crimes,'' Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Gregory's slaying was renewed this year
after Carolyn Gregory, the dead woman's sister, asked a member of
the Mount Vernon City Council if DNA might be used to glean fresh
clues in the case, Pirro said. The councilman approached the Mount
Vernon Police Department, which then reviewed its files to see if
old evidence existed.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, biological evidence abounded. Gregory's apartment
had been splattered with blood, as had a pillowcase that had been
pressed against her head, a piece of jagged glass and a sheet found
at the end of a bloody trail that began at her body and continued
outdoors. Some of this blood, detectives had long believed, came
from her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a law-enforcement official who is involved in the
investigation said the Mount Vernon detectives' original case files
indicated that Gill had known Gregory and had been a suspect from
the beginning, but that investigators had lacked evidence powerful
enough to file a charge or to get a court order to draw his blood
for testing. Under the new state law, however, Gill had to submit a
DNA sample as an inmate, and did so in January.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this, investigators retrieved the sheet, pillowcase and
glass shard from storage and sent them to the Westchester County
forensic lab, which was able to extract, amplify and analyze DNA
from the blood on the sheet and pillowcase. Once entered into the
state database, the DNA profile extracted from the sheet was found
to match Gill's profile, Pirro said. Gregory's blood was on the
sheet also.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro described discovery of the DNA match as ``like the finger
of God pointing 21 years later, saying, `You can't get away with
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This evidence shows that he was at the murder scene while she
was bleeding,'' Pirro said. ``Obviously we will still have to go to
trial and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and I believe that we
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirro said that after her office charged Gill with second-degree
murder, prosecutors would present the DNA evidence to a grand jury.
Gill is eligible for parole on his robbery conviction in May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cold-case DNA match is not the first in the state. Earlier
this year, the DNA of Jonathan Williams, 33, an inmate being held
at Rikers Island jail on a murder charge, was found to match a
sample in a New York City database of DNA derived from rape
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Safir, the New York police commissioner, said the match
conclusively linked Williams to semen taken from a Harlem rape
victim in 1998. And the city medical examiner's office, which
maintains that database, said it had had as many as three so-called
hits since last year. The case against Williams has been under
grand-jury review, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gregory's case was seized upon Sunday by Gov. George
Pataki, who described Gill as a career criminal who has been
convicted of nine felonies and eight misdemeanors since 1969. The
convictions include multiple counts of robbery, grand larceny,
possession of stolen property and criminal trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor plans to call a news conference Monday to say that
Gregory's case illustrates that his two recent proposals for
greater use of forensic DNA _ one to expand the database to include
anyone convicted of any state crime, another to eliminate statutes
of limitation for 16 felonies _ are sound.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians have expressed opposition to elements of both
bills, saying that the expanded DNA sampling would be an
unnecessary invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that many of the felonies for which Pataki would
abolish the statutes of limitation, including second-degree arson,
criminal sale of a weapon and aggravated assault on a police
officer, do not typically yield DNA evidence, and thus should not
have their prosecution deadlines abolished.

EDITORIAL: REDEMPTION AT THE CIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 13:
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's Cold War entanglements in Guatemala are like a
malignant tumor that cannot be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the agency seemed to deal belatedly but decisively with
its misdeeds. John Deutch, the CIA director, dismissed two senior
officers and disciplined several others for mishandling relations
with the Guatemalan military and failing to keep Congress
adequately informed about operations in the Central American
nation.
</P>
<P>
   But now all seems forgiven, as the agency prepares to award a
distinguished career medal to the highest-ranking official who was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA contends that the award to Terry Ward, who was once
chief of covert operations in Latin America, is intended to honor
his achievements over a long career and should not be read as a
nullification of Deutch's action.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials note that even as he sacked Ward, Deutch said
his decision did not preclude recognition of Ward's previous
service. But the unmistakable message of the award is that George
Tenet, Deutch's successor, does not think Ward's behavior was all
that reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemala matter was not a minor mistake. It involved a
breach of the most basic covenant that must govern the operations
of an intelligence agency in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ward failed to ensure that Congress, as required by law, was
kept fully and currently informed about the abusive conduct of
Guatemalan officers who were on the agency payroll. This included
allegations that one of the men had condoned the murder of an
American innkeeper in Guatemala and the killing of a Guatemalan
guerrilla married to an American lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, who has worked for the White House and the Senate and
served as Deutch's deputy, is wise in the ways of Washington.
Surely he knows that an award like this tells agency employees that
the boss is repudiating the decision of Deutch and is more
interested in befriending the CIA's operations division than in
insisting on the highest standards of conduct. It is no secret that
Ward's dismissal outraged many members of the espionage service.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but the rehabilitation of Ward
comes just as Deutch's stature has been diminished by new
disclosures that he mishandled classified information when he ran
the CIA, and that some of his top aides, including Tenet, may have
tried to shield him from investigation after he left the agency. In
the spy business, accounts tend to get settled eventually, though
often in opaque ways.
</P>
<P>
   If Tenet did not want to create the impression that the agency
was absolving Ward, he could have quietly overruled the decision of
his operations chief, James Pavitt, to grant the award. At the
least, when the award is presented later this month, Tenet or
Pavitt should say that in honoring Ward, the CIA is not excusing or
belittling his transgressions.

   Maybe it was the springlike weather, or the angry complaints of
Republican voters who had to squint hard to find their presidential
candidate listed in small print on New York's presidential primary
ballot. But the past week saw encouraging signs that the breezes of
political reform may finally be reaching Albany.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Republican leader of the State Senate, Joseph
Bruno, denounced as ``absolute nonsense'' the Republican ballot
rules that nearly blocked Sen. John McCain from competing here and
subjected New York to national ridicule. Even more refreshing,
Bruno promised ``to move diligently'' on a thorough overhaul of
those rules to make it easier for candidates to get on the ballot.
He also pledged to simplify the ballot itself. That would
presumably mean discarding the state GOP's frustrating practice of
showing delegates' names in large type, with the names of the
presidential candidates those delegates support listed in tiny type
below.
</P>
<P>
   In making these pledges, Bruno was elaborating on the general
promise of change that he made two weeks ago, when he was trying to
perfume a party-line vote by Senate Republicans to block a solid
reform bill proposed by Senate Democrats. In the interim, the sour
reaction of many Republican voters to last Tuesday's convoluted
ballot apparently strengthened Bruno's resolve to get out in front
on the issue rather than wait for leadership from Gov. George
Pataki, a fellow Republican with whom he has been feuding these
past several months.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a long wait. Until Bruno's announcement, and
even right afterward, the governor's office was dismissing calls
for prompt action on reform, saying there was no urgency as the
next presidential election is still four years away. But confronted
by Bruno's promise to take action independently, Pataki changed his
tune. A spokesman denied reacting to Bruno's push but said the
governor would make his own reform proposal, and that it would come
``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki was an architect of the disgraceful and ultimately
unsuccessful effort to prevent McCain and other Republican
candidates from competing against Gov. George W. Bush in the
state's primary. The fact that Bush ultimately prevailed over
McCain in the contest does not make the governor's ballot scheming
look any better. Pataki owes it to New Yorkers to rise above his
petty squabbling with Bruno to achieve permanent changes in the law
that ease the rules for ballot access and that otherwise advance
principles of democracy and fair competition.
</P>
<P>
   There is no excuse for delay. The latest ballot fiasco has
created a window for reform that is fated to close as memories of
this year's ballot manipulation fade and party leaders again become
preoccupied with crafting rules to help their particular candidate.

EDITORIAL: A POISONED MINIMUM WAGE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 13:
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a much-needed $1 minimum-wage increase over
two years, but the bill is fatally tainted by $123 billion in tax
cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy. President Clinton has vowed
to veto the bill unless Congress strips away the tax cuts.
Republican leaders have resisted increasing the minimum wage, which
at $5.15 an hour is well below its buying power in 1980. But now
they have modified their game plan, trying instead to hold a wage
increase hostage for tax breaks for high-income individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans claim that the tax cuts are intended to help
small businesses, which would have to pay their lowest-wage workers
more. But in fact, more than $78 billion of the tax cuts over 10
years comes from reductions in estate and gift taxes. Only $19
billion of the cuts counts as small-business tax relief, according
to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Other provisions
in the bill could reduce employer-paid pension coverage for
low-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, estimates
that nearly 90 percent of the tax benefits would go to the
wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers. The House bill will now have to
be reconciled with a Senate bill that raised the minimum wage by $1
dollar over three years and included an equally objectionable,
though smaller package of tax cuts. The minimum wage should be
raised, without tax cuts for the rich.

   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Carlos Perez's on-field problems spilled off
the field once again when he was arrested and charged with driving
under the influence late Saturday night, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who pitched earlier in the day against St. Louis in
Jupiter, Fla., was arrested at 11:03 p.m. He spent eight hours in
county jail before posting $500 bond, according to a statement
released by the Vero Beach Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 29, was on his way back from dinner at the Riverside
Cafe, police said, when he stopped at a traffic light at the
beachfront intersection of Ocean Drive and Beachland Boulevard. He
put his car in park and fell asleep, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A concerned motorist called police after witnessing the car go
through a complete cycle of the traffic light without moving,
according to the police statement.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, still owed $12.6 million over the next two seasons, was
released from jail approximately 7 a.m. and was in uniform by 10
a.m. for the day's workout. Afterward, Perez met with Los Angeles
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone and managing partner and CEO
Bob Daly for approximately 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not happy,'' Daly said. ``He said he had a
couple of drinks, got to the light and fell asleep. I'm very happy
that nobody got hurt and nothing else happened, but it's not
exactly what I would have liked to have with my eggs this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly said Perez ``seems to be remorseful about (the incident).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's not going to do it again. We'll see. I don't
know. I want to get the rest of the facts,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's legal limit for driving under the influence is .08.
Perez failed a field roadside physical performance test but refused
a breathalyzer test, according to Vero Beach Police Lt. Kevin
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the officer's opinion, he was impaired and over the legal
limit,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The arresting officer, Charles McFarland, could not be reached
for comment. Perez was charged with a first-degree misdemeanor,
Martin said. The maxium penalty is one year in prison and a $1,000
fine. Martin also said Florida law mandates the suspension of
Perez's driver's license for six months for failing to take a
breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me if they want to do it (administer a
breathalyzer), if I say no,'' Perez said. ``Nobody got hurt, nobody
got hit. I was sleeping at the light, and that's it. I was just
kind of tired. I don't think this kind of stuff is going to happen.
Only thing I can say is I'll be more careful next time and hope it
doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to upset my mind. I'm still working hard and
I'm not going to keep nothing in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing date was not set. However, Adam Katz, Perez's agent,
is scheduled to fly here today to meet with the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake,'' Perez said. ``Everyone can make a mistake.
It's the first time it happened, but I can guarantee it's not going
to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said that since he doesn't know all the facts of the
incident, and with litigation looming, it would be unfair to
address how this affects Perez's status on the Dodgers. Perez
remains in the hunt for a spot in the starting rotation, but team
officials were steaming about this incident.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson opted not to comment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a another in a series of off-the-field incidents
involving the well-compensated Perez, who is trying to rebound from
the worst year of his career. He was 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA last
season, and has a 14.40 ERA this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The problems began for Perez the moment he was acquired from the
Montreal Expos in a July 1998 trade. He made his first start with
cotton stuck in his nose, the remnants of a one-car collision he
was involved in days before the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Perez missed a start in Montreal when he
mysteriously injured his knee. Perez said he hurt it shagging balls
on the hard Olympic Stadium turf, but Malone acknowledged hearing a
story that Perez was injured the night before his start when he
fell and banged his knee during a night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the infamous scene of Perez repeatedly bashing a
water cooler with a bat in the Dodgers' dugout after a poor outing
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers management also was not happy about Perez swearing near
spectators after making poor pitches during spring training games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that there is even a hint of something
improper occurred,'' Malone said. ``He needs to show us he's
serious and make a commitment for us to help him return to the form
of old when he was one of the best left-handed pitchers in the
National League. We're there to help him, not only as a pitcher but
as a person, but he's going to have to make a decision this is what
he wants. We're here to help.''

<HEADLINE>
COMMENTARY: RAY'S FOUR REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert W. Ray, the independent counsel who
succeeded Ken Starr, will issue the first of his four final reports
this week. The document of about 25,000 words will deal primarily
with ``Filegate,'' the snooping into FBI files of over 900
Americans by the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Good news for the Clintons: The first IC report concludes that
this was caused by gross incompetence of the midlevel White House
staff and the laxity of eager-to-please FBI officials _ but was not
a conspiracy prosecutable under the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's Round Two is scheduled to be submitted to a three-judge
panel in early summer. That will deal with ``Travelgate,'' the
alleged abuses of power by Hillary and presidential aides in the
prosecution of innocent (and quickly acquitted) longtime White
House employees to make way for Clinton patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Because active investigation continues, which Reno Justice
cannot obstruct, I presume Hillary Clinton faces far greater
problems with Travelgate than with Filegate.
</P>
<P>
   Round Three has to do with Whitewater and the missing Rose Law
Firm files; its wrap-up was long sidetracked by the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Though planned for transmittal before Labor Day, the ``full
description'' of the investigation called for in the law _ which I
sense will detail tawdry corner-cutting and egregious evasiveness
but not prosecutable crime _ is unlikely to have great impact on
elections.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the details of each of Ray's reports are to be
sealed for three months, until every person named has a chance to
include comments in an appendix. (In Travelgate and Whitewater,
hundreds will be named.) But the truth will out.
</P>
<P>
   The above planning is newsworthy, but here's the stunner: There
will be a fourth round early next year about Bill Clinton's conduct
in sexual harassment cases. It will take the form of a ``full
description'' in lieu of prosecution or be a grand jury indictment.
</P>
<P>
   What triggers that unthinkable thought is Ray's hiring of two
new prosecutors last week. Logic suggests that their purpose is to
position the independent counsel for a prosecutorial decision next
January.
</P>
<P>
   Note that U.S. Judge Susan Webber Wright refrained from citing
Clinton for criminal contempt for willfully misleading her court in
the Paula Jones case. That would have ``double-jeopardied out,'' as
lawyers say, a criminal charge against the perpetrator by the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody assumes Ray will seek to indict a sitting president; that
would entail a fight up to the Supreme Court for no practical
purpose in Clinton's waning months in office. And we can forget
about any previous grand jury having left behind a sealed
indictment; those are usually done to prevent flight and Clinton
won't flee.
</P>
<P>
   But didn't the Senate, in its acquittal of impeachment charges,
put the notion of prosecution behind us? The answer, which most
Americans don't want to hear, is that impeachment is no substitute
for indictment. The law will not be finished with Clinton's
deception under oath until the appointed prosecutor decides whether
or not to seek an indictment. In the unlikely event a grand jury
agrees to hand one up, it will be for a trial jury to pronounce its
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Before trial or in the unlikely event of conviction, the
Constitution permits the next president to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   For some months in this space, I have been pressing the new, and
perhaps last, independent counsel to fish or cut bait on his
Filegate-Travelgate-Whitewater reporting. It would be patently
unfair for Ray to spring an ``October surprise'' that would affect
Hillary's campaign or the presidential election (much as the
Iran-contra prosecutor influenced the '92 campaign on its final
weekend).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps for that reason, he agreed to talk to me in his office
about his procedures and timetable. ``It's not enough to say `we've
issued a report,''' Ray says, mindful of an error of his
predecessor's. ``Part of my responsibility is to explain our
judgments so the country can evaluate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight-lipped about report content and stone-faced about
impaneling another grand jury, the next target of Carvillian
vilification expressed his determination not to issue condemnations
of wrongdoing he does not bring to trial, but to lay out the
sometimes ugly facts to the court and make public his prosecutorial
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Clintons, beware not the Ides of March _ but watch the
Fourth of July and the afternoon of Inauguration Day.

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider it a classic Bill Schrader moment.
</P>
<P>
   At a big telecommunications convention in Geneva last October,
William L. Schrader, chairman of PSINet Inc., the biggest
independent Internet service provider, announced that PSINet had
just struck a deal to offer high-speed Internet access in Europe.
The partner, he said, was Winstar Communications Inc., an American
wireless carrier, allowing PSINet to bypass the Continent's
traditional phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Winstar's top executives in New York knew nothing
about a deal with PSINet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bill was predicting the future,'' William L. Rouhana
Jr., Winstar's chairman, said lightheartedly in an interview last
week, noting that his company never announced such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   All Schrader would say, by way of explanation, was that PSINet
had indeed negotiated a European deal with Winstar. ``The fact that
Rouhana didn't know isn't my problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Odd? Bizarre even? From another chairman at another company,
perhaps. But for Schrader, it was simply business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   In building PSINet from its modest roots in upstate New York to
international Internet powerhouse with a stock market value of $7.3
billion, he has never been afraid to get a bit ahead of himself _
or to risk alienating a potential partner. In fact, PSINet and
Winstar are now in preliminary discussions about working together,
according to executives close to those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, whose hobbies include target shooting, is an executive
who often fires from the hip, so to speak, aiming verbal shots at
allies and enemies alike and establishing a reputation as perhaps
the most iconoclastic executive of his stature in the
communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet, with fiber-optic lines around the globe, some of the
world's most advanced Internet systems and a fast-growing customer
base, looms as a highly attractive acquisition candidate _ one
whose shares are up nearly 300 percent since October, as investors
have noted its potential takeover value. It is the biggest of the
Internet access providers not already snatched up by telephone
companies looking to expand into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But PSINet has been valuable for years. And Schrader, who owns
7.45 percent of the company, has always refused to sell, sometimes
leaving prospective buyers to walk away wondering if he is shrewd
or headstrong _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real reason PSINet is still independent is Bill
Schrader,'' said Richard G. Ellenberger, chief executive of
Broadwing Inc., the former Cincinnati Bell. Broadwing recently
filed to reduce its stake in PSINet to about 11 percent but would
still be its largest shareholder. ``He has built it from the ground
up, and he's not through. He believes he's one of the new age of
executive leaders, and he's not ready to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, 48, may not be ready to quit because he has already
come so far. A biologist by training, he was a co-founder in 1985
of one of the first Internet operations, called Nysernet, which
initially linked academic computing centers in the cold reaches of
upstate New York. In 1989, when for-profit activity was still
ostensibly banned from the government-financed Internet, he founded
what was then called Performance Systems International Inc., moving
it to northern Virginia to be closer to the Federal agencies then
overseeing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet was not only one of the first providers of Internet
access service but one of the most innovative. In 1995, for
instance, PSINet was a pioneer in offering unlimited Internet
service at a fixed monthly fee to consumers across the nation. The
pricing was set in typical Schrader fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I asked him how they chose what to charge for
the flat fee,'' Ellenberger said. ``And he said, `Well, it was 1995
so we chose $19.95, and $19.95 sounded good to us.' And I asked
him, `You didn't do any economic modeling?' And he said, `Nope.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, PSINet's tactical focus has changed; the company got
out of the consumer Internet business in 1996, selling its consumer
unit to Mindspring Enterprises so it could focus on serving
business customers and acting as a carrier's carrier for smaller
Internet service providers. More recently, instead of merely
providing raw Internet links, PSINet has begun to add more advanced
and lucrative services by managing Web servers and computer systems
that deliver corporate software applications across networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's ultimate goal has remained constant. ``I would
like to build a system,'' Schrader said, ``that can deliver all the
media to all the customers on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold S. Wills, PSINet's president and chief operating officer
and a former executive at IBM and Xerox, first met Schrader in the
spring of 1996. ``I thought he was crazy,'' Wills said, recalling
his job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said, `We're going to kill the phone companies and we're
going to be bigger than AT&AMP;T, and it will be a lot of fun.' And I
said, `How much revenue have you got?' and he said, `Well, last
year we had $35 million.' And I said, `Well, how are you going to
do what you want to do?' And he began to explain in ways that I
hadn't understood before the power of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other people did not understand either. PSINet's stock
traded below $10 throughout 1996, 1997 and 1998. It was not until
last year, when PSINet generated more than $550 million in revenue,
that investors began climbing onto the PSINet bandwagon as a way to
play the growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And to ride the PSINet bandwagon is to hear none of the bland
modulations of boardroom-speak.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, as he drove his silver-gray Lincoln Town Car (he
also owns a Porsche Boxster) from PSINet's headquarters in Herndon,
Va., to one of the company's nearby network centers, Schrader was
asked about one of his competitors, John W. Sidgmore. Sidgmore runs
UUNet, the No. 1 Internet carrier, which is now part of MCI
Worldcom Inc. and is also based in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of where the market's going, we see eye to eye,''
Schrader said. ``But John is a typical executive who will say what
he thinks people want to hear and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   (In an interview later, Sidgmore said, ``I'm willing to bet that
on Bill's report card in sixth grade it said something like,
`Doesn't play well with others.''')
</P>
<P>
   And do not even get Schrader started on Stephen M. Case,
chairman of America Online Inc. and another Virginia neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case is a perfect example of someone who misrepresents the
truth for his own interest,'' Schrader said as he drove.
</P>
<P>
   He cited what he saw as America Online's about-face, after it
agreed to acquire Time Warner Inc., on the need for the government
to regulate the delivery of Internet data over cable television
systems. Before the deal, America Online had called for a
government role; after hooking up with Time Warner, the nation's
second-largest operator of cable systems, many people in the
industry perceived America Online as changing its stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like hypocrites, and Case is a hypocrite,'' Schrader
said. He peered over the wheel, then added: ``He is a self-serving
businessman who's into hypocrisy and I'm not. That's why he decided
to stop competing against us as an Internet service provider and
get into the content business.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement responding to those comments, America Online
said, ``Mr. Case's position on open access has been consistent from
day one.''

 UNDATED: day one.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Schrader reserves his deepest ire, however, for local telephone
incumbents, which he says are monopolists holding back the digital
future. Bashing the Bell companies is hardly unusual among smaller
communications carriers, but Schrader's company must also deal with
the Bells on a daily basis, renting their local communications
lines in order to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly outspoken about Bell Atlantic, the East Coast
giant with which PSINet does a significant amount of business. ``I
call them `Bell Atlantis,''' Schrader said, still dishing as he
drove. ``Bell Atlantis is dead. They cannot exist in tomorrow. We
know the customer better than they do and they can't keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why lash out at a such an important supplier?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm honest,'' Schrader said. Referring to Bell
Atlantic's chairman, he said, ``It's not in my best interest to
tell you that Ivan Seidenberg is a poor manager of a
multibillion-dollar company, because they're our major supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a corporate response, Susan Kraus, a Bell Atlantic
spokeswoman, replied: ``This is not even worth commenting on but
I'll say this. Consider the source. It's hard to take anything he
says seriously. This guy has a long history of making irrational
statements and taking gratuitous potshots at his competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Schrader's blunt style is
that it has not prevented him from garnering the deep respect of
his peers, even those he does not treat gently. As someone who
spoke up for and invested in the Internet early and often, Schrader
is often considered one of the handful of true Internet
visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enormous courage and he's as smart as a fox,'' said
George H. Conrades, chairman of Akamai Technologies Inc. and former
chairman of BBN, one of the big three early independent Internet
companies, along with UUNet and PSINet. ``I admire him,'' Conrades
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sidgmore, of UUNet, also offered a compliment of sorts. ``I'm a
big supporter of Bill's, as wacky as he is,'' Sidgmore said.
``Whatever else you say, good or bad, he is steadfastly committed
to his vision for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sidgmore said, ``I would not be surprised if you read
soon that we will do some investments together.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of all he has built, Schrader has been reluctant
to sell it, despite the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars
such a deal could bring him, considering his personal 7.45 percent
stake in PSINet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Internet providers of all size and
description have been snatched up by more traditional
communications companies. UUNet agreed to be acquired by MFS
Communications in 1996 just before MFS itself was acquired by
Worldcom Inc. In 1997, BBN was acquired by GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That has essentially left PSINet as the last of the Mohicans,
holding out against assimilation with the communications giants.
Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has explored acquiring PSInet, but
those discussions were strictly preliminary. Far more likely
suitors are the new breed of communications carrier in the United
States, companies like Level 3, Qwest, Broadwing and Nextlink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to buy PSINet at least 10 times over the last few
years,'' Sidgmore said. ``Right after MFS bought us we tried to buy
him. I tried after Worldcom. I tried a bunch of times and he would
never sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, it comes down to Schrader being Schrader. ``He
always had the opinion that PSInet is worth 10 times whatever his
stock price is,'' Sidgmore said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that other Internet companies have sold out _ beyond
the financial incentives _ has been their executives' notion that
integrating into a bigger company can give them access to a broader
set of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wills, PSINet's No. 2 executive, takes a slightly more pragmatic
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day, they will buy us and we will be sold, and my job is
to make it more expensive for them every day that they wait,''
Wills said. ``What they could have bought for $200 million, they
will now probably have to pay $20 billion for.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Schrader about selling his company _ well, maybe it's better
not to ask. ``Why should I sell the company?'' he said, bristling.
``Tell me.''

   Some of those close to the WBC super featherweight champion will
point to two decisions he made and shake their heads: His rejection
of a multi-million-dollar contract offer from HBO - which he called
``slave wages'' - and the hiring of rap promoter Jay Prince to
replace his father/trainer, Floyd Sr., as his manager. The latter
is part of what has caused a heavyweight feud in one of boxing's
first families.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather, 23, counters by saying he's a grown man and is only
trying to make the right business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever is most accurate, a once-happy camp is now in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   `'He's out of control,'' said Jeff Mayweather, Floyd Jr.'s uncle
and former member of his team.
</P>
<P>
   The boxing world was disgusted when Mayweather turned down a
six-fight, $11.5 million contract extension with HBO, which
would've made him one of the highest-paid fighters in the world,
and his use of the term ``slave wages'' certainly cost him fans.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad at one point that HBO officials refused to
speak with him.
</P>
<P>
   The offer remains on the table but Mayweather - whose title
defense against Goyo Vargas on Saturday is his last under contract
- has yet to accept it and won't say whether he plans to do so.
He'll leave that up to Prince.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mayweather did defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was misquoted. He claims he said something along
the lines of, ``Compared to Prince (Naseem) Hamed's contract, this
is a slave contract'' and doesn't regret saying it. He simply
believes he should be paid the kind of money earned by the likes of
Hamed, Roy Jones Jr. and Oscar De La Hoya, and he is not inclined
to accept anything less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up there with those guys,'' he said. ``I feel I should get
closer to what they get.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I was seen as a good guy when I did everything everyone
asked. Then, when I didn't want to accept the contract, I'm a bad
guy. It doesn't even bother me. I feel good about my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he shouldn't earn the same as Hamed and Co.
Mayweather, while as talented as anyone, does not have the drawing
power of any of the above. At least, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Jay Prince will have Mayweather fix the immediate
problem by accepting HBO's offer and continuing to build his name
by winning fights in spectacular fashion. Normally, that's how it's
done in this business.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can fix the damage done to his personal relationships
is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mayweather, a former fighter who worked in tandem with
Floyd Sr. guiding Floyd Jr.'s career, took the biggest hit: He was
fired by his nephew and now the two barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Jeff said, is a rift between the fighter and several
members of his extended family that might never be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's burned so many bridges,'' Jeff said. ``He's turned
everyone off, everyone in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Jr. said he realized that his uncle doesn't have the
expertise to handle his business affairs and asked himself: Why am
I paying this guy? He also claims that Jeff stole money from him,
an accusation his uncle denies.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Sr., who remains as trainer, seems to be the most hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mayweather said his nephew and brother ``no longer have a
father-and-son relationship. It's strictly business now.'' That
might be an exaggeration but there's some truth to it.
</P>
<P>
   That's sad. The former fighter had to watch from prison as his
son fought in the 1996 Olympics but was released in time to take
over his son' training early in his professional career. The two
comprised a winning and vibrant team and seemed to be tight.
</P>
<P>
   Then Floyd Jr. refused the HBO offer - against his father's
advice - and Hamed has been criticized for lack of legitimate
competition. And while Bungu is a good fighter, he moved up in
weight to fight Hamed and certainly isn't in the class of an Erik
Morales, the type of opponent Hamed must beat if he hopes to lure
back the fans he has alienated....
</P>
<P>
   Floyd senior refused to comment in detail. But it's clear he
feels he was betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has done something wrong to an individual, I feel
that person should apologize,'' he said. ``Sometimes apologies do
mend things, sometimes you can be forgiven for things.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``I'm a true believer in God and there is one thing
I'm sure about: You gotta be good to your parents. That's the way
life is.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Jr. has no regrets about letting his uncle go. However, he
is committed to his father and tried to explain hsi position.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Price, the successful founder of Rap-A-Lot Records in
Houston, because he wanted a businessman with a track record to
handle his money. In a way, he feels his team failed him because
they did not stay behind him when it came time to make a tough
decision.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, he wants his father to remain at his
side as trainer - assuming that's what Floyd Sr. also wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my father,'' said Floyd Jr. ``And he's the best trainer
in the world, he really is. If he doesn't want to train me, he can
go. It's not like I have handcuffs on him. If he is not happy, he
should leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, if my dad left me it would hurt me, it would
take a piece of my heart. Everyone else can leave but not my dad.
If it takes stress off him, then that's what he should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Sr. won't say what he plans to do. He only hinted that the
difficult situation will be rectified soon without providing
details.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's the trainer of one of the most talented fighters
in the world and will make a very good living as long as he remains
with him. He earns 10 percent of his son's purses, as he has all
along, while Prince claims 20 percent (Jeff received three
percent).
</P>
<P>
   However, Floyd Sr. made it clear that no matter what happens
he'll always love his son and want the best for him - even when he
makes mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it can be very, very costly to an individual who
doesn't listen to those close to him, to those who live him,'' he
said. ``But Floyd's a very good man now and I'm his father. I'll be
his father until the day one of us dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Jr. swears he is content. He believes in Prince and is as
confident as ever in his son's ability. He even sees a silver
lining in all that surrounds him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, controversy sells,''aid Floyd Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's plenty of that.
</P>
<P>
   Staples deal off: The fact that Staples Center and Arum have
agreed to share the cost if the state refuses to cap its live-gate
tax at $50,000 for the tentative De La Hoya-Shane Mosley fight on
June 17 was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   What's an estimated $350,000 among friends when all parties
stand to make much, much more?
</P>
<P>
   However, it's the long term that concerns both parties. State
officials probably will have to agree to the cap - as opposed to 5
percent of the gate - if California is going to compete against New
York and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't the cap be implemented? Money generated by
big- money fights will cover any loss as a result of the cap. It's
as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it will be interesting to see exactly how big
this fight will be.
</P>
<P>
   The seating capacity at the new arena will be 19,000-plus. It's
difficult to imagine a sellout even with an expected marketing
blitz: Boxing, even at this level, remains a difficult sell despite
the fact few sports can match its electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers will be surprised if the paid crowd exceeds
15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Lou Savarase, set to fight Mike Tyson on May 20
in Milan, Italy, has little chance of beating the former two-time
world champion.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's a legitimate fighter. That could not be said for
Tyson's last opponent, Julius Francis, who can hardly box.
</P>
<P>
   Savarase isn't a great test for Tyson - but he is a test....
</P>
<P>
   Hamed announced before his bout with Vuyani Bungu that we would
see a more focused, more business-like fighter and he proceeded to
knock out the South African in four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed has been criticized for lack of legitimate competition.
And while Bungu is a good fighter, he moved up in weight to fight
Hamed and certainly is not in the class of an Erik Morales, the
type of opponent Hamed must beat if he hopes to lure back the fans
he has alienated....
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti, whose brutal knockout of Joey Gamache on Feb. 26
in New York pumped added life into his career, is scheduled to
fight on the undercard of the Lennox Lewis-Michael Grant fight on
April 29 in New York. His opponent has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Camache, 33, has the reputation as one of the smartest people
ever to lace up gloves, and he demonstrated why last week - by
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Camache was lucky to survive the Gatti fight without serious
injuries and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky I'm not dead,'' he said. ``When you get that close,
it's a sign from God that it's time to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Camache will make a fine television analyst....
</P>
<P>
   Diego Corales defends his IBF junior lightweight title against
slick Derrick Gainer on the undercard of the Mayweather-Vargas
fight....
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Lopez reportedly is training in Las Vegas and is

EDITORIAL: THE TRIBULATIONS OF MOZAMBIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 13:
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters in Mozambique have subsided, but the need to
provide for the victims is by no means diminished. The United
States and other wealthy nations should be generous in providing
aid. Nearly a million of Mozambique's 17 million people have lost
their homes, farms or food supplies. The official death toll of 400
is expected to rise into the thousands. Tens of thousands of
villagers have fled their homes for the safety of high ground. The
United Nations says 250,000 Mozambicans are now living in makeshift
camps, and another 250,000 remain in ruined villages around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent immediate needs are food, tents, medicine and
plastic sheeting and blankets. The U.N. estimates that a third of
the country's corn, the staple crop, has been destroyed. More than
40,000 head of cattle have drowned, and 141 schools have been
obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term economic consequences could be devastating for a
country that is still struggling to rebuild from a 16-year civil
war that ended in 1992. Mozambique remains one of the poorest
countries in the world, with a per capita annual income of barely
$150. But it had made impressive gains in recent years. The
government of Joaquim Chissano had embraced economic reform,
encouraging foreign investment, increasing exports and boosting
economic growth to close to 10 percent a year, one of the highest
rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But flood damage could reduce the country's domestic product by
as much as a third. After the first floods in early February, the
government and the United Nations issued an urgent appeal for $65
million in foreign aid. They are expected to double or even triple
that request in the coming weeks. So far, foreign donors have
pledged more than $100 million. Debt relief would also help.
Washington has said that it will forgive Mozambique's remaining
debt. Britain, Italy, Spain and Portugal will do the same. The
World Bank has accelerated its debt relief program and diverted
money from long-term infrastructure to emergency road-building.
These are welcome expressions of support for a country that could
take years to recover from this disaster.  &QL;

PIERRE BOULEZ: AT A CONDUCTOR'S PARTIES, THE WORKS HE BEFRIENDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pierre Boulez, who will be 75 in two weeks' time, is
touring the globe for celebrations and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday he arrived at Carnegie Hall with the London Symphony
Orchestra for the first of four concerts on consecutive days,
playing a new piece in each program, 20th-century classics and
works by modern masters. Gyorgy Ligeti and Luciano Berio have been
represented; on Monday night comes Boulez's own ``Originel,'' a
gentle memorial for flute and orchestra, along with music by George
Benjamin, ``Petrushka'' and Daniel Barenboim in the Schoenberg
Piano Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a party. The repertory is such as Boulez has been
promoting from the podium for nearly half a century: His conviction
has not been shaken, not even stirred. But by consistently acting
on that conviction, he has drawn into himself the power of
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   He has also helped educate orchestras and listeners. So the
effect of his conviction has slowly changed. There is no battle
now, no need to swerve from defensiveness to attack. The music has
been proved; it just has to be played superbly.
</P>
<P>
   This is what has been happening. The big pieces in the first two
concerts, Bartok's ``Wooden Prince'' and Schoenberg's ``Pelleas und
Melisande,'' are both favorites of Boulez's, and both succumb
readily to his present conducting style, in which his
characteristic gifts of clarity of texture and precision in detail
and tuning are joined by a grand spaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Both works were given rich and resplendent performances, the
Schoenberg beautifully modulated so that it reached its most
passionate intensity close to the end. Both also found the London
Symphony _ especially the woodwind soloists and the brass _ in fine
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the keenest excitement came in the newer pieces, and
especially in Ligeti's Violin Concerto, this magician composer's
most recent orchestral score. It is music that never comes to
ground. Much of it plays in high registers; much of it tricks and
delights the ear by giving the impression that the soloist is
performing on several violins at once, or that marimbas and other
percussion instruments are tucked under the strings.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds are like light beams playing through glass, and also
like memories of folk music. The abstract and fantastical merges
into the earthy and particular.
</P>
<P>
   The piece has seemed wonderful before, but this performance, so
exquisitely exact in gesture and perfect in intonation, was a
revelation. Christian Tetzlaff, the soloist, amazed. His left hand
jumped into extreme positions with unerring accuracy, and his
playing stayed rhythmically secure and beautifully in tune even at
ferocious speeds. The concerto was all spinning brilliance or, in
the first slow movement, puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   It was also good to hear that a modern violin, made by Peter
Greiner last year, can perform so spectacularly: both in the
concerto and in Tetzlaff's encore piece, a movement from the Bartok
solo sonata.
</P>
<P>
   There was thus a neat segue from Ligeti's music into Bartok's,
in a program that gained further homogeneity from being all
Hungarian. Peter Eotvos' ``zeroPoints'' had been the wacky opener,
beginning from an imitation of an electronic bleep and shooting off
in all kinds of directions, from explosive fanfares to a lugubrious
passage for low wind, everything finely imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The Schoenberg was also partnered by sonic imagination _ not so
much in Berio's disappointing and raggedly played ``Notturno'' for
strings, but decisively in Salvatore Sciarrino's piano concerto
``Recitativo Oscuro.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Pollini, the soloist, was typically vivid and alert,
but seemed not fully sure of his role in playing chill, bright
fragments and explosive chords, while some of the orchestral
players wanted to find humor in the music more than unsettling
oddity and malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the weird soundscape of scratches, wheezes and
whistlings came across. So did the disturbing regular gray tread of
a funeral march through much of the piece, and the sense of piano
and orchestra as two great animals circling each other in the same
cage, about to fight.
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: JARVIS EMBARKING ON A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis passed through a thick, noisy crowd of
well-wishers Sunday evening as he led his St. John's players to
their seats, from where they would watch the traditional National
Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball selection show.
Jarvis made his way through clusters packed three- and four-deep at
the ESPN Zone on Times Square, the place sizzling with the
electricity of college basketball in March. The well-wishers
hollered, ``Congratulations, Coach,'' ``Way to go, Mike,'' and
``Good job, Coach.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city dominated by professional sports and professional
sports issues _ hirings, firings, trades _ St. John's for the
second straight season has managed to ignite a passion for college
basketball. Jarvis, a coach some wondered about and grumbled about,
is quickly winning. In this city, winning takes off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very good about coming to New York before we ever
played a game,'' Jarvis said. ``I felt that there were a lot of
people who were very excited about us being here. What they told me
was that they would judge me as much on how our team played as much
as how our team won.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are a lot of people who are excited about how
you perform. They love the underdog; we're going to have to find a
way to remain the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``New Yorkers say, `Great job, Coach,' but they always
end it with `this year' or `so far.' But that's New York and I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is the architect of a toughness that allowed St. John's
to defeat Duke at Duke last month, then beat Connecticut, the
defending national champion, not once, not twice, but three times.
At George Washington, where he was forced to recruit foreign
players, Jarvis said his greatest challenge, ``was getting players
to understand me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tough,'' Jarvis said, ``but what I want to emphasize is
that we're mentally tough. What I look for, are players who have
not just won all their lives, but who have been through some type
of adversity and who have found a way to come through it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's discovered it was going West. To Tucson, Ariz., as
the second-seeded team, the highest seeding it had received since
1985, when St. John's was placed first in the West and wound up
reaching the Final Four. Still, Jarvis would not call this his most
satisfying season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly been one of the most interesting years,'' he
said. ``But it's really too early. We're still on a journey. I
don't know where it's going to take us. I'm just enjoying the
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley arrived late Sunday and sat by himself on a sofa
away from the team. For the past month, Barkley has been the target
of a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation into
activities including the administration of his Scholastic
Assessment Test before he enrolled at St. John's, as well as other
perceived special benefits. The pressure became so intense that
Barkley stunned his team and the administration by announcing
Friday night that he was leaving the team.
</P>
<P>
   He returned Saturday night and had brilliant game as St. John's
beat Connecticut for the Big East title. This is Barkley's second
season under Jarvis. He said the difference between the first and
second seasons has been miniscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still wants you to run the offense to perfection,'' Barkley
said. ``He runs a pro offense, but over all if you follow his rules
you don't have anything to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's has six games left to win, beginning Thursday against
15th-seeded Northern Arizona. This gets to the heart of a story
that has been lost beneath the drama of the season: the precise
teachings of Mike Jarvis. Last season St. John's was a turnover
from reaching the Final Four. Last season, St. John's had more
weapons: every player could take the opposition off the dribble.
This season passing has had to be crisper. The passing is
exquisite. The team runs, pushes the tempo, forces the pace and
does it with an iron-man rotation of seven players. Is this enough
to advance?
</P>
<P>
   St. John's has not reached the Final Four since 1985. In some
ways the NCAA's worst nightmare might be for the Red Storm to
advance. In each successive tournament game, Barkley could become,
if not a more sympathetic figure, a lightning rod to discuss the
merits of NCAA regulations, the intensity and intent of
enforcement. Everyone knows about Barkley; let's find out about the
enforcement officers who are going after him.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA needs to be exposed. Who orders the investigations?
Through what prisms does the NCAA filter its investigations? An
entire tournament is needed to ferret it out. Let's play the
investigation game on an open court.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is not sure that he wants to carry a campaign through the
tournament. He would prefer to concentrate on basketball. ``But I
probably won't have that option,'' he said. ``That could be a
positive and a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been rumored for several NBA head-coaching jobs. He has
only reiterated that he keeps all options open. At heart he says he
is an educator. A college coach.
</P>
<P>
   On his way through the crowd Sunday evening, a man whispered to
a friend: ``Next year this time he's going to be in the NBA.'' When
told of the exchange that some might consider a compliment, Jarvis
only smiled. ``To some people it might be,'' he said, and he left
it at that. &QL;

(PHOENIX) - Phoenix fifth-grader Tony Marino has been forbidden to
read - by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, mom Lynne Marino won't let her 11-year-old son
reread - again - any of his three Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly four months until the release of the fourth book in
J.K. Rowling's mystical, magical, megaselling series, Tony has been
encouraged to explore books by other authors.
</P>
<P>
   Other Phoenix area kids, parents, librarians and booksellers are
employing a similar strategy to fill the long days between now and
July 8, when the next Potter book is expected to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, kids section staples such as Brian Jacques' Redwall
series and C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia recently have surged in
popularity around the country. In fact, sales for many Harry Potter
surrogate books have doubled or tripled in the past year. (Talk
about legs: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - the first book
in the Narnia series - was originally published 50 years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   With proven page-turning appeal to both kids and their elders,
the three-book Potter series has sold more than 18 million copies
since its first title, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, was
published in September 1998 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter's most powerful magic is his ability to sell
hardcover books to 11-year-old boys. The juvenile market is
primarily a paperback business, and middle school boys don't
typically read much outside of class, preferring athletic and
electronic distractions instead.
</P>
<P>
   A Harry Potter book is ``the type of book that kids who hated to
read have just fallen in love with,'' said Marty Rice, children's
book specialist at Borders Books &AMP; Music in Phoenix. ``For some of
them, it has gotten them excited enough to start reading other
authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Local booksellers and librarians (who have been forced by
limited Potter titles to steer suddenly eager readers to alternate
authors) said they focus on a few key attributes when recommending
surrogates: fast pace, serial form and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's books are ``fast-moving,'' said Kitty Jazwinski,
librarian at Glendale American Elementary School. ``You never read
a chapter and say, `Oh well, nothing happened there.''
</P>
<P>
   Serials appeal to kids who identify with characters and want to
follow continuing adventures, said Joyce Dooley, librarian and
media specialist at Landmark Middle School in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often when we read a book, we don't want it to end,'' she
said. ``That's the appeal of a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students want to read them all and are quick to tell me if I'm
missing one of the books in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy stories encourage young readers to stretch their
imaginations - sometimes too far, allege some parents who dislike
the books because of their supernatural content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter has just enough of the weirdness - the witchy
part - to make it almost naughty but not really,'' said Sue
Sjostrom, a former schoolteacher who now operates Annie's Book Stop
in Phoenix. ``There's just enough `should my kid be reading this?'
to make it that much more special and delicious for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on prerelease orders, the Harry Potter series' fourth
installment, Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament, already
occupies the No. 1 slot on Internet bookseller Amazon.com's sales
list.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marino, who has his copy of the next Harry Potter reserved
at a local bookstore, is making do till July with the Redwall
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' he said. ``But it's not as good as Harry
Potter.'' &QL;

their hunger-for-Harry gangs by exploring other books in the
juvenile-fantasy genre. &QL;

INGRID G. BRAINARD, 74, DANCE HISTORIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ingrid G. Brainard, a dance historian and teacher of historical
dance, died on Feb. 18 at her home in West Newton, Mass. She was
74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Tristram Perry, a spokesman
for the Boston Conservatory, where Brainard taught.
</P>
<P>
   Brainard received a doctorate in musicology from the University
of Gottingen in Germany, writing her dissertation on ``The
Choreographer of the Court Dances of Burgundy, France and Italy in
the 15th Century.'' Her area of expertise extended through dance of
the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reconstructing and staging the dances, Brainard
lectured and wrote for publications including the New Grove
Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the Dance Research Journal, the
Harvard Dictionary of Music and Die Musikforschung.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first fellows of the Radcliffe Institute for
Independent Studies in Cambridge, Mass., Brainard was an artist in
residence at Northeastern University and served as a director and
chairwoman of the Congress on Research in Dance. She also founded
the Cambridge Court Dancers. She had taught dance history at the
Boston Conservatory since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Paul Brainard ended in divorce. She is survived
by a son, Christopher, of Newton.

GORE, BUSH LOOK FOR VOTES IN OTHER'S HOME STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Campaigning in George W. Bush's backyard, Al
Gore on Sunday slammed the Texas governor, saying his tax cut plan
would threaten the nation's economy, the solvency of Social
Security, and ``raises the serious question, does Governor Bush
have the experience to be president?''
</P>
<P>
   As an audience made up primarily of senior citizens answered
``no,'' Gore told them, ``A proposal like that makes you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore came to a senior center here to raise an issue that plays
well with older voters: Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore stumped for votes in Bush country, Bush was in Gore
land, picking up the endorsement of US Senator Fred Thompson, a
Republican from Tennessee and a leading voice on campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush traveled from Austin to Plant City, Fla., where he
campaigned with his brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, at a
strawberry festival and assailed Gore for using campaign finance as
his main issue. ``When I saw the headline, I wasn't sure if it was
an April fool's edition or not in the paper,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fellow must think America has been asleep or
something during the last seven years of this administration,''
Bush went on, adding, ``After all, it was not that long ago that he
went to a Buddhist temple to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's endorsement came as Gore and Bush battled over
independent voters who supported the aborted candidacies of John
McCain and Bill Bradley, in part because of their positions on
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Gore appeared with Minnesota Governor Jesse
Ventura, a champion of campaign finance reform, in an attempt to
boost his credentials as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as Bush was en route to Knoxville, Gore was blaming
Bush's ``secretly financed, sneaky attack ads'' for defeating
McCain, referring to Texas contributors who spent $2.5 million on
negative ads against the Arizona senator. He said that if ``all the
people put pressure on Governor Bush,'' he might agree to the vice
president's offer to suspend television advertisements in exchange
for twice weekly debates. ``I think that he'll be freer to see this
risky tax scheme for what it really is, something the American
people do not want.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit to Texas since Bradley withdrew from the
race, Gore, accompanied by Olympic track star Carl Lewis and US
Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, also reached out to
black and Hispanic voters in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   At a Baptist church just outside Houston, Gore got a respectful
but unusually low-key reception from thousands of congregrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created new jobs, but we have not reached the promised
land,'' he said. ``We may have left Egypt, but don't tell me we
have arrived in Caanan. We have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he sat down for Mexican food and greeted Latino
leaders at the Spanish Flowers Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Gore flew to Florida, where the Gore campaign
is buoyed by what it says is a shot at handing Bush an embarrassing
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore ticket narrowly lost Florida in 1992, but came
back in 1996 to win it. Gore strategists are encouraged by public
polls that show Gore within striking distance of Bush in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Florida will hold primary elections on Tuesday, along
with Tennessee, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

GRUDZIELANEK SAYS HE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Mark Grudzielanek prefers not to hit leadoff
- just like he would have rather remained at shortstop instead of
moving to second base - but if that's what Los Angeles Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson wants, Grudzielanek will give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's latest tinkering with the first two spots in the
lineup included Grudzielanek in the leadoff and center fielder Todd
Hollandsworth second. It's been the reverse of that much of the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I feel much more comfortable in the No. 2 spot, but
we don't have a typical leadoff hitter on this team,'' said
Grudzielanek, who had two hits from the leadoff spot Sunday against
St. Louis. ``I'm sure I'll get comfortable at it, but who knows?
I'm sure we'll have a talk. I like to be comfortable in a spot and
leave it alone, like last year when (Johnson) left me in that
two-hole the last 2 months of the season and it was comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson wants energy at the top of his lineup, and
Hollandsworth and Devon White, battling for the center-field spot,
haven't satisfied his appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Though Grudzielanek is a much better hitter in the No. 2 spot,
he does have extensive leadoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he batted leadoff for the Montreal Expos and enjoyed one
of his most productive offensive seasons. He batted .306 with 34
doubles and 33 stolen bases. However, he walked just 26 times in
692 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some strides last year, I got on base a little more and
maybe I can do some things up there that can help us along,'' said
Grudzielanek, who batted .326 and had a .376 on-base percentage.
``I told him I'd much rather stay in two-hole, but I'll do what
best suits the team. It's not like I'm a stranger to the one-hole.
I understand it, I know what I need to do, but also you have to
understand me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to swing the bat, and I'm not going to change that.
(Montreal manager) Felipe (Alou) found that out in `96. But he left
me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable Cora: After a shaky start in which Alex Cora fought
jitters in the field and had poor at-bats, he's settled in the last
five or six days and played well at shortstop. Cora, 24, said the
change came after talking with his brother, Joey, a former big
leaguer and now a minor-league coach in the Chicago Cubs
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning I wasn't playing relaxed,'' Cora said. ``I
thought it was going to be easier. I felt the pressure a little
bit. I learned from it. (Joey) called me and we had a little chat,
about 45 minutes, and he told me to have fun and play hard. That's
all I can control.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Dodgers managing partner Bob Daly and Scott
Boras, the agent for third baseman Adrian Beltre, will resume
talking today in hopes of reaching agreement for a three-year deal.
Both sides continue to say negotiations are moving in good faith,
but both sides appear to be getting frustrated. ``I don't get mad.
I don't get angry. I'm going to keep my cool,'' Daly said.

CANADIAN SNOW BIRDS TRY NEW SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MAUREEN WEST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Canadian snowbirds always come back to Arizona like
swallows returning to Capistrano.
</P>
<P>
   Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   The slow business in Phoenix's East Valley winter visitor RV
parks this year is blamed in part on the change in the migratory
pattern of Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Some are traveling past Arizona to newer and cheaper places in
Mexico while others are staying in Canada and migrating to British
Columbia, where the weather is moderate, Canadians remain covered
by Canada's public health-care system and there's no devaluation of
currency as occurs across the U.S. line.
</P>
<P>
   Small British Columbia communities are even considering building
RV parks, according to Doug Gray of Vancouver, British Columbia, an
author and lawyer considered the foremost authority on Canadian
snowbird patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``While western Canadians would prefer to winter in Arizona, an
increasing number can't because of medical-insurance problems,''
Gray said during a visit to Apache Junction this month. ``That's a
bigger problem to many people than the poor exchange rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when Gray publishes his fourth edition of his
Canadian bestseller The Canadian Snowbird Guide, it will include a
chapter on snowbirding in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver Island and Vancouver's Fraser Valley have moderate
climates and plentiful campgrounds. Informal winter retirement
communities are emerging there.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 15 to 20 percent of Arizona's 300,000 snowbirds
normally come from Canada. But the numbers have been down the past
few years. Canadians who stay away from home for more than six
months a year lose their health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of money is at stake between competing retirement
regions, Gray said, explaining that the aging population is growing
at a faster rate in Canada than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By 2026, according to Canadian government statistics, 7 million
people, or 18 percent of the Canadian population, will be 65 or
older, compared with 16 percent of Americans. By 2041, Canada will
have 10 million seniors, making up 23 percent of the population. As
in the United States, they are far healthier and more active than
previous retirees.
</P>
<P>
   There is a multiplier effect that increases the value of winter
visitors, according to Gray. He cites a study showing that the
average Canadian snowbird hosts additional visitors, for an average
of 49 days during their seasonal stay. ``Those are a lot of tourist
dollars for the communities where they land,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadians love Arizona and all their friends here and will
be loyal, although many will shorten their traditional six-month
stay here by half, according to Gray. Many East Valley RV park
owners say they have noticed that trend over the past two years,
with some Canadians arriving later and leaving earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are about 55 companies offering
health-insurance policies, some older Canadians can't purchase them
because of pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The current edition of Gray's book has information on part-time
living in Mexico, which is becoming increasingly popular with
younger Canadians. Costa Rica also has appeal to some Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Younger retirees are also being lured to Mexico by airlines
offering cheap packages, said Gray. In January, one round-trip
flight from Canada was advertised for $150. Mexico's rich culture
and cheap rent also are attracting some Canadians. About 95 percent
of Canadians visiting Mexico are 45 and older and have not yet
tried Arizona or other U.S. winter destinations, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians Guy Couture, 57, and his 56-year-old wife, Tharcycle,
of Quebec, who spent six weeks, including a few weeks in Arizona,
on the road in a small van this year, are planning a trip to Mexico
next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Al and Pat Lynch of British Columbia regularly return to Mesa
for the winter, but each year they have to weigh the costs of food
and rent, which have become more expensive over the past seven
winters here.
</P>
<P>
   As do other repeat visitors from Canada, they make the decision
about whether to come back one season at a time. &QL;

.West(at)ArizonaRepublic.com &QL;

Mexico and cities in British Columbia have their eyes on attracting
Canadian winter visitors who in the past have stayed for months at
a time in sunny Arizona. &QL;

MISSOURI SOUTHERN STATE COLLEGE ADOPTS INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOPLIN, Mo. _ When Missouri Southern State College's president
told people in the early 1990s that the college was adopting an
``international mission,'' many thought it could never happen.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``cosmopolitan'' didn't come to mind to describe this
former junior college in a southwest Missouri city better known for
its two dozen trucking firms.
</P>
<P>
   But on the campus, evidence abounds that the college has
embraced the world.
</P>
<P>
   In one classroom, a video camera, television screen and
satellite connection let French-language students talk to a group
of English-language students at a university in Orleans, France.
They debate topics from movies to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In another class, Terry Marion lectures onways a human resources
manager can help employees adjust to living in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   In the office of Chad Stebbins, who heads the Institute of
International Studies, masks he bought while traveling in Africa
adorn the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Students swap tales of time spent studying or working in
countries such as Austria, Mexico, and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges offer students a chance to study abroad, learn
foreign languages and take classes in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But at Missouri Southern, which has about 5,500 students,
thinking globally is a mission that permeates the campus, rather
than being an isolated program.
</P>
<P>
   Campus leaders say the international mission prepares students
for work at companies that are increasingly multinational.
</P>
<P>
   John Wittstruck, Missouri's deputy commissioner for higher
education, remembers the early skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't seem to fit. (Becoming) a center of excellence
in the transportation industry _ trucking _ made more sense,'' he
said. ``But I think they really have made believers out of some of
the skeptics. If one were to ask why an international mission at
Missouri Southern, one would come back with, `Why not?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Opening students and professors to the world is the goal of the
new international focus.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of them have begun going overseas to study everything
from art and biology to music and journalism. Students can major in
international studies and international business, or learn to speak
Russian or Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Campus visits by global notables such as former Costa Rica
President Oscar Arias and the Zambian Boys Choir have lent an
international flair to Joplin, a place where, for many, New York
and Los Angeles were once considered exotic.
</P>
<P>
   At Southern, located near the junction of Kansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma and Arkansas, more than 9 in 10 students are white, most
of them from small to medium-sized towns in the area. Graduates
usually have stayed around Joplin as teachers or nurses,
journalists or business people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, students who have studied abroad think it's natural to want
to work in Chicago or San Francisco, maybe even Madrid or Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Business has become more global, even in this corner of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Leggett &AMP; Platt Inc., a bedding components manufacturer in
nearby Carthage, has plants in Belgium, Germany, Sweden, China and
other countries. Several area firms recently were bought by
international conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's a much smaller place than it used to be and the
Internet has made it smaller,'' said John Hale, Leggett &AMP; Platt's
vice president for human resources. ``Southern was early among
smaller colleges in undertaking an international mission and was
very wise to have done it.''  &LR; brk:Quiet change  &LR; tx:The
international mission began slowly and quietly in the early 1990s
under the leadership of President Julio Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Leon, a native of Chile who is of Chinese descent, arrived at
Southern 31 years ago to teach business classes. He earned a
doctorate at the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville, and later
became dean of Southern's business school. He began his term as
president in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   During his time on campus and in Joplin, Leon came to believe
that Southern's students and professors could benefit from
understanding more of the world than what they could reach in their
car.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted students and professors to know the world, not just
through words in a textbook, but in the sights, smells and sounds
of an open-air market in San Jose, Costa Rica, or a Hong Kong
street crammed with cars, pedestrians and bicycles.

JACK SANFORD, PITCHER WHO WON 16 STRAIGHT, IS DEAD AT 70 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Sanford, a hard-throwing right-hander who won 16
consecutive games in propelling the San Francisco Giants to the
1962 National League pennant, died last Tuesday at a hospital in
Beckley, W.Va. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was brain cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford pitched in the minors for seven seasons, then found
instant success in the major leagues, winning Rookie of the Year
honors with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1957, when he was 19-8 and
led the majors in strikeouts with 188.
</P>
<P>
   After falling to a 10-13 record the following season, he was
traded to the Giants for pitcher Ruben Gomez and catcher Valmy
Thomas in what the Phillies president, Bob Carpenter, would rue as
``the worst trade I ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford won 40 games over the following three seasons, and then,
at 33, achieved acclaim he could hardly have envisioned when, as a
teen-ager out of Wellesley Hills, Mass., he was spurned by the
Boston Red Sox at a tryout camp. In 1962, Sanford won 16 straight
starts between mid-June and mid-September en route to a 24-7 record
for a Giants team that won the pennant in a three-game playoff
against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Only Rube Marquard, who won 19 straight for the New York Giants
in 1912, and Roy Face, who won 17 straight for the Pittsburgh
Pirates in 1959, have won more consecutive games in a single year
during the modern era. Six pitchers have matched Sanford's 16-game
single-season streak.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford started against the Yankees' Ralph Terry three times in
a rain-plagued 1962 World Series that stretched over 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a three-hit, complete-game shutout in Game 2 at
Candlestick Park, a 2-0 victory that was ``the best game I ever
pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember almost every pitch,'' he said in an interview
more than three decades later. ``I tried to pitch inside on Mantle
and low and away on Maris.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford was beaten in Game 5 at Yankee Stadium, when he struck
out 10 but yielded a three-run homer to Tom Tresh in the eighth
inning that sent the Yankees to a 5-3 victory. He pitched into the
eighth inning in Game 7, leaving with the Yankees leading by 1-0.
The Giants had runners on second and third with two outs in the
ninth when Willie McCovey drilled a liner toward right field off
Terry, who had been victimized by Bill Mazeroski's Series-winning
homer for the Pirates in 1960. Second baseman Bobby Richardson
stuck up his glove and snared the ball to end the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford had a record of 137-101 for 12 seasons, with the
Phillies, Giants, California Angels and Kansas City Athletics. He
was a golf director at country clubs after retiring from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ileta, of Daniels, W.Va., and West
Palm Beach, Fla.; a son, John, of Jupiter, Fla., and three
daughters, Laura Sanford, of Lexington, Mass.; Nancy Blagg, of San
Antonio, and Susan Sanford of Boulder, Colo., all from his marriage
to the former Patricia Reynolds, which ended in divorce; a brother,
Frederick, of Natick, Mass.; a sister, Nancy Rafter, of Dover,
Mass., and three grandchildren.

MISSOURI SOUTHERN STATE COLLEGE ADOPTS INTERNATIONAL ATTITUDE

   ``Some of our students tend to be a little provincial in their
views. Some of them have never been out of the county, let alone
the country,'' Leon said. ``When they travel they have to get a
passport, cross the ocean, deal with different languages. When
these students return, they are transformed in the way they see
themselves. Their horizons are expanded.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 students go abroad each year, some for weeklong
conferences, others for a semester or year or to study or intern
for a company.
</P>
<P>
   The move to an international mission began when a handful of
students went abroad and a few professors introduced international
content to their classes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Missouri Coordinating Board for Higher Education
began ``mission review,'' which required Missouri's public colleges
to choose a mission. Board members wanted the state's public
colleges to differentiate themselves from each other and to focus
their efforts, not try to be all things to all people.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri General Assembly decided to give colleges money to
enhance those missions. Many colleges chose missions that reflected
the strengths they had had for years. For example, the University
of Missouri's four campuses wanted to strengthen graduate programs
and the life and health sciences.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern decided to stretch. It has received almost $6
million over the past five years in mission enhancement money, and
uses about $300,000 each year to send students abroad, and almost
$100,000 to send professors abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international mission has put us on the map and made us a
player around the state,'' said Stebbins, a Joplin native. ``(Other
colleges) are doing more of what they did before. We're doing
something completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one graduate: it practically ``defies logic''
that his alma mater has successfully adopted a cosmopolitan
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   There have been obstacles along Southern's path toward being a
global campus. Many people on campus and in the community were
suspicious of the change. Some still are.
</P>
<P>
   People have questioned whether the school really needs to focus
on what's happening in Hong Kong or Africa. Who cares, they ask,
how England educates its kids or Mexico handles environmental
problems?
</P>
<P>
   Some area residents heard ``international mission'' and
envisioned a flood of foreign students taking classroom spots from
local kids.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what the mission is about.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more foreign students study in Joplin now, but the
number still is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the international focus lets students and professors
experience the world themselves, with many overseas trips paid for
by the college. Similar programs at most colleges help students
find private scholarships to go overseas, but don't pay for the
trips.
</P>
<P>
   And the international mission lets Southern students debate
important issues in other nations that have a ripple effect
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier, people would say, `Why an international mission? Kids
grow up in southwest Missouri. They go to school here, work here
and die here,' '' said Richard Massa, a southwest Missouri native
who began the school's Institute of International Studies in 1996.
``But my response is, `Your children deserve the very best
education possible.' ''  &LR; brk:Different attitude  &LR; tx:As a member of
the college's governing board, alum Steve Carlton endorses the
change. When he was a student, ``the big thing was a trip (to
Bolivar, Mo.) to play Southwest Baptist in baseball. Going to
college was a big deal, let alone Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not true for today's students.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rogers graduated in December and now edits /{The Carthage
Press./} The highlight of his time at Southern was a three-week
trip to Hong Kong and China. He and another student worked side by
side with journalists from around the world covering Britain's
handover of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the impression the Chinese are reserved and serious,
but I got to see more sides of the Chinese people,'' Rogers
recalls. ``We went to the Guangzhou zoo. We were the main
attraction. Everybody was following us around. They are enamored of
the American culture, but I hadn't realized that before.''
</P>
<P>
   The college also has worked to share its new identity with
people off campus.
</P>
<P>
   Southern students teach after-school classes in Spanish and
Russian at area elementary schools. Joplin area residents attend
the school's annual International Piano Competition and campus
performances by international cultural groups. The college offers
an International Trade and Quality Center as a resource for local
businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   But the mission's primary goal is to mold Southern students into
world-ready young people who understand themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ginny Andrews, a mass communication major, traveled to Germany
on a fellowship and to Croatia for an international journalism
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel extremely well equipped,'' she said. ``It's a great
college, but on top of that, their dedication to the international
mission has really enhanced my education.''

DON'T WORRY, THOSE NEW GOLDEN DOLLARS ARE COMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Those new golden dollars, the ones featuring
Indian guide Sacagawea, seem to have vanished as quickly as they
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Have they already gone the way of the ill-fated Susan B. Anthony
dollar?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. In fact, people gobbled up the first 200 million so fast
that the folks at the U.S. Mint wished they had twice as many for
the first distribution. Hey, 200 million (BEGIN ITALICS)seemed(END
ITALICS) like a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The mint shipped 100 million to the Federal Reserve, which
distributed them to banks, and 100 million to Wal-Mart stores,
where they landed in their cash registers. The nationwide shipment
got under way at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   Some area Wal-Mart stores are still making change with the new
dollars, but don't be surprised if bank tellers and checkout clerks
have trouble coming up with one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shortage because of the surprising demand,'' said
Diane Raley at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. ``We will
eventually catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael White at the U.S. Mint in Washington hopes to be caught
up by the end of March. The Philadelphia mint is cranking them out
at high speed, he said, and the Denver mint will join in soon.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Commerce Bank got an initial shipment of 2,000 and UMB
Bank received 4,000, not enough to keep up with requests.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who got some of the first batch of coins held onto
them as collector's items _ a typical reaction to a new coin, White
said. But soon there will be enough in circulation that consumers
will use them like the rest of their coins, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks the new dollars shouldn't be so scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hit the 14-week mark of production, about mid-April,
we expect to be up around 500 million coins,'' said White. ``It
took the Susan B. Anthony coin 14 years to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the mint, in fact, like to talk about how different
the new dollar is from the Susan B. Anthony, a coin that never
caught on in part because it looked and felt too much like a
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference, of course, is the new coin is golden,
although not actually gold. It is manganese brass, a mixture of
copper, zinc, manganese and nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The new coin is the same size as the Susan B. Anthony, but it
has an extra-wide border and a smooth edge like a nickel, rather
than a reeded edge. And through the miracle of electromagnetic
properties, says the mint, vending machines that recognized the
Susan B. Anthony as a dollar coin also will recognize the new
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   While the coin has gotten some good reviews, it wasn't launched
without controversy. Some retailers didn't appreciate the mint's
idea to get the coin to consumers quickly by selling them to
Wal-Mart. Plenty of small store owners already struggle against
Wal-Mart competition.
</P>
<P>
   And some banks complained that Wal-Mart got the coins before
they did, although the mint maintains the coins were shipped at the
same time. Some smaller community banks complained they were
shortchanged in the distribution, and the mint recently launched a
new distribution directly to them.
</P>
<P>
   Many have applauded the choice of Sacagawea as the image on the
new coin. Sacagawea was the Shoshone interpreter who accompanied
Lewis and Clark on their expedition west between 1804 and 1806.
Interestingly, she seems to peer directly at the holder.
</P>
<P>
   But a small brouhaha arose over the way Sacagawea is pictured
carrying her baby. Sacagawea gave birth to a son, Jean Baptiste, on
the trip and would likely have placed him on a cradleboard, facing
backward, according to Shoshone custom. But the image shows the
baby facing forward, wrapped in a pouch on her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically there was a little artistic license there,'' said
White.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small image, it would have been difficult to picture
the baby on a cradleboard. And the mint checked with Shoshone
representatives and historians who said that it was possible that
as a matter of convenience at times Sacagawea would have wrapped
the baby and carried him on her back as depicted.
</P>
<P>
   For the success of the coin itself, the question remains whether
Americans will take to it in everyday transactions. Some people are
skeptical, especially as long as the dollar bill is around.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be a plot to do away with the $1 denomination in
paper money?
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to the National Press Club in Washington,
Philip N. Diehl, director of the U.S. Mint, said there were no
plans to retire the dollar bill. The new coin, so long in coming,
he said, was a response to a market demand for a new dollar coin,
especially in the vending industry.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in the next few months will decide if Diehl was
correct in calling the response to the coin a ``grand slam home
run.''

   On a recent visit to New Orleans, I was boarding a tour bus when
the guide asked everyone his or her place of origin. There were
visitors from Tennessee, Oklahoma, California, France, Italy and
Germany, and the guide's reply was always the same: ``How nice!
Welcome to New Orleans!'' When he came to me, I answered ``New
York.'' ``Welcome to America,'' he replied. Are we really viewed as
that different?

   When she returned from Paris recently, Susan Rappaport brought
two charming and basic French books for Alexandra Hall, her
5-year-old granddaughter. She explained that Alex might enjoy
beginning to learn French now, in preparation for future visits.
Alex listened attentively and then placed her hands firmly on her
hips. ``Thanks for the books, but I can't learn French,'' she said.
``Listen, I don't even know all the words in New York City yet.''

   It's enough to make one wonder, according to Norman I. Reisman.
He was among the crowd on the subway platform waiting to push onto

   I was driving on the Upper East Side when a pedestrian pointed
to my front wheel, indicating something was wrong. I pulled up next
to the curb. He bent over, examined the tire and asked me to pull
up about a foot and then back up so he could show me what had
caused the flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing that I was annoyed at the prospect of changing the tire,
he offered to give me a hand. By pure good luck, he had a plug and
the glue necessary to fix it. He quickly yanked out the sharp screw
that had caused the damage, inserted the plug and in two minutes
had executed a perfect repair. I offered him $5 but he said he
wanted $15. I gave him $10, but felt he had earned the money.
</P>
<P>
   On my way home, I pulled into a gas station to check the tire
pressure. As the attendant checked the tires, I recounted my story.
</P>
<P>
   He roared with laughter. ``I told Charlie to cut that stuff out.
He'll ruin the neighborhood reputation,'' he said. Of course, what
Charlie did when he bent over was to place a screw on the road and
ask me to rock the car back and forth until I had given myself a
flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Charlie doesn't feel he's ready to give up his repair
work. Soon after, he did the same thing to a good friend of mine,
but was paid twice since he was able to put two holes in the tire.

everyone know you?'' he asked. Rainin didn't affirm or deny, he
just fudged. ``Not quite,'' he said.

   Mielke was across from Saks Fifth Avenue, trying to hail a taxi.
As she raised her arm, she felt a foreign object in her right hand
and without even looking at it, flung it into the street. The next
thing she knew, a man was yelling, ``For God's sake, get out of the
street'' as he pulled a woman back to the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic light changed and the man ran into the road himself
and retrieved a woman's wig. It was the foreign object Mielke had
tossed away. She had swept it off the woman's head with the curled
finger of her upraised, taxi-hailing arm.

THE KNICKS STAND TALL AGAINST THE SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston sneered right back
at their demons Sunday night by attacking their fears. Instead of
flinching at the sight of Tim Duncan and David Robinson, they began
the game by smartly driving right under the chins of San Antonio's
exceptional big men.
</P>
<P>
   They used reverse layups and backdoor cuts and devised a detour
system around the wingspan of Duncan and Robinson. In the process,
they left the looming duo that devastated them in the finals last
June in foul trouble. With a little help from the Knicks' missing
piece in that championship series _ Patrick Ewing _ they barged
their way to a 93-80 confidence builder at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It did not make up for the last time the Spurs were at the
Garden, when they danced around after winning the league
championship, but it helped soothe any anxiety the Knicks may have
had about whether they could compete against Robinson and Duncan if
they meet again.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' star trio dominated. Sprewell ended with 24 points,
Houston scored 20 and Ewing had 21 points and 15 rebounds. Held
down by Larry Johnson, Duncan scored just 15 points, while Robinson
added 22. The Knicks held the Spurs to 38.6 percent shooting from
the field and shot 48.6 percent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' hold on this game slipped just a bit in the opening
four minutes of the fourth quarter, when the Spurs cut a 17-point
third-quarter deficit to 9 points after Duncan's hook shot over
Kurt Thomas. But the Knicks did not repeat their pattern of coming
unglued under pressure this season and fought back with some smart
defense to take the ball out of Duncan's hands. A 3-pointer by
Johnson with 6 minutes 53 seconds left put his team back up, 87-73.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few nervous moments when the Spurs cut the Knicks'
lead to 89-80 with two minutes left. But the attack theme
prevailed. After a miss by Robinson, Chris Childs scored on a
driving layup with 1:23 remaining to increase the margin to 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were not the dominating force they were the last time
they came to the Garden. A month later, Sean Elliott had a kidney
transplant. That he was sitting on the bench in a suit Sunday
night, awaiting the green light to play again, was a medical
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were also without the injured Terry Porter. But they
did have Duncan and Robinson to torture the Knicks. Last June, they
devastated the Knicks in the paint, coming up with points and
blocked shots. By the end of the finals, the Knicks were flinching
as they drove the lane and helpless to defend against the bank-shot
artist, Duncan. In January, it was the same.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Knicks took a different approach. Instead of
shying from contact, they reveled in it as Sprewell and Houston
drove inside, using their bodies and reverse layups to avoid having
their shots blocked. In the process, they also drew fouls on
Robinson and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter was a blueprint followed to perfection.
Johnson played physically on Duncan _ and was aided by a few double
teams _ to hold him to 1-for-7 shooting. On offense, the Knicks
worked the ball inside and ended the first quarter going to the
free-throw line on their final five possessions to take a 34-22
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Knicks went into a lull. Once again, as soon as
Coach Jeff Van Gundy began to put reserves like John Wallace and
Childs into the game, the rhythm was lost. Quickly, the Spurs
capitalized and went on a 12-0 run to cut the Knicks' lead to
36-34. The Knicks turned the ball over three times in that span.
And when they doubled Duncan, he passed the ball to set up Jaren
Jackson and Mario Elie for 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Knicks, perhaps because they had been the aggressors,
got the benefit of a key call with 4:41 remaining and their lead
down to 42-41. It appeared Sprewell bumped Robinson out of the way
on a reverse layup attempt. But Referee Hugh Evans saw it
differently and slapped Robinson with his third foul.
</P>
<P>
   A livid Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich went storming up the sideline
and was hit with a technical foul. After the free throw for the
technical, plus the two free throws by Sprewell, the Knicks grabbed
a 4-point lead and crushed the Spurs' momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks plodded ahead from there and ended the first half
with an exclamation mark. After a steal by Wallace, Childs came
streaking up the court, pulled up from 26 feet and knocked down a
3-pointer at the buzzer to give them a 54-47 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan to attack the Spurs' big men was working, even though
the Spurs were shooting 51.2 percent. By the end of the half, the
Knicks had gone to the free-throw line 16 times, while the Spurs
had just four attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sprewell guiding the way. He was masterminding the
Knicks' plan on every level _ coming up with four assists and six
rebounds to go with his 16 first-half points _ while providing
inspiration with his hustle.
</P>
<P>
   He did not let down in the third quarter. He picked up two quick
assists, including a slick feed to Johnson for a layup, and had the
Knicks up 64-52 with eight minutes left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's unselfishness was contagious. Ewing got into the act
of giving when he drove through the lane and spotted Houston wide
open on the perimeter. In midstride, Ewing flung the ball outside.
And as the crowd cheered the unselfishness, Houston lived up to
their excitement by drilling the 3-pointer. One possession later,
Houston made another 3-pointer and gave the Knicks a 71-55 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The evening crowd could not help but be impressed and cheered
wildly as the Spurs were forced to take another timeout to stop the
bleeding. The Knicks' lead ballooned to 17 points after another
assist from Sprewell and some tough defense by Johnson on Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs had their pride, and the Knicks had a couple of
sloppy moments. Those lapses gave the Spurs a chance to cut the
Knicks' lead to 79-67 entering the fourth. &QL;

   TOPEKA, Kan. _ While thousands of folks hound the Kansas Revenue
Department for their income tax refunds, some people turn up their
noses at huge checks another state agency has waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being told that the state holds a big chunk of your
money, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars, but refusing to
accept it, even after the state has tracked you down and told you
it's available.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wilson, a former Johnson County state representative who
runs the unclaimed property operation for state Treasurer Tim
Shallenburger, shakes his head at it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people on one hand who can't get it fast enough, and
others, when you have it in hand, you can't give it to them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's program in the treasurer's office is charged with
returning as much as $80 million to about 375,000 missing owners.
Last year, $5.8 million was returned.
</P>
<P>
   It's like being a debt collector in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   He finds people and tries to return money to them that has been
held in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, insurance policies and even
utility deposits that are considered abandoned. When the owners
can't be found, the money is given to the state treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Wilson about returning big-time amounts and he'll quickly
come up with a handful of stories. He says he can't release
information that would allow the potential recipients to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of a person whose name was culled from the
unclaimed property records last March. The person was tracked down
and letters were sent urging the person to make a claim, but Wilson
has heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Shallenburger and I could not raise the person on the
phone. We went to the person's door and knocked on the door,''
Wilson said. ``The person came to the door without opening it and
said, `Who is it? What do you want?'''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he explained that a number of letters had been sent
and there had been no response. Did you know, Wilson asked the
person, that there is $224,000 in unclaimed property in your name?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' the person said. ``Go away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day,'' Wilson said, ``we have not heard from this
person.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Wilson traced someone entitled to $255,000 from
the unclaimed property account, but found that the person had moved
to Georgia. Unclaimed property authorities there said they were
trying to give the same person $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The person moved again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent two registered letters to the home,'' Wilson said.
``That's been seven months ago, and the person's not collected or
had anything to do with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had the same luck trying to reunite people with two claims
of $65,000 each and with one of $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Missouri treasurer's office, officials in the unclaimed
property section used to be baffled by the refusal of people to
accept money owed to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not anymore,'' said Monica Boone, a spokeswoman. ``I
usually send them a claim form and say it's up to them whether they
send it back or not. There's not a thing we can do if they don't
want their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is holding about $135 million worth of unclaimed
property owned by more than 900,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both states say they don't know why some people are
unwilling to accept such large amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, turns down the windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson returned about $145,000 to an individual who had no idea
the cash was waiting from an old real estate deal and some old
shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable. This is unbelievable service because I
had no idea that either one of those existed,'' the person told
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest I've actually given away since I've been here is
$405,000,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Checks in the range of $50,000 or $60,000 aren't that unusual.
Wilson has one case worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson routinely writes letters explaining that he may have
missing money for a person. He makes phone calls, sometimes
multiple calls. He's like a persistent salesman trying to close the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   What does he think about when he's standing on a stranger's
porch?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I worry about is my safety,'' he said.
``People are pretty jumpy about opening the door for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he tries to persuade people that he is really from the
treasurer's office, that he's not selling something or trying to
scam someone.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he has been fairly successful at returning money to
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one function of government that is good,'' he said.
``This is one function of government that works.''

3 U.S. HIGH SCHOOL RECORDS SET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM J. MILLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three United States high school records were set, and
Shalane Flanagan and Damion Drummond lost in upsets Sunday in the
final day of the New Balance National Scholastic Indoor
Championships at the Armory Track and Field Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The national records were registered by Brooklyn's Boys and
Girls High School in the girls' 4x800-meterrelay in 9 minutes 7.57
seconds; Leevan Sands of Melbourne, Fla., in the boys' triple jump
at 52 feet 8 inches; and Sanya Richards of Pembroke Pines, Fla., in
the girls' 200 in 23.64 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, a 15-year-old sophomore, also won the 60 in 7.43 in
her first career indoor meet. Sands, a senior, also took the long
jump Saturday at 24-3}.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, one of the top milers, from Marblehead, Mass., was
leading in the mile Sunday until five meters from the finish, when
Emily Kroshus of Calgary, Alberta, came on to nip her at the tape
in 4:46.79, just 12-hundredths of a second ahead. The two seniors
will meet again next week in Portugal at the world junior
cross-country championships.
</P>
<P>
   Kroshus, a 5-foot-6-inch, 120-pound smooth-striding runner who
has trained 80 miles a week for the cross-country meet with little
speed work, returned to the track 90 minutes after the mile Sunday
and destroyed the competition in the two-mile run with a sparkling
10:09.36, winning by more than 100 meters. She had splits of 5:02
for one mile and 9:32 at the 3,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond, a senior at Brooklyn's Paul Robeson High, took the
lead in the 800 and held it until Paul Joyce, a senior at Rockland
County's Clarkstown South, put on a blistering kick over the final
80 meters to win in 1:52.23, with Drummond second in 1:53.39. Joyce
had defeated Drummond in the 800 in the Eastern States meet two
weeks ago in a national-leading time of 1:51.96.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Thomas, a senior at Northwest High School in Burtonville,
Md., put on gritty winning performances in the 60 and the 60 high
hurdles. Suffering since January from a badly sprained left ankle
that had curtailed his training, he won the 60 dash in 6.73, which
came as no surprise since he is one of the best in the country at
the sprint. But he raised eyebrows with his hurdles victory, in
7.92, which came 10 minutes after his dash victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the meet officials Monday and asked if I could be in
the hurdles even though I hadn't hurdled since outdoor season last
year,'' the 6-1, 180-pound Thomas said. ``I just wanted to see if I
could do something in the hurdles.'' He ran two races in each of
these events before the finals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Other outstanding performances Sunday in boys' events were
recorded by Carlos Bedoya of White Plains, N.Y., in the 200
(21.44); Jonte Buhl of Austin, Tex., in the 400 (47.78); Justin
Romaniuk of Suffern, N.Y., in the mile (4:14.09); Camden, N.J., in
the 4x200 relay (1:28.81); Lenape, N.J., in the 4x400 relay
(3:16.40); and Joshua McCaughey of West Kingston, R.I., in the
25-pound weight throw at 78-8\.
</P>
<P>
   Notable winners in girls' events included Priscilla Lopes of
Whitby, Ontario, in the 60 hurdles (8.29); William Penn of
Philadelphia in the 4x400 relay (3:50.82); and Berkeley of
California in the 4x200 relay (1:38.73).

BLOCK SCHEDULING IN SCHOOLS GAINS POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ERICA WOOD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kay Lunsford belongs to the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the North Kansas City High School English
department was among the veteran teachers who fought to stop the
school from going to longer class periods in the fall of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Lunsford, now the writing-lab manager, has since joined the
parade of administrators, teachers and students who praise what is
known as block scheduling. Though some districts balk at the
format, the concept has steadily gained popularity in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lunsford said the change had forced her to become aware of
different learning styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop being the great purveyor of education,''
Lunsford said. ``My kids told me it wasn't going to work for me to
talk to them for 85 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Several variations of block scheduling exist, but most schools
use modified versions of the straight ``4//4'' block or the
alternating ``A//B'' model.
</P>
<P>
   On the straight block, classes meet every day, and students do a
school year's worth of work in a semester.
</P>
<P>
   The other version alternates two daily schedules, so that four
classes meet on the ``A'' day and four on the following ``B'' day.
Students take eight courses each semester.
</P>
<P>
   The A//B model is the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   Area schools from Independence to Kansas City, Kan., have
switched to the longer periods. Others, such as Center and Shawnee
Mission South, aren't convinced block scheduling is the best
method.
</P>
<P>
   They've stuck with the more traditional schedule, which
encompasses six to eight class periods daily, each lasting 45 to 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Though studies have reported conflicting results on the academic
benefits, block scheduling appears to be more than a fad.
</P>
<P>
   Jim King, executive director of the Missouri Association of
Secondary School Principals, said he knew of no Missouri schools
that had tried the block format and then reverted to the
traditional schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a 1997 survey of 77 percent of Virginia schools
found block scheduling had created a more relaxed environment that
had resulted in fewer discipline referrals and improved teacher
morale.
</P>
<P>
   Area school officials and students say teachers now have more
time to go in-depth than with the traditional schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been extremely positive about it,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   North Kansas City High School was one of the area's first to
switch to the ``A//B'' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study there showed that students now have more time to
study for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Durham, school-improvement coordinator for North Kansas
City High School, said academically there hadn't been a measurable
difference. But officials have seen fewer discipline problems.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Cannon, a North Kansas City High School freshman, said that
with all the rushing around under the old format, he didn't know
how students got anything done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel as bogged down,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Area schools have learned to compromise on the controversial
aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Math and music teachers traditionally have balked at block
scheduling. They want students in class every day, lest they forget
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin Middle School in the Hickman Mills School District solved
the problem by instituting a seminar period common to most block
formats. Seminars enable students to receive tutoring, attend club
meetings or go to assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   At Ervin, students attend their band, orchestra or choir
practice for the first 45 minutes of seminar. They attend class the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin Principal Darryl Cobb said officials found that most music
students were doing OK academically, so they didn't need the extra
help others get during seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Marching-band members at Shawnee Mission West also can work with
their teachers during seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not everybody's a fan of block scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to Shawnee Mission West and several other high schools
with block scheduling weren't enough to sell the program to Shawnee
Mission South's faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Corky Jacobs said officials couldn't see where block
scheduling would benefit students, since they already had strong
test scores. A committee is studying the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Schumann, Center High School principal, said the
district's main focus was to raise test scores so that it could
regain full accreditation in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Because no proof exists that block scheduling helps that,
Schumann said, switching schedules is not a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the seminar period gives students too much freedom.
The report on North Kansas City's program suggests that many
students don't fully utilize the period.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day at North Kansas City High School, some students
practiced dance routines or received academic help. Others
congregated in the hallways, sitting or leaning against lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (seminar) great for the one-third to one-half of students
who will take it seriously,'' King said. ``For those not really
committed to school to begin with, it provides an opportunity for
them to waste that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Each district, he said, has to look at what's best for its
students in deciding whether to switch to block scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever schedule you're on, you have to learn to live with
it,'' he said.

 In a rare event, hearing-impaired person serves as juror  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Last Monday, Joseph Forbis, a 35-year-old
Kansas City, Kan., resident, became the first hearing-impaired
person to serve as a juror in Wyandotte County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Forbis works for United Parcel Service sorting and labeling
small packages, making sure they join shipments headed for the
proper destinations. He is pursuing a degree in counseling at
Kansas City Kansas Community College, where he is taking three
courses this semester.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday and Tuesday, with sign-language interpreters to help
him understand the testimony, he served on a jury that acquitted
Leeotis Yancey of Kansas City, Kan., of aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, the defense attorney and the prosecutor all said
Forbis' disability had not been disruptive and that they
appreciated his service.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for hearing-impaired persons to appear in
court as witnesses, plaintiffs or defendants. But their serving as
jurors is not common. Forbis said he hoped he might have been the
first in Kansas, maybe even in the country. But that wasn't the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Kaspar, president of Deaf Expression Inc., which
furnished the interpreters, said deaf jurors served in two trials
in Kansas City about four years ago. Ron Keefover, spokesman for
the Office of Judicial Administration in Topeka, said Forbis would
have to settle for second in Kansas. A deaf person served on a jury
in Wichita in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I received the (jury) summons I said, `I'm going, because
I want to see how the judicial system works,''' Forbis said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Forbis said he called the jury clerk, inquired about an
interpreter and was told the court would furnish one.
</P>
<P>
   When Monday came, Forbis joined scores of other potential jurors
who gathered at the courthouse and ``waited and waited and
waited,'' as Forbis put it.
</P>
<P>
   Forbis said he saw his chances to be a juror shrinking as the
day wore on. Then, in the afternoon, his name was called with the
last group that was sent to the courtroom of Wyandotte County
District Judge Thomas L. Boeding.
</P>
<P>
   Boeding said he was first aware that a deaf person was in the
jury pool when an interpreter arrived at his office minutes before
he was due in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 25 years practicing law, I've never even seen a deaf
person show up for jury duty,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeding called Forbis, assistant district attorney Cline Boone
and defense attorney Bob DeCoursey into his office. They discussed
some of the hurdles posed by Forbis' presence, including that the
interpreter would have to be in the jury room during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas law says that only 12 jurors may be in the jury room.
Boeding told the interpreter he would have to maintain the
confidentiality of the jury room and could not participate in
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the session with the judge and lawyers, Forbis
said, ``I had my hopes pretty high. I had to keep in mind I could
be eliminated any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbis was chosen as one of the 12 jurors and was placed in the
seat closest to the witness stand. The interpreter _ actually there
were two who traded off every 20 minutes _ sat beside the court
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a minute or two of the start of the trial it was like
nothing unusual was going on,'' Boeding said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one small hitch developed during the trial, Forbis said.
Boone, the prosecutor, stood blocking his view of the interpreter.
Boone was told to move.
</P>
<P>
   DeCoursey said that Forbis paid close attention to the testimony
and that, perhaps because of him, the other jurors did the same.
</P>
<P>
   As for the evidence, Forbis said he and the other jurors
believed there were so many inconsistencies in the testimony that
they could not convict the defendant. The jury deliberated just 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really pleasant experience,'' Forbis said. ``I
enjoyed my service very much.''

CANADA (Phoenix) _ Canadian ``snowbirds'' always come back to
Arizona like swallows returning to Capistrano. Or do they? The slow
business in Phoenix's East Valley winter visitor RV parks this year
is blamed in part on the change in the migratory pattern of
Canadians. Some are traveling past Arizona to newer and cheaper
places in Mexico while others are staying in Canada and migrating
to British Columbia, where the weather is moderate, Canadians
remain covered by Canada's public health-care system and there's no
devaluation of currency as occurs across the U.S. line. By MAUREEN

   &UR; (EDITORS: ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY) (PHOENIX) -
Phoenix fifth-grader Tony Marino has been forbidden to read - by
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, mom Lynne Marino won't let her 11-year-old son
reread - again - any of his three Harry Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly four months until the release of the fourth book in
J.K. Rowling's mystical, magical, megaselling series, Tony has been
encouraged to explore books by other authors.
</P>
<P>
   Other Phoenix area kids, parents, librarians and booksellers are
employing a similar strategy to fill the long days between now and
July 8, when the next Potter book is expected to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, kids section staples such as Brian Jacques' Redwall
series and C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia recently have surged in
popularity around the country. In fact, sales for many Harry Potter
surrogate books have doubled or tripled in the past year. (Talk
about legs: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - the first book
in the Narnia series - was originally published 50 years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   With proven page-turning appeal to both kids and their elders,
the three-book Potter series has sold more than 18 million copies
since its first title, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, was
published in September 1998 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter's most powerful magic is his ability to sell
hardcover books to 11-year-old boys. The juvenile market is
primarily a paperback business, and middle school boys don't
typically read much outside of class, preferring athletic and
electronic distractions instead.
</P>
<P>
   A Harry Potter book is ``the type of book that kids who hated to
read have just fallen in love with,'' said Marty Rice, children's
book specialist at Borders Books &AMP; Music in Phoenix. ``For some of
them, it has gotten them excited enough to start reading other
authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Local booksellers and librarians (who have been forced by
limited Potter titles to steer suddenly eager readers to alternate
authors) said they focus on a few key attributes when recommending
surrogates: fast pace, serial form and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's books are ``fast-moving,'' said Kitty Jazwinski,
librarian at Glendale American Elementary School. ``You never read
a chapter and say, `Oh well, nothing happened there.''
</P>
<P>
   Serials appeal to kids who identify with characters and want to
follow continuing adventures, said Joyce Dooley, librarian and
media specialist at Landmark Middle School in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often when we read a book, we don't want it to end,'' she
said. ``That's the appeal of a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students want to read them all and are quick to tell me if I'm
missing one of the books in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy stories encourage young readers to stretch their
imaginations - sometimes too far, allege some parents who dislike
the books because of their supernatural content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter has just enough of the weirdness - the witchy
part - to make it almost naughty but not really,'' said Sue
Sjostrom, a former schoolteacher who now operates Annie's Book Stop
in Phoenix. ``There's just enough `should my kid be reading this?'
to make it that much more special and delicious for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on prerelease orders, the Harry Potter series' fourth
installment, Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament, already
occupies the No. 1 slot on Internet bookseller Amazon.com's sales
list.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Marino, who has his copy of the next Harry Potter reserved
at a local bookstore, is making do till July with the Redwall
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' he said. ``But it's not as good as Harry
Potter.'' &QL;

WALTER DANA, 96, POLKA PROMOTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Dana, who propelled polka music to a new prominence in
postwar America after a varied career in popular music in Poland,
died on March 4 in Miami Beach. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Having exposed the Poles to American jazz before the war, Dana
took polkas to new audiences when he founded Dana Records in New
York in 1945. It became the top Polish music label, introducing
artists well known in the field like Frank Wojnarowski, Ray Henry,
Gene Wisniewski and Johnnie Bomba.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started what is known today as polka music, it's as simple
as that,'' said Jimmy Sturr, who has won a Grammy for polkas 10
times.
</P>
<P>
   Sturr said that Dana saw the market niche represented by Poles
and other Eastern Europeans nostalgic for Old World music. As a
recording executive, publisher, composer and performer, he helped
provide livelier fare for new and traditional audiences. He
accelerated the trend of adding trumpets and saxophones to polka
bands, turning what had been five-piece combos into small eight- or
nine-member orchestras. The accordion, of course, remained at
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big-band polka-style music,'' Sturr said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shibilski, who for 35 years has been the host of a Saturday
evening polka show on the public radio station of Fordham
University, WFUV-FM, said that Dana assembled a stable of the best
polka musicians, and then promoted them with flair. In particular
his cooperation with Cosmat Distributors, which handled popular
rock acts like the Cadillacs and the Orioles, paid rich dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Dana had the biggest sellers,''
Shibilski said. ``He was really responsible for national exposure
to the music from the late 1940s to the early 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana grew up in Warsaw, Poland, receiving a degree in music from
the University of Warsaw and then working as a press attache in the
Polish Foreign Office while continuing his musical studies at the
Warsaw Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   He began his professional career as a ``musical illustrator''
for the Quid Pro Quo theater in Warsaw. He changed his name to Dan
to avoid capitalizing on the name of his well-known father. Because
the Polish possessive is formed by adding an A, his name was
pronounced Dana by English-speaking audiences, and it stuck.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing his studies in Paris, Dana heard jazz, as
played by the Revelers and others. He returned to the Quid Pro Quo
to form a vocal jazz quintet. He was arranger and vocal coach to
four singers he recruited from the choir of the Cathedral of St.
John in Warsaw and he accompanied them on the piano and accordion.
The group, Chor Dana, was still on the bill when the Luftwaffe
bombed and destroyed the theater about 11 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Dana wrote the score for Poland's first talkie and for 14
subsequent films. Chor Dana toured Europe, and the impresario Sol
Hurok sent the group on two North American tours. Bound for the
first of those tours, the group played aboard the Ile de France,
along with the Mills Brothers, the Ballet Russe and others. Chor
Dana stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands the group played before Prince Bernhard and
Princess Juliana. In Germany the group members were treated as
stars. In Poland they gave a private concert for Marshal Jozef
Pilsudski, leader of the Polish revolution. Pilsudski was godfather
to Dana's only son, Gustave, who, like Dana's wife, Niusia
Nobisowna, a comedian, preceded him in death. There are no
immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 Dana became director of light music for the Federal
Radio Network and director of the Tip-Top Theater in Warsaw. He had
complete charge of popular music on the radio and increasingly
played American fare like ``Rhapsody in Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazi armies rolled into Poland and bombs began to fall
in September 1939, Dana and his family escaped to Romania and then
to Italy. They fled Mussolini's Italy, going to Detroit, where they
worked in Polish-language radio.
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended in 1945, Dana moved to New York and was
accepted in the musicians union, the American Federation of
Musicians. He recorded for RCA Victor and Harmonia and then founded
Dana Records, which he sold some years ago to Fiesta Records. He
wrote many of the hits recorded by Dana artists, including ``Who
Stole the Kishka?'' His hit song ``Longing for You'' was recorded
by Vic Damone and Sammy Kaye, among others.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from recording he turned his attention to
classical composition. He wrote ``Florida Sketches,'' a symphonic
suite given its premiere by the Miami Beach Symphony in 1970. He is
a member of the Polka Hall of Fame.

DICKSON OPTIMISTIC, DESPITE BEING ROCKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Starting pitcher Jason Dickson took a one-hopper
off his left forearm, had a bat thrown at him and gave up seven
runs in 11/3 innings, but one wouldn't have known it talking to the
right-hander afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson remains optimistic because: A) the ball off his forearm
caused only a minor bruise; B) he was able to dodge the bat that
slipped out of a hitter's hands; and C) four of the seven runs he
allowed were unearned runs, a result of three errors behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson is coming back from shoulder surgery and says he feels
fine physically. His problem has been with the command of his
pitches, but he said Sunday after the Anaheim Angels' 18-9 loss to
the Mariners he was able to hit his spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here and the last time out against Oakland I was far from
perfect but I can see where it's getting back to where I want it to
be,'' Dickson said. ``I'm unhappy with the results but I'm happy
with the quality of the stuff I had today.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson is competing for a spot in the starting rotation, but in
two games is 0-2 with a 12.46 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was my first big league season you could be really
worried because you look at the numbers and say I'm not doing
well,'' Dickson said. ``But I've thrown the ball good enough to get
myself through a big league game. When you know your stuff, you
know if things are going to be fine, and that the numbers at this
point in the season don't mean that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, he had better command today and threw a lot of balls
down in the zone,'' Scioscia said. ``It was a step in the right
direction. And we gave him six outs in that first inning (because
of the errors). I think he threw a lot better than what's going to
show up in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds, Mo Vaughn, Garret Anderson and Gary DiSarcina did
not make the 40-minute trip to Peoria, instead working out at the
club's complex in Tempe. In doing so, they missed a bad display of
defense put on by the Angels, and it wasn't just the four errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' Scioscia said. ``Some plays weren't made,
they didn't throw to the right bases and those errors in the first
inning gave them extra outs. Some of it you can chalk up to spring
training, but part of it you shouldn't see at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Angels were fine, getting 13 hits. Tim Salmon
had three hits, including his team-leading third home run of the
spring, and Benji Gil, a leading candidate to win a job as a
utility player, also homered. Scott Spiezio and Larry Barnes had
two hits apiece.

FLOURISHES

 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)

 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Gary Ahlert, an agent for toy inventors, was
in a financial hole. He had lost $400,000 on a plan to market a
material to cover artificial limbs. So in 1998, when a potentially
lucrative mining deal came up, the pitch, from an apparently
credible businessman, seemed worth listening to: invest in an
Arizona mine filled with ore that could be used to make cellular
telephone batteries.
</P>
<P>
   To get a stake, Ahlert called a Georgia company whose newspaper
advertisements offered ``Hard Money. Financing available. $250K and
Up.'' Ahlert sent the company a $5,000 processing fee for a $3
million capital investment loan, and he and a partner invested
about $200,000 of their own money in the mining project.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the offer of a loan was fraudulent, the
mining project was a scam and Ahlert and his partner were out about
$300,000, all the poorer for having proved a law enforcement adage
that a booming economy breeds white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, while violent crime has plummeted nationwide,
white-collar crime, against individuals and small businesses, has
skyrocketed, fueled by the economy and made easier by the Internet,
law enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a lot of money around, they are going to go
after the money,'' said Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney. ``So, when you look back and you have high activity in
the market, and we have never seen anything like this, you are
going to have a lot of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generalization is that the honey attracts the bears.''
</P>
<P>
   That has created a difficult situation for a criminal justice
system designed to deal, primarily, with street criminals, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   For Ahlert and others like him, the situation adds insult to
injury.
</P>
<P>
   And because it is so hard to track down this kind of scam
artist, prove the case and recover the money, prosecutors and the
police are sometimes reluctant to try, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to securities regulators, law enforcement agencies and
the National White Collar Crime Center, which studies the
phenomenon, white-collar crime has risen 10 percent to 20 percent
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   And the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, which deals
with investment fraud, reported a 20 percent jump in the number of
complaints from 1995 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the Internet had complicated the
situation for them by making it easier for swindlers to quickly
steal money and disappear into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne A. Hunt, the chief of the financial crimes section for the
FBI, said in an interview that the bureau was investigating more
than 26,000 white-collar cases, using more than 2,400 agents. In a
decade, bureau officials said, the FBI has more than doubled the
number of agents and resources dedicated to white-collar cases.
</P>
<P>
   But, law enforcement officials acknowledged, that is still not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of new technology has really affected us
tremendously,'' Hunt said. ``Traditional white-collar criminals are
now utilizing the Internet to do the same types of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Leighton, a sociologist and professor of criminology at
Eastern Michigan University, said it was a difficult transition for
law enforcement to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep this image of the street criminal and the idea
of the threat coming from the poor, but we have long had all this
white-collar crime, which is much more likely to affect the average
American,'' Leighton said.

</P>
<P>
   Ahlert and his partner spent about $220,000 on the mining and
the loan schemes. And, having devoted about another $80,000 to
lawyers and investigators in an effort to recover his losses, he
has lost his business, is considering filing for bankruptcy and is
about to close his office on Main Street here. He and his partner
do not even know if they can afford to hire a bankruptcy lawyer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking about the case is law enforcement's lack
of action.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlert said he had appealed for help from New York to El Paso,
Texas, and had compiled thick files of evidence. In one letter, the
men running the mining project claimed to own more than 700,000
tons of ore in Arizona, ore that really belonged to the Department
of Defense. One Texas police agency considered pressing charges
against one of the men in the mining project, but the El Paso
County district attorney's office dropped the charges because
prosecutors believed they could not make the case, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that a case like Ahlert's was
difficult to investigate because white-collar criminals tended to
be good at hiding their assets, and generally it was not
cost-effective for prosecutors unless they could amass a long list
of victims who had been defrauded of much more than Ahlert and his
partner could reclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in Texas, Georgia and New York who
have looked at Ahlert's case said that it appeared he had amassed
evidence of fraud, but that it was very unlikely the case would
ever go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that investigating even the simplest
white-collar crime case could take years and often involved sorting
through thousands of pages of documents. Furthermore, jurors often
have a hard time understanding white-collar crime or feeling
sympathy for the victims, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Given those realities, the officials said, prosecutors are
reluctant to proceed with small cases or those that involve few
victims. Arrests for white-collar crime, which peaked in 1995,
suggest that after making a strong push to address the growing
number of people being victimized by white-collar crime, the
authorities pulled back and began focusing on bigger cases, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been told by prosecutors that our case was not sexy
enough,'' Ahlert said. He later added, ``We are just two little
guys who can't do anything for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in white-collar crime is felt most acutely in
financial centers, like the New York region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What everyone is worried about is that if the market corrects
downward we are going to be swamped with complaints,'' said Eric
Dinallo, a former Manhattan prosecutor who is now chief of the New
York state attorney general's investor fraud and securities bureau.
``Because people will not even know that they are being scammed
until they take their money out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lambiase, the director of the securities division at the
Connecticut Banking Department, said more street criminals were
moving into the world of white-collar crime because they could get
away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mug someone in Connecticut I could get you arrested
today,'' he said. ``But if you do white-collar stuff, there are so
many ways to hide and shield yourself, and it is much tougher to
convict you in front of a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambiase said that experienced people like Ahlert were
increasingly being defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlert was hardly new to the workings of the business world. One
of the authors of a book called ``Selling Your Idea or Invention''
(Carol Publishing, 1994), which included a chapter on how to avoid
scams, he had worked with Hasbro, Mattel and other major toy
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlert saw the advertisement for the loan in The New York Times
classified section in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton, the sociologist, said that people like Ahlert were
easy targets in good economic times because ``people feel more
comfortable about spending on things that sound risky.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ahlert said his experience had left him far from
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned my life upside down,'' he said as he smoked
cigarette after cigarette in the conference room of his office last
month.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was living on money borrowed from friends and his
daughter, Noel, 33, a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed,'' he said.  &QR;

LAKERS HEAD EAST FOR IMPORTANT TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's too early to say the Los Angeles Lakers have
reached the stretch run of the season, but they are entering their
last uphill leg today as they begin an eight-day, five-game road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's the last extended trip of the season and their last through
the East, concluding with back-to-back games against two of that
conference's powers, New York and Miami, next Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The trip starts in Denver tonight, followed by back-to-back
games at Washington and Detroit on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson has pointed to previous road trips as
barometers, but attached no grand significance this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're out so far, the chimney sweep is coming, and the
guy that does the roofing is coming in and the cleaners are there,
etc.,'' Jackson said wryly, ``so I'm looking forward to a clean
house when I get back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, it has no more significance than when we play
New York and Miami back-to-back at the end of this thing....
Hopefully, we can surmount the Detroit, Washington games, which
will be tough enough as it is, back-to-back, to go in and have the
energy to play New York and Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the weaker opponents should present a challenge as the
Lakers try to extend a nine-game road winning streak. All but the
Wizards have impressive records at home: Denver 20-12, Washington
13-19, Detroit 22-10, New York 25-7 and Miami 23-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the Lakers would fly home from Denver tonight, then
leave for D.C. on Wednesday, but Jackson said the quick turnaround
and long flight East would make it impossible to hold practices in
L.A. (they'll practice twice in Denver instead).

   But Jackson, who once took his Chicago Bulls to the Statue of
Liberty for some team-building, also considered taking the Lakers
on a field trip in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had the scheduling to do all over again,'' he said,
``but I couldn't get the plane to reroute and get us on to
Washington, because we could have done something in Washington....
I was going to play that by ear, but that went by the wayside about
two weeks ago, when it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   By George: Jackson indicated he wants to give little-used rookie
swingman Devean George a longer look over the last month and a half
of the season, figuring he might provide an added dimension in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great 3-point shooting threat and is going to get, I
think, some major time down the stretch before the playoffs start,
so he can get ready to play more minutes,'' Jackson said. ``I'm
looing for time that's important time, not just time that's at the
end of the game.... I definitely think he's got a chance to help
us. I like to have shooters in at the end of quarters.''

   MALIBU, Calif. _ Some of the Pepperdine players passed time
Sunday afternoon playing dominoes on a patio overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. Others nervously munched on food inside the home of
Dr. Andy Benton, the school's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves were at Benton's home to watch the NCAA Tournament
selection show and finally learn whether they were one of the 35
teams earning at-large berths.
</P>
<P>
   They kept saying they were confident they belonged in the field
of 64, that the selection committee felt the same way. But until
they knew for sure, well, these were anxious moments.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Waves' long wait - it began last Monday after a
69-65 loss to Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference final - came to
a swift, happy conclusion when they learned they were an 11th seed
in the East Region, the first region announced. Pepperdine (24-8)
opens against sixth-seed Indiana in Buffalo, N.Y., on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The moment their name scrolled across the television screen, the
Waves erupted with joy, sharing high-fives, hugs and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The wait was over. Pepperdine was in. It was time to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough being on the bubble, you're never really
sure if you're going to get in or not,'' said Pepperdine guard
Craig Lewis. ``Anything can happen with the (selection) committee
while they're in the room trying to figure out who's in or not.
We're just happy we came up early, on the first bracket. That eased
a lot of stress that we had.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the stress was unwarranted. Pepperdine was on
solid ground after winning the regular-season WCC crown, then
advancing to the conference tournament final. Even though the Waves
lost in overtime, their strong nonconference schedule and wins
against Fresno State, Louisiana-Lafayette and Gonzaga were too
impressive to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember beating Frenso State the second game of the season
and telling the team this was an NCAA win,'' Pepperdine coach Jan
van Breda Kolff said. ``To go on the road and beat a team that's
had a good tradition like a Fresno State, in a hostile environment.
That's the type of game that's going to help us come tournament
time. We used that word (NCAA Tournament) the second game of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine was immediately back at work Sunday night, practicing
and preparing for Indiana, which finished fifth in the Big Ten,
then bowed out of the conference tournament in a 72-69 loss to
Illinois in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves don't seem too concerned with the Hoosiers' (20-8)
historic standing among the elite teams in the country. They look
forward to the challenge, but are not intimidated. Bob Knight, A.J.
Guyton and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team like we were before, just hoping to win,''
Tommie Prince said. ``We're one of the teams looking to win and put
the program back on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Tezale Archie agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter who we played,'' Archie said. ``We played
UCLA this year, stepped into Pauley Pavilion with all that
tradition. We went to Kansas. So we're past that stage of we're
just happy to be there.''
