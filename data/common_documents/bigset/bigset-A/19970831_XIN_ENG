<TEXT>
<P>
BAKU, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani President Geida Aliyev
today highly praised China's political and economic achievements
in recent years and expressed a strong wish to deepen economic and
trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev made the comments when meeting with Wang Bingqian, the
vice-chairman of the Sanding Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress (NPC), who earlier met the country's national
assembly speaker and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said that Azerbaijani always attaches great importance
to developing friendly ties with China, and the relations between
the two countries have been satisfactory over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have enjoyed traditionally good political
relations, he said, adding that there is huge potential for
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president also joined some senior Azerbaijani officials in
welcoming China to join in the oil exploitation in the Caspian Sea.

Congratulating on China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, he said he firmly believed that China
has the ability to resolve the Taiwan issue equally successfully.
</P>

Wang told his host that China wishes to continue the long-term
friendly cooperation with Azerbaijan in all fields, and thanked
Azerbaijani government for sticking to the one China policy on the
Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Delhi Hold Formal Talks on Teesta River Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India today held a
secretary-level formal talks of the Joint Rivers Commission (JRC)
in a bid to formulate a final proposal for an agreement on sharing
of water of the Teesta river, said official sources.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held at the Teesta Barrage rest house in the
northwestern Lalmonirhat district between Bangladeshi Water
Resources Secretary Shamsul Huda and his Indian counterpart Mata
Prasad.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, according to meeting sources, both sides
analyzed data of the river's water flow of last 50 years while
Bangladesh highlighted the issue of unilateral withdrawal of the
water by India in the lean season.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that an agreement is expected to be signed at the
33rd ministerial meeting of the JRC in New Delhi in November.
</P>
<P>
There are 54 common rivers between Bangladesh and its huge
neighbor India. Following a 30-year water sharing treaty on Ganges
river signed in December 1996, both sides agreed to put the Teesta
river issue on the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
There are two barrages in the river which comes from Sikim, one
at Gazaldoba in India and the other at Doani in Bangladesh, the
distance between them being only 60 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to international water sharing rules, Bangladesh and
India should get 33 percent of the total flow each. But in the
absence of any agreement, India is taking 85-90 percent of the
total flow in the lean period, Dhaka complained.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the unilateral withdrawal of the Teesta water by
Indian authorities, Bangladesh is getting only 10-15 percent
(3,000-4,000 cusec). The lowest flow recorded on January 13 this
year was only 2,700 cusec (cubic foot per second).
</P>
<P>
But the country's largest irrigation project, the Teesta
barrage, constructed at a cost of 10 billion taka (about 225
million U.S. dollars), and its 34-kilometre main distribution
canal need at least 8,000 cusec water in the lean season, said
officials from the Water Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
If Bangladesh gets its due share of Teesta water, additional
crops worth 4 billion taka (about 90 million dollars) will be
produced, the officials added.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Clan Clash Kills 9 in Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 30 (Xinhua)- Nine people were killed and
several others were wounded Friday afternoon after inter-clan
fighting erupted in the country.
</P>
<P>
The clash happened between two Habar Gidir sub-clans both
supporting South Mogadishu faction leader, Hussein Mohamed Aidid,
at Muri village, 40 kilometers South of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The fighting came after militiamen of Sa'ad sub-clan of Habar
Gidir attacked a cheek point at Muri village controlled by Eyr
sub-clan of the same clan.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, battle wagons, heavy machine guns
and assault rifles were used during the fighting between the two
subclans at the Muri village check point.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said the Sa'ad militiamen have overcome the
less prepared Eyr militiamen and consequently destroyed their
check point, adding that four victims belonging to other clans
living in the area were caught in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the area attributed the reason for fighting to
earlier killings between the two subclans men in and outside
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The conflict was motivated and planned by the Sa'ad militiamen
who were annoyed by the latest killing of one of their fellow
men, a Khat dealer, at the check point two days ago, the
eyewitness said.
</P>
<P>
The area has been quiet this morning as Khat traffic dealers
pass through the same village normally on their way to K-50
airstrip to receive the daily Khat import from neighboring Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Muri village check point is one of a dozen of illegal
check points stretched from Mogadishu to the port town of Merca
where both tax imposed by Hussein Aidid and extortion money are
collected from all kinds of traffic every day.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the two subclans met in South Mogadishu today
about the incident and tried to find ways of easing tension
between the two subclans.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time these two subclans have exchanged heavy
fire since the formation of Hussein Aidid's self-styled
government more than two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Excessive Taxes Hampering Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's prospects for
economic growth is being negatively affected by excessive taxes,
excess debt and over-dependency on commodity prices, economists
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants to a conference on university
education and entrepreneurial development in Harare, economist
John Robertson said Zimbabwe's strengths and weaknesses require
proper analysis to strengthen the economy.
</P>
<P>
"This country has the most educated population in Africa, well
structured economic infrastructure and a broadly based economy in
agriculture, manufacturing, mining and tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said personal and indirect taxes as a percentage of
earnings are now projected to be 58 percent during the current
year compared to 24 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Economic Society Kenias Mafukidze
said it is important to create a stable macro economic
environment and that this is only possible with low interest and
inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
Inflation and interest rates are currently pegged at 19.1
percent and 25 percent respectively, a situation he said is not
desirable for effective growth.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Casts Doubt on Dialogue Process with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan would remain hopeful
about the dialogue process with India while awaiting necessary
clarification over "mixed signals" from New Delhi, a foreign
office spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed "disbelief" over Indian Prime Minister
I. K. Gujral's reported statement that he would only meet U.S.
President Bill Clinton in New York next month if Pakistan-India
relations were left off the agenda of their meeting, the official
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also proposed to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif next month on the fringes of the U.N. general assembly.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has said it would welcome the U.S. mediation but India
rejects any involvement of a third country in fear of
"intervention".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "this Indian posture negates the 'Male
spirit'," referring to the meeting between Sharif and Gujral in
the capital of the Maldives in May.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian posture "raises further doubts about the
whole process of the dialogue and New Delhi's adherence to given
assurances and understandings reached prior to and during the last
round of foreign secretary-level talks."
</P>
<P>
During the second round of foreign-secretary-level talks held
here in June, Pakistan and India agreed to set up working groups
to solve their outstanding issues including the disputes over
Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to hold the next round of
foreign-secretary-level talks in New Delhi in September.
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility for promoting peace is global and no country
should deem itself to be outside the pale of present day's trend
of dialogue and constructive engagement," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"And if it chooses to do so it may not impose its will on the
rest of the world community," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign-secretary-level talks
in March after more than three years of suspension amid signs of
improved relations between the two arch rivals in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have fought three wars since their
independence in 1947, two of which were over Kashmir that remains
to be a core issue in their bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> PNA Demands Israel Redeployment in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today demanded Israel implement the second phase
of further redeployment in the West Bank ahead of the visit of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio reported senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat today sent messages to Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, urging
Israel to coordinate with the PNA in carrying out the second
stage of redeployment by the originally-set date of September 7.
</P>
<P>
Erekat made the demand despite the fact that the first phase
of redeployment has yet to be carried out due to the PNA's
refusal to accept the 9 percent of redeployment set unilaterally
by Israel. The PNA demanded Israel redeploy troops from at least
30 percent of the West Bank at the first stage.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached when both sides signed the Hebron
redeployment protocol in January, Israel should carry out the
first stage of redeployment by March 7, and the second stage by
September 7, and the last stage before mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Israel is only willing to relinquish about 40 percent of the
West Bank after completing the whole process of redeployment, but
the PNA hopes to regain over 80 percent of the land on which it
will establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The PNA is to send a high-level delegation to Washington in
advance of the much-expected first visit to the region by
Albright.
</P>
<P>
It was no coincidence that the PNA put up the demand to Israel
concerning further redeployment 10 days ahead of Albright's
visit. The PNA was apparently trying to create more pressure on
Israel by accusing it of failing to honor the signed peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to begin her Middle East tour on September 9,
which will take her to Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Syria
and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Top on her agenda is to try to revive the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process that has been deadlocked since Israel began
building the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian tension has been rising since Israel
imposed harsh sanctions against the Palestinians immediately
after the July 30 twin suicide bombings in Jerusalem's
Mahane Yehuda market, which killed 16 people and wounded 170
others.
</P>
<P>
These sanctions, including a total closure of the Palestinian
territories, barring Palestinian workers from entering Israel for
work and withholding of most of the tax revenues due to the PNA,
have inflicted huge loss on the weak Palestinian economy and
caused hardship to life of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Albright telephoned Friday both Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat to inform them
of her schedule of the September visit. During their phone
conversation, Arafat lodged a complain to Albright about
Israel's sanctions, hoping she will try to persuade Israel to
lift them.
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis
Ross also telephoned Arafat to discuss various ideas to overcome
the crisis between Israel and Palestine. Ross' four-day visit to
the region early this month paved the way for Albright's trip.

<HEADLINE> GCC Investment In Petrochemicals to Reach 33 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Capital investment in
petrochemical projects by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is
expected to reach 33 billion U.S. dollars by 2000, an economic
study reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The study issued by the Doha-based Gulf Organization for
Industrial Consulting (GOIC) said that at the end of 1995, there
were some 35 petrochemical manufacturing plants in Gulf states
with a total investment of over 19 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
New petrochemical projects worth 13.6 billion dollars are
currently under construction, or at an advanced study stage
in Gulf states, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The GOIC is funded by the GCC which groups Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states have developed an advanced petrochemical
industry to increase revenues through crude oil exports and
exploiting large reserves of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
At present, the region produces around 7 million tonnes of
basic petrochemicals like methanol, olefins and aromatics.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Opens First Sugar Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today
opened its first sugar refinery under a Saudi-British Offset
program.
</P>
<P>
The plant which was a joint venture between Saudi Arabia
and Britain was inaugurated by Saudi second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Defense Prince Sultan Bin Abdel Aziz
in Saudi western coast city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
The 160 million U.S. dollars joint venture has the
state-of-the-art technology and will have a maximum capacity of
515,000 tonnes of high-quality sugar annually, according to
reports from Jeddah by Kuwait News Agency. .
</P>
<P>
It will refine imported crude sugar from Australia, South
Africa and Thailand and cater to both the domestic and
export market.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia hopes the sugar refinery would be more than
enough to meet the requirements of the local consumption and
reduce imports of high-quality sugar. It also hopes to
increase its output by a further 100,000 tonnes annually by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Officials figures showed that the current sugar consumption
in Saudi stands at 500,000 tonnes a year.
</P>
<P>
The refinery is one of several projects which have been
successfully promoted and assisted by the Al-Yamamah Economic
Offset Program in Saudi Arabia. The program dates back to
1985 when the Saudi and British governments concluded an
agreement for the acquisition of Tornado, Hawk and PC-9
aircraft and specialized naval vessel.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1 billion pounds sterlings (about 1.71 billion
U.S. dollars) is expected to be invested under the program which
requires transfer of British technology to Saudi companies through
joint ventures and licensing agreements.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is one of some Gulf Arab countries that have been
implementing Offset programs under which foreign armaments
suppliers who obtain a contract worth a certain amount of money
from them must invest a certain percentage of the sales value in
the countries' industrial projects.

MESSINA, Sicily, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Luiz Eduardo Lima
made an unbelievable sprint in the men's 1,500 meters freestyle to
surpass all his opponents for the title.
</P>
<P>
The race was led all the way by American Nathaniel Lewis and
Italian Marco Formentini and it seemed the winner would be either of
the two swimmers.

<P>
The last 200 meters saw a close race between Formentini and Lewis
with the lead changing hands several times.
</P>
<P>
When the the two swimmers began their sprint in the last 30 meters,
they underestimated Lima's sprint ability and had to concede the
defeat.

Lima surpassed Formentini and Lewis in the last three meters. When
he saw he was the winner from the score board, he threw his fists into
the air.

<HEADLINE> "Seeing is Believing": Says GFA Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- "Seeing is Believing," said Antje
Vollmer, vice-president of the German Federal Assembly (GFA) after
visiting a prison in Tibet this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The management of this prison is scientific and rational, and
what she has seen here is different from what she has heard about,
Vollmer said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a small number of Western politicians spread their
fabrications about the management in Tibet's prisons out of their
own ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
US congressman Frank Wolf, who has never been to any Tibetan
prisons, went so far as to openly slander Tibet as "persecuting
and ill-treating" prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Autonomous Regional Prison of Tibet that Vollmer visited is
located in the north suburbs of Tibet, and is the largest prison
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Losang Garle, the warden of the prison, told Vollmer that the
prison was built in 1960, and locks up the largest number of
prisoners among the three prisons in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The more than 900 prisoners here are all criminals sentenced to
over ten years of imprisonment by the economic court. According to
the warden, the criminals in the prisons account for only 0.075
percent of Tibetan population.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Vollmer's question about the rights of the
criminals, the warden said that all criminals are treated equally
without any discrimination nor maltreatment.
</P>
<P>
Their legal rights of appealing and accusing are fully
protected, and the appealings lodged by criminals this year have
unexceptionally been heard in accordance with legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
When Vollmer learned that the tapestry with the design of the
Potala Palace hanging on the wall of the room is made by a
criminal himself, she immediately asked to visit the carpet
weaver.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the carpet mill where more than 100 prisoners
are weaving carpets, Vollmer asked one of them to compared this
place with the place he stayed during the preliminary hearing and
asked him which is better, the criminal, who was sentenced to 15
years of imprisonment because of murder, answered: "life here is
good." Seeing this robust man, Vollmer nodded her satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Vollmer visited cells, an activity center, the teaching
building and a visiting room, and learned about the prisoners'
study and life.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of prisoners from Lhasa are allowed 20-minute visits
each month, and those from remote agricultural or pastoral areas
may visit at any time they like. Besides, the prisoners and their
relatives are free to talk and no prison workers will be present,
prison sources said.
</P>
<P>
When leaving the prison, the warden said to Vollmer: "You are
welcome to visit here again." Vollmer replied: "I'll try to come
again as a guest, but I hope you'll not say so to those who have
completed their prison terms." Her words made all those present
laughing.

<HEADLINE> UN Sanction Exerts Tragic Effects on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The air ban on Libya imposed by
the U.N. had exerted tragic effects on all aspects of its life,
said Shaaban al Arabi Abdel Hafeez, Libyan ambassador to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The air ban had cost Libya heavy casualties, Abdel Hafeez made
the remarks in an interview published by Tunisian newspaper
Asherouq today.
</P>
<P>
Since the air ban came into effect in 1992, more than 15,000
Libyan patients have died, said the ambassador, because the
sanction blocks them from flying abroad to acquire treatment and
prevents Libya from importing enough medicine.
</P>
<P>
And the air ban has also caused the deaths of new-born babies
and lying-in women resulting from shortage of medicines, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. sanction had resulted in the shortage of car
spare parts in Libya causing the rise of traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an air embargo on Libya in
April 1992 to pressure it to abide by U.N. resolution 731 to
surrender two suspects involved in the bombing of a Pan AM
jetliner over Lockbie, Scotland in 1988.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Thieves shot and wounded a
senior u.s. security officer in Bujumbura, as he emerged from a
popular restaurant, a report from the Burundi capital said today.
</P>
<P>
Chip Cooper, a diplomatic security special agent with the
State Department and head of security at the U.S. embassy in
Bujumbura, was flown to Nairobi today, U. S. marine Sergeant
Carlos Gerren was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was shot in the neck at 10.25 p.m. local time Friday after
being approached by two men outside the Central Oasis restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Cooper "was shot in the neck last night. It didn't hit any of
his arteries. It didn't touch his spinal cord... a couple of
thieves were trying to take his money," Gerren said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 U.S. citizens live in Burundi, where an ethnic civil
war has killed at least 150,000 people since October 1993. Some
five marines usually protect the embassy, according to Gerren.
</P>
<P>
Washington scaled down its presence in Burundi after an army
coup last July which brought Major Pierre Buyoya to power.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 600 Congolese
refugees in Tanzania's Kigoma region will be repatriated on
Sunday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
UNHCR deputy representative in Tanzania, Lennart Kotsalainen

KAMPALA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
received a U.S. congressional delegation here today and briefed
its members on Uganda's economic development and democratic
progress.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also talked about investment and taxation
polices in Uganda as well as regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Museveni explained to the delegation that the major problem in
Africa is the uprising of middle class, which he said Uganda is
tackling by liberalizing the economy and implementing primary
education program.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa has a lot of natural resources but still
lacks entrepreneurship and sufficient infrastructure to have
these resources exploited.
</P>
<P>
The president earmarked the investments, trade, tourism and
soft loans for developing infrastructure as major areas through
which Uganda and U.S. can cooperate.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of economic cooperation because
modern economy cannot develop without a large market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S delegation includes seven members from the banking and
national services, commerce and international relations
committees of the U.S. congress.
</P>
<P>
They are all on a general familiarization tour of the region.
The delegation will also visit Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa and

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Visits South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir left here today for South Africa on an official visit
at the invitation of his South African counterpart Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Bashir is expected to hold talks with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni on bilateral relations under the auspices of Mandela
with the aim of normalizing the relations between Sudan and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda had severed relations with Sudan in 1995, accusing it
of interfering in the internal affairs of Uganda and supporting
elements opposed to the government.
</P>
<P>
These accusations were denied by the Sudanese government,
which in turn accused the Ugandan government of sheltering the
forces of John Garang, leader of the main rebel group in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The mediation attempts made earlier by Iran, Libya and Malawi
to normalize the relations between the two countries have all
failed.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, said that
in addition to his mediation between Sudan and Uganda, President
Mandela is trying to bring Bashir and Garang together with the
aim of putting an end to the Sudanese civil war which began in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Yet Garang has announced he will not attend the Pretoria
meeting and that he plans to continue fighting against the Bashir
regime.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria meeting will be attended by both the Sudanese and
Ugandan presidents as well as Zimbabwian President Robert Mugabe
and a representative of the Malaysian government.

MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Armenian President Levon
Ter-Petrosyan winded up today his official visit to Moscow and
left for Yerevan, Armenia's Capital, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day visit Ter-Petrosyan and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin signed a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and
Mutual Assistance between Russia and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
According to Ter-Petrosian, the treaty covers almost all
spheres of Armenian-Russian relationships and reflects all
intentions and prospects for the development of all-round
relations between the two states.
</P>
<P>
The realization of the Treaty will allow the two states to move
towards "allied relations," the Armenian president said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed an agreement to establish the closed
joint-stock company ArmRosgazprom, which as Ter-Petrosyan said,
will be of strategic importance for the development of power
engineering in the two countries and is hoped to open up new
opportunities for Russian gas supplies to the Middle East,
including Turkey and Iran, through Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents as well sign a "joint Russian-Armenian
Declaration" which emphasized the close interaction between the
two states in the field of foreign policy, including within the
framework of the United Nations and other international
organizations.
</P>

Both presidents expressed the readiness for deepened
interaction with the European Union. They confirmed the intention
of the two countries to carry out together with other states an
active work on the adaptation of the treaty on conventional armed
forces in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Support for Sovereignty Down in Quebec, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Support for sovereignty has
dropped in Canada's French-speaking province, according to the
latest new poll by Groupe Leger &AMP; Leger.
</P>
<P>
The poll put support for the No side at 54.6 percent if a
referendum were held now, compared with 45.4 for the Yes.
</P>
<P>
This marks the highest level of support for the federalist side
since well before the referendum of October, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was done for the Globe and Mail newspaper,
was taken in the past week, when Ottawa was pushing its hardline
approach in letter exchanges with the separatist Quebec
government.
</P>
<P>
The finding that the No side has achieved a clear edge over the
sovereignists reflects the fact that some Yes voters have switched
to say they are undecided, rather than a change from one side to
the other, according to Jean-Marc Leger, president of the polling
firm.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned against attributing the weakening of
sovereignist support to the federal government's active pursuit of
its so-called "Plan B", the hardline strategy on Quebec
separation.
</P>
<P>
The slide in the support for the Yes side is more a result of
dissatisfaction with the provincial separatist government and its
cuts in spending and services, Leger suggested.
</P>
<P>
Support for the Quebec government has fallen sharply over the
past two months. Of those questioned, 40.3 percent now say they
are very satisfied or satisfied with the government, down from
49.1 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of those who are dissatisfied has climbed to
54.9 percent from 47.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that federal Progressive Conservative Party
leader Jean Charest tops a survey of voter confidence in political
leaders, edging out Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
And both men ranked far ahead of Canada's Prime Minister Jean
Chretien.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted from August 21 to 27. A total of 1,007
people were questioned. It has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage
points, 19 times out of 20.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Calls for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos said today that peace is the most important factor for the
realization of stability and development in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here when addressing the closing ceremony
of a seminar on science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos reiterated that the Angolan government is always
open to dialogue and has been doing its best to resolve the past
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) had not responded completely to
the call for peace in Angola, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the UNITA leadership has unjustifiably delayed
in implementing its military and political tasks under the Lusaka
peace agreement signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that President Dos Santos has made a
speech in public since the United Nations Security Council
adopted a resolution of imposing sanctions on UNITA on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Arab States Urged to Deepen Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab states need to further
restructure their economies through reforms to tackle unemployment
and improve living standards after years of stagnation, said the
Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) today.
</P>
<P>
The 22 countries of the Arab League have achieved some success
in the reforms of some sectors, but they are generally lagging
behind the aspired levels, AMF said in its latest report on
regional economies.
</P>
<P>
This should prompt them to push ahead with the efforts to
deepen their economic reforms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi-based financial institution held that high foreign
debts and low economic growth as the main problems facing the Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
It said foreign debts of Arab states increased in the past
years to an estimated total of 150 billion dollars by the end of
1996, excluding huge military debts due to the purchase of
advanced weapons each year.
</P>
<P>
AMF said the economies of Arab states are suffering from a low
growth rate which is outstriped by that of the population.
</P>
<P>
This has made unemployment a popular problem, especially in
Egypt and Gulf states. Latest international statistics shows Egypt
is facing an explosion of population which has reached more than
60 million, three times of that 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the Gulf, the unemployment rate of the United Arab Emirates
stands at more than 14 percent, which is expected to reach nearly
25 percent by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increase of the population, the per capita
income of the Arab world has remained almost unchanged, AMF said.
</P>
<P>
The leading financial institution of the Arab League reiterated
that the Arab economies have several other weaknesses, including
limited productive bases, lack of diversification in exports,
making them vulnerable to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
AMF, involved in reform in the region, said lack of
diversification in exports is the biggest problem of the Arab
world. In the six Gulf countries, the economies are seriously
reliant on oil exports.
</P>
<P>
AMF criticized Arab states for failing to attract enough
investment and imposing restrictions on private sectors.

<HEADLINE> King Sihanouk Urges Talks Between Ranariddh, Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk today urged Second Prime Minister Hun Sen to hold talks
with ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
expressed the wish to play a role of a mediator.
</P>
<P>
"You should agree to meet each other and if you meet, I should
help to be a mediator," Sihanouk made the appeal at his villa in
the centre of the northwestern town of Siem Reap while meeting
with civilian representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Ihave an obligation to help the nation achieve national unity,
peace, stability and independence," the king said.
</P>
<P>
The king also repeated the appeal to the conflicting parties of
Cambodia to stop fighting immediately and solve their dispute in a
non-violent way.
</P>
<P>
The king flew to Siem Reap, home to the ancient Angkor Wat
temple complex, Friday from Beijing, where he had received medical
treatment since February.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the general elections due to be held in May next
year, the king said he hoped the elections would be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh and Hun Sen formed a coalition government in 1993
after U.N.-monitored general elections which ended years of
fighting in the country.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two rivals escalated this year in
preparing for next year's general elections and climaxed in early
July when their respective troops broke into armed conflict in the
capital, resulting in the prince's escape from the country.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been going on in the town of O'Smach on the
country's border with Thailand.

BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard Abraham Olano today
proved his endurance and speed in relatively hot weather condition

</P>
<P>
Olano clocked one hour nine minutes and two seconds from two

<HEADLINE> Moussa Meets US Ambassador on Albright's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa discussed today with the U.S. Ambassador here Edward Walker
the upcoming Mideast tour by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said to the press after the meeting that
Egypt would be "the third or fourth stop" of Albright's multi-leg
tour in the region, which is reportedly to begin September 9.
</P>
<P>
The maiden trip to the region by Albright would also take her
to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule territories, Syria, Jordan
and possibly Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Walker said further withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West
Bank, among other issues, would be discussed during Albright's
visit. Israel declared on Saturday that it will not execute the
second stage of the Oslo accords related to its redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Albright, in an attempt to revive the stalled peace talks, was
reported to bring with her major U.S. initiatives on the final
status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, further Israeli
redeployment and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in January, Albright has avoided touring
the region, apparently fearing she could achieve little as
relations between Israel and the Palestinians have gone from bad
to worse.
</P>
<P>
But following a suicide bombing attack in Jerusalem last month,
she was strongly considering a trip, her aides said.
</P>
<P>
Before landing her feet in the region, Albright has recommended
that the incumbent U.S. ambassador to Egypt be appointed as
Washington's envoy to Israel, local newspaper Al Ahram reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Walker would succeed Martin Indyk, who is awaiting Senate
confirmation of his appointment as assistant secretary of state
for Near East affairs, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Intensifies Educational Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has stepped up its
educational reform this year by reducing school staff, improving
teaching facilities, establishing overseas students foundations
and changing test form, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
In a move to speed up its educational reform in line with the
country's transition to market economy, Mongolia has introduced
nationwide a shift to a self-paid college education from a free
one.
</P>
<P>
Every student at a public university will pay 240,000 tugriks
(300 U.S. dollars) a year and poor students will get financial
supports. In turn, college graduates will have their own choice
for jobs rather than be assigned to a job by the state.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia launched a five-year education program at the
beginning of this year to transform its current eight to ten-year
elementary and secondary education system into a 12-year mandatory
educational system as is done in the international practice.
</P>
<P>
The reform, supported by a 16.5-million-dollar soft loan of the
Asian Development Bank, will merge some primary and secondary
schools, cutting faculty and updating teaching equipment.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia set up a foundation of 1.5 billion tugriks (1.9
million dollars) to support a program of sending students overseas
to learn high technology. More than 300 Mongolian students have
been sent to China, Japan, German, the United States and Britain
since early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia initiated national middle school graduation exams this
year and increased the share of multiple-choice questions in the
exams, which is common in the internation practice.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Mongolia has taken measures to encourage the
establishment of private schools to lift the burden of the state.
Private college students account for more than a fifth of the
country's college students.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has given priority to the development of education by
alloting 20 percent of the state budgetary receipts to education.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, Nepal Transit Route to be Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The transit between Bangladesh and
the land-locked Nepal will be opened tomorrow to benefit both
sides in terms of reducing transport cost of Kathmandhu's external
trade and earning revenues for Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Commerce Minister Tofael Ahmed today told the
parliament that the transit route, from the southern port Mongla
to the northern tip Banglabandh, will facilitate Nepal for its
suborn trade from September 1.
</P>
<P>
It is informed that Nepal will transit over one million metric
tones of cargo every year through Mongla port.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese Commerce Minister Surabendra Nath Shukla, now visiting
Bangladesh, was present in the parliament to witness the session.
</P>
<P>
Tofael Ahmed and his Nepalese counterpart will attend the
opening ceremony at Banglabandh border. An Indian minister will
also join the function, according to Tofael Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Describing the opening of the transit as an historic event, the
Commerce Minister said it would bring in the implementation of the
Nepal-Bangla Trade Pact, which was never implemented during the
past 21 years since it was signed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh and Nepal will be benefited by the launching of
transit between the two countries," he told the parliament, saying
Nepal would save transportation cost for at least 700 kilometers
by carrying their goods from Mongla port to Kathmandhu.
</P>
<P>
Goods to be imported by Nepal will be transported from the
Mongla Port to the Banglabandh point. Later, those will be routed
through Indian territory to Kakarvita in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"This will usher in a new era of economic cooperation between
the two neighboring countries," said Commerce Minister Tofael
Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
India recently agreed to allow transit for Nepalese goods to be
imported through Bangladesh which will help give effect of the
transit treaty, he added.
</P>
<P>
Usually, Nepal imports commodities through the Calcutta port of
India. But it was learnt that Kathmandu is willing to use Mongla
port as it would cut import costs and also reduce shipment time
for the exports of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's transport sector will also be benefited while port
activities enhanced by the transit to Nepal. Exports from
Bangladesh to Nepal will also go up, Tofael Ahmed pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, it is Bangladesh who will ultimately be
benefited," said Tofail, adding that the infrastructures to be
needed for the transit trade facility would be there as soon as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Using Foreign Funds To Protect Southwest China Forest Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Since 1990, foreign governments
and international finance organizations have provided China's
Yunnan province with 450 million yuan in funds to protect forest
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has become the largest user in China of overseas funds
for forest protection, according to Chen Heping, a project
official with the Provincial Forestry Bureau, who explains that
this is because of increasing calls for environmental protection
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is rich in rare tropical forests, but this beautiful
plant kingdom suffered from serious deforestation in the past
several decades as local people used the forests for farmland.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the World Bank offered over 150 million yuan in loans
to help afforestation, and local governments also raised more than
50 million yuan and planted over 60,000 ha of fast-growing trees
in eleven counties.
</P>
<P>
With another 87 million yuan in World Bank loans and 58 million
yuan raised by local government, Yunnan has been able to finish
the first-phase of a development and protection program for forest
resources, and the second and third phases have been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Yunnan has also used funds from the German,
Dutch, and New Zealand governments and from international
financial bodies to protect forests in nature reserves.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Urged to Rely Wholely on Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The President of the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Wei Jianxing, told a
national trade union conference recently that trade unions should
play a major role in implementing the Chinese Communist Party's
principle of relying entirely on workers.
</P>
<P>
In discussing how to run enterprises better with the help of
workers, Wei said that trade unions should back that principle
politically and systematically and should improve worker's quality
and protect their rights.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions should help enterprises build up good leadership
to promote reforms and development with the support of employees,
he said, and should explore new democratic management methods and
ways to supervise the managers and protect the workers' rights in
accordance with the Labor Law.
</P>
<P>
Both boards of directors and supervisors should work with
democratically-elected representatives of trade unions, he said,
and enterprises should support trade unions in accordance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions should urge enterprises to arouse the employees'
enthusiasm and to make full use of their ability, he stressed,
adding that they should also make an effort to improve employees'
ethics, education, and skill. Trade unions should pay special
attention to the workers' problems and help solve them, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Awards were given to ten party and government officials and
science and technology workers at the conference for outstanding
work in running enterprises well with the help of employees.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government is committed to promoting
fishery development and fishery resources protection, a
spokeswoman for the local Agriculture and Fisheries Department
said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that, in addition to providing various
services to local fishermen, the government has been putting in
new resources to increase and protect local fishery resources in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"We've entrusted advisory companies to study fishery resources
and fishery production in Hong Kong waters, so that we can work
out long-term strategies for fishery resources management and
protection," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the department has initiated an artificial reef
deploying plan of 100 million HK dollars (12.82 million
U.S. dollars), in a bid to improve marine environment and increase
 local fishery resources. Meanwhile, the government is also
considering the feasibility of developing deep-sea fishing.
</P>
<P>
Last year Hong Kong's marine capture and cultured fishery
production reached 192,000 tons, with a wholesale value of 2.4
billion HK dollars (307.69 million U.S. dollars), accounting for
approximately two thirds of local fishery consumption.
</P>
<P>
She said that Hong Kong's return to the motherland provides a
more beneficial environment for the development of Hong Kong's
fisheries to continue into the 21st century.

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) and Chinese society have been urged to make vigorous
efforts to publicize the patriotic united front.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued jointly, the CPC Central Committee's
United Front Work Department, Propaganda Department, and Office of
Overseas Publicity say the patriotic united front has been a
powerful weapon of the Party during different revolutionary and
construction periods and that it entered "a new historical
development period" after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th
CPC Central Committee in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Committee asked everyone to make publicity of the
united front a part of the agenda. "In united front publicity, the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics must be held high...and all news media and
publishers must be used," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Major media at the center and the local level should use
publicity about the united front as part of their annual plan, and
should run special editions, columns, and programs on the united
front.
</P>
<P>
Periodicals of united front departments at all levels are Party
publications guiding united front work and controls of united
front publicity must be tightened.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian Mick Doohan continued
his domination of the 1997 season when he claimed the title of the
500cc race at the Czech Grand Prix in Brno, Czech Republic on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, who has already sealed his fourth straight world title,
won for the 11th time in 12 races as he equalled the season record
set by Italian Giacomo Agostini in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, who crossed the finish line on one wheel, ended up
almost 15 seconds in front of Italy's Luca Cadalora after 22 laps
of the 5.399km circuit. Cadalora was second on a Yamaha with
Japan's Nobuatsu Aoki on a Honda third.
</P>
<P>
Doohan was duelling with Japan's Tadayuki Okada at the start of
the final lap when Okada tumbled to the ground in a high-speed
crash as he sought the first 500cc victory of his career. He was
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, 32, ranks alongside Mike Hailwood and Agostini as the
only riders in 500cc history to win four consecutive world titles.
</P>
<P>
Doohan now has 295 out of a possible 300 points this season, in
which three races remain. He scored the 45th Grand Prix win of
his career -- all on Hondas.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Alex Criville, Doohan's teammate, made a successful
return to action after being sidelined since June with severe hand
injuries he suffered in practice for the Dutch Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Criville, winner at Brno last year, finished fourth in his
comeback race.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Max Biaggi, riding a Honda, won the 250cc race ahead of
France's Olivier Jacques (Honda) and Japan's Tetsuya Harada
(Aprilia).
</P>
<P>
Biaggi closed to within 11 points of championship leader Harada.
</P>
<P>
Italian teenage sensation Valentino Rossi, riding an Aprilia,

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China's State Flood Control and
Drought-Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Water Resources
today called on provincial and municipal level departments and
Yangtze and Yellow River control departments to implement
anti-drought measures for a good autumn harvest and planting.
</P>
<P>
This summer, large areas north of the Yangtze River have been
hit by the worst droughts since the 1970s, affecting 23 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Continued high temperatures and little precipitation have
extended and intensified the drought, which poses a severe threat
to China's autumn harvest and to the total grain output this year.
</P>
<P>
The two offices issued a circular urging authorities to
recognize the importance of doing a good drought relief-work job
and to be prepared for a long period of difficulties. They
emphasized efficiency in the drought-relief work, and different
kinds of irrigation for different crops.
</P>
<P>
New water sources should be developed and the price of water
adjusted. Different regulations should be developed for different
water use, said the circular.
</P>
<P>
All government departments of water resources, agriculture,
finance, power, and weather forecasting should co-ordinate
drought-relief efforts, and extensive water conservation projects
should be built, the circular emphasized.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Third Generation CPC Leadership (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The fact that China is in the
midst of its best period in history indicates that the third
generation of the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s collective
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core has established firm and
strong leadership over the Party and country.
</P>
<P>
The view is widely shared by Beijing political observers,
analysts and leading theorists on the eve of the 15th National
Congress of the CPC scheduled to open on September 12.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chungui, vice president of the Party School of the CPC
Central Committee, noted that over the past five years, China's
economic strength has improved substantially along with the
gradual establishment of a socialist market economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The general pattern for the country's opening to the outside
world is taking shape, he said, adding that China will certainly
maintain its current stable situation and will continue to enjoy
long-term economic growth, social stability and unity among people
of various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best period the People's Republic has witnessed
since its founding in 1949," said Pang Xianzhi, a leading CPC
theorist who worked 17 years as secretary for the late Chairman
Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
James Sasser, US Ambassador to China, commented to a Newsweek
reporter's questions concerning China's third generation leaders
by saying: "Frankly, I thought that after the demise of Deng
(Xiaoping) we would see a little trepidation on the part of the
leadership, but I see just the contrary."
</P>
<P>
Sasser's aforementioned "thought" was highly representative of
the thinking of many Western political observers and analysts in
February of this year when senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,
reputed as the "chief architect of China's reforms and
opening-up", passed away in Beijing.

<P>
As a matter of fact, China's reform and opening-up drive
entered a crucial period following Deng's death, with a number of
deep-rooted contradictions surfacing.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the many difficulties it encounters, China has
achieved stability and an annual economic growth rate of around 10
percent for the past six months, with the inflation rate falling
to less than two percent in the first half of this year, the
lowest level since the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"These factors have fully displayed the ability of China's
collective leadership to exercise effective control over the
overall situation," according to a Beijing political scientist.
</P>
<P>
One Western scholar noted in an article published on the
British-based newspaper Guardian that the prestige China's third
generation leaders enjoy is what one would expect for leaders of a
country which has recorded around 10 percent annual economic
growth over the past decade and more.
</P>
<P>
Hu Angang, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said China's economic growth cycle is usually marked by
the convocation of a CPC national congress.
</P>
<P>
Hu said: "In the past, the economy was often at a low ebb on
the eve of a national Party congress. The congress was usually
followed by a period of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
"However, things are quite different this time. The country's
economic situation is good before the covening of the 15th Party
congress."

Chinese economists spoke highly of the speech Jiang Zemin
delivered at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee on May
29 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The speech has not only made a major breakthrough in the
economic theory, but has also inherited the essence of a series of
keynote speeches Deng Xiaoping made during his inspection of south
China in early 1992," said one Beijing economist. "Jiang has
further developed Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Annual sessions of the National People's Congress, the
country's legislature, and the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top advisory
body, were held earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The sessions, the first major political events in China
following Deng's death, drew wide-spread attention from overseas
media and political circles.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming 15th CPC National Congress, during which
China's third generation leaders will decide the orientation and
line of the country's development in the final years of this
century, as well as in the 21st century, will undoubtedly attract
even greater worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Juding from a series of articles published in China's official
media, people are expecting that the 15th Party congress will add
impetus to the reform of economic and political restructures, and
that the reform of state-owned enterprises will be the focus of
economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts note that the congress' ability to provide
solutions to some most pressing problems China currently
encounters in reforms and opening-up will enable the world's most
populous country to continue maintaining prosperity and stability
over the next 10 to 15 years.

conditions. They are, in fact, what the previous two generations
of Chinese leadership intended to accomplish, but failed to do
so," said Hu. "The third generation's success reflects the
administrative competence of the current Chinese government."
</P>
<P>
Hu said the introduction of a new tax system has brought more
revenues to state coffers and has helped enhance the central
government's macro-control capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that successful macro-economic control by the
central authorities enabled China's once-overheated economy to
achieve a "soft landing" for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The central leadership has paid close attention to the
widening gap between the country's different regions, and has
adjusted its policies to ensure common prosperity for people
across the country, according to the young economist.
</P>
<P>
"When compared with their predecessors, the new generation of
Chinese leaders is more pragmatic and set great store by the study
of the country's national conditions," said Hu. "This has enabled
them to make decisions which are more in line with reality in
China."
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the past three years show that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
Premier Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of
economic affairs, have completed 41, 40 and 37 domestic
fact-finding tours respectively, in order to gain first-hand
information on various parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Third Generation CPC Leadership (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political observers here also share appreciation for the
ability the CPC's third generation leaders have exhibited in
handling international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sasser offered the following comment about China's resumption
of sovereignty over Hong Kong two months ago: "I find (the
Chinese) leaders more self-confident. More assertive!" He also
praised Jiang for having recorded what he called a "remarkable
year".
</P>
<P>
The smooth return of Hong Kong, a great diplomatic triumph for
China, also demonstrated the outstanding ability of China's third
generation collective leadership to properly handle the
international situation and deal with foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, Premier Li and other senior Chinese leaders
have exchanged visits with heads of state from more than 100
countries over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges have greatly promoted friendly relations between
China and the rest of the world, and have created a fine global
environment for China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
However, China's third generation leadership faces both
opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment, the low efficiency of the national economy as a
whole and corruption are posing the most serious challenges to
third generation leaders," said one political analyst.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the third generation leadership enjoys
its own advantages compared with the previous two generations of
the Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The first generation (of leaders) represented by Chairman Mao
established its authority through tumultuous revolution which
brought national independence and liberation to China," said the
analyst.
</P>
<P>
He added that the second generation of Chinese leaders
represented by Deng Xiaoping established authority by initiating
the reform and opening-up policy and creating a new historical
situation in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the third generation leaders by noting they have
consolidated their leadership over the country in the process of
establishing a socialist market economic structure and promoting
political restructuring to meet the needs of the new market
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Pang commented: "It's apparent to me that the third generation
of China's collective leadership has lived up to the expectations
of the Chinese people."

<HEADLINE> Syria Says US Role in Mideast Peace Ebbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Syria's
ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party (BASP) today said that the
U.S. role in the Mideast peace process is ebbing, and urged for
more active European Union involvement in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Al-Ahmer, BASP assistant secretary general, said the
U.S. role has been "remarkably and seriously" receding recently.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a speech at the opening of the fifth
extraordinary congress of the Federation of Arab-American
Institutions in Damascus today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the decreasing U.S. role coincided with
intensified Israeli aggressiveness, which he said encouraged
Israel to persist in its "aggressive policies and practices."
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmer praised the EU function in the Middle East peace
process, saying there was a positive development in the EU
attitude towards the region.
</P>
<P>
Syria welcomes an EU role to save the Middle East peace process
and calls on the EU to play a still more active role in this
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmer voiced his country's opposition to the fourth Middle
East and North Africa Economic Summit due to be held in the Qatari
capital Doha in November, because it will be attended by Israel.
</P>
<P>
This summit, if ever convened, will be a serious violation of
the unity of Arab stand and an encouragement for Israel to kill
the peace process, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan President Arrives in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 31 (Xinhua) -- President of Kazakhstan
Nursultan Nazarbayev arrived in Kuwait today on a two-day official
visit to this Gulf country, during which several economic
agreements are expected to be signed.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev, accompanied by a high-powered political and
economic delegation including Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart
Tokayev, was welcomed at the Kuwait International Airport by
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev would hold talks with Kuwaiti leaders on boosting
bilateral relations in politics, economy, trade and investment
during his stay here, said a Kuwaiti official.
</P>
<P>
The agreements to be signed between the two countries would
cover economy, trade, investment and avoiding double taxation, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev is expected to call on the Kuwaiti businessmen to
invest in Kazakhstan to benefit from the preferential policies
offered to foreign investors in Kazakhstan, including a five-year
tax holiday and a 10-year profit taxes exemption period.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Kazakhstan have been developing
since the former Soviet Union republic became independent in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1992, Kuwaiti deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Nasser Abdullah Al-Rudhan visited Kazakhstan and signed a
Memorandum of Understanding under which Kuwait would support
Kazakhstan with expertise in the field of oil exploration while
Kazakhstan would supply Kuwait with mine sweeping experts.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh Foreign Minister Tokayev visited Kuwait in May 1997
during which he delivered a message from Nazarbayev to the
Kuwaiti Amir on developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Nazarbayev pays a visit to a Gulf Arab
country since he assumed power in December 1991. He will also visit
Bahrain and Oman following his trip to Kuwait.

WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton opened a "back to school" push
to salvage his national education testing plan yesterday by
promising a rewrite to assuage Republican fears of federal power
over local schools.
</P>
<P>
-- The white House plans to send Congress its request for
authority to negotiate trade agreements on a "fast-track" basis.
</P>
<P>
-- In Biljana Plasic, former biology professors and president
of the Serb Republic, the United States has found a new,
potentially decisive champion to force Bosnia's defiant Serbs to
carry out their commitment under the Dayton peace agreement, the
troubled 1995 accord ending the war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Experts say that educational issues are becoming national in
scope to an unusual extent. President Clinton plans to try to win
support for the first truly national performance tests in schools,
and Republicans in Congress will attempt to stop the initiative.
</P>
<P>
-- The first formal migration study to be sponsored by the
American and Mexican Governments found that the number of
undocumented Mexican workers who have settled in the United States
in the 1990's is far lower than some politicians have suggested,
only about 105,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arab Found Guilty for Spying for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Higher State Security
Emergency Court of Egypt today sentenced Azam Azam, an Israeli
textile engineer accused of spying for Israel, to 15 years in
prison, the Egyptian MENA News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The same court ruled that his Egyptian colleague, Emad Abdel
Hamid Ismail, be imprisoned for life in the same case.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli Arab women Zahra Youssef and Mona Ahmed Shawahnah,
standing trial in absentia in previous hearings, were also
sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of recruiting the
Egyptian for spying for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence, to
undermine Egypt's national and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
The verdicts were passed this morning at the seventh hearing of
the four defendants after several adjournments since the case
opened on April 24, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Azam and 34-year-old Ismail, arrested last
November, had pleaded innocence to charges of spying for the
Jewish state that can carry sentences of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
During previous hearings, Faird al-Dib, Azam's defense attorney
alleged that the case was "faked" and the real motive was to stop
the normalization of Egyptian-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel but ties have never been warm. The spy case, however, added
to the tensions because of the Mideast peace deadlock.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Steps up Mediation to Solve Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is determined
to step up its efforts to solve the Afghan crisis, said the
U.N. special envoy Akhzar Ebrahimi here today.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahimi, who arrived here Saturday, met with Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi and discussed new round of U.N. efforts to
bring Afghan crisis to an end.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. Secretary General (Kofi Annan) hopes that Iran's
constructive efforts to end Afghan crisis and its support for
peace agreements in Afghanistan will continue," Ebrahimi was
quoted as saying by the state-run Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that the Afghan crisis can be settled through
political channels, adding that problems cannot be solved
militarily.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi reiterated that Iran's efforts to establish peace
and security in the region, among them peace agreement in
Tajikistan, showed his country's solid commitment to peace and
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran had tried to bring about peace and
security in Afghanistan by inviting all warring factions to
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister criticized outside forces for
their intervention in Afghan affairs and called on Afghan
groups to abandon war as a means to achieve their ends.
"Establishing a widely-represented government is the only way to
end the Afghan crisis," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran was ready to back any U.N.-supported
plan which would end the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
"A new definition of life must be provided in Afghanistan. It
seems that a plan, which would include development and
reconstruction of the economic life of the Afghan people, would
have a better chance of success," Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahimi assured Kharrazi that his suggestion would be given
serious consideration by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"This issue will definitely be considered in the U.N. plans,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that front lines north of the Afghan capital
Kabul rumbled to the sound of artillery exchanges early Saturday,
but there was no major offensive by the Taliban or their rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, which seized Kabul in September last
year, controls two thirds of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Azzam Should Be Released Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- In reaction to Egypt's
sentencing of Israeli citizen Azzam Azzam for espionage, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today said that Azzam was
innocent and should be released immediately.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was informed of the verdict in Azzam's trial
this morning during the weekly Cabinet meeting, said in a
statement that he and the whole government viewed the verdict as
"a very serious development."
</P>
<P>
"Azzam Azzam is innocent and should not sit in prison even for
one day," said Netanyahu, adding that he had sent a message to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last week asking the latter to
act to secure Azzam's release.
</P>
<P>
Azzam, the 35-year-old Druse from Maghar in the Galilee,
was sentenced by Egypt's State Security Court in Cairo today
to 15 years in prison with hard labor for spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian citizen Emad Abdel Hamid Ismail, together with two
other Israeli-Arab women, were sentenced to life sentences for
being accomplices to Azzam in the case. The two women, Zahra
Yousef Jreis and Mona Ahmed Shawahna, were tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
Azzam, who worked in a textile company near Cairo, was
arrested by Egyptian police last November and was brought to trial
on April 24.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian state security prosecutors told the court that Azzam
gave Ismail women's underwear soaked in invisible ink to be
used in writing secret messages to Israel. Ismail was
allegedly recruited by the two Israeli-Arab women when he
worked at a factory in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both Azzam and Ismail have pleaded innocent, and the
repeated interventions by Israeli leaders in the trial have
failed to affect the final conviction of guilt.
</P>
<P>
Duing their summit on May 27 in Egyptian resort city Sharm el
Sheikh, Netanyahu requested Mubarak to act to secure Azzam's
release, but was rejected by the latter citing he could not
interfere with the court.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opposition Labor Party head Ehud Barak, during his
visit to Cairo on July 16, also appealed to Mubarak to
secure Azzam's release. Mubarak remained unimpressed by the
call.
</P>
<P>
Farid el-Deeb, one of Egypt's leading defense lawyers who
defended Azzam, claimed that Ismail was tricked by the police
into confessing about their espionage, but his arguments were
dismissed by the court as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The espionage trial of Azzam cast a shadow on the tense
relations between Egypt and Israel at a time when the Middle East
peace process is deeply deadlocked. Israel has repeatedly charged
Cairo for supporting the Palestinian National Authority in its
refusal to take orders from Israel on fighting terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Delhi to Construct Embankment on Teesta River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The water experts of Bangladesh
and India today decided to construct a 1.8 kilometer embankment,
mostly in the Indian territory, on the right bank of the river
Teesta, said official sources.
</P>
<P>
The construction work on the embankment will start within
December this year and will be completed by March 31, the experts
told a joint press conference today at the Teesta Barrage rest
house in the northwestern Lalmonirhat district.
</P>
<P>
However, a long-expected final proposal for a Teesta
water-sharing agreement was unable to be formulated in the two-day
Secretary-level meeting of the Indo-Bangladesh Joint Rivers
Commission (JRC), which began on Saturday between Bangladeshi
Water Resources Secretary Shamsul Huda and his Indian counterpart
Mata Prasad.
</P>
<P>
"The draft Teesta water sharing agreement cannot be finalized
due to the lack of sufficient data on the flow," said the Indian
delegation head Mata Prasad.
</P>
<P>
He said the data are too age-old for consideration, so we have
commissioned the standing committee for collection of fresh data
on the flow of Teesta within the month of October.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the water experts of the countries analyzed
the data of the river's water flow of last 50 years, official
sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is informed that an final agreement is expected to be signed
at the 33rd ministerial meeting of the JRC in New Delhi in
November.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The China Charity Federation
(CCF) donated 2.4 million yuan today for building rainwater
collectors in northwest China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
The project calls for 10,000 cisterns in drought-stricken areas
so that 10,000 rural families will have enough drinking water. It
is one of four CCF projects this year for 10 social welfare
institutions, helping 100 poor families, and providing orthopedic
surgery for 1,000 orphans with facial deformities.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, 1,000 cisterns had been completed.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held in Beijing's Great Hall of People, CCF
Chairman Cui Naifu said that more people are concerned about
charitable activities in China, and CCF's projects have gotten
support from people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his heartfelt thanks to those who have made
donations, among whom are Chinese pop singers, a charity
association in Wuxi city, Jiangsu province, and businesses and
charities in Malaysia, Germany and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Threntened of Loss of Asian Games By OCA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Council of Asia
(OCA) on Sunday warned Thailand that it could lose the 1998 Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
The OCA accused Bangkok organisers of ignoring its calls to
address problems concerning preparations.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Bangkok Asian Games, scheduled for December 1998, was
in doubt following internal bickering among officals of the
organising committee (BAGOC) and inadequate preparations.
</P>
<P>
"The OCA has repeatedly voiced its concern at the highest level
but unfortunately this had no echo within the (Bangkok) Organising
Committee, which is why we are at the present situation," OCA
director-general Abdul Muttaleb Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
The OCA had invited BAGOC officials to Kuwait in July to
discuss urgent issues concerning the games but failed to receive
any reply to their invitation. Some OCA members had attempted to
travel to Bangkok but were deterred from doing so by Bangkok
organisers who claimed of fund-lacking.
</P>
<P>
The OCA said that marketing of the 1998 Asian Games has
resulted in 80 million dollars in funding, considered a record
for the event.
</P>
<P>
The OCA is to hold an emergency meeting on September 23, where
it will call an emergency vote among its members on whether to
strip Thailand of its right to host the Asian Games. Thailand had
previously staged the Asian Games for three times.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stock Market And Investor Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Trading was bullish last week
on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) at 26.7 billion yuan, up
73.57 percent from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
This was the result mainly of low-priced state enterprise
shares and local investor confidence. They hope that state firms
may speed up restructuring after the 15th Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), which begins on September 12.
</P>
<P>
Shenneng and Magang stocks rose and were market leaders,
helping push the SSE Comprehensive Index to more than 1,200 points
on Thursday. On Friday, the last trading day of the week, it
closed at 1221.06, up 4.2 percent from a week before, while the
SSE 30 Index was 376.01, up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mid-year reports of many firms were a factor in the
stimulation, but trading focused on low-price stocks and
blue-chips plunged unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attribute the stability of the market to growth
of major low-priced shares, which helped investors regain market
confidence. The market has a sound foundation for low-priced
stocks, analysts say, and some low-priced stocks have been listed
for comparatively longer than many others and it's easier to chart
their development.
</P>
<P>
The low prices are also more suitable for investors, especially
those with little capital and who are afraid of being "trapped" by
high-priced shares. And, the cheaper shares belong to pillar
industries that are supported by the state and are attractive for
long-term investment.

<HEADLINE> Liberia in Throes of Post-war Austere Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Liberia, which has just emerged
from the devastation and carnage of a seven-year civil war, is
now in the throes of a belt-tightening austere economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigeria's "Sunday Times" today, Liberia has only
17,000 U.S. Dollars in its treasury at present and owes its
workers about 112 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Newly elected President Charles Taylor has urgent post-war
economic rehabilitation and reconstruction programs to attend to,
but there is neither the means nor the materials to execute them,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
There is no fund to give its citizens a new lease of life to
start some forms of economic activities. Those who returned
empty-handed from refugee camps have no means of buying
seedlings, ploughs, hoes and cutlasses for farming.
</P>
<P>
Many of the erstwhile baby-soldiers are left to rob or starve,
while guns and ammunitions have strayed into wrong hands that
have empty bellies to fill.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the robbery incidents are seen by
experts as "crime of survival".
</P>
<P>
West African countries called on the international community
to help Liberia's reconstruction at a just-concluded sub-regional
summit of heads of state and government.
</P>
<P>
But they can hardly assist Liberia with significant take-off
grants after funding heavily for peacekeeping efforts in the
country. Nigeria alone is reported to have spent more than four
billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A report even said these countries had largely developed what
an analyst called donor fatigue when their reservoir of donations
seems to be running out.
</P>
<P>
However, the new government is confident of a bright future.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister John Molba has assured Liberians that,
with the vast forest resources, iron ore and proper management,
the will to succeed and the determination to eliminate corruption
in high places, the country will emerge from poverty and
lawlessness into wealth.

<HEADLINE> Australia Govt Calls For More Surrendered Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Gun Control Australia (GCA)
called for another quarter of a million private guns surrendered
by the gun owners during the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of GCA, Randy Marshall, said in a statement
issued here today, "it is good to see that half a million guns
have been handed in throughout Australian, but many gun owners had
not complied with the law and should hand in their weapons to
police in the next month."
</P>
<P>
Following the tragedy at Port Arthur last year when a youth
shot at the visitors caused 35 people killed, the GCA was
established and according to a gun buy back scheme to take over
the private guns.
</P>
<P>
Marshall said, "shooters should realize that in one month's
time the fine for being caught with an illegal gun could be 5000
Australian dollars (3750 U.S. dollars), and two years
imprisonment."
</P>
<P>
In noting that the gun back scheme and the amnesty should end
in one month, he appealed to owners of illegal weapons to
surrender them.
</P>
<P>
On GCA's figures, compiled to August 28, 510116 weapons had
been surrendered throughout the country with compensation payouts
totaling more than 261 million Australian dollars (195.75 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israeli Doctors to Offer Blood Test for Colon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Israel will begin
soon to offer Ashkenazi Jews, who are mainly of central and
eastern European descent, a blood test for a mutated gene that
can cause a type of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
The test is to be conducted by Hadassah University Hospital in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Tamar Peretz, director of Hadassah's Sharett Institute for
Oncology, said in an interview published on today's The
Jerusalem Post that the test would soon be added to its
existing system of checks for mutations linked to cancer,
making it the first center after the Johns Hopkins University
Medical School of the United States to do so.
</P>
<P>
The gene was discovered recently by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, an
investigator at Johns Hopkins University's Howard Hughes Medical
Institute in Baltimore. Vogelstein said last week that it would
take three to five years for Johns Hopkins University to patent
and license the discovery and the resultant blood test.
</P>
<P>
He added that any geneticist could take the information from
the article to be published in Nature Genetics on September 1, and
examine blood samples according to his description.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the mutant gene, found in one out of 17
healthy Ashkenazi Jews, was called a "major breakthrough" and a
"landmark" by geneticists around the world.
</P>
<P>
The defect is the most common cancer-related mutation ever
identified in an ethnic group, and Vogelstein's discovery is
the first time that a relatively common, preventable illness
has been linked to a genetic mutation.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who carries the gene has a 20 to 30 percent
lifetime risk of contracting colon cancer, but the majority of
colon cancer cases derive from genetic mutations that occur
during one's lifetime, rather than those inherited from parents.
</P>
<P>
If the defective gene is identified in an individual, he
must undergo a colonoscopy to search for pre-cancerous polyps
or a tumor itself; if caught early, the polyps can be
removed by pinching them off during the colonoscopy, but if
found at a more advanced stage, surgery is necessary.

<P>
LHASA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Tibet
Autonomous Region decided recently to increase input in medical
care by 20 million yuan (about 2.5 million US dollars) next year,
a local official says.
</P>
<P>
The regional government now spends more than 200 million yuan
on medical care every year, accounting for seven percent of the
region's annual financial income. This is the highest percentage in
China's provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The region places great importance on public health in rural
areas. In the past three years, the number of hospitals in the
countryside has increased by 11 percent, and hospital facilities have
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
The central government and other provinces have provided the
region with 140 million yuan to help build pharmaceutical
factories and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the region worked with the United
Nations Children's Fund in treating common diseases among women
and children, and, as a result of new midwifery, the infant
mortality rate dropped nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans in pastoral areas get free medical care, and the local
government spends about 30 million yuan on these services every
year. The region has also increased vaccination efforts, and
poliomyelitis has basically been eliminated. The number of lepers
has declined to 68.

25 points to lead Houston Comets routing New York Liberty 65-51 at
home on Saturday, capturing the first ever Women's National
Basketball Association Championship.

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- There were 3,422 km of expressways
in China at the end of 1996, and the country may have one of the
world's largest freeway systems in five to fifteen years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Port handled more than 100 million tons of cargo
annually for the past several years and is one of the world's
largest ports. Qinhuangdao in north China has become the No.1
coal-shipping port in the world.

<P>
These are just a few of China's developments in road and water
transport since 1992, the year of the CPC's 14th national

China will continue to develop roads, waterways, and ports to
clear the bottle-neck in transport and major highway, waterway,
and port networks will be formed across the country by the end of
the century, he said.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, there will be 1.25 million km of highways. China has

of the counties, 97.3 percent of the towns and townships, and 81
percent of the villages in China.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, he noted, the country has built 276 new sea
berths, including 103 that can handle 10,000-ton ships and above,
adding a new handling capacity of 120 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China has improved over 4,230 km of waterways and built 81
river docks to give an additional handling capacity of 22 million
tons.

<HEADLINE> Fires Destroy 300,000 Hectares of Forests in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Fires have destroyed nearly
300,000 hectares of forests in Indonesia's Sumatra and Kalimantan
provinces so far this year, Environment Minister Sarwono
Kusumaatmadja said.
</P>
<P>
"The acreage of forests gutted by fires may increase as this
year's drought is far from over," Sarwono said Saturday in
Semarang, Central Jave, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said about 90 percent of controlled forest burning "is
done by large forestry and plantation companies and the
government-sponsored transmigration program."
</P>
<P>
Only 10 percent of the fires is believed to be caused by the
traditional slash-and-burn harvesting and land clearing methods.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government was considering making
man-made rain to deal with the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Agriculture Minister Sjarifuddin Baharsjah said a food
crisis may hit Indonesia due to the prolonged drought which has
lasted more than three months.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the drought will affect some 300,000 hectares
of rice fields in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Logistics Agency, Indonesia's rice
stock now stands at 2.9 million tons.

<HEADLINE> India Doctor Finds "Golden" Solution to Heart Ailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Perhaps for the first time in
the medical history of India that a 24-carat gold spring has been
implanted in the artery of a heart patient to relieve him of a
serious ailment, the Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The non-surgical procedure to implant the gold spring to open a
blocked artery was performed on August 27 by eminent cardiologist
Dr Purshottam Lal at Noida's Metro Heart Institute in the Suburbs
of New Delhi, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The patient's artery which was opened up by the gold spring,
was blocked to the extent of 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a light-hearted remark after the successful angioplasty,
elated Purshottam Lal quipped: "Gold is loved not only by women
but also by arteries."
</P>
<P>
Extensive research conducted jointly by the Metro Heart
Institute of India and the Medical College of Wisconsin-Milwauki
of the United States has demonstrated that accumulation of
deposits -- which block arteries -- on 24 carat gold is much less
than on other metals. Medically, this is explained by
endothelization, which is much less on 24 carat gold than on other
metals.
</P>
<P>
The gold implant was used after successful research on animals.

<HEADLINE> Savings Remain Most Alluring Way for Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Banking deposits remain urban
residents' first choice when arranging their surplus money,
although other investment tools are catching the attention from
individual investors, "Business Weekly" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited a recent survey as saying that 69.5 percent
of the respondents have bank deposits; 20.9 percent invest in
bonds; 20.8 percent trade stock; and 12.3 percent have insurance.
</P>
<P>
The rest invest in stamp collecting, industry, jewelry, private
lending, real estate and other options.
</P>
<P>
Chinese residents are more active in individual investment than
they were two years ago, with bank deposits attracting the most
attention among them, according to the survey, which was conducted
by a Beijing-based Horizon Research Group in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Xiamen and Chongqing. The 1,524 respondents were
between 18 and 65.
</P>
<P>
Although bank deposits' yields are lower than other investments,
they are safest, which can best explain a boom in deposit savings.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, outstanding individual bank savings
amounted to 4,275 billion yuan, 400 billion yuan more than the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the bank deposits continue to lead investment choice, its
appeal is weaker. In the first half of the year, individual
savings were 170 billion yuan less than the same period last year
mainly because of the overheated stock market.
</P>
<P>
Most residents showed positive response to the reform of state
commercial banks and their service quality.

COLOMBO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's provincial council

COLOMBO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will launch a new
teacher education project with assistance from the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank, the Ministry of Education said today.
</P>
<P>
The 75 million U.S. dollar project will help strengthen teacher
education with the establishment of five new colleges of
educational institutions and 80 teachers' centers in all
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The present composition of the teaching strength shows that
extensive training is required to improve teacher skills,
particularly in science and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
Teacher recruitment will be given careful attention as
untrained and less qualified persons brought into the system tends
to lower the quality of education and increase in-service training
costs, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve the quality of teaching, 1,850 teachers
will be trained at teacher training colleges while a further 1,800
will be trained at colleges of education.

<HEADLINE> China Hailed for Agricultural Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Some people in the Western
countries have worried that China will not be able to feed its
huge population in next century, but a British scientist does not.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese can and will be able to feed themselves," said Dr
James Gilmore, director general of the Center for Agriculture and
Biosciences International (CABI) headquartered in Wallingford,
Oxford shire, Britain.
</P>
<P>
"China has made a tremendous contribution to the survival and
development of mankind by feeding 22 percent of the world
population with 7 percent of the world's cultivated land," he said
in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
CABI, an international, inter-governmental, non-profit
organization directed by the governments of its 41 member
countries, occupies a unique position as a scientific organization
and a publisher on agricultural research and development.
</P>
<P>
China joined CABI on August 21 1995, opening the way to further
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"China is one of the most important member countries of
CABI. CABI and China have maintained close relations for over 15
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
CABI has cooperated with China since 1981 for the exchange of
CABI information. Dr Gilmore said that since the Chinese
government has given the priority to agricultural research and
development, China will be more capable of developing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said the agriculture achievements in China are attributed to
China's right policy and the priority given to the field.
</P>
<P>
One of the good examples is that China has doubled the rice
yield of the 1950s by popularizing hybrid rice, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between CABI and China is just starting, we are
very keen to have an office in China which will be opened next
year," Gilmore said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue Key for Improvement of Greek-Turkish Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The resolution of the Cyprus
problem was the key for the improvement of relations between
Greece and Turkey, former U.S. senator John Brademas said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Brademas, who is of Greek descent and has also served as
President of New York University, made the statements to the semi-
official Athens News Agency (ANA) today on the sidelines of the
Athens summit'97, a three-day international congress which opened
here Friday with the title of "democracy and development: Europe's
contribution to the globalization of the economy."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Cyprus problems was an anchor tied around the
neck of Turkey, which will not allow Ankara to join Europe.
</P>
<P>
"My own opinion is that in the long run it is much better for
Turkey, for the country of Turkey, not to have the albatross of
Cyprus around its neck. Because so long as Cyprus remaining
divided, with Turkish forces there, Turkey will never be able to
enter Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for what he envisaged as success being for Richard
Holbrooke, U.S. President Clinton's emissary on the Cyprus
problem, he said that his view was that getting an arrangement
where there is a constitutional structure, that will have one
country, one sovereignty, with respect for the rights of all the
people, Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, which will made it
possible for the north to be able to improve its standard of
living, would be in the interest of Turkish Cypriots and this of
course means that the Turkish military forces must be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The present prospect of beginning negotiations for entry of
Cyprus into the European Union (EU) should be regarded as "a
forward step," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jacques Poos, foreign minister of Luxembourg and
whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, stressed here
Friday that the entire 15-nation bloc has decided that Cyprus's EU
entry talks will start at the beginning of next year, regardless
of whether the Cyprus problem is solved or not.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Vice-Prime Minister
Boris Nemtsov met here today visiting Vice Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Council Huo Yingdong.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Nemtsov said "the Russian-Chinese relations
are developing steadily, and we believe that the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region will play an important role in promoting
economic and trade ties between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that he is preparing for the visit of President Boris
Yeltsin to Beijing in this Autum, making efforts to promote the
development of the bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
In Nemtsov's opinion, the cooperation between Russia and China
in the power and agriculture fields is full of promise. He
expressed hope that Russia will provide for China chemical
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Huo Yingdong, for his part, said that the volume of trade
between the two countries reached 7,000 million U.S. dollars last
year, but it accounts for two percent of the Chinese foreign trade
volume only. He believed that the two countries' trade has a great
potential of development.
</P>
<P>
Huo said that China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong and keeps the region in stability and prosperity."Hong
Kong's people is full of confidence in Hong Kong's future", he
added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Independent Board to Design School Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered the Education Department to have an independent
board design the nation's school test as a way to deflect Congress
members' attacks on the test program.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address today, Clinton says he will "do
whatever is necessary" to help school administer those tests to
4th and 8th graders.
</P>
<P>
Clinton says nationwide testing will help measure how U.S.
students compare worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Under the rewritten plan, math and reading tests for the
nation's school children would be developed by an independent
bipartisan board, rather than the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
Clinton first called in his State of the Union address for
higher national standards and performance testing. About 20
percent of the nation's schools have volunteered to test students,
including seven states, 15 cities, and the military.
</P>
<P>
Some congressional Republicans view the federal test as
undermining the tradition of local control over schools.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said in the radio address he was encouraged by a
new government report that found student achievement in math and
science improved during 1996.
</P>
<P>
The tests measure 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds and 17-year-olds on
math, science and reading. The writing test, added later, is given
to fourth, eighth and 11th graders.
</P>
<P>
But the National Assessment of Educational Progress also found
that students from grade school through high school still cannot
read or write any better than before.
