<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Not Invited to Form Government in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
prime ministerial candidate A. B. Vajpayee said Thursday evening
that he had not been invited by President K. R. Narayanan to form
the next government.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee Thursday evening called on the president and submitted
documents to prove the support of 240 out of 543 MPs in the Lower
House of Parliament, telling the president that talks with
All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which has 27
MPs, had not yielded any result so far.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after his 40-minute meeting with the
president, Vajpayee said that the president told him that he would
consider everything and let his decision be known by day after
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee had called on the president Tuesday evening after he
received the president's letter asking him whether he would be
"able and willing" to form a "stable government" on the same day,
and claimed to be able to form a stable government.
</P>
<P>
Then the president asked him to furnish documents supporting
his claim to form a stable government and Vajpayee promised to do
so Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With his Tamil Nadu allies failing to forward their letters of
support Thursday evening, Vajpayee and other BJP leaders have been
greatly upset.
</P>
<P>
Apart from asking the BJP to dismiss the present Tamil Nadu
government, AIADMK supremo Jayalalitha has also asked the
allocation of finance and law portfolios to her nominees.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee expressed his inability to give any commitment on the
demands like dismissal of the Tamil Nadu government. He also said
Thursday evening that there was no question of succumbing to any
pressure for giving the finance portfolio to AIADMK.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Visits Russia in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, praising the role played by Moscow in resolving the Iraqi
weapons inspection crisis, said on Thursday that he would visit
Russia early next month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington,
Annan said, the main purpose of his visit is to show that the
world community stand together to deal with the weapons inspection
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in Moscow beginning of April, and again to show that
we all stand together on this Iraqi crisis, and send a message to
the Iraqi leadership that they've signed an agreement and the
whole international community intends to hold them to its
fulfillment," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and China upheld a peaceful solution to the
stand-off between Iraq and the United States over the weapons
inspection crisis. Last month, a deal signed between Annan and the
Iraqi authorities averted a war.
</P>
<P>
Annan praised Russia's role in the process. "Russia played a
very important role, and right from the beginning sought a
diplomatic solution, sending a deputy foreign minister as an
envoy, and he worked very hard at getting an agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that he stayed in touch with Russian leaders
prior to his trip to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"I was also in touch with Foreign Minister Primakov and President
Yeltsin, as I were with other leaders around the world in my
preparation for the trip," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
Annan reiterated his appeal for the United States to pay the
1.3 billion U.S. dollars dues it owes to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is, as the Iraqi crisis has showed, a
unique and irreplaceable instrument for achieving through
diplomacy what the world demands," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"A stronger United Nations can do even more for the United
States and for the rest of the world," he affirmed.

<HEADLINE> UNEP/GEF Assist Africa in Combating Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U. N. Environment Program
(UNEP) and Global Environmental Facility (GEF) are assisting
African countries in combating land degradation in order to
effectively implement the International Convention to Combat
Desertification.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing held here Thursday, Ahmed
Djoghlaf, Executive Coordinator of UNEP/GEF Coordination Office,
said that the impact of desertification in Africa is particularly
acute.
</P>
<P>
It threatens the lives of millions of people and seriously
affects more than 39 percent of the total area of the continent,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to implement the Nairobi Program of Action to Combat
Desertification adopted in 1997, the U.N. official pointed out,
UNEP took a leading role in designing a policy framework and
promoting a meaningful portfolio in land degradation focusing on
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Djoghlaf told reporters that the next meeting of the GEF
Executive Council to be held in New Delhi on March 30-31 would
consider a UNEP-sponsored project which is designed to address
the transboundary land degradation issues of Mauritania and
Senegal.
</P>
<P>
The project which will be implemented in five years time at a
cost of 12.3 million U.S. Dollars is aimed at addressing the root
causes of biodiversity loss from land degradation in five
critical ecosystems, covering 60,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, he said, the GEF Executive Council will
discuss another UNEP/GEF project of 10 million Dollars to improve
the management of indigenous vegetation for the rehabilitation of
degraded rangelands in the arid zones of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 10 million Dollars Land Management and Environmental
Change Project covering Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
is designed to develop sustainable and participatory approaches
to biodiversity conservation within agricultural systems, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Seven other transboundary land degradation UNEP/GEF projects
which are estimated to cost more than 50 million Dollars and
involve 20 African countries are under active preparation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, UNEP/GEF will assist 10 African countries in
the preparation of their national strategies, plans or programs
for the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
UNEP/GEF will allocate 2.5 million Dollars to 12 African
countries in preparing their national country studies on
biodiversity, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
UNEP is also assisting Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania in
preparing a 10 million Dollars project aiming at enhancing
biodiversity conservation and sustainable utilization within the
Gregory Rift Valley Lakes and Wetlands, Djoghlaf said.
</P>
<P>
GEF is a multilateral financing mechanism created to address
climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of
biodiversity, reduction of ozone layer depletion, the protection
of international waters, and other global environmental
challenges.
</P>
<P>
GEF is mandated to provide new and additional grant and
concessional funding to eligible countries to meet the agreed
incremental costs of measures designed to achieve agreed global
environmental benefits in the areas of biological diversity,
climate change, international waters and the protection of the
ozone layer.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Seeks Aid for Army Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The cash-strapped Zimbabwean
government might be forced to source for more donor funds to
finance the further downsizing of the national army.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency Thursday quoted sources in government
as saying that the government is planning to further cut down the
army to 25,000 soldiers in a bid to reduce expenditure in line
with current economic demands.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1997, the Ministry of Defense reduced the
size of the army from 51,000 soldiers to 40,000 through early
retirement.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, the government trained retrenched soldiers
to equip them with skills to start self-help projects with the
assistance of donors.
</P>
<P>
Sources in government said since the overall public service
reform program was being funded through donor assistance, the
government might turn to donors for more funds.
</P>
<P>
"There are many donors prepared to assist the government with
such programs reducing the size of the civil service," the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government is under pressure to cut its expenditure to
reduce the skyrocketing budget deficit and bring back
macro-economic stability needed for businesses to thrive, the
agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Rise on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to rise
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) picked up marginally by three points to close at
1580.84 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Property stocks emerged the top gainers. However, dealers said
investors remained sidelined pending further developments in
Indonesia and the local corporate scene.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in the broader market moved sideways for most of
the day as investors took stock of recent gains and appeared to
exercise some caution, they said.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume shrank to 195.75 million units, valued at
331.68 million Singapore dollars (204.74 million U.S. dollars).
Declines led advances by 168 to 152, while 293 other counters
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd continued to be the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 13.72 million units. It was followed by
MBf Capital which had 8.45 million shares traded. Rekapac was next
with 8.2 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Property developer City Developments Warrant98 and Khong Guan
shared the top spot on the gainers' list as each of them rose by
50 cents to finish at 4.98 and five Singapore dollars
respectively. City Developments, Creative 50 and DBS (Development
Bank of Singapore) all increased by 40 cents to end at 7.65, 37.1,
and 9.2 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Elec was the biggest loser as it declined by
40 cents to close at 5.6 U.S. dollars. Local car distributor Cycle
&AMP; Carriage (C&AMP;C), SIA (Singapore Airlines) Foreign, and Venture
fell by 20 cents each to finish at 6.75, 11.4, and 5.7 Singapore
dollars respectively.

NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- President K. R. Narayanan
Thursday night decided to hold discussions with the Congress and

240 MPs out of 539 declared seats so far.

said a presidency communique issued here Thursday night after the
meeting between the president and BJP prime ministerial candidate
A. B. Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
With the support of only 240 members in the Lower House,
Vajpayee is well short of an absolute majority or even a working

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Move Up 0.5 Pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales picked
up 0.5 percent in February, the Commerce Department reported here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth, which represents a seasonally adjusted 218.1
billion U.S. dollars, followed an even bigger increase of 1.0
percent in January. The January figure, the biggest gain in six
months, had originally been estimated as a tiny 0.1 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the first two months of this year shows that
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic
output, began the year at a surprisingly healthy pace.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe economic growth would be significantly
slower this year than last year because of adverse effects from
the Asian financial chaos. But so far the weakness is yet to be
felt as unemployment dipped in February to 4.6 percent, returning
to a 24-year low.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Thursday, the Labor Department said that new
claims for unemployment benefits fell by 7,000 last week to
298,000, a sign of continued strength in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The February sales report showed that consumer spending outside
the auto sector rose 0.6 percent. That followed a revised 1.3
percent surge in January, the biggest gain in almost two years.
</P>
<P>
The warm weather in most parts of the country, caused by El
Nino, spurred strong demand for Spring clothing, garden supplies
and other hardware products.
</P>
<P>
Sales at department stores and specialty stores climbed up by a
strong 1.3 percent, after even bigger gains of 2.1 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
Sales at hardware and garden supply stores were up 2.0 percent
in February after a 3.6 percent jump in January. Demand in this
area has been helped not only by the weather but by a sharp drop
in mortgage rates that has sparked a boom in home sales.
</P>
<P>
Furniture sales dipped 0.4 percent in February, which marked
only a slight setback from a huge 3.3 percent gain in January.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales edged a slight 0.1 percent in February after a small
dip of 0.2 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Sales at gasoline service stations were down 1.1 percent, the
biggest decline for any major category last month, reflecting a
drop in prices due to abundant supply.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Russia to Cooperate in Fighting Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Russia
will appoint mutual police attaches in a joint drive to fight
international crime syndicates, according to a treaty signed
Thursday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi and visiting Russian Deputy Chairman Anatoly
Kulikov, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of police attaches would streamline the
exchange of intelligence between the two countries, Kulikov said.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the police forces of the two countries would
cooperate closely to track international syndicates smuggling
uranium, diamonds and gold.
</P>
<P>
They would also work together in the prevention, detection,
suppression and investigation of other crimes, including murder,
money laundering, and trafficking in drugs, firearms and
radio-active material, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said there were strong similarities in the crime
patterns of South Africa and Russia. Both were in a period of
transition and were facing new threats in the form of organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
"In both countries, a number of criminal syndicates are
operated by foreigners who ruthlessly exploit the vulnerabilites
of a state in transition," he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Government Considers Reducing Salary Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan government decided to
review wage policy in public services and reduce the wage gap
between top officaials and primary public servants, The New
Vision reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Apolo Nsibambi, the minister of public service, said in a
statement the decision was made when Ugandan president Yoweri
Museveni met with a team of parliament members Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president asked for reducing the gap of 30 times to 20
times between the top officials and primary public servants.
</P>
<P>
The ministers of the country earn some 1,300 u.s. dollars
while a primary worker earns some 45 u.s. dollars, local sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Sources in parliament commitees on presidential and foreign
affairs and on public affairs said the president gave the
minister a month for reviewing the presidential emoluments and
benefits bill and the overall wage structure and report to the
committees.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked for freezing pay for top officials
for four years.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the present wage ratio between the
highest and lowest of 1:30 should be revised.
</P>
<P>
But still, some parliamentarians reportedly told the president
during the meeting that he set a bad precedent to have little
wage as a state head. Some suggested at the meeting that if
Museveni did not want money he could donate it to charity.
</P>
<P>
Some parliamentarians asked for the increase of their salary
several times before. Wednesday's meeting was the third time the
president met the parliament members on the matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi
will visit Djibouti early next week to attend a regional summit
on troubled Sudan and Somalia, a source with the Foreign Ministry
told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The President will be accompanied by his Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) grouping seven eastern African and Horn of Africa states,
is scheduled to start on Monday and will last one or two days,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Among other regional leaders expected to attend the summit are
presidents Omar el-Bashir of Sudan, Issaias Afeworki of Eritrea
and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Ethiopian Premier Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to focus on a mediation bid to end the
15-year Sudanese civil war, as well as to promote national
reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, the president
of the self-proclaimed Independent Republic of Somaliland, was
planning to attend the summit at that time.
</P>
<P>
After the Khartoum government met southern rebels under the
IGAD auspices in Nairobi October and agreed to resume talks in
April, a good regional diplomatic attempt was underway to settle
the Sudan conflict, said IGAD's Executive Secretary Tekeste
Ghebray.
</P>
<P>
He added on Wednesday that other issues at the summit will
include the IGAD budget and regional development projects for
road construction, food security and tackling cattle diseases.
</P>
<P>
On that same day, the Sudanese government urged European
nations to put pressure upon rebels in the south to accept its
offer of a ceasefire so that the humanitarian aid deliveries can
go unhindered.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Monday that Bashir had reshuffled his cabinet,
including one ex-rebel leader and two opposition figures among 12
new faces. Analysts said that the move appeared to be a political
concession to the southern rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has been fighting
the Muslim-dominated Khartoum government since 1983 for greater
autonomy in the animist and Christian south.

<HEADLINE> Non-tariff Barriers Retard Intra-regional Trade: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Problems currently obstructing
the movement of goods across borders, thereby retarding
intra-regional trade and economic development, are largely due to
high levels of informal trade.
</P>
<P>
This was said in an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency on
Thursday in Harare by Danny Meyer, president of the African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) National Chambers of Commerce,
Industry and Other Economic Operators.
</P>
<P>
Meyer, who attended a trade facilitation symposium in Geneva
this week, said trade problems could no longer be blamed on poor
infrastructural development or political instability only, but to
some extent on some non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
"It is, however, important to acknowledge the high level of
informal trade which takes place between countries. A number of
non-tariff obstacles are contributing to this," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
Other barriers he pointed out included bureaucratic and
irrelevant customs and immigration procedures, undeveloped
facilities at and understaffing of busy border posts, inadequate
security at border posts and along major transport routes,
excessive charges, levies and fees, corruption and lack of
transparency and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
He said, "in consideration of the need to promote
inter-regional trade, the perception is often that products
manufactured abroad in developed countries must be superior to
those produced in neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
He added solutions would have to be found to these problems
which inhibit cross border business.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Call for U.N. Procurement Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries
called on the United Nations to increase procurement from
their suppliers, according to a press release from U.N. Office
of Communications and Public Information on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They made the point at a Fifth Committee (Administrative and
Budgetary) session on Wednesday to review the United Nations
administrative and financial efficiency, which focused on
procurement reform.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the Group of 77, Indonesia's representative Cecep
Herawan said among qualified vendors, procurement preference
should be given to vendors from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's representative Amjad Hussain Sial said current
suppliers roster is made up primarily of companies from
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts should be made to broaden the roster's
geographical base, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said suppliers from developing countries only account
for 6.9 percent of the U.N. roster currently.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's representative Kabir complained that bidding on
procurement contracts remains limited to a few states.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that suppliers roster be made transparent and
procurement preference be given to countries that have paid their
assessed contributions to the U.N.. The idea was shared by India's
representative Rajat Saha.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the European Union and several other
European countries, Britain's representative Nicholas Thorne said
the European Union shares the concern of developing countries
about the lack of a fair share of the business opportunities on
offer.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Raps French Mission to Probe Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
strongly criticized the French Parliament's fact-finding mission
that has been charged with probing the role French troops played
in the 1994 genocide, a report available here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This fact-finding mission is useless because the information
it will be looking for is already there, and they (the French)
are aware of it," Minister in President's Office, Patrick
Mazimhaka told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) in an exclusive interview
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"This commission is just a hoax, since it will not have enough
juridical power to convoke anyone on the involvement of French
troops in the tragedy here," said Mazimhaka.
</P>
<P>
For the Rwandan authorities, this move by France is aimed at
hoodwinking international opinion in setting up such a powerless
fact-finding mission.
</P>
<P>
"If this is what they have preferred, the mission itself is
diversionary," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, former French Socialist Minister of Defense, Paul
Quiles, declared that the fact-finding mission is preparing to
come to Rwanda in the coming two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the mission is to probe the role of French
troops in the Rwandan genocide as well as that of other troops
which were present on the ground, Quiles pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Why do they want to document the involvement of other
troops?" Mazimhaka questioned, insinuating that the French should
restrict themselves to the involvement of their own troops in the
1994 bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
"This fact-finding mission will bring us back to square one,
while French scholars, independent reporters as well as human
rights activists were pretty well advanced in documenting the
involvement of France in the tragedy here," Mazimhaka furthered.
</P>
<P>
"All in all this fact-finding mission is a trivialization of
facts documented by independent researchers," Mazimhaka
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Invites Turkish Cypriots to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has formally invited Turkish Cypriots to participate as
full members of the Cypriot delegation which will negotiate the
country's accession terms with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Thursday, read to the press in London
after a 45-minute meeting with British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, Clerides said he repeated his wish that the Turkish Cypriot
community nominates representatives to be included as full
members of the Cypriot team which will conduct the negotiations,
Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides is currently in London to attend the European
Conference, participated by the 15 EU member-states and 11
applicant countries.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said his position on Turkish Cypriot participation in
accession talks was outlined taking into account the conclusions
of the Luxembourg EU summit last December that the accession of
Cyprus would benefit all communities and help bring about civil
peace and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed in his statement that regarding the
participation of the Turkish Cypriot community in the delegation,
"I was making an honest and solemn invitation to my Turkish
Cypriot compatriots to participate for I firmly believe that they
should take an active part and make their contribution to the
negotiating process for acceding to the EU."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "should the Turkish Cypriot community respond
favourably to the proposal, they may rest assured that their
points of view and the opinions of their representatives will be
discussed freely, seriously and in good faith."
</P>
<P>
He assured the Turkish Cypriots that the conclusions reached
will constitute "an important element in formulating the
negotiating positions of the Cypriot team."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the response of the leadership of the Turkish
Cypriot community will be positive," Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that Cook considers the proposal by
the government of Cyprus as "very constructive."
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be submitted to the Turkish Cypriot side by
Britain as the current EU rotating presidency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit last December decided to start accession
negotiations with the Cypriot government on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has stated that the
Turkish Cypriots will not participate in the EU accession talks
unless the breakaway state, unilaterally declared in northern
Cyprus, is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Train Links S. Africa, Swaziland, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The passenger train
services of South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique will introduce
a twice-weekly shuttle service between Durban and Maputo via
Mpaka in Swaziland on April 3.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported on Thursday
that the shuttle, the first of its kind for southern Africa, will
service three countries and travel across two borders in one day,
which would boost travel and tourism in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican traders who bought stock in Durban, a port city of
South Africa, had also requested affordable, time-saving
transport, and research had confirmed that viability of the
service.
</P>
<P>
The current train transport from Maputo, the capital of
Mozambique to Johannesburg, the South African commercial hub, and
Durban, normally takes 50 hours. The new shuttle service would
cut the traveling time to 20 hours.

<HEADLINE> IDNDR Introduces New Initiative to Prevent Seismic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Proper preventive measures can
help reduce casualties and damages caused by earthquakes, the
Geneva-based Secretariat of the International Decade (1990-2000)
for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IDNDR launched Thursday an initiative called the Risk
Assessment Tools for Diagnosis of Urban Areas Against Seismic
Disasters (RADIUS).
</P>
<P>
It aims at preparing earthquake scenarios and preventive action
plans in the selected cities and developing practical tools for
seismic risk assessment of urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Nine cities among 58 candidates have been selected for the case
studies: Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Antofagasta (Chile), Bandung
(Indonesia), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Izmir (Turkey), Skopje
(Macedonia), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Tijuana (Mexico), and Zigong
(China).
</P>
<P>
The Initiative also offers the possibility to share the
collected data with other cities, cities which are willing to
participate in the activities.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 700 shocks each year are
sufficiently strong to cause property damage, death or injury if
centered in a populated area.
</P>
<P>
A major portion of the world's earthquakes each year take place
in Asia and around the rim of the Pacific Ocean. Two thirds of the
world's population live in this area, where no part is free from
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
RADIUS is financed by the Japanese government. In addition,
three international institutes give technical assistance to the
initiative: the International Center for Disaster-Mitigation
Engineering (INCEDE, Japan), the Bureau de Recherches Geologiques
et Minieres (BRGM, France) and GeoHazards International (GHI,
USA).
</P>
<P>
Planned RADIUS activities include training seminars in 1998 in
Japan with the participation of technical experts and government
officials respectively in the nine selected cities, visits of
regionally established advisory committees in order to provide
technical advice to the selected cities and to raise public
awareness, and an international workshop to be held in 1999 to
present the results of the initiative.

<HEADLINE> UK Now May Need Fewer Tanks, Says Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said Thursday that he believes there are good reasons
for Britain to cut its tank numbers and to reduce its forces in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Royal Institute of International Affairs on the
government-ordered Strategic Defense Review which began last year,
Robertson said Britain's potential enemies had cut their tank
numbers in recent years and technological advances meant tanks
were now more vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the threat of massive armored attack by
UK's potential enemies had been "much diminished in recent years".
</P>
<P>
"There are strong arguments why we might not need as many tanks
in the front line," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
However, there were also a counter argument to consider in
favor of tanks, saying that Britain could not have contributed to
the Gulf War against Iraq as it did without a credible armored
capability, and that the effectiveness of United Nations forces in
Bosnia was in large part due to heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
That's why a final decision on the issue had not been taken so
far, said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that there were arguments for Britain to
reduce its forces in Germany as the basing of UK forces there was
"a Cold War relic which has outlived its usefulness".

<HEADLINE> Cook to Push New EU Initiative on Mideastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said Thursday he is to push a new European Union (EU)
initiative on advancing the Middle East peace process during his
upcoming visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Israel Radio's reporter in London,
Cook said he will visit the region next week not only as British
foreign secretary but also in the capacity of the EU
presidency.
</P>
<P>
He said he would promote the new EU initiative by taking the
following three steps.
</P>
<P>
First, he would demand both Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) honor their respective commitments in
order to get the peace process going. Namely, Israel must carry
out "credible, urgent and substantial further redeployments" in
the West Bank, while the PNA is to make 100 percent effort to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Cook said he would promise to extend the EU
financial aid to the PNA and explore how to best take advantage
of the EU funds to advance the peace process. He said the funds
should be used for specific projects that will contribute to
peace, such as the construction of Gaza airport, seaport and
industrial parks.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Cook said he had committed the EU to intense diplomacy
so as to get the peace process moving. He said he would consult
with other European countries in order to get united backing for
this new initiative.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the EU had devised a five-point
plan for its new initiative on the Middle East peace process. It
includes a 15-20 percent Israeli handover of Area C in the West
Bank under total Israeli control, canceling the third Israeli
redeployment, a halt to Israeli settlements and its unilateral
moves especially in Jerusalem, implementation of the interim
agreements and the Memoradum of Security Understanding drawn by
the two sides under the U.S. sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
During his scheduled visit to the region, Cook is also
expected to visit Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syrian. Cook said he
would also try to break the deadlock in the Lebanese and Syrian
peace tracks, which he termed as important parts of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the recent Israeli offer to withdraw from South
Lebanon, but adding that "it is very difficult to separate the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks which must go hand in hand." He said
Syria plays an important role in restoring peace and stability in
South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Although the EU is eager to play a bigger role in the
mediation of the Middle East peace process, it is doubtful if it
could succeed in doing so because of the U.S. monopoly.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Europe, including Britain, last week,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected London's
suggestion to halt settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Many regarded Netanyahu's European visit as only an attempt to
deflect the U.S. pressure on Israel to take big steps to break
the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate following the recent Iraq
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been widely criticized for adopting double
standard in dealing with Middle East issues.

<HEADLINE> Forex Shortage Causes Zambian Kwacha's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia (BOZ)
explained Thursday that the limited supply of foreign exchange on
the local market has caused the continued devaluation of Zambian
Kwacha, according to Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In a response to Kwacha's continued devaluation, Kabinga
Pande, head of public relations of the central bank, said in a
statement released in Lusaka that though the demand for foreign
exchange has picked up since last year, the supply side has
experienced adverse external shocks.
</P>
<P>
The Kwacha has depreciated from 1,300 in mid-1997 to 1,700 per
Dollar this month and is supposed to experience a further
depreciation.
</P>
<P>
This results from the mismatch experienced in both the supply
and demand of foreign exchange, said the BOZ official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that seasonal factors such as the restocking by
business entities and remittance of dividends have increased
demand for foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Pande added that the supply side of foreign exchange on market
has also experienced adverse shocks, which have not helped meet
the increased demand.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the shocks have mainly been the result of
economic problems experienced in the Far East since last year.
</P>
<P>
The economic problems, said Pande, resulted in turn in the
reduction of the world's demand for copper, the country's major
source of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that copper prices are reduced from 109
cents per pound in February, 1997 to 74 cents in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Pande also refuted reports that the Kwacha is experiencing a
free fall without the intervention of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He said that BOZ is committed to intervene in the foreign
exchange market to uphold the policy of maintaining a stable and
competitive rate.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Northern Ireland Deal "Agonizingly Close" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Thursday an agreement on a Northern Ireland peace
settlement was "agonizingly close."
</P>
<P>
"We are agonizingly close to agreeing the framework or outline
of a settlement. We've obviously got to get the detail right too,"
Blair told Independent Television News after a meeting in Dowing
Street with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
Blair also urged Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA
guerrillas, to re-join the peace process. Sinn Fein was expelled
from the peace talks last month but was allowed to return to the
negotiating table on March 9. Sinn Fein, however, said it would
not re-enter the talks until a meeting between Adams and Blair.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Sinn Fein come back to the process," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he remained "stubbornly optimistic" that an overall
agreement could be reached by early next month.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still optimistic, maybe stubbornly optimistic, that we can
get to that deadline, provided there's the goodwill there for
people to negotiate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, if reached by the parties in Northern Ireland,
would be put to referendums in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic on the same day in May.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Blair, Sinn Fein leader Adams told
reporters he wanted his party to return to the talks "as soon as
possible" but the decision was up to the leadership of the party
to make.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Interested in Cooperation with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Minister of External Relations
and Trade of New Zealand, Don Mckinnon said on Thursday that his
country is interested in cooperation with Mozambique in
agriculture and fishery.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon said this after his meeting with Mozambican President
Joaquim Alberto Chissano. During their talks, they discussed
bilateral relations and matters concerning the British
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon pointed out that the stable situation in Mozambique
has offered a good opportunity for the African country to promote
its export to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"We will encourage New Zealand investors to invest in
Mozambique like investors from other countries are doing here,"
said Mckinnon.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are seeking ways for the British Commonwealth to
provide assistance to Mozambique since there are many
similarities among the Commonwealth countries."
</P>
<P>
With the help of New Zealand, Mozambique joined the British
Commonwealth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The visiting New Zealand minister also revealed that he has
discussed with the Mozambican side about how to quicken the
implementation of the mine-removing plan.
</P>
<P>
For three years New Zealand has been helping Mozambique with
mine clearance training, he said, adding that New Zealand will
help strengthen the capability of mine clearing in Mozambique so
that its soldiers can do their job more easily and safely.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon began his trip to Southern Africa on Tuesday and is
scheduled to end his tour in Mozambique and return home today.

<HEADLINE> Humans Produce and Respond to Pheromones: Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have shown for the
first time that humans produce and respond to pheromones,
subliminal scent messages widely used by animals to attract mates
and recognize one another.
</P>
<P>
Psychologists Kathleen Stark and Martha McClintock, of the
University of Chicago in the United States, have found that
undetectable scents from one woman can influence the menstrual
cycle of another.
</P>
<P>
Their findings were published Thursday in the British
scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The researchers took armpit secretions from women at a
particular stage of their menstrual cycles and smeared these
secretions on to the upper lips of women who were at different
stages of their cycles.
</P>
<P>
They then measured the rise and fall of the hormones and found
that those odourless chemicals could either speed up or slow down
the cycles, depending on the stage of the donors' cycles.
</P>
<P>
"These data demonstrate that humans have the potential to
communicate pheromonally," the psychologists concluded.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Mission
of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) on Wednesday conducted air
operations using the Dushanbe airport, U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, UNMOT carried out a helicopter
flight and was expected to get a fixed-wing aircraft to land at
Dushanbe airport on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, UNMOT announced that it was withdrawing three
United Nations teams from remote areas to their base in Dushanbe
because they were isolated due to heavy snow and avalanches, and
because the Tajik authorities were not allowing the United
Nations Mission to use the Dushanbe airport.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the authorities of the Dushanbe airport have
finally given the "green light" for the United Nations Mission
to carry out its air operation.
</P>
<P>
Two teams had already been withdrawn using helicopters of the
Russian border forces, according the spokesman. He said that
those teams would be re-deployed as soon as the United Nations
"air assets are operating freely."

<HEADLINE> Canada's Vehicle Sales Drop Sharply in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- New motor vehicle sales in Canada
fell sharply in January following strong sales in December,
Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Total vehicle sales plunged 27.0 percent to 105,595 from the high
of 144,555 in December. "The month-to-month sales decrease was the
largest drop since January 1976," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In January, a total of 50,689 passenger cars were sold in the
country, down 24.1 percent from a month before.
</P>
<P>
Sales of trucks, vans and buses fell 29.4 percent to 54,906 in
January.
</P>
<P>
"Industry sources have suggested that dealers might have drawn
some business into December by offering customers strong incentives
on the purchase of new motor vehicles," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
"This shift in sales, coupled with the January ice storm,
contributed to a substantial decline in new vehicles sales in
January," it noted.
</P>
<P>
However, on a year-over-year basis, Canada's new vehicle sales were
0.7 percent ahead of January 1997.

BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- President Ejub Ganic of the

Announcing the resumption of the process, which had been

<HEADLINE> Sub-regional Customs to Discard Outdated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Customs chiefs from west and
central Africa have resolved to take immediate steps to discard
outdated procedures and complex documentation in the clearance of
import and export consignments in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a communique at the end of a three-day conference
Wednesday, the customs chiefs said modernization of their customs
services had become imperative so as to check delays in goods
clearance which also result in additional transaction cost.
</P>
<P>
The directors-general agreed to strive to harmonize and
streamline clearance procedures in line with the standard of the
World Customs Organization (WCO), the News Agency of Nigeria
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The delegates urged WCO to assist in organizing seminars and
workshops for members to master the valuation system of the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"The successful take-off of the WTO/WCO valuation in the
region can be further achieved through regional cooperation and
bilateral agreements," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is to ensure that regional interest are taken
into consideration in forging policies for the 21st century," it
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, customs administrations in the
west and central African region should articulate their positions
as a homogeneous group rather than "a linguistic enclave".
</P>
<P>
On technical assistance, the customs chiefs claimed that the
region was not benefiting enough from technical assistance
program of WCO, adding that it had been militating against the
implementation of several conventions.
</P>
<P>
They also resolved to strengthen cooperation with WCO on
checking fraud and other transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
The conference, held in the Nigerian capital Abuja, was
attended by delegates from Angola, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire,
Equatorial Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Overfishes Pacific Salmon: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. refusal to honor the
Pacific Salmon Treaty is costing Canadian fishermen at least 60
million dollars (42 million U.S. dollars) a year, said Canadian
Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. overfishing undermined Canadian efforts to save the
salmon from extinction, the minister was quoted by Thursday's
Globe and Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Americans are taking more of our fish than we are taking of
theirs, and the trend is upward," Anderson said in a speech on the
eve of a long-delayed resumption of talks on salmon quotas.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa and Washington announced Tuesday that the talks will
begin at the end of this month, three months after two special
envoys urged immediate return to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The envoys also asked the Alaskan fishermen to reduce their
interception of Canadian-bound fish in the North Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1985 treaty, neither country is supposed to take more
fish from the ocean than the number that originates in their
waters.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Alaskan interceptions of fish returning to Canadian rivers
last year reached an unprecedented peak, even while Canada was
cutting its own catch to save them from extinction, Anderson
noted.
</P>
<P>
In the south, Canada has also cut its interception of fish
swimming into U.S. waters off Washington state, and helped that
state's conservation programs, he added.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Turkish Proposals for Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Thursday rejected the
Turkish proposals for unconditional dialogue on all outstanding
issues between the two countries, saying that Ankara was unable to
see the road which leads to the restoration of transquility in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Turkish proposals which was handed to the
Greek ambassador in Ankara early Wednesday, acting Greek
government spokesman Nikos Athanasakis blamed Turkey for creating
all tension in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis also rejected Wednesday the
Turkish proposals including an invitation to Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos to visit Ankara, saying that the
proposals, as others in the past, aimed at creating impressions
rather than dealing with the substance of issues.
</P>
<P>
Athens needed a reply from the Turkish side to its positions on
a step-to-step approach, on how the problem of delineation of the
continental shelf in the Aegean was resolved, he said, adding that
if this was done, the two neighboring countries could enjoy good
relations.
</P>
<P>
Greek-Turkish relations have been strained over decades for
territorial waters, air space rights and the delineation of
continental shelf in the Aegean and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Currently, both countries have voiced their willingness to
better bilateral ties, but no substantial progress has been made.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Iraqi Oil Experts Start First Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Oil experts from the United
Nations and Iraq held first round of talks here Thursday evening
to assess Iraq's capacity to produce and export crude oil under
an enhanced oil-for-food deal, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Head of the U.N. experts team, Britain's Charles Graham and
General Director for Studying and Planning Department of Iraqi Oil
Ministry Falih al-Kahyatt co-chaired the talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, which comprises British, Dutch and Jordanian
experts in construction engineering, measurements and navigation,
arrived here Thursday afternoon. The team also includes one
Russian and one Frenchman -- two oil overseers working with United
Nations' Iraq program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on February 20 adopted resolution
1153 to more than double the amount of oil Iraq is allowed to sell
in six months to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars under the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials informed the secretary-general during his visit
to Baghdad last month that for the time being, Iraq cannot export
more than 4 billion dollars worth of oil under the deal due to the
shortages of essential spare parts and the decline in oil prices
in world market.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, hit hard by the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions imposed
after its invasion of Kuwait, asked the U.N. to allow it to import
equipment and spare parts to repair its industry and pipelines.

<HEADLINE> AL Voices Support to Arab Resistance to Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid Thursday defended the Arab resistance to Israeli
occupation of their land as fully legitimate, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The continued occupation of Lebanese and other Arab land will
only whet Arab resistance to that occupation. Such resistance was
invested with full legitimacy while that occupation lacked any,"
said Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
The AL secretary general was speaking to reporters on the
occasion of the 20th anniversary of Israel's invasion of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the recent Israeli initiative on pulling out
from south Lebanon as a ploy to circumvent U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425 which calls for an immediate and unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced that it is seeking bilateral negotiations
on an Israeli pullout from south Lebanon if Beirut guarantees the
security of Israel's northern territories. Lebanon has rejected
Israel's offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim to protect its northern areas
from cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said Israel's goal was to separate the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks in peace talks with Israel, which have been
deadlocked for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, have held
sporadic peace talks since 1991. But the negotiations, which broke
off in early 1996, stalled over the fate of Golan Heights,
captured by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
"Despite that the 1978 resolution (Resolution 425) orders its
immediate pullout from Lebanon, Israel continues to procrastinate
over implementing U.N. resolutions and continues with its almost
daily attacks on Lebanese territory and civilians," Abdul-Meguid
said.

LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Thursday, with Frankfurt closing slightly higher and
London and Paris retreating from Wednesday's record closing highs
and finishing the session in the negative grounds.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 ended at 5,794.80, down 35.0 points or 0.60
percent after a five-session rally in a row, depressed by the
Dow's losses and by a strong pound which knocked the market back.

Falls in the Far East affected some issues, although many

German shares on the Frankfurt market, which closes before Wall

<HEADLINE> Canadian Air Force Pilots Flee to Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Canadian air force pilots are
fleeing in droves to high-payed private airlines and the military
hopes bonuses as much as 75,000 dollars will stop the pilot drain.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Thursday that about 300 pilots have left air force
squadrons, attracted by wages in the private sector that can be
more than double what they earn in the service.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 155 pilots left the military and the system produced
only 65 to replace them, according to Colonel Joseph Hincke,
director of air personnel for air staff headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
As a result, "we have slowed some operations down. We still do
operations, but we recognize that all the resources aren't there,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent study showed that at junior levels the military pilots
make similar wages to civilian trainees of about 30,000 (21,000
USD) a year.
</P>
<P>
But the military fliers' salaries hit a peak of about 65,000
dollars while airlines are paying as much as 125,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pilots are choosing to leave the service at the age
of 32 or 33 years, after they have been fully trained and worked
in the forces for about 10 years, Hincke said.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, they have had enough of being constantly
transferred and are concerned about the quality of life for their
families, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government is "responding to the reality of the
marketplace" with the proposed payments to air force pilots,
Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Turkey Discuss Deadlocked Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special coordinator for
Cyprus, Thomas Miller said Thursday that he had "very
constructive" contacts with the Turkish officials on the Cyprus
issue, according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who arrived here late Wednesday, has met with Turkish
State Minister for Europe and Cyprus Sukru Sina Gurel.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Cyprus is not static. My mission is to
bridge the differences and help the parties to find opportunities
which sometimes are not very visible," he told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the circumstances an realistic attitude
will make the Turkish and Cypriots reach consensus on some
disputed issues.
</P>
<P>
Commenting the latest development of the island state, Miller
admitted that he is pessimistic about an imminent solution to
this thorny problem.
</P>
<P>
The self-declared parliament of the Turkish Cypriot community
in the north has announced the recognition of the so-called
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" a precondition for talks
with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot-dominated government, however, rebuffed this,
saying that its talks with the Turkish Cypriots would be of
bicommuncal nature.
</P>
<P>
Asked when U.S. presidential envoy for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke will visit the region, Miller said that this will
depend on the development of the situation on the island.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gurel said that his meeting with Miller was
aimed at exchanging views over the current situation of Cyprus,
adding he does not expect a concrete result.
</P>
<P>
Miller had visited Cyprus and Greece before he arrived here for
contacts with Turkish officials on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official had asked to meet Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz and Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, but the
request was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when the Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of it in a wake of
an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The small island state has remained divided despite years of
backbreaking efforts by the United Nations and international
community to strive for a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash sent a
letter to Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides calling for the
establishment of a new Cyprus. But it met a cold response
from the Cypriot government.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Has to Appear in Court: Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela would have to testify in court next Thursday on
his appointment of a commission of inquiry, the Pretoria High
Court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a brief judgement, Justice W de Villiers, the
judge, said that the president has to appear in court for the
South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) case, because it was a
matter of overwhelming public interest.
</P>
<P>
Mandela failed to appear in court last Monday as ordered by
the court to give evidence on the appointment of a commission to
investigate the affairs of Sarfu.
</P>
<P>
Sarfu is seeking a court order to declare Mandela's
appointment of the Browde Commission unlawful. It said that
Mandela did not apply his own judgement when appointing it.
</P>
<P>
The judge said he had paid particular attention to the
president's position as the head of state, but he decided it was
not in the interest of justice to revoke his order.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's lawyers applied Monday for the withdrawal of the
court order, saying the president's ability to exercise his
constitutional duties would be hampered if he is subjected to
cross-examination on evidence on every executive decision.
</P>
<P>
The president's office replied to Thursday's ruling by saying
that Mandela was quite happy to appear in the Pretoria High Court
next week.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional experts said if Mandela takes the stand to
testify next week, it would set a tricky precedent through which
executive decisions of the government could become subjects of
lengthy litigation.

Over the past few days, the media have released a host of
reports on how the central leading officials show solicitude
for the people.
</P>
<P>
As the NPC session entered the second stage, related issues,
such as anti-corruption, public security and the development of
cultural and ethic progress, have become the focus of attention by
NPC deputies and members.
</P>
<P>
When approving of the achievements made by the government,
judicial departments and law-enforcing organs in their endeavor to
combat corruption and crimes, deputies and members have voiced the
hope that more effective measures should be adopted to create
still better conditions for the reform, opening up and
modernization, as well as a better working and living environment
for the public.
</P>

Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members have criticized some local
officials' false practices, with some CPPCC members advocating the
that related problems be dealt with by law.
</P>
<P>
Among the moves, proposals, and suggestions put forth by
deputies and members, many are on issues with which people are generally
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Attending a panel discussion earlier, Tian Jiyun, secretary
general of the current NPC session, demanded that the deputies
report truthfully on the feelings and aspirations of the people
and the criticisms and suggestions they set forth on the work of
governments at all levels.

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP Fell in October-December 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product
(GDP) in the October-December period of 1997 dropped 0.2 percent
from the previous quarter, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drop amounted to the equivalent of an annual fall of 0.7
percent, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
The fall, which follows a 2.8 percent decrease in the
April-June quarter and a 0.8 percent growth in the July-September
period, prompted a pessimistic view that the Japanese economy in
fiscal 1997 may show the first decrease in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it appears difficult for Japan to achieve the
government's economic growth target of 0.1 percent in fiscal 1997,
which ends this month.
</P>
<P>
Japan's GDP may trend downwards for the first time since fiscal
1974, when the GDP fell 0.5 percent, the agency said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The EPA Vice-Minister, Shimpei Nukaya, attributed the
October-December economic drop to a serious decline in personal
consumption and housing investment.
</P>
<P>
Japan's real GDP came to an annualized 482.4 trillion yen
(about 3,768.8 billion U.S. dollars) in the October-December
period, preliminarily, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand reduced the nation's GDP growth by a negative
0.8 percentage point, while external demand pushed it up by 0.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Personal consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of
the GDP aggregate, declined 0.9 percent from the previous quarter,
due partly to decreases in food and clothing consumption, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment also decreased 4.2 percent from the previous
quarter, posting the fourth straight quarterly drop, and public
investment fell 1.8 percent, the first decline since the first
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corporate capital spending, another engine of the
economy, rose 0.6 percent, following a 1.1 percent growth in the
previous term.
</P>
<P>
As for calendar 1997, external demand boosted Japan's GDP by
1.4 percent, while domestic demand reduced it by 0.5 percent, the
agency said. This was the first negative figure for domestic
demand in 23 years.

<HEADLINE> China's Vice-Minister Of Foreign Trade Says Exports Will Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The current financial turmoil in
Asia has had a limited impact on China's exports and the country
is confident of maintaining steady growth in exports, China's Vice
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister, Shi Guangsheng, made the remark today at the
East China Export Commodity Fair in Shanghai. The event has been
held annually from March 5-14 since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian countries have seen shrinking market demand
because of the crisis, but they only account for eight percent of
China's trade, and there is still strong market demand in European
countries and the United States, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade will have both challenges and
opportunities in 1998, he said. Emphasis must be placed on making
deals, and Chinese exporters have already been speeding up reforms.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's exports and imports were worth 325 billion US
dollars, and in 1998, the country plans to do 345 billion US
dollars worth of trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Business at the present East China fair is expected to be down
10-15 percent because the number of participants from Indonesia
and the Republic of Korea has declined drastically, Shi said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top advisory
body urge government departments and their staff to commit
themselves to building a clean and honest government and their
battle against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have showed great
concern on the spread of corruptive practices in some areas and
departments, while voicing their appreciations of the progress

The members held that the key to the success of the drive is
effective control over political power since the abuse of power
give rise to corruption.

Huang Weimin, vice-chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee
of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, urged
that the role of non-communist parties in democratic supervision
over governments and law enforcement should further be enhanced,
so should be the education among leading officials to improve
their ideological and legal awareness. He added the supervision
should also come from the media.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, a proposal on the
establishment of an anti-corruption body within the Supreme
People's Procuratorate were carried out. And anti-corruption
bodies have been set up within procuratorates at all levels, which are
playing a vital role in combating against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Morover, Huang Weimin suggested that anti-corruption
regulations be enacted and issued as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a large sense, the success of the anti-corruption drive will
hinges on the awareness, support and participation of the masses
of people, noted Liu Ying, deputy director of the supervision
department of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Li Lijun, deputy director of the supervision department of
Hunan province, advocated that tours overseas by officials on
public expenses should be controlled by a single department in a
a bid to stop the loopholes in the miseuse of public funds.

<HEADLINE> British Fund Eyes China's B-Share Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The China Index Fund, which was
started by the Commercial Union of Britain two month ago and was
the first index fund on China's B-share market, has raised 15
million US dollars on China's two bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The news comes from Nicholas Baring, president of the British
company, who spoke at a seminar on the fund held in Shanghai
today. He told the gathering that many fund managers have been
worried about investing in Asia, but his company is confident of
China's development prospects and that a stable and prosperous
China will contribute to the recovery of other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The fund tries to introduce overseas capital to aid China's
development and will provide a wide-range of opportunities for
foreign investors who are unfamiliar with China's stock market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Index funds appeared in the United States in the early '60s and
are now popular in many Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The China Index Fund started with 13 million US dollars in
capital and raises capital from Britain and elsewhere with the
assistance of Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia), Indosuez
W.I. Carr Securities, Newton Securities, and Shenyin Wanguo
Securities (Hong Kong).

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's TRC Asks Court to Overturn ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has asked the Cape Town High
Court to overturn the blanket amnesty granted to 37 top African
National Congress (ANC) officials.
</P>
<P>
TRC Deputy Chairman Alex Boraine said Friday that the truth
body is in the process of filing an application to ask the court
to direct the Amnesty Committee to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
The Amnesty Committee last November granted blanket amnesty to
37 senior ANC officials, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Other members given amnesty include Defense Minister Joe
Modise, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, Justice Minister Dullah
Omar, Transport Minister Mac Maharaj, Tourism Minister Pallo
Jordan and ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu said in the court papers that the
amnesty decision was invalid by virtue of at least four
irregularities, including that the amnesty was not for identified
acts.
</P>
<P>
Boraine said the TRC hoped the National Party (NP) would
withdraw its own court application to have the amnesty declared
invalid.
</P>
<P>
The NP, the largest opposition party in the country, Thursday
launched an application in the Cape Town High Court to "review
and set aside, alternatively correct" the granting of the blanket
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
The NP said ANC officials were given preferential treatments
and the amnesty was granted without going through the same
procedure as non-ANC members who sought amnesty. For example, the
ANC members' wrong doings were not disclosed, which is required
by normal procedure.

<HEADLINE> French Plane Repair Company Expects Closer Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Messier-Bugatti, a plane parts
production and repair company of France, wishes to reinforce
cooperation with China in technological service and personnel
training, said the company's president Yves Leclere on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leclere said at a press conference that since establishing a
bureau in Beijing in 1997, Messier-Bugatti has been doing very
well in China by providing services in repairing Airbus and Boeing
planes, bought by China in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
Messier-Bugatti, which is also one of the world's three largest
producers of wheels and airbrakes, braking systems, landing
systems and hydraulics used on Airbus and Boeing planes, plans to
establish a permanent service for technical support and
distribution of spare parts for the Airbus planes in China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Leclere expected the next five years to be full of "economic
wars in plane service industries," and said that his company will
be ready to offer "total and guaranteed service," especially in
repairing and renewing braking systems and landing systems of
planes.
</P>
<P>
Messier-Bugatti has an annual sales volume of 1.614 billion
francs (270 million U.S. dollars) and spends 147 million francs
(24.5 million U.S. dollars) in research projects each year.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing: A Year of Good Progress Since Being Raised in Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing has made fairly rapid
progresses in economic development and infrastructure construction
since it became a centrally-administered municipality a year ago,
according to deputies from the city, who are here attending the
annual session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of its GNP last year reached 11.5 percent,
compared with the national average of 8.8 percent, and the average
income of local urban residents was about 5,320 yuan, 160 yuan
more than the nation's average, the deputies said.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, farmers' average net income last year, still
below the national average, increased by 14.5 percent over the
previous year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Development conditions of Chongqing are relatively poor
compared with those of the country's other three
centrally-administered municipalities, but local people have been
encouraged to make greater efforts to build Chongqing into a new,
beautiful city, they said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of business people and travelers from other
parts of the country and from abroad who came to Chongqing to make
investment or for sight-seeing last year reached 17.25 million,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign banks, including those from Japan and Canada, have
set up branches in the city last year, and it approved 230 new
foreign-funded enterprises and actually used foreign funds
totaling 940 million US dollars during the year.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has started to build three high-grade highways and is
prepared to build another five. And five new bridges have been
built across the Yangtze River, they said.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing faces severe challenges in the future. It has to
resettle about one billion people affected by the ongoing Three
Gorges Project and help more than 3.66 million poor farmers shake
off poverty, they said.
</P>
<P>
To invigorate state-owned enterprises suffering from losses and
help 400,000 laid-off workers is another hard task for the city in
the coming years, they said.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders and deputies from the grass-roots units expressed
determination to work hard so that Chongqing will achieve greater
progresses in years to come.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, accompanied by United States Vice President AL Gore,
toured Silicon Valley in northern California Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visit was part of the 10th semi-annual meeting of the
so-called Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which was created five
years ago to improve U.S.-Russian ties.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders first visited the Lockheed Martin Missiles &AMP;
Space organization which has forged alliances with Russian
counterparts to develop state-of-art telecommunications satellites.
</P>
<P>
Gore noted at Lockheed that the commercial space industry was a
growing, 60 billion U.S. dollars a year business.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States were positioned to claim a lion's
share in the expanding market via cooperation, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Lockheed Martin, Boeing has launched a joint venture
with several Russian companies to create a sea-based satellite
launch facility.
</P>
<P>
After leaving Lockheed, the two leaders went to San Jose State
University where they co-chaired a U.S. West Coast-Russian Far
East regional cooperation meeting with a broad economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told the gathering of government officials and
business leaders that Russia is an enormous emerging market with
vast, untapped resources, and is eager to do business.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Chernomyrdin then went to the headquaters of San
Jose's Cisco Systems, where Chernomyrdin got a closed-door
briefing by business executives on how to develop a high-tech
economy.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had several meetings in Washington on Wednesday
before heading to Silicon Valley.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen bodies have been
recovered from a massive landslide Friday at Reshian in Leepa
Valley, about 50 kilometers from Muzaffarabad, capital of
Pakistan-controlled Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Friday evening from Muzaffarabad said
that at least 30 people were feared dead and many others injured
as a result of the landslide.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are underway to search the other victims by the local
administration in collaboration with army personnel.
</P>
<P>
Torrent mud and rocks triggered by a landslide caused 30 houses
to cave in, leaving at least 30 people dead including 10 women,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The landslide occurred as a result of torrential rains,
dislodging a massive piece of land to bury a large part of the
village, causing loss to both lives and property.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been removed to the nearest hospitals for
first aid. A large number of local residents are also assisting in
the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have called upon the federal government
for an immediate dispatch of relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of loss of lives and property are difficult at this
stage but it is feared the casualties could go much higher.

<HEADLINE> People's Immediate Interests Focus of NPC, CPPCC Sessions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The people's immediate interests
have been focused at the ongoing annual sessions of China's top
legislature and advisory body, when the economic system, and
social, economic setup are undergoing profound changes.
</P>
<P>
Deputies and members from the central leadership down to the
grassroots units have stressed that close attention should be
attached to the people's feelings and difficulties, which has a
direct impact on the future of China's reform, opening up and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary people's concerns represent hot topics for discussion
at the previous NPC annual sessions and the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
and, the matters involved are more complex at this year's sessions.
</P>
<P>
Although people's overall living standards have kept improving
over recent years, some urbanites and rural residents are still
needy and have a relatively hard time, as new problems crop up in
the course of the economic restructuring that has swept such a
relatively backward country like China.
</P>
<P>
There is an inevitable rise in the number of workers laid off
by state-owned industrial enterprises, where in-depth reform has
entered the most crucial stage. The reform is a new thing anywhere
and the growing unemployment in its wake can hardly be understood
by all workers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, all top leaders have underlined the importance of
the issue, pointing to the fact that it merits special attention
and should be tackled appropriately.
</P>
<P>
Whenever participating in panel discussions of different NPC
delegations, both Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier
Li Peng have call on government institutions at all levels,
enterprises and the the whole society to care for the laid-off
workers and provide them with the basic means to guarantee their
livelihood.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate dropped
0.3 percentage points to 8.6 percent in February, Statistics
Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's employment rose 82,000 in the month, mainly as a
result of a continued increase in Ontario and a rebound in Quebec
following the ice storm.
</P>
<P>
The employment gain builds on the growth of 1997, leaving
employment up 448,000 over the last 12 month, the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In February, full-time employment rose by 84,000, continuing
the surge that began a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the last 12 months, full-time employment has risen 4.2
percent to 472,000, while part-time employment has fallen slightly.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that nearly half of February's employment
increase went to Canadian youths 15 to 24 years of age, the first
major increase in six months.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the youth unemployment rate dropped to 15.5
percent from 16.5 percent in January.

HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
general external trade went down in January from the same month
of last year, the Census and Statistics Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the department's preliminary statistics, the
re-exports decreased by 2.9 percent over a year earlier to 99.1
billion Hong Kong dollars (12.71 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of domestic exports fell by 11 percent to 15.3
billion Hong Kong dollars (1.96 billion U.S. dollars), while that
of imports decreased by 14 percent to 113.2 billion Hong Kong
dollars (14.51 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts here attributed the fall in Hong Kong's external trade
mainly to the recent financial turmoil sweeping almost all major
economies in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, the department also said the external trade figures
usually display greater volatility in the first two months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year decline in the value of both exports and
imports in January 1998 were likely to have been caused by the
different timing of the Lunar New Year holidays in 1997 and 1998,
it said, adding that it should be more meaningful to make
comparisons based on figures for January and February 1998
combined, when the figures for February are available towards the
end of this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
issued a statement Friday expressing incomprehension and worry
over Norway's decision to expel two Russian diplomats, and declare
three other Russians persona non grata.
</P>
<P>
The ITAR-TASS news agency said the statement declared that
Oslo's decision ran counter to the principle of mutual
understanding and constructive cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia felt gravely sorry that Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik postponed his planned visit to Moscow because of
the incident, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Moscow reserved the right to take measures over Norwegian
diplomats in Russia in response, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Norway accused the two Russian diplomats -- Russian embassy
attache Valery Kotsharev and advisor Yevgeny Serebriakov -- and
three former Russian diplomats of attempting, "for several years,"
to recruit Norwegians to work for Russian intelligence services.

<HEADLINE> HK's Medium-of-Instruction Policy Remains Unchanged: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The medium-of-instruction
policy of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) remains unchanged, a senior official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Secretary for Education and
Manpower Joseph W. P. Wong reiterated the need to promote
mother-tongue teaching to enhance students' cognitive development
and learning ability.
</P>
<P>
The government has accepted the findings of the independent
Appeal Committee on appeals cases relating to the use of English
as a medium of instruction (MOI) in a number of secondary schools
from the 1998-1999 school year onwards, according to Wong.
</P>
<P>
The committee has found that of the 20 appealing schools, 14
should be allowed to continue using English as the medium of
learning, while for the other six schools, Chinese would be their
most effective MOI.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the government's MOI policy remained unchanged,
Wong outlined the objectives of the policy:
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen the teaching and learning of Chinese and
English to enable students to be biliterate and trilingual (or be
conversant with written Chinese and English and be able to speak
fluent Cantonese, Putonghua and English);
</P>
<P>
-- To promote mother-tongue teaching to enhance students'
cognitive development and learning ability;
</P>
<P>
-- To discourage the use of mixed code (or a mixture of Chinese
and English, in teaching and learning).
</P>
<P>
An appropriate medium of instruction is crucial to a student's
effective learning, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out: "Research worldwide and in Hong Kong has shown
that students generally learn better through their mother-tongue.
They will be able to understand better what is taught, analyze
problems, express views, develop an inquisitive mind and cultivate
critical thinking."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Quality Education Fund of the SAR
planned to set up a quality school award scheme to promote
excellence in various domains of education, with a view to
nurturing students with all-round abilities.

<HEADLINE> New Railway a Boon for Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Resources-rich but less-developed
southwest China will be an attractive area for foreign investment
with the opening to traffic of the Nanning-Kunming Railway that
links Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan in southern and southwestern
China, according to deputies to the National People's Congress, in
session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
Numberous production bases and projects involving grain, coal,
aluminium, building materials and fruit are being built in
southwest China and the Beibu Gulf area in Guangxi -- all to be
served by the Nanning-Kunming Railway, according to the deputies.
</P>
<P>
Cen Hongping, secretary of Beihai Municipal Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), said that his city has signed
30-plus contracts with investors from the United States, Australia
and some other countries and regions, involving a total investment
of 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A US-funded project, costing 900 million yuan, has started
trial operation. Work on the terminal building at Beihai Airport
invested by Siemens Co. of Germany will begin next month, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The port city of Qinzhou had 13 projects involving foreign
investment in the latter half of 1997 with a total investment of
625 million yuan, said Qinzhou acting mayor Yang Caishou, an NPC
deputy.
</P>
<P>
An aluminium production base, believed to be the largest of its
kind in China, is being built in Guangxi with advanced technology
imported from 17 countries.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China is rich in 28 mineral resources such as coal,
iron, tin and zinc. The Nanning-Kunming Railway has a designed
annual hauling capacity of 20 million tons, outstripping the
combined marine transport capacity of Beihai, Qinzhou and
Fangcheng ports by 11 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Confident About Future of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac on
Friday expressed confidence in the future of Hong Kong under the
"one country, two systems" policy when meeting Tung Chee-hwa,
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting at the Elysee presidential palace,
Chirac described the relations between France and the HKSAR as
"excellent," against a background of overall good relations
between France and China, said sources at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The close relations between France and the HKSAR were also
important because of the "absolute necessity to reinforce the
Euro-Asia relations," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his appreciation to Chirac for his support, and
said Hong Kong will not abandon the currency board which pegs the
Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The stability of both the Chinese yuan (Renminbi) and the Hong
Kong dollar is very important for financial stability in Asia,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac agreed with Tung that "Asia has all the trumps to face
up to the financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
Tung invited Chirac to visit Hong Kong at a time of his
convenience.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he had planned to visit Hong Kong in May 1997, but
had to abandon the plan because of an early legislative election
at home.
</P>
<P>
Tung ended his three-day visit to France on later Friday and
left here for home.

<HEADLINE> Poorest Region Expects to Shake Off Poverty by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Xihaigu, the poorest area in the
under-developed northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
expects to shake off poverty by the end of the century, according
to a regional leader.
</P>
<P>
"We will use every means possible to shake off poverty in
Xihaigu and I can assure you that it will not drag down the
country's poverty-reducing progress," said Ma Qizhi, chairman of
the regional government at a news conference hosed here today by
the on-going session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Inhabited by 2.2 million Muslims, Xihaigu is known as the
hardest nut to crack in China's poverty elimination program due to
its extremely harsh environment and chronic drought.
</P>
<P>
Despite a drop in poor population in the area over recent
years, it still has some 520,000 people who can barely feed and
clothe themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, great efforts will be made to improve basic
farming and living conditions in poverty-stricken areas. A water
diverting project, funded by the central government, has been
diverting water from the Yellow River to the arid land in Xihaigu.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, about 30,000 hectares of waste land will be
turned into erable land where the last group of the poor people in
mountainous areas will be relocated, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma revealed the central government allocates some 30 million
yuan in poverty relieving funds each year to the region. The water
diversion project cost a total of 3 billion yuan.

MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian markets fell slightly on
Friday after reports that President Boris Yeltsin was undergoing
medical treatment for an acute respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, canceled his meetings Friday and was undergoing
treatment at his Gorky-9 residence after doctors said he was
suffering from an acute respiratory infection, the Interfax news

saying.
</P>

Russian blue chips dropped by two percent following the news of
Yeltsin's ailment.

<P>
The Russian Trading System said that within the first half hour
of Friday's trading, its own index fell by 1.9 percent from
Thursday closing, and its technical index was down by 1.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
A senior trader said the index started falling as soon as
traders heard the news.
</P>
<P>
Another trader said the news of Yeltsin's illness had a far
bigger impact on the markets than the interest cut by the Central
Bank of Russia.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party to Consider Staking Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Congress party leader Sitaram
Kesri called on President K. R. Narayanan Friday night and told
him that his party would consider staking claim to form government
after consultations with party leaders, its allies and other
parties including the United Front.
</P>
<P>
The process of consultation was already on and until the party
was completely ready it would not stake its claim, he told newsmen
after his 30-minute meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prime ministerial candidate A.
B. Vajpayee called on the president Thursday and furnished to him
a letter with documents showing the support of 240 out of the 539
elected MPs in the Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"While the process of consultation with the BJP will continue,
the president will also hold discussions with leaders of other
political formations such as the Congress and the United Front,"
said a presidency communique issued here Thursday evening after
the meeting between the president and Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
In his Tuesday letter to Vajpayee, whose party emerged the
largest political party in the just concluded general elections,
the president asked him whether he was able and willing to form a
stable government. Vajpayee gave a positive response.
</P>
<P>
Then the president asked him to furnish documents supporting
his claim to form the next government, he promised to do so the
next day.
</P>
<P>
Yet Vajpayee could only get the support of 240 MPs instead of
252 as he said earlier after failing to receive support from its
allies in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the United Front are also expected to call on the
president Friday evening on the formation of the government as the
president has invited leaders of Congress, the United Front and
Left parties for consultations separately Friday evening following
the BJP furnishing documents claiming support of only 249 MPs
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The impasse in government formation created by the delay of the
BJP's Tamil Nadu allies in handing over their letters of support
to the BJP continued Friday.
</P>
<P>
BJP Secretary General Venkaiah Naidu said Friday evening that
the BJP and its allies would review the latest situation Saturday.
The BJP, being the largest bloc in Parliament, should form the
government otherwise the country would have to go for another
election, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today stressed the importance of continuing to develop agriculture
as the country's economic base at a group discussion attended by
Henan deputies to the National People's Congress, in session here
since early March.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged Henan, China's most popular province and a leading
grain producer, to deepen reforms, expand the scope of opening and
accelerate economic development, thus making greater contributions
to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang focused on agriculture at the discussion.
</P>
<P>
"We should unswervingly adhere to the principle of taking
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned people not to slacken work in the wake of good
grain harvests for several consecutive years to prevent a decline
in grain production.
</P>
<P>
"We can't say, at any time, that there is too much grain and
relax our efforts at grain production," he said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a sustained and steady agricultural development,
rural communities must launch farming-oriented capital
construction projects, and improve production conditions and the
ecological environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to harness rivers by building more water
conservancy projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
In view of worsening water shortages in north China, Li called
on local people to develop water-efficient farming, plant more
grass and trees and control sand encroachment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged leading officials to protect the enthusiasm of
farmers, alleviate their burdens, stabilize the land contract
system and promote democracy in rural areas by setting up
democratic election systems and making public village account
books.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urged Local Governments to Support Institutional Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today urged
local governments across the country to give full support to the
forthcoming institutional restructuring of the State Council,
China's cabinet, and make preparations for their own institutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made these remarks in a panel discussion with deputies
from north China's Hebei Province to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), top Chinese legislature, in session here since
early March.
</P>
<P>
The current NPC session approved the State Council's
institutional restructuring plan last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Government downsizing, which will affect powers of various
departments and personal interests of all officials, is an arduous
task that will have an impact on the overall situation of reform,
development and stability," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
While realizing the necessity and urgency of institutional
restructuring, it is also necessary to make careful arrangements
and take the overall situation into account, to ensure ideological
unity and a good order and consistency of government work, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments at all levels must actively support the
institutional restructuring of the State Council, and be well
prepared to push forward their own institutional reforms according
to the general arrangements of the State Council," he urged.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is very important to improve the
building of democracy and a legal system and maintain social and
political stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to create a stable social and political
environment for reform and development through the promotion of
the rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
A fundamental way to implement the principle of administering
the country according to law is to make greater efforts in
legislation, law enforcement, administration of justice and spread
of legal knowledge, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the public security situation must be
improved through a quick and severe crackdown according to law on
serious crimes harming social and economic order.
</P>
<P>
He also called for intensified efforts to spread legal
knowledge across the country.
</P>
<P>
"I always believe that while it's important to enhance the
legal awareness of the general public, it's more critical to
improve the legal awareness of officials, especially leading
officials, and their ability to do everything in accordance with
law," he noted.

<HEADLINE> China to Guard Financial Crisis with Better Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior legislator said today
that China will strengthen legislation aimed at standardizing
economic activities to guard against financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"China will earnestly draw on the lessons of the financial
disturbance in southeast Asia and guard against financial crisis
through legislation," said Hu Kangsheng, deputy-director of the
Commission of Legislative Affairs under the National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and its Standing Committee have been giving priority to
safeguarding a sound operation of commercial banks and financial
institutions, maintaining financial order and preventing financial
crisis, Hu said at a press conference held during the First
Session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Eighth NPC and its Standing
Committee enacted 118 laws and law-related decisions, the majority
of which are aimed at regulating economic activities.
</P>
<P>
In particular, five key laws and one decision on economic
affairs were enacted in 1995. They are Law on the People's Bank of
China, Law on Commercial Banks, Law on Insurance, Law on
Negotiable Instruments, Guarantee Law and Decision on Punishing
Crimes Disrupting Financial Order.
</P>
<P>
Draft laws on securities and trust are under deliberation in

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province's Environmental Protection Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has begun a "Love Our Common Home" campaign to increase awareness
of the importance of environmental protection, according to Zhang
Hongming, director of the Provincial Environmental Protection
Bureau, who made the announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is one of China's most developed provinces and places
great significance on environmental protection, he said. The
government has made it part of its long-term economic and social
development plan and local governments have been asked to play a
greater role in implementing local environmental protection
programs.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Environmental Protection Project began in June
1994, and Zhejiang has set up 127 smoke and dust control zones on
a 900-sq.km. area, cleaned 148 cement factories, opened a
150-sq.km. low-noise area, established 141 water-source protection
zones, made 104 villages and towns ecologically friendly, and
brought 128 major pollution sources under control.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, the amount of pollutants discharged
has not risen at a rate similar to that of economic growth in the
province, Zhang said, and to improve the environment more, the
province will build a number of model cities and prefectures, so
that by the end of the century, environmental pollution in the
province will be brought under control.

<HEADLINE> HK Closes Another Vietnamese Refugee Departure Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong authorities
closed another Vietnamese refugee departure center Friday, taking
a further step towards the end of the whole Vietnamese boat people
saga, a local government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this was another major step following the closure
of the Kai Tak Vietnamese Migrant Transit Center in March last
year, the Whitehead Vietnamese Migrants Detention Center in June
1997, and the North Camp of the High Island Detention Center in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newly-closed center, or the New Horizons Vietnamese Refugee
 Departure Center, located at Kwun Tong Road, Kowloon, had about
270 Vietnamese illegal immigrants before the closure.
</P>
<P>
They have all been transferred to the Pillar Point Vietnamese
Refugee Center in the "New Territories," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1975, over 200,000 Vietnamese had arrived in Hong Kong,
according to the local authorities. The migrant population reached
a historical peak in October 1991, with over 64,300 Vietnamese
people accommodated in 14 camps in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the continued efforts of all the concerned parties, the
present Vietnamese population in Hong Kong has dropped to about
1,200 Vietnamese refugees, 660 Vietnamese migrants and 980
Vietnamese illegal immigrants, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stated: "The government (of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region) will continue with its efforts to draw the
Vietnamese boat people issue to a complete and satisfactory
conclusion."

<HEADLINE> New Communist Party in Nepal Elects Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The breakaway party from the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) has
elected its leadership and central committee.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) said
here Friday that at its three-day meeting which concluded Friday,
a 35-member central committee has been elected and Sahana Pradhan
elected the new party's chairwoman, while former deputy prime
minister Bam Dev Gautam holds the powerful post of general
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six of the 101 MPs of the CPN-UML registered a new party
called CPN-ML on March 5 at the Parliament Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's law, 40 percent members of a parliamentary party
or the party's central committee can form a new party and get
recognition.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament Secretariat recognized the CPN-ML on March 6 as
a new parliamentary party, and Gautam was unanimously elected its
leader the next day.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Friday, Gautam accused the
CPN-UML of abandoning the People's Multiparty Democracy propounded
by the late general secretary Madan Bhandari.
</P>
<P>
He said investigation into the death of Bhandari should be
continued.
</P>
<P>
Bhandari and his colleague died in May 1993 when the jeep they
were riding fell into a river, but the driver survived. The
accident remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
Gautam said his party can join hands with the Nepali Congress
(NC) on the matter of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The ruling NC now replaces the CPN-UML as the largest party in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Gautam stressed that the Indian army should be removed from
Kalapani in western Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The status of Kalapani is a decades-old issue between Nepal and
India.
</P>
<P>
Gautam also said the Mahakali Integrated Development Treaty
signed between Nepal and India is against the national interest of
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Differences over the Mahakali treaty and other issues between
Gautam and Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the CPN-UML,
led to the split of the party, which came less than two months
after the party held its sixth national congress.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Democratic Party (RPP), the third largest
in the country, is also split. But the Election Commission has not
recognized the splinter group led by former prime minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand as a national party.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official called
for increasing contacts between the Beijing-based Association For
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (Arats) and the Straits
Exchange Foundation (Sef)in Taiwan with a view to narrowing
differences.
</P>
<P>
"Arats and Sef share some views and have some differences over
topics for discussion in future talks, therefore the major task
for the two bodies now is to seek common ground by increasing
contacts and exchanges," said Arats Vice Chairman Tang Shubei.
</P>
<P>
Tang talked about impending talks between Arats and Sef at a
panel discussion yesterday attended by members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, in session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
As to topics for discussion, Tang said, it is the stand of
Arats that arrangements should first be made on procedural matters
relating to ending cross-Strait hostilities and resume economic
and business talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Arats is actively promoting contacts and exchanges with
Sef and hopes the two sides can hold informal talks on topics for
discussion and making arrangements for Sef chairman Koo Chen-fu's
visit to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Tang reiterated that the "one China" principle must be upheld
in handling across-Strait affairs as well as in talks between the
two sides.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not to Yield to EU Pressure: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet Secretary
Danny Naveh indicated Friday that Israel will not cave in to the
pressure from the European Union (EU) to accelerate the peace
talks with the Palestinians and harm its national security
interests.
</P>
<P>
Naveh told Israel Radio that the proposals on the peace
process, which were put forward by the EU Chairman Robin Cook,
are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Cook, Foreign Secretary of the EU rotating presidency country
Britain, declared early this week that the stalled peace talks
require increasing pressure for a positive response from Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed his six-point plan to break the stalemate
in the peace process, which calls Israel to make "substantial,
credible and urgent further redeployment" in the West Bank and
halt "all expansion of settlements."
</P>
<P>
Naveh warned that European officials, who demand a place
for the EU alongside the United States in the process, not
to try to "impose their ideas on Israel", which may compromise
Israel's security interests.
</P>
<P>
However, Naveh agreed that the EU has an important role
to play in advancing the peace process, noting that it could
encourage the Palestinians to reach agreements with Israel on
issues, such as the opening of Gaza airport and Karni
industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
Since Britain held the EU presidency this January, it has
put the first priority of its foreign policy on advancing the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following Cook's visit to six Middle East countries next
week, British Prime Minister Tony Blair will also tour the
region next month.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A study in the city of Shanghai
has found that 85 percent of the parents living there hope their
children will be able to study at university or college.
</P>
<P>
This is in sharp contrast to the 10 percent of parents who said
they'd be happy if their children just made it through secondary

</P>
<P>
Shanghai's Minhang District Education Bureau did the study

graduates of polytechnic schools or universities, and 47 percent
of them had a primary or junior middle school education.
</P>
<P>
Of the 72 percent of the parents who are laborers, farmers, or
clerks, less than 2 percent say they would like their children to
be farmers or laborers, and 78 percent say they would like them to
become scientists or government office workers.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that most parents spend a large amount
of money and expend a great deal of effort to provide better
conditions for their children's studies, and 10 percent have

Strobl, who was third in downhills for twice this season, won
the shortened World Cup finals race with a time of one minute

<HEADLINE> New Silk Road Makes A Smaller World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- For a long time, the Silk Road
meant nothing but a hazy memory of the distant past of commercial
and cultural exchanges between East and West.
</P>
<P>
But, on December 1, 1992, the Silk Road was restored of its
former glory, when a train pulled out of the station at
Lianyungang, a port on the east coast of China, for Rotterdam in
the Netherlands, and for the past five years the Silk Road has
had a new name, the Second Eurasian Continental Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The new 10,900-km land bridge passes through Siberia and snakes
its way across a dozen countries on two continents. And because it
is more significant for China than perhaps for any other country,
the Chinese government has spent billions of yuan on
infrastructure for it.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang, in Jiangsu Province, is being turned into a large
international hub with 25 berths and a yearly capacity of 19.95
million tons of goods, and a plan to add a hundred more, each with
a 10,000-ton or greater capacity to meet future needs.
</P>
<P>
Railways have been improved for the 4,131-km Chinese section of
the new bridge, from Lianyungang to the Altay Pass in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the cargo capacity of the land bridge
has doubled annually, and in 1997, Lianyungang handled 30,016
TEUs. Chinese officials say that goods headed west accounted for
most of the goods shipped over the new land bridge in the first
two years, but now the ratio of east-west and west-east goods is
about 50-50.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Germany, and Hong Kong, have joined a

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A high-level delegation of the Serbian government, carrying
proposals of dialogue with ethnic Albanians, arrived Thursday in
Pristina, capital of Kosovo, without being able to meet political
representatives of the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac Thursday threatened to block
the process of admitting Cyprus by the European Union, if only the
northern Greek Cyprus is accepted by the EU. "The European Union
does not have the right to take a piece of Cyprus and thus
integrate a conflict which is not its own," said Chirac at the
European Conference held in London. Meanwhile, Turkey has accused
the EU of creating a new Yalta structure by dividing the Muslim
world from the Christian world in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The opposition Rally for the Republic and Union for French
Democracy will have a close fight with the Socialist Party in the
Paris region, or Il-de-France, and the southern
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, where the big cities of Marseille and
Nice are located. In both of the two regions, the shifting of
the votes for the far-right National Front will be decisive for
winning the presidency of regional parliaments on March 15.
</P>
<P>
-- The crisis in Kosovo dominated the agenda of the first
meeting of the European Conference held in London on Thursday,
which gathered the "great European family" from 15 EU countries
and 11 candidate countries for EU membership. The 26 countries
condemned "with great vehemence" the resort to "excessive force"
by the government of Belgrade against ethnic Albanians, and called
for an upgrading of the statute for Kosovo within the Yugoslav
federation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Relevant returning officers in
Hong Kong began to accept candidates nomination on Friday for the
Election Committee subsector elections to be held on April 2.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Legislative Council elections will include the
subsector elections, which will return a total of 683 members of
the Election Committee, and the general election of the
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) on May 24.
</P>
<P>
These 683 members, together with the ex-officio members
including Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress
and Provisional Legislative Council members, as well as religious
subsector, will form an 800-strong Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the government guidelines on election-related
activities in respect of the 1998 Legislative Council elections, a
candidate of an Election Committee subsector must be subscribed by
not less than five registered voters and each voter may only
subscribe as many nominations regarding a particular subsector as
10.
</P>
<P>
Nomination forms must be handed in to the relevant returning
officer in person during the nomination period which will last up
to March 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the Basic Law, the SAR's first Legislative Council shall

On Friday, the SAR government also published the 1998 final
registers of voters and electors for the Election Committee
subsector elections and the Legislative Council election.
</P>
<P>
The geographical constituencies' register shows that the size
of the electorate now stands at 2.795 million, which represents an
increase of 264,000 from 2.531 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"That means about 70 percent of the potential electors may go
to the polls on May 24," a spokesman for the Registration and
Electoral Office said.
</P>
<P>
The electorate of the 28 functional constituencies totals
138,984, representing about 60 percent of the potential electors.

<HEADLINE> b u p 2553 China-NPC-Scientific Innovation Innovations of Science, Technology Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists today called
for taking effective measures to encourage innovations in science
and technology to ensure a steady growth of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Weak competitiveness in science and technology constitutes a
potential risk for China's economic development in the coming
century," said Wang Xuan, an academician from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) and a deputy to the Ninth National People's
Congress, in session here since early March.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also inventor of the Chinese-character computerized
typesetting system which is widely used around the world, said
that, according to a latest report released by the CAS, China's
competitiveness in science and technology has declined for three
years running.
</P>
<P>
At present, national total investment in research and
development only accounts for 0.5 percent of the country's GNP,
Wang said, adding that, in terms of patents filed and progresses
made in basic sciences, China lags behind many other countries.
</P>
<P>
China's high-tech sector contributes to less than 10 percent of
the country's economic growth, compared with 50 percent or so in
developed countries, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient input in science and technology, as well as
problems in the old science management system, are impeding
scientific progress in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the nation's high-tech sector has developed can it
meet challenges of the next century," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangliang, vice-president of Beijing University and also
an NPC deputy, said that China has numerous scientific
institutions, which do not produce many research results, nor have
many of such results commercialized. "This is closely related to
the existing science management system," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Luo Yifeng, an expert in high-tech fibers, noted that China has
to be ready for challenges from a fast developing information
economy, in which any economic increases will rely on innovations
and accumulations of knowledge
</P>
<P>
"Chinese enterprises should set up their own information
system, and research institutions should provide them with
innovations," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is already paying close attention to the
issue, and various measures are being taken, Luo said, quoting
Premier Li Peng as saying that special attention will be paid to
quickening the development of the high-tech industry and promoting
the integration of science and technology with economic
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing weekly air quality report
showed an improvement last week, with pollution levels falling
from medium to slight.
</P>
<P>
The city's air pollution index for the period between March
6-12 stood at 188, a ranking indicative of a slight pollution
level.
</P>
<P>
However, the report indicated lingering major pollutants such
as nitrogen and oxygen compounds.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has released its weekly air quality report since
February 28 to inform residents of environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
The first report indicated a level of 206 with the second
report showing a slight drop to 203, figures indicating medium
pollution.
</P>
<P>
China's National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA)
classifies air quality in five grades, with an index of under 50
representing good environmental conditions. Relatively good
conditions fall between 50-100; slight levels between 101-200,
medium levels between 201-300 and serious pollution over 300.
</P>
<P>
"The use of coal and motor vehicle emissions are the major
factors causing pollution in Beijing," according to Zhao Yixin,
director of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The city ranks first on the list of world capitals with an
annual coal consumption of 28 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, statistics show that the city has over 1.2 million
motor vehicles, up three-fold on only ten years ago.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Inspects Barracks in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni inspected barracks in the northern city of Gulu on
Thursday, The Monitor reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The President chaired a meeting on his arrival on Thursday
evening during which officers there reported to him about the
security situation in the region, the report said. But it did not
reveal any detail of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Museveni's inspection tour to the north took place ten days
before the visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States has asked Uganda to hold talks on the
rebellion in the north. But Uganda noted that the rebels of LRA
have no desire for a political solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The President's inspection to the north is seen as a signal of
a possible mop-up operation by Uganda army against the LRA
rebels.
</P>
<P>
A recent report said some of top field commanders of LRA are
tired of rebellion and are conceiving a surrender plan to Ugandan
authorities. But Joseph Kony, the LRA top political leader,
ordered to intensify subversive activities such as kidnapping
civilians to fill the LRA ranks.
</P>
<P>
LRA has some 2,000 members in previous years. But it has now
only hundreds of remnants in its ranks.
</P>
<P>
Gulu is home to the headquarters of the Fourth Division, which
is the main forces of Ugandan Army, responsible for the security
of the north where the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
are haunting.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni was welcomed by Major General Salim Saleh,
the caretaker of the country's Defense Ministry, and Brigadier
Wamala Katumba, the commander of the Fourth Division, among
others.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China is suffering from
abnormally high flood waters in the south while the north battles
a severe drought, said Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Since last October southern China has had more rain than usual,
causing floods in the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu,
Zhejiang, Fujian and Guizhou. These provinces' flood-control
headquarters have been monitoring the situation around the clock
and preparing for an intense period of flood-watching, he said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of northern China, on the other hand, received
20-to-90 percent less moisture, Niu said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, 3.96 million hectares of farmland have
been affected by drought. The lower reaches of the Yellow River
ran dry much earlier than last year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Major Policy Bank Announces Quarterly Lending Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank (SDB),
a major policy-oriented bank, plans to extend loans totalling 12.2
billion yuan (1.47 billion US dollars) during the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Loans totalling 12 billion yuan will go for capital
construction and 200 million yuan for technical upgrading. The
loans will benefit more than 200 projects, including the Shuohuang
Railway (from Shuozhou in north China's Shanxi Province to
Huanghua in neighboring Hebei Province), a new section of the
Beijing Subway System, the Pudong Airport in Shanghai, the Ertan
Power Station and the Wanjiazhai Water Conservancy Project.
</P>
<P>
The government has granted the SDB approval to issue a total of
95 billion yuan in loans during 1998.
</P>
<P>
SDB President Yao Zhenyan said the bank will place priority on
loans to basic industries, infrastructure projects, central and
western regions, projects in new economic growth areas, large
enterprises and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
No loans will be extended to ordinary small projects, luxury
real estate development, commercial projects and projects prone to
inefficiency, according to Yao.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's
central bank, announced the credit quota system for state-owned
commercial banks would be abolished at the beginning of 1998. The
PBOC also replaced mandatory lending plans with guiding
plans.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision does not affect policy-oriented banks,
and related institutions will continue to extend loans in
accordance with mandated government plans.
</P>
<P>
SDB, founded in 1994 to finance the country's major
construction projects, extended loans totalling 107.7 billion yuan
in 1997, with 95.5 percent of related funds going for medium- to
large-sized projects and technical renovations.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Reduces Spindles as Part of Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's fourth
municipality, has joined the nationwide campaign to destroy
spindles as part of the effort to restructure the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Local sources reported that the No.1 Cotton Mill destroyed
obsolete spindles on Thursday to mark the beginning of Chongqing's
effort to revamp its loss-making textile sector.
</P>
<P>
Primary products such as yarn and cloth account for 70 percent
of the city's textile output, with local sources noting that the
city is not a cotton producer. The government plan calls for
Chongqing to eliminate at least 40 percent of some 497,000
obsolete spindles, substantially more than the national average of
25.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry's high asset-to-liability ratio stands at
119 percent, with the vast majority of enterprises in the sector
operating in red. The situation prompted the city government
decision to eliminate 150,000 cotton spindles over the next three
years, with plans calling for the elimination of 133,400 spindles
during 1998.
</P>
<P>
The China Huacheng Group, a profitable venture with total
assets of 22.9 billion yuan, recently signed an agreement to merge
four of the city's cotton mills, including the No.1 Mill.
</P>
<P>
The merger will involve assets totalling 840 million yuan,
156,000 spindles, a work force of 15,000 and 7,300 retirees.
</P>
<P>
China plans to eliminate 10 million spindles and reduce the
industry's work force by some 1.2 million people over the next
three years. Shanghai's ongoing effort has already resulted in the
elimination of over 200,000 spindles.

<HEADLINE> First AIDS Hospital to Be Launched in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A first specialized AIDS
hospital is to be launched in June this year, ''The New Vision''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the hospital, which is still in
construction in Lubowa, some 30 kilometers south of Kampala, will
serve as a referral hospital and training center for nurses and
doctors in palliative care of the HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni first conceived the idea of
launching such a hospital during his visit to Midmay Hospital in
the United Kingdom in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new hospital is to be initially run by the Midmay
specialists before Ugandan Ministry of Health takes it over.
</P>
<P>
Hope Kivengere, the President's press secretary, told the
paper, ''The president is open about the (AIDS) disease and will
discuss with anybody about the ways and means to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
The Midmay experts ''meet the president on regular basis to
exchange ideas and inform him of the work. This project is just a
continuation of his crusade against AIDS,'' the press secretary
added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the countries which have been hit most
seriously by AIDS in the world. An earlier report published last
December said that out of the total population of 21.5 million,
there are two million people carrying the deadly HIV virus.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Has over 40% Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Among every five
Tanzanians, there are two illiterates nowadays, a newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Business Time quoted official statistics as saying that
out of the country's population which stands at about 28 million,
12 million are illiterate, of whom 7 million are girls and women.
</P>
<P>
The report said that as primary education is not compulsory in
Tanzania, about two million children of school-age are not
enrolled, only 15 percent go to secondary school and there is a
high drop-out rate among girls.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a report by the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF)
said that Tanzania is caught in a deep crisis with its education
system which is hardly available to the poor.
</P>
<P>
"All the vital inputs from trained teachers to books, desks
and classrooms are in short supply or are missing altogether and
children's rights to education generally are not being adequately
addressed," the report said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said that enrollment has drooped sharply since 1980
from 93 to 69 percent and education opportunities for girls are
hampered by discrimination of various kinds.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Education Minister Juma Kapuya has said that under a
new five-year program, school enrollment is expected to rise to
85 percent, but education experts argued that such a goal is
unattainable as the whole education system is collapsing.

COLOMBO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Labor Minister W.D.
Senviratne is visiting Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for talks on the
issue of employment for Sri Lankans living in the region, media
sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Senviratne, who left here for a six-day official visit to the
Middle Eastern countries Thursday evening, are holding talks with
his counterparts on problems faced by expatriate Sri Lankans in
the region and trying to find more openings for their employment,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
One of the issues to be discussed at the talks is the new
employment contract, introduced by the Sri Lankan Foreign
Employment Bureau and which is a must for Sri Lankans leaving the
country for employment, Senviratne told the sources before
departure.
</P>
<P>
The new deal has been accepted by many countries, but there are
still some gray areas and doubts mostly in the minds of certain
foreign employment agents, Senviratne said. However, there could
be amendments to suit the needs of individual countries and
adjustments would be made to accommodate the culture and standards
of different countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Warns Public Not to Eat Infected Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bureau of Fisheries and
Aquatic Resources Friday warned the public not to eat a species of
goby fish following reports of fish poisoning incidents in some
southeastern villages in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The fish was found to contain poisonous bacteria and not fit
for human consumption, after recent fish poisoning incidents in
the towns of Javier and Macarthur, Leyte province, which killed 10
people and seriously affected 46 others.
</P>
<P>
The fish poisoning incidents, according to bureau director
Dennis Araullo, occurred as a result of not heeding the moratorium
on the catching, transporting and marketing of the
potentially-poisonous goby fish throughout the country since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of our investigation, we learned that many of
the people in Leyte are still eating the poisonous goby fish,"
Araullo stressed in a memorandum sent to all Department of
Agriculture's regional directors.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's fish health section examined the fish samples and
found the bacteria which the fish contained could cause chronic
diseases.
</P>
<P>
In view of this finding, the Inter-Agency Committee on
Environmental Health warned that this type of fish from the Manila
Bay is also no longer fit for human consumption.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Higher on Interest Rate Sentiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian bond market
continued to rally Friday as market participants priced in the
greater likelihood of an interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
As offshore funds flowed into the debt market, the Australian
dollar tracked higher to close at 67.30 US cents from 66.78 at the
close Friday.
</P>
<P>
Axiom Funds Management senior economist Matthew Drennan said
the Australian dollar was in a very wide trading range at the
moment, "it's probably being pushed up on the fact that there is
some interest in the bonds from offshore, and people are just
buying up the Aussie in terms of that investment."
</P>
<P>
He said while the interest rate argument might have been
expected to push the Australian dollar lower, with offshore
investors taking positions in the domestic fixed interest market,
there was a weight of money argument which would lend support to
the currency, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
"If there was a rate cut in two or three months time, you'd see
the Aussie softer again," he said.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of an interest rate cut by the third quarter of
1998 is now around 27 percent, according to an AAP survey of
financial markets economists.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 86.35 yen from 86.12 yen at
Thursday's close. It was also at 1.2282 marks from 1.2103 marks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Banks Work to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Aware of the vital role exports
played in the economic development and will play in the economic
recovery, the Thai government is racking its brain to find ways to
boost exports especially through the banking system.
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, the central bank changed rules to
encourage commercial banks to lend a hand to exporters, who are
strapped for liquidity because the depreciation of the baht had
raised production and materials costs.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, approved last
Monday a change in capital adequacy requirement in a bid to kindle
greater enthusiasm among commercial banks to support local
exporters.
</P>
<P>
The change reduced the risk weighting of pre-shipment credits
from 100 percent to 20 percent, which means commercial banks could
maintain less capital in managing their loan portfolios.
</P>
<P>
In this way, commercial banks could increase their credit lines
to exporters while gaining more flexibility in maintaining the
capital-to-risk assets ratio within the 8.5 percent minimum.
</P>
<P>
One week later, the central bank proposed to relax the
restrictions for Bangkok international banking facilities (BIBF)
to increase cash available to local exporters.
</P>
<P>
Three changes will be made to alter BIBF operations.
</P>
<P>
First, the central bank is to reduce the minimum loan through
BIBF to exporters to 500,000 U.S. dollars from 2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Second, BIBF is to be allowed to buy unrestricted amounts of
foreign currency-denominated export bills from local firms.
</P>
<P>
Third, BIBF will be allowed to guarantee foreign-currency debt,
including letters of credit, for local clients borrowing from Thai
commercial banks or overseas institutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed to
extend more loans to local exporters.
</P>
<P>
When visiting Thailand last Wednesday, Japanese Vice Finance
Minister Eisuke Sakakibara agreed to extend 600 million dollar
this month to help Thai exporters fund imports of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Beside, a one billion dollar loan from international banks,
brokered by ADB, will support raw material imports and
post-shipment financing for exporters.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, President of the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of
Thailand Pridiyathorn Devakula brought another good news for
exporters, saying an additional 116 billion baht (2.6 billion
dollars) will be gradually injected into the financial system to
relieve the liquidity crunch facing cash-strapped exporters.
</P>
<P>
Besides, several measures have been taken to help exporters.
</P>
<P>
The Exim Bank directly handles three, including a one billion
baht (22 million dollars) structural adjustment loan, a 8.3
billion baht (184 million dollars) baht-denominated packing
credit, and a 13.5 billion baht (300 million dollars) loan from
Japan's Exim Bank, which is part of the loan granted by
Sakakibara.
</P>
<P>
As Exim Bank President Pridiyathorn said, these measures are
expected to give exporters a breathing space while foreign
investor confidence is restored and capital outflow is reversed.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the policy changes and the loans from outside,
some commercial banks have been reluctant to extend credit even if
borrowers are exporters.
</P>
<P>
Pridiyathorn said the current funding of 350 billion baht (7.8
billion dollars) from which banks draw to lend to exporters was
insufficient due to the fall of the baht.
</P>
<P>
Although the government projected a seven percent export growth
to 62.6 billion dollars, the Exim Bank president painted a more
gloomy picture of zero growth with a volume of about 58 billion.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the fierce competition from other exporting countries
as a result of their weakened currencies and the slackened demand
in export market such as Japan, the United States and Europe as
the reasons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disadvantages, it is widely believed that the Thai
economy had already gone through the worst period.
</P>
<P>
So long as the banks increase capitals to meet the demand of
exporters, together with the stabilized baht, the Asian tiger will
finally emerge from the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> South Korea: DPRK Soldiers Cross Military Demarcation Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen soldiers of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) crossed the military demarcation
line into the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone Thursday
morning but went back 17 minutes later, said South Korea's Joint
Chiefs of Staff Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, who were moving along the signposts at the
demarcation line for some three kilometers and then crossed
roughly 40 meters into the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone
at 11:05 a.m. (local time) Thursday, paid no attention to the two
announcements and over 20 warning shots by the South Korean
military, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not explain why it announced the
accident a day later.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has been in a state of wartime mobilization since
10:00 p.m. Thursday because a vital nationwide military exercise
is under way, DPRK Deputy Foreign Minister Li In Gyu said in an
emergency briefing to foreign diplomats in Pyongyang Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK stages the military exercise because it is greatly
concerned with growing foreign military threats to the country,
the deputy minister added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Set to Establish Four Economic and Trade Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua)-- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
plans to establish four foreign trade and economic cooperation
groups in 1998 as part of an effort to accelerate reform of its
foreign trade management system, according to the International
Trade News.
</P>
<P>
The four groups, which are expected to remove barriers between
different trades and promote the relocation of assets, will fall
into four categories, according to Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Mao.
</P>
<P>
The first category will include industrial enterprises dealing
with foreign trade. The second category represents a mixture of
enterprises from the trade, industrial, agricultural, technology
and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
The third category will consist of a foreign economic
cooperation group mainly involving construction enterprises, which
will combine trade and banking. The fourth category consists of
pillar enterprises in the tourism and transportation sectors,
which will offer services to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The city will also explore different forms of public ownership
in the economic and trade sectors, and will accelerate the reform
of state-owned trade enterprises, said Zhang, who is in charge of
the city's economic and trade development.
</P>
<P>
Beijing registered a 1997 foreign trade volume of 15.6 billion
US dollars, up 4.6 percent on the previous year. China joined the
list of the world's top 10 trading nations with a total 1997 trade
volume of 325 billion US dollars.

Foreign trade officials have called for greater nationwide
efforts to ensure that China fulfills its 1998 target of 345
billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> British Co. Investment in Tanzania Tops $100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) - The Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) has invested 100 million U.S.
Dollars in Tanzania over the past 50 years to support private
sectors, said a CDC statement available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Marking the 50th anniversary of CDC, visiting CDC Deputy
Chairman Sir William Ryrie said Thursday that his organization
will launch a joint venture capital fund with local investors to
assist Tanzania in managing and expanding its small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
CDC, the Britain's overseas development financial institution
with a duty to help poorer countries by promoting private
enterprises, began its first investment in the then Tanganyika in
wattle planting in 1949, one year after its foundation.
</P>
<P>
Today, the British firm employs more than 2,500 people in
timber, wattle, tea and power production in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It is also involved in financing gold and mineral exploration
and has played a pioneering role in the establishment of
commercial sugar production in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of recent increased private sector involvement in
mineral sector, CDC has made an investment stake in a new gold
mine in north Mara Region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Early this decade, CDC demonstrated its long term commitment
in Tanzania by pioneering the concept and implementation of

<HEADLINE> Israeli Doctors to Try New AIDS Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli doctors is going to
try their new therapy to cure AIDS, local daily The Jerusalem
Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that doctors of Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem
have received Israeli Health Ministry permission to be the first
in the world to infuse into AIDS patients immunologically active
lymphocytes following transplantation of bone-marrow stem cells
taken from a healthy sibling's blood.
</P>
<P>
Professor Shmuel Slavin, whose pioneering donor lymphocyte
infusion (DLI) procedure has already cured dozens of people around
the world of leukemia, lymphoma and various non-cancerous genetic
diseases, is leading a research group to carry out the experiment.
</P>
<P>
Slavin believes the new therapy could "turn back the clock"
for AIDS patients by reconstituting their immune system with
donor-derived, immunologically active lymphocytes.
</P>
<P>
Then, when the recipient's body is primed not to reject the
donor cells, the patient's HIV-1 virus level is attacked with the
available drug "cocktails," bringing it down to what the patient
had several years before.
</P>
<P>
Successful re-establishment of the immune system in AIDS
patients and heavily immunosuppressed HIV-1 carriers, says Slavin,
is likely to increase their resistance against infections that
can kill them.
</P>
<P>
Such biological treatment is also "likely to eliminate the
cancer of the lymph nodes and possibly other secondary tumors
that often result from AIDS victims' weakened immune system,"
Slavin predicts.

LAGOS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday denied
Nigerian paper reports credited to the American ambassador to
Nigeria that he commented on the yet-to-be declared candidature
of General Sani Abacha in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
It was widely reported in many Nigerian dailies Thursday that
U.S. ambassador Williams Twaddell said Wednesday that the U.S.
government would accept Abacha as the next civilian president if
it was the collective will of Nigerians.
</P>

However, Robbert Howes, director of the U.S. Information
Service (USIS) said in Abuja Thursday that the story was not
true, the Nigerian Tribune reported Friday.

Howes said he had the founding after seeking to clarify the
story from Tadd Chapman, economic officer of the U.S. embassy,
who was with the envoy during a visit to Nigerian Minister of
Commerce and Tourism Emmanuel Udogu, when the reported promise
was made.
</P>
<P>
According to the USIS director, what the ambassador said at
the function was that "for the transition program to be credible,
there must be a level plain field for a free and fair election".
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Nigerian minister has not commented or
confirmed the reported remarks, nor the U.S. ambassador.

<HEADLINE> China Expands Tourism Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA) has established 1,162 international travel
agencies as part an effort to further explore the global tourism
market.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 Category-A travel agencies formerly held CNTA approval
for booking and hosting overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
China's travel agencies were formally divided into three
categories, including Category-A operations. Category-B travel
agencies were limited to hosting overseas tourists referred by
Category-A agencies and serving domestic tourists. Category-C
travel agencies provided services for domestic tourists.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued its Regulations on Management of
Tourism Services in October 1996, with CNTA initiating a category
adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
China currently offers two specific types of tourism agencies
-- international and domestic.
</P>
<P>
International tourism agencies have basically assumed the
business activities of the former Category-A travel agencies,
while domestic tourism agencies are limited to domestic tourism.
</P>
<P>
Tourism experts point out that the effort signals a major step
in increasing the international competitiveness of Chinese travel
agencies, and in regulating market order.
</P>
<P>
China's overseas tourism industry has witnessed annual
double-digit growth over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The country hosted a record 57.6 million overseas tourists
during Visit China '97, up 12.6 percent on the previous year, with
the sector's foreign exchange earnings hitting 12.07 billion US
dollars. The World Tourism Organization ranked China sixth
globally in accordance with related indices.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Palestinian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China is fully prepared to join
the international community to advance the Middle East peace
process, according to Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks today in a meeting with Saeb Erekat,
minister of the Local Government of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed China's great concern about development of the
peace process in the Middle East. Qian told Erekat that China is
pleased with all progress, but is also uneasy about the current
impasse in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Qian recalled his visit to the Middle East at the end of last
year, and stressed that all countries in the region and the
international community agreed that a peaceful solution to the
Middle East issue was the only choice.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestine issue, a major aspect of the Middle East
issue, should be resolved in a comprehensive, just and reasonable
manner. The long-standing stalemate in the peace precess will harm
both Arabs and Israelis, and will further complicate the regional
situation, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The international community should grasp current favorable
opportunities to help all concerned parties break the impasse and
advance the peace process, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Middle East peace talks should be based on relevant United
Nations resolutions and the principle of "land for peace", said
Qian, adding that parties concerned should abide by all agreements
and adopt a realistic and flexible attitude to realize regional
peace through dialog.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China will continue to support the just struggle of
the Palestinian people and their effort to regain occupied
territory and restore legitimate national rights.
</P>
<P>
Erekat forwarded a letter in which PNA President Yasser Arafat
briefed Chinese President Jiang Zemin on developments in the
Middle East situation.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinians will never forget the support the Chinese
people have exhibited for their just cause, and added that his
government sincerely appreciates China's stance on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Palestine will adhere to its choice for peace and
hopes to comprehensively implement agreements reached thus far.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expressed Palestine's sincere hope that China, a
permanent member of the UN Security Council, will continue its
extensive efforts to promote the peace process and ensure a
comprehensive settlement which fully complies with the interests
of all parties in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Ji Peiding and Erekat met
earlier today to discuss the peace process and Sino-Palestinian
relations.

<HEADLINE> China Investigates Electromagnetic Radiation Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting a nationwide
investigation on electromagnetic radiation pollution in a bid to
tighten controls and protect public health.
</P>
<P>
An official with the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA) noted that rapid economic growth has been accompanied by an
equally rapid rise in the number of facilities creating
electromagnetic radiation. He also pointed out that further
development is expected in related activities.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to properly distribute facilities will result in an
excessive concentration of power and will in turn create pollution
in surrounding areas," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that radiation has the potential to create
long-term adverse effects on public health. Excessive radiation
disturbs normal physical functions and causes a number of diseases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, radiation disrupts telecommunications and flight
safety, according to experts. They also noted that certain signals
from radiation facilities disturb the regular operations of some
medical instruments and lead to medical accidents.
</P>
<P>
The NEPA investigation, which will be carried out over the next
year, will mainly concentrate on the nation's broadcasting and
telecommunication systems, high voltage power transmission lines
and industrial, scientific and medical facilities creating
electromagnetic radiation.
</P>
<P>
Officials point out that the investigation will provide
detailed information concerning radiation pollution and will
enable the government to strengthen related management in order to
protect the environment and public health.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing investigation is in full swing and is scheduled for
completion in July.

<P>
People of Tianjin still remembered very well his call-in radio
and TV programs broadcast or televised through which he directly
answered residents' inquires, all in concrete terms.
</P>
<P>
Li was elected member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and member of the
Central Committee's Secretariat at the Fourth Plenary Session of
13th CPC Central Committee in 1989, to take charge of ideological
work. He is renowned for his profound study and open-mindedness in
the intellectual circle. And he published two books "Ideas on

People".
</P>
<P>

1993, he has injected new vigor and vitality into the CPPCC's work
with his enlightened views and practical attitude.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC's basic functions in the past were political
consultation and democratic supervision, to which Li added new
contents -- participation in and deliberation of state affairs,
after assuming office. Then, CPC Central Committee issued a notice
to Party committees at all levels, and urged the committees to
create conditions for the work of local CPPCC committees. As a
result, the CPPCC's status in China's political life has greatly
been raised.

CPPCC has conducted exchanges with foreign countries at various
levels in the past five years. By 1997, it has forged ties and
conducted friendly exchanges with 98 institutions from 68
countries and four international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan sets great store by the method of study. At the
21st meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eight CPPCC
National Committee, he recommended a unique study method, which
integrates theory learning with the review of experiences and
study of practical work.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, reading books is kind of study and so is
application and more important at that, he said. On the other
hand, he added, the process of book reading is in fact a process
of learning and applying theories.
</P>
<P>
With regard his personal life, Li develops a widee range of
interests, with a particular liking for Beijing Opera. And his
other hobbies include playing tennis or table tennis and going for
fishing.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- While El Nino is cursed
worldwide for its damages, excessive rains brought by the weather
phenomenon has blessed tea producers in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The output of tea, a major foreign exchange earner of
Tanzania, may reach 25 million kilograms this year, up 7.9
percent over last year, Tanzania Tea Authority Marketing Director
Richard Mwakangale has said.
</P>
<P>
Tea producing regions of Mbeya, Kagera and Iringa, as well as
parts of Usambara in Tanga region, are set to record high yields,
Business Times Friday quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Continuous rains and high altitude have been favorable to
producers in the areas, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Lushoto district in the northern Tanga region is the only area
where the rains have adversely affected tea production,
Mwakangale said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains, sometimes mixed with hailstones, hinders timely
picking and transportation of the green leaf in the district to
factories for processing.
</P>
<P>
Mwakangale believes that heavy rainfall in other tea producing
areas of east Africa will equally result in bumper yields.
</P>
<P>
The expected rise in tea production, however, raises fears of
businessmen who predict auction prices in Kenya's Mombasa may
tumble.

Wildlife is returning because of local people's efforts to
improve the environment by curbing soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The county is located on the upper reaches of the Jinsha River,
a branch of the Yangtze, the country's largest river. Before the
1960s vast primitive forests were inhabited by a large variety of
wildlife such as bears, deer, leopards and boar.
</P>
<P>
Animals virtually disappeared in the decades that followed as
local people cut down trees. By the late '80s, the forest coverage
in the area had declined to less than 15
percent. Environmentalists warned that the Yangtze River area was
being turned into a second Yellow River, which is known for its
severe erosion problems.
</P>
<P>
To improve the local environment, the government has reduced
the lumbering in the area by 40 percent while encouraging local
people to plant grass and trees.
</P>
<P>
Roads and power stations have been built in the area by the
government to provide coal and electricity for local residents to
save wood. The White House Nature Reserve was set up in the area,
covering more than 190,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. The green coverage area has been
increased to 25 percent, while land erosion has dwindled to an
area of 1,000 square kilometers, about one-fourth of the previous
area.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Ranks First in Consumption of Aquatic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua)-- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, is abundant in aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The city has kept top spot among China's major cities in per
capita consumption of aquatic products for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Guangzhou urban residents consumed 236,000
tons of aquatic products in 1997, or 60 kilograms per person.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Pearl River delta area, which is the major
supplier of aquatic products for Guangzhou, other cities and
provinces across the country also supply aquatic products for
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Today, Guangzhou residents can enjoy imported seafood from
Australia, Norway and Thailand. Last year, about 30,000 tons of
imported aquatic products enriched residents' diets.
</P>
<P>
The abundant aquatic products and a stable market helped drive
down seafood prices from previous years. The price index in 1997
was reduced by 12 percent to that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of consumed aquatic products in Guangzhou are
from other provinces, which made Guangzhou the distribution center
of aquatic products in south China.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has formed 19 large aquatic products wholesale
markets. Every day, about 50 tons of quality aquatic products are
exported from Guangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Negligent Father Fined in Israel, Precedence Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented decision,
the Tel Aviv District Court has ordered a man to pay about
260,000 U.S. dollars to his three children for neglecting them, a
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post reported that Judge Henia
Stein ordered the man, Yithzak Amin, to make the payment of
300,000 shekels (86,000 dollars) to each of his three children -
two sons and a daughter who are all in their 30s now.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the fine was imposed because Amin was found to
have neglected his children and failed to provide for their
physical and emotional needs while they were growing up.
</P>
<P>
He ruled that due to the father's failure to fulfill his
paternal obligations under the law, permanent emotional damages
were caused to the children who are therefore entitled to
compensation.
</P>
<P>
This was the first court ruling establishing that a father's
legal obligations include providing love and warmth, and not just
material support. The complainants claimed that after their mother
committed suicide when they were very young, their father
remarried and basically abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
The three grew up in various institutions and stayed with
foster families until they reached majority. They described how
often their father did not let them into his house when they
wanted to come to visit him during vacations, and they were
forced to spend the nights in public parks.
</P>
<P>
Judge Stein had consulted with Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein on the matter, and he said there was no reason to
block a claim for damages by children against their parents, if
they are claiming the parents had not acted in good faith.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports Could Face Difficulties in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China's export markets could be a
problem area for the economy in 1998, today's International
Business Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The general gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of
Southeast Asia is expected to drop to 2 percent this year from
last year's 4.5 percent, and reduce the region's import needs by
10-to-25 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was expected to decrease exports from China,
which depends on East Asia for 55 percent of its total exports.
</P>
<P>
The expanded trade deficit and aggravation of current accounts
jointly have caused East Asian nations to take measures to protect
imports such as licensing, import quotas and anti-dumping
restrictions. These measures are expected to restrain China's
exports, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the growth
rate of the global economy will drop to 3.5 percent this
year. That of developed countries with a market economy will fall
2.5 percent. Those countries could reduce their imports from China.
</P>
<P>
An IMF analysis shows that exports from nations undergoing a
financial crisis should expand about 20 percent. Western countries
are expected to turn to those nations rather than China.
</P>
<P>
However, there are also favorable situations for China, as the
European Union further relaxed restriction against imports from
China.
</P>
<P>
China has also reached agreements with some nations after
negotiations on China's World Trade Organization membership.
</P>
<P>
And overseas investments in China continue rising, which should
helpful to China's export situation.

Uygur Autonomous Region to have easy access to telephones and
information.
</P>
<P>
This northwestern ethnic region had difficulty in contacting
the outside world through long-distance telephones, especially

telephone lines, compared with only nine in 1986 when it began
satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
The region has set up four ground satellite stations, as well
as 26 digital mini-stations, forming a satellite information
network linked to most other provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The recently completed satellite communications projects cost
more than 20 million yuan, with equipment imported from the United

prepared to accept any constructive suggestions from anyone on
the land acquisition and redistribution program, a cabinet
minister has said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday night, Chairman of National
Land Acquisition Committee Joseph Msika, also Minister Without
Portfolio in the office of the president and the cabinet, said
there was no going back on the land issue as the policy had been
formulated and adopted during the liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
According to "The Herald" daily Friday, the minister was
responding to representatives of the private sector and the
Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU) at a meeting they requested on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The private sector had requested the meeting with a view to
making a more meaningful contribution to the land reform program
through the establishment of more dialogue with the government.
</P>
<P>
Msika assured the representatives that the program had no
intention of disrupting the agricultural industry.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the government intended to strengthen the
industry in a way that would increase productivity in both
communal and commercial farming areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the land acquisition program would instead
bring peace and security in the country which were a requirement
for national development.
</P>
<P>
He allayed some fears by the CFU on the criteria used by the
government in identifying land for acquisition by clearly
explaining the process.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the Zimbabwean government announced to acquire
about 1,500 farms or five million hectares of land to resettle
landless Zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> China Releases January Tourism Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China hosted 5.08 million
overseas tourists in January this year, up 23.8 percent on the
1997 period, according to the China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
CNTA estimates that final figures for foreign exchange earnings
from overseas tourism will hit 920 million US dollars, up 10.7
percent on January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival, a traditional Chinese holiday which fell on
January 28, provided a substantial increase in the number of Hong
Kong and Macao compatriots visiting inland areas, with the actual
figure rising by 30 percent to 4.46 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector witnessed a decline in the number of
foreign tourists. While Japan is normally China's largest source
of tourists, the number of Japanese visiting the country in
January fell by 14.8 percent to only 91,000.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from Hong Kong and Macao spent a total of 450 million
US dollars during the month, up 31 percent, with revenues from
foreign tourists dropping by eight percent to 310 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has initiated the '98 China Country and City Tour to
attract more overseas visitors. The major campaign offers tour
itineraries to major scenic sites in historical and cultural
cities, as well as rural scenery and folklore. Visitors can also
personally witness the changing face of China since the
introduction of the reform and opening policies in 1979.
</P>
<P>
China hosted 57.6 million overseas tourists during Visit
China '97, with foreign exchange earnings resulting from the
campaign standing at 12.07 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> UNGA President Hold Talks with Malaysian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations General
Assembly (UNGA) President Hennadiy Udovenko held talks here Friday
with Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi on a number
of issues including U.N. reforms and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The issues we discussed included Security Council reforms, the
financial problems faced by the U.N. and the current situation in
Kosovo," Abdullah told a news conference after the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was committed to the reforms within the U.N.
However, he regretted that not much progress has been made on the
U.N. reforms as too many countries have their own agenda, which
made it difficult to reach one particular formula.
</P>
<P>
He said there should be more efforts to be made to reform the
U.N. Security Council. The present arrangements are not
satisfactory, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, Abdullah said the Kosovo crisis may be an internal
matter, but it is also an issue of human rights and the violence
in Kosovo can also affect the stability in that region.
</P>
<P>
"Because of that, the international community should not only
express concerns, but should make efforts for a proper solution,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Malaysia welcomes the initiatives
taken by some European countries in defusing the tension in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he and Udovenko also discussed bilateral
cooperation in various fields between Malaysia and Ukraine as
Udovenko came here in two capacities both as the UNGA president
and as Ukraine's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko arrived here Thursday night for a three-day visit to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko, who succeeded Malaysia's Razali Ismail as the UNGA
president, is scheduled to call on Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before he
leaves for Tokyo Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Two Flocks of Endangered Pheasants Found in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Two flocks of brown-eared
pheasants, an endangered species, have been found at Lingshan
Mountain in the western suburbs of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists say that the species of brown-eared pheasants has
only been discovered in north China's Shanxi and Hebei provinces,
and like the giant panda and golden monkey, it is under state
first class protection.
</P>
<P>
Last October zoologists found several big birds they had never
seen in Beijing. The birds were identified as brown-eared
pheasants. The zoologists traced the pheasants and found two
flocks with a total number of 43 birds.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists say brown-eared pheasants, one meter in length and
weighing 2-to-3 kilograms, run fast and live in pairs. They eat
plant roots, seeds and insects. They mate in spring, and every
female lays 8-to-10 eggs.
</P>
<P>
The newly found pheasants came from Shanxi Province, said
zoologists. Related departments are taking measures to protect
them.
</P>
<P>
Lingshan Mountain has a variety of vegetation; and 116 species
of birds live on the mountain.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto who
has been re-elected to a seventh term in office is expected to
announce the members of a new cabinet on Saturday, an official
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the presidential household, M. Basyuni told a press
conference that the new ministers will take their oath on March 16
at the State Palace.
</P>
<P>
Basyuni also said that the head of state, who will be
accompanied by Vice President B. J. Habibie, is scheduled to chair
the first meeting of the new cabinet on the following day.
</P>
<P>
Basyuni did not give details about the number of the new
cabinet for the 1998-2003 term.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was re-elected on Tuesday to his seventh term of
office by the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's
highest legislative body.
</P>
<P>
According to the original schedule, the new cabinet will be
formed at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the palace said the hasty formation of the
cabinet reflected the president's deep concern over the lingering
economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, Indonesia has been facing spiraling
inflation, growing unemployment and other serious economic,
financial and social problems caused by a rapid decline of the
rupiah currency.
</P>
<P>
At present, the rupiah is trading at about 10,000 against the
U.S. dollar, compared with 2,400 per dollar in July last year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania-Zambia Railway Revenue Increases by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 13 (Xinhua) - The Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority (TAZARA) generated 12.682 billion Tanzanian Shillings
(nearly 20 million U.S. Dollars) during the 1997/98 fiscal year,
a 28.1 percent increase compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Communications and Transport William
Kusila said in a statement Friday that the increase was achieved
mainly by improved passenger and cargo services.
</P>
<P>
"For example, TAZARA managed to ferry 778,530 passengers
during the first half of the 1997/98 fiscal year compared to
686,022 during a corresponding period in 1996/97," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who doubles as the chairman of the Ministerial
Council for TAZARA, said that the Authority has managed to
increase its engine capacity from 30 percent to 57.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA has rehabilitated damaged wagons and increased the
number of wagons from 1,122 to 2,280 which suffice the demand, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1860-km railway, built by the Chinese government in an aid
program in the 1970s, has survived the recent destructive floods
linked to the EL Nino rains which have paralyzed the Central
Railway linking the coast in the East to the Tanganyika Lake in

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Presidium of the ongoing
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature, held its third meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Li Peng, an executive chairman
of the Presidium.
</P>
<P>
The meeting approved draft resolutions on the government work
report, on implementation of the 1997 plan for national economic
and social development and a draft plan for 1998, and on
implementation of the central and local budgets for 1997 and draft
budgets for 1998.
</P>
<P>
All the three draft resolutions will be printed and distributed
to the delegations to the NPC for examination, and will be
submitted to a full meeting for final approval.
</P>
<P>
The meeting endorsed a report by the NPC Financial and Economic
Committee on its examination of the implementation of China's 1997
development plan and budgets.
</P>
<P>
The Financial and Economic Committee says in its report that
goals of China's national economic and social development for 1997
have been basically attained, with the national economy displaying
a momentum of high growth and low inflation and the macroeconomic
environment further improved.
</P>

"The guidelines, principles and emphases of the draft plan for
national economic and social development in 1998 are correct, and
the overall arrangements are basically feasible," the committee
says.
</P>

It suggests the current NPC session approve the draft 1998 plan
for national economic and social development submitted by the
State Council, and a relevant report made by Chen Jinhua, minister
in charge of the State Planning Commission, at the session on
behalf of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The committee holds that China faces arduous tasks in promoting
economic restructuring and growth in 1998, but an annual economic
growth of eight percent is both necessary and attainable.

16.7 percent over the previous year, and the proportion of fiscal
revenue in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose to 11.5 percent.

"The general situation for the implementation of the 1997
budgets was good," the report says.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia would provide 578,000
U.S. dollars to increase public awareness of unexploded mines and
ammunition in Laos, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the money would go towards a nationwide program in
Laos to alert school children, their families and ethnic
minorities about the danger of unexploded mines.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the money would also support a program aimed at
giving the government of Laos the ability to manage the clearance
of mines and unexploded ammunition.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is one of the leading contributors to international
land mine clearance programs," Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Since March 1996 the Australian government has provided 12
million U.S. dollars for demining assistance and the government
expects to commit 66 million U.S. dollars to demining initiatives
in the decade to 2005.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia's donation would also be used to train
people in Laos in disaster preparedness.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province,
one of the country's major rice producers, has begun developing
maize in paddy fields as part of an effort to improve agricultural
structure.
</P>
<P>
The province produced more than 25 billion kilograms of grain
in 1997, but faced serious fodder shortage when it intensified
efforts to promote animal husbandry at the same time. The province
had to ship in billions of yuan worth in maize and other fodder
crops to make up the feed shortage.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government decided to grow high-yield and
high-efficiency crops on 300,000 hectares of paddy fields
beginning this year, including 70,000 hectares of maize, according
to the province's Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
Hunan will select 30 paddy-field pilot areas to develop maize,
in a bid to have 200,000-to-300,000 hectares of quality maize
within three-to-five years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considers New Steps on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Thursday it is considering new steps to stop the Kosovo conflict
spreading to the rest of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that the steps
include aid to Yugoslavia's neighboring countries and increasing
the military force in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott will fly to the area
next week for talks with leaders of Albania, Bulgaria, Romania,
Macedonia and Slovenia, said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said also under consideration is extending the monitoring
force of 700 American and Scandinavian soldiers in Macedonia
beyond a scheduled withdrawal at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that's under discussion right now. But yes,
we are looking at what the right mix of capabilities and missions
will best serve a situation that has gotten worse, not gotten
better."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. last week scrapped the measures to soften the
sanctions against Belgrade after dozens of ethnic Albanians died
in a Yugoslavian government crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
that he was going to ask the U.N. Security Council to review the
earlier decision to withdraw the peacekeeping force from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly are pleased that the secretary-general agrees
with us that there is a need to have a stabilizing international
presence, a peacekeeping presence in the region," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the troops in Macedonia is expected to expire at
the end of August this year and the Security Council decided to
pull them out by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Rubin confirmed that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Annan also discussed the issue and believed the troops will
remain in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We do think it's encouraging and important that the
international community is getting behind the idea that if the
current trends don't reverse themselves...one of the grave risks
here is that the violence in Kosovo will spread to neighboring
countries like the former Yugoslavian republic of Macedonia,"
Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> China Setting Up Direct Channels with International Retailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- China is creating direct trade
channels with international retailers instead of the routine
contacts through intermediate business agents, according to
sources with China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is encouraging China's foreign trade companies to
make direct relationships with international retailers as part of
the effort to alleviate the impact of the Southeast Asian
financial crisis on China's exports.
</P>
<P>
At an international export commodity fair this week in Tianjin,
a municipality in north China, a number of purchasing agents
representing big international retail firms replaced overseas
intermediate business agents to become the fair's major
customers. Such companies include Makro from the Netherlands,
Daiei from Japan, the China Resources Holding Co. Ltd. and the
Wing On Co. Ltd. from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Carrefour Group from France gave a presentation at the fair
to hundreds of Chinese exporters on how to enter its global
purchasing network.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the company's Asian purchases were from
Chinese markets in recent years, with 1 billion yuan worth of
commodities last year primarily household necessities, electrical
appliances, stationery, textiles and electronics, said
J.C. Goarin, Garrefour's China manager.
</P>
<P>
The store has set up 270 chain supermarkets in 14 countries and
regions including those in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.

SHANGHAI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The corpse of a Shanghai
resident during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) received a medical
operation on Wednesday, an autoposy conducted by Shanghai and Hong
Kong doctors, the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The corpse, unearthed in Shanghai in 1994, was that of Gu
Chongli, a celebrity and a high-ranking official who died at the
age of 81. It was the best preserved ancient corpse ever found in
Shanghai, China's biggest city in east China. Examination of the
body showed that the internal organs were intact, which will aid
further research.
</P>
<P>
After a half-hour operation a 49-gram heart, two halves of the
brain, and lobes of the lung were removed from the body.
</P>
<P>
"The autoposy study of this ancient corpse can tell us a lot,"
said Xu Yongqing, an expert on ancient corpses with the Shanghai
Natural Museum. The research will be of great significance for
ancient pathology, medical archeology, ancient environmental
science and medical history, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"It can provide answers to such questions as why the corpse
didn't rot for 400 years; which disease he died of; which diseases
he suffered in his old age; and even provide information on his
living environment through analysis of the air in his lungs," Xu
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports increased
sharply by 93 percent in February compared to the same month last
year, strengthening the country's record of a trade surplus for
six consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Customs Department here Friday,
exports in February totaled 216.51 billion baht (about 5 billion
US dollars), up 93.08 percent, while imports increased 17.72
percent to 165.58 billion baht (3.9 billion dollars), resulting in
a trade surplus of 50.9 billion baht (1.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the department did not provide figures in US dollar.
The baht has plunged from 25 against the dollar in the first half
of last year to about 43 now.
</P>
<P>
The department said that for the first two months of 1998 the
country recorded a total trade surplus of 96.38 billion baht (2.2
billion dollars), compared to 81.22 billion (1.9 billion dollars)
in the previous four months.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Most Tropical Cyclones Sweep Over Bangladesh: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 95 percent of the world's
tropical cyclones sweep over Bangladesh, bringing heavy loss of
life and property to this South Asian nation, a weather expert has
said.
</P>
<P>
Forty to 50 percent of disasters in country come from tropical
cyclones, M.H. Khan Chowdhury, former Meteorological Office chief,
told a workshop here on Thursday, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Of the cyclones formed in the Bay of Bengal during April and
May, 80 percent will surely hit the country as they have no other
tracks to divert their course," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
And cyclones during October and November that move west to
northwest lash at Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka if they do not
recurve.
</P>
<P>
In the 22-year period between 1964 and 1986, cyclones killed
some 400,000 in the country, while the 1970 devastating cyclones
alone claimed some 300,000 lives, according to Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
Some 138,000 Bangladeshis lost their lives in the April 29,
1991 disastrous cyclone with a wind speed of as high as 205
kilometers per hour, causing 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in material
loss to the country, the meteorological expert said.
</P>
<P>
But there was less loss of life and property in the 1997 storm
due to massive pre-disaster preparedness ahead of the disaster, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To minimize losses, an effective disaster-warning system should
be set up to disseminate disaster-warning signals quickly to the
media and agencies concerned so that immediate actions could be
taken to avert catastrophe, the expert added.

<HEADLINE> Early Establishment of Preparatory Committee for Macao Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official in
charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs said here today that it is
better to establish a preparatory committee for the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) earlier than later.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee should have a wide representation of
people in Macao, said Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, who is
attending an ongoing session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) as a deputy.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, the preparatory committee should have more
members from Macao than those from the mainland since the future
Macao SAR will implement the principles of "one country, two
systems" and "Macao people governing Macao" and a high degree of
autonomy for Macao.
</P>
<P>
The major task of the preparatory committee is to make
preparations for the establishment of the Macao SAR and formulate
methods for the formation of the first government of the Macao SAR
and its judicial organs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The actual date for the establishment of the preparatory
committee will be decided by the NPC and its Standing Committee in
accordance with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen described the return of Macao to the embrace of the
motherland as another milestone in the great cause of
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" policy put forward by Deng
Xiaoping has become reality in Hong Kong, he said. It not only
ensures Hong Kong's economic prosperity and social stability but
also plays a positive role in the return of Macao to the embrace
of the motherland and the settlement of the Taiwan Issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 1999 will bring China a double happiness -- the
return of Macao to China, which falls on December 20, and the 50th
anniversary for the founding of new China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in a smooth transfer of power in
Macao," he added.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the principle of "one country, two systems,"
Macao's political, economic, historical, cultural and social
characteristics will be taken into full consideration, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China will unite all people that can be united in Macao,
including Portuguese born in Macao, for achieving a smooth
transition and Macao's sustained economic development and social
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen enumerated a long list of items of work that need to be
done during the latter half of Macao's transitional period.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time that we began work on these items," he
said.

PRAGUE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- After heated debates, the Czech
government decided Thursday to implement major hikes in rent as
well as in the price of electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from July 1, rents and gas prices will rise by 27
percent while electricity will increase by 24 percent, the CTK

</P>
<P>
The move is part of the effort made by the Czech government in
the transition towards establishing a market economy. It is aimed
at correcting the low cost of rents, gas and electricity which has
incurred losses in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
The government also increased subsidies to low-income families
and pensions to the retired to offset the effects of price hikes
on those most vulnerable to price fluctuations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. General: Crew to Blame for Cable Car Tragedy in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A United States general said
Wednesday that the four-man crew of a U.S. Marine Corps plane was
to blame for last month's cable car tragedy in Italy's Dolomites.
</P>
<P>
"It was a crew error. The crew flew lower and faster than
authorized whenever ... there was a valley," Major General Michael
DeLong said.
</P>
<P>
"The crew piloted the plane in an aggressive way, exceeding
speed limits and flying well below the set limit."
</P>
<P>
The general said that supervision and training of the crew was
also to blame because they were instructed to fly at 1,000 feet
(300 metres) rather than the 2,000 feet laid down for the region.
</P>
<P>
"We know from sources that they were flying below 1,000 feet
and hit the cables at between 366 and 373 feet. However most of
the low level portion of the flight should have been planned,
briefed and flown at 2,000 feet," said the general.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crew of the jet would now go before a
U.S. grand jury, which would decide whether they should face a
court martial.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy happened on February 3, when a low-flying
surveillance jet based at Aviano sliced through the ski-lift
cables on Mount Cormis during a training flight, sending 20 people
inside a cable car to their deaths.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Export Earnings up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's major traditional
export earner tea has recorded an impressive earning of 700
million U.S. dollars in 1997 up from 562 million U.S. dollars the
previous year, showing a 24.6 percent growth, according to the
Daily News Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tea earnings have outstripped other traditional export earners
rubber and coconut, Tea Board sources told the paper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, earnings may not be as high as the impact of El-Nino
is expected to severely affect the tea plantations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tea Research Institute has issued guidelines to
the plantations on how to minimize the damage from the El-Nino
threat, the sources was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenya which is Sri Lanka's main competitor suffered a severe

Sri Lanka has received larger orders from the Commonwealth of

Iran, Iraq, UK, UAE, Egypt Syriya and Jordan also increased.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM: Kosovo Should Participate in Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo's ethnic Albanians should
show their willingness to negotiate with Belgrade if the situation
is to improve in the Serbian province, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Demands for independence by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the two million people in Serbia's Kosovo province,
have met with violent repression. Dini said however the local
population is also '``partly to blame for the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
Kosovo exploded in violence within the past two weeks and
nearly 80 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Dini said a solution to the crisis depends on a constructive
approach by the people in Kosovo, who could see international
sympathy rapidly evaporate if they do not do their part.
</P>
<P>
He said the Serbian government was showing signs of a
willingness to negotiate and "we are waiting for the other side to
do the same."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had talked with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, who gave signs of his willingness to comply with
these demands.
</P>
<P>
His failure to comply would lead to "more severe measures,"
Dini warned, adding that if Kosovo withdraws from the dialogue
with Belgrade, it will be blamed for the deterioration in the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Expert on Tropical Cyclones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 95 percent of the world's
tropical cyclones sweep over Bangladesh, causing heavy losses of
lives and properties to the south Asian country, a weather expert
has said.
</P>
<P>
Forty to 50 percent of disasters in the country were caused by
tropical cyclones, M.H. Khan Chowdhury, former Meteorological
Office chief, told a workshop here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Of the cyclones formed in the Bay of Bengal during April and
May, 80 percent will surely hit the country as they have no other
tracks to divert their course," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
In the 22-year period between 1964 and 1986, cyclones killed
some 400,000 people in the country, while the 1970 devastating
cyclones alone claimed some 300,000 lives, according to Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
Some 138,000 Bangladeshis lost their lives in the 1991
disastrous cyclone with a wind speed of 205 kilometers per hour,
which also caused 2.4 billion U.S. dollars losses in materials,
the meteorological expert said.
</P>
<P>
But there was no heavy loss of lives and properties in the 1997
storm due to pre-disaster preparedness ahead of the disaster, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To minimize losses, an effective disaster-warning system should
be set up to disseminate disaster-warning signals to the media and
agencies concerned so that immediate actions could be taken to
avert catastrophe, the expert suggested.

<HEADLINE> Greenhouse Fruit Selling Well in Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- In early March, when cherries
produced in greenhouses in Shandong Province were ripe, they were
immediately snapped up by traders at 15 yuan (1.8 U.S. dollars)
per kilogram, 10 times the price for ordinary cherries.
</P>
<P>
East China's Shandong province, a pace-setter in growing fruit in
greenhouses, accounts for half of the 16,000 hectares of
greenhouses in the country.
</P>
<P>
While there has been an oversupply of ordinary fruit, the
supply of greenhouse fruit still falls short of demand, though the
latter is priced much higher. "This is because greenhouse products
are always available in the off-season," one market analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yongshun, a farmer in Tengzhou in Shandong, could not sell
the cherries he grew last year and could only watch them rot. So
he decided to shift to greenhouse cherries, which earned him more
than 30,000 yuan in March.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many farmers in Shandong are growing cherries,
grapes, strawberries and plums in greenhouses.

<HEADLINE> Washington Hails China's Decision to Sign Covenant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States hailed
China's decision Thursday to sign the International Covenant On
Civil and Political Rights, calling it a "positive and
constructive step forward."
</P>
<P>
Both the White House and the State Department expressed
"welcome" to the measure announced hours earlier by Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Qian told a press conference that his country intends to sign
the covenant to show its sincerity in dealing with the human
rights issue.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry commented at a press
Briefing: ``Obviously the United States government welcomes
today's decision by the Chinese government as a positive and
constructive step forward.
</P>
<P>
``This decision by China to sign the covenant will represent a
formal commitment to the principles that are espoused in the
covenant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about possible impact on U.S. moves at the upcoming U.N.
Human Rights meeting in Geneva, McCurry said that Qian's
``significant'' announcement ``will be taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
However, he did not clarify if Washington had decided to drop
the sponsoring of an anti-China resolution in Geneva later this
month.
</P>
<P>
For years, the United States has tried and failed to sponsor a
resolution critical of China's human rights condition. The
prospect this year for such a document seems dimmer since
U.S. allies in Europe have decided to curtail their efforts.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin also commended the
Chinese decision, believing the Chinese government means what it
says.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a pattern of Chinese announcements in this area,
where they first say they're going --they intend to sign a treaty
or a convention, and then they sign a treaty or a convention, and
then they ratify a treaty or convention," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Both McCurry and Rubin confirmed that President Bill Clinton
might move the date up for his trip to China.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Clinton might visit China in late June or
early July instead of November. Neither McCurry nor Rubin were
prepared to be more specific about the schedule.
</P>
<P>
"The president has a number of reasons to think about the
scheduling of the China trip. Clearly, we want to keep momentum in
this relationship: that has been progressing because of the
exchange of high-level leaders and delegations, including the
summit meetings between the two presidents," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin of China visited the United States in
late October and early November last year. He and President
Clinton agreed to establish a constructive strategic partnership
between the two countries for the next century. The two leaders
met again in Vancouver, Canada, at an APEC meeting some three
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president has already, in a sense, assessed the
importance of the continuing dialogue he has with the highest
levels of the People's Republic leadership," McCurry said. He
described the ties with China as "one of the most important
relationships the United States has on Earth."
</P>
<P>
He said that China and the United States have cooperated well
on regional security issues, the Korean peninsula and the
four-party talks, adding that the role played by China has been
"very, very helpful."
</P>
<P>
"The president looks forward to continuing that type of
detailed, concrete dialogue with President Jiang Zemin, and I
think he hopes that this will be an occasion that we can continue
to make progress on the issues that are central to what is a very
expansive bilateral relationship," McCurry noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress and improvement of the Sino-American
relationship, both China and the United States believe that more
efforts are needed to narrow their differences on the Taiwan
issue, the human rights problem and trade imbalance.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto on New Government's Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
emphasized that restoring currency stability will be the most
immediate priority of the new government.
</P>
<P>
"We're not asking for much. We just want to have a stable
rupiah as that people's living standards do not fall further," the
president said here Thursday night when meeting with members of
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), official Antara news
agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
If this was achieved, the country's economic wheels could start
rolling again, he said.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Indonesian rupiah has lost about 80 percent
against the U.S. dollar in the past eight months since the
monetary crisis, which hit most of the Southeast Asian countries
and some East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, Soeharto admitted, had made it seem that the fruits
of the 30 years of development had been destroyed. "This crisis
has inflicted big losses on everyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government along with the people had made concerted
efforts to ensure adequate supply of basic commodities and
medicines.
</P>
<P>
"But the results of our efforts are still inadequate. Many
things remain to be done to restore normalcy in the situation," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was reelected to his seventh term of presidency
on Tuesday at the general session of MPR, is reportedly to form
his Seventh Development Cabinet on Saturday (March 14).

The Hindustan Times:
</P>
<P>
-- As uncertainty over government formation deepened Thursday

secure letters of support from some of his allies, President K. R.
Narayanan decided to open parallel discussions with the Congress
and the United Front.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Parliament Adopts Law on Abandoned Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian parliament adopted a
law on Thursday designed to invalidate war-time decisions on
abandoned houses. The new law will pave the way for an early
return of refugees who fled their homeland during years of ethnic
conflicts in the former Yugoslavian republic.
</P>
<P>
Under a war-time law on houses, owners automatically lost their
rights of residence if the houses were abandoned for more than six
months.
</P>
<P>
The war-time law on houses later became a major obstacle for
refugees returning to their homeland because they could not
re-claim their houses, which were being occupied by others.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, previous owners of houses must
register with local authorities to claim their former properties
within six months after the law becomes effective.

COLOMBO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will contribute 15 million
U.S. dollars to a three-year agreement it has signed with Sri
Lanka on development projects in the South Asian country, the

the development aid covered by the agreement is in addition to
contributions from sector specific funds that are considered on a
project-by-project basis and handled by the Swedish International
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
The present ethnic conflict is identified as the greatest
obstacle to development in Sri Lanka. Sweden would try to assist
Sri Lanka in searching for a solution to the problem, Wingen told
the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Thai Military Officers Ordered to Use Bicycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai army officers and their
families will say good-bye to their cars inside the military
camps, as the army has worked out a new policy to encourage riding
bicycles to save petrol and reduce pollution, the Bangkok Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 bicycles will be distributed to military units
across the nation, said Deputy Army Chief-of-Staff Pattana
Phuthananont.
</P>
<P>
The bicycle campaign was promoted by the Army
Commander-in-Chief Chettha Thanajaro, who used his personal budget
to buy part of the bicycles.
</P>
<P>
General Chettha will lead a number of army officers to ride
bicycles on March 20, to encourage people to turn to bicycles for
short-distance travel, Pattana said.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, each military camp of the army is located in a
100-rai (16 hectares) plot or larger.
</P>
<P>
According to Pattana, the army can save about 400,000 baht
(about 9,000 U.S. dollars) each month due to its campaign to
encourage officers to make prudent use of tap water, power supply
and telephone.

<P>
ROME, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Fiat car company will invest
about two billion U.S. dollars over the next five years to open new
markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fiat chief executive Roberto Testore said Thursday in Turin
when he unveiled the Seicento (600) model that his company would
invest 1.95 billion dollars before 2002 to improve its global strategy.
</P>
<P>
He said in the five years, car demand in western Europe would
grow by ten percent, by three percent in North America and would fall
slightly in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Demand in emerging economies would grow by 50 percent and the
markets of the future were mainly in China, India, eastern Europe
and some Latin American countries where Fiat would build new
plants or promote sales, said Testore.
</P>
<P>
The company would also produce 15 new models, including the
Seicento and three more this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cautious Optimism Seen About Philippine Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Some analysts have expressed
cautious optimism about the Philippine banking system, the largest
victim of the financial crisis in Southeast and East Asia, while
the country has insisted it is healthy.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson said the
country's banking industry remained "vibrant and fundamentally
sound" despite the major stress from the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said that this vibrancy was manifested in the continuous
growth of resources, higher capitalization, a wider operating
network, expanded services and manageable levels of non-performing
loans.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the Central Bank showed that
as of September 1997, the total assets of the banking system stood
at 2.6 trillion pesos (about 81 billion U.S. dollars), up 22.34
percent from the end-1996 level.
</P>
<P>
With the liberalized banking and bank branching rules since
1992, the operating network of banks had expanded. By the end of
1997, there were 1,006 banking institutions with 6,185 branches or
offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
Credit quality of the banks also remained sound. As of
September 1997, non-performing loans accounted for 3.81 percent of
the total loan portfolio. The banks' exposure to the real estate
sector was only 13.7 percent, much lower than in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The banks' profitability has been sustained. Pre-tax net income
for the first nine months of 1997 rose to 38.7 billion pesos
(about 1.2 billion dollars), 16 percent up when compared with the
same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the break-out of the financial crisis last July, the
Central Bank also implemented a series of measures to help the
banks weather the storm.
</P>
<P>
The measures include placing a cap on real estate loans,
adjusting the overbought and oversold foreign exchange position of
the banks, introducing a 2 percent loan-loss provision and
strengthening the supervision of accounts of both banks and their
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, were cautiously optimistic about the
country's banking system. They said the data were only up to last
September when the crisis had not yet reached the worst, adding
the cracks have begun to show this year.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the financial crisis claimed its second
victim, the Orient Bank, the smallest bank in the country, after
forcing a small bank to close last September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the banks also showed ominous signs. For decades
their foreign exchange position has been negative, indicating that
their foreign exchange liabilities have always exceeded foreign
exchange assets.
</P>
<P>
Data as of October 1997 showed that the net foreign assets of
the banks stood at negative 19.1 billion dollars. The unfavorable
position may aggravate the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
The banks' bad loans are also growing. The banks jacked up
their lending rates to between 26 and 40 percent during the
crisis. As a result, dozens of companies failed to pay their
loans.
</P>
<P>
The "extremely high" interest rates are also killing the
economy. Before the crisis, the banks' credit growth rate always
surpassed the increase of their assets. The country's leading
bank, Metro Bank, even had a credit growth rate of 130 percent
while managing only an asset growth of about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
But in the second half of last year, the banks went to the
other extreme and became very selective in lending money to their
clients, drawing the massive protest of the business community.
</P>
<P>
Due to a spate of corporate failures, Moody's Investors
Service, a U.S.-based credit rating agency, has lowered its
outlook from "stable" to "negative" for eight Philippine banks
including Metro Bank.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the Philippine banking sector was in a better
position than that of other countries, but its defects also showed
up in the crisis. They suggest the monetary authorities correct
the mistakes immediately to make the banking system stronger.

<HEADLINE> IMF Team to Visit Indonesia Again for Fresh Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will soon send a team to Jakarta to hold fresh talks with
the Indonesian government, an official said here late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of the Economic and Financial Resilience
Council (DPKEK) Fuad Bawazier said the IMF team will arrive here
soon after the announcement of the new cabinet slated for tomorrow
(March 14).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an IMF source in Jakarta confirmed Friday that the
imminent arrival here of an IMF team which would be headed by one
of the institution's senior executives.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the IMF delayed its second tranche worth 3
billion U.S. dollars assistance to Indonesia because of the
so-called lack of reforms in the country. Meanwhile, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank also delayed their loans to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the IMF agreed to provide 43 billion
rescue package for Indonesia which had been badly hit by the
monetary crisis since July. At the end of last year, Indonesia
received the IMF's first tranche of 3 billion U.S. dollars in
long-term loan.
</P>
<P>
Since early February, the Indonesian government has repeatedly
said it is preparing to set up a currency board, which would peg
the rupiah to a hard currency.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other international monetary institutions opposed
the plan.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Orders Illegal Workers to Leave By May 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Labor Ministry has
ordered about 800,000 illegal workers, most of them from Myanmar,
to leave Thailand by May 1 or face legal action.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Trairong Suwankhiri said
on Thursday that the Thai government has set aside 24 million baht
(about 550,000 U.S. dollars) to build five detention centers along
the Thai-Myanmar border by the end of April and illegal workers
will have to report to these centers before being repatriated.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will cover the illegal workers'

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian, EU Share Positions on Kosovo: EU Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Union special
envoy Anthony Lloyd said Thursday that the Bulgarian government
and EU hold similar positions on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Kosovo has reached crisis proportions," said
Lloyd at his meeting with Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister
Konstantin Dimitrov, the BTA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, who is also the British minister of state for foreign
and commonwealth affairs, said that the level of violence used by
the Yugoslavian authorities in Kosovo is unacceptable and is
condemned by the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU representative mentioned the decisions taken by the
Contact Group during its meeting in London Monday, saying that the
response was decisive and rapid.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group on Former Yugoslavia reportedly proposed
imposing an arms embargo on Belgrade if it fails to politically
resolve the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd drew attention to the joint declaration issued by foreign
ministers of Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Macedonia and Turkey
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
He said the declaration, which condemned the violence in Kosovo
and called for a political solution to the issue, is "absolutely
consistent with the statements from the Contact Group," and
"establishes an absolute unanimity of purpose between the regional
states and the Contact Group and the world community in that
context."
</P>
<P>
As to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the envoy said that "whilst
we support greater autonomy, that autonomy needs to be within the
existing internationally recognized boundaries of
Yugoslavia. There is no room for secession," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also warned ethnic Albanians not to indulge in terrorism,
saying, "There can be no support from any part of the world
community for acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Sofia is the last leg of Lloyd's four-nation Balkan tour which
has taken him to Skopje, Tirana and Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> 34 Ministers of American Continet to Meet Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The ministers of 34 American
countries will meet in San Jose next Thursday for fresh
negotiations on the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA).
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting of preparatory talks is crucial for the
creation of the FTAA, Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Jose
Manuel Salazar said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will sign the "Declaration of San Jose" and an
outline of negotiations subject to the approval of the summit of
the Americas next month in Santiago, Chile, added Salazar.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory meetings have been held since the Summit of the
Americas in December 1994, when the presidents agreed to set up
the FTAA in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have proposed to mark the formal start for the
FTAA negotiations in the next summit.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is the only country excluded from the FTAA plans because
of its ideological differences with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The representatives have made some progress in the definition
of the objectives and mechanisms of negotiation, but differences
in agriculture, subsidies, measures against unfair competition,
labor and environmental matters must still be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Common Market (Mercosur) countries -- Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- want agriculture discussed in a
special table of negotiations, while the United States prefers it
in a table on access to markets.
</P>
<P>
Mexico insists subsidies and unfair competition be treated
within the theme of competition policies, but the United States
wants them dealt with separately.
</P>
<P>
Governments still face problems in reconciling the interests of
economies so different as the United States and poorer Latin
American and Caribbean countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Sector Facing Less Export But New Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Though China's textile exports
are suffering losses in the Asia financial crisis, China still has
opportunities to recover through processing trade, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics reveal that because of the financial turmoil
in the region, China's textile exports have plummeted since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
China has mapped out its strategy to offset the region's
currency difficulties by importing raw materials from other
countries and processing them into final products for sale. Other
Asian countries are doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based paper noted that although the exporting price
of other major Asian textile exporters is much cheaper, it will be
more expensive for them to import the raw materials because of the
price devaluation in these countries.
</P>
<P>
As for China, the prices of imported raw materials are dropping
faster than the prices of the exported processed goods.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures indicated that so far this year, the prices of
China's textile exports have dropped by five to ten percent. By
comparison, the price of China's textile imports fell by seven to
13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government can help the manufacturers by increasing their
tax rebate and helping them find new business opportunities, said
the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Monetary Authorities Cut Banks' Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has slashed the statutory reserve requirement of banks
to help lower interest rates, a leading newspaper revealed on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statutory reserve, a portion of total deposits which must
be kept in the central bank vault, will be cut by three percentage
points to 10 percent at the end of the month, the Manila Bulletin
quoted a statement from the bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the banks' liquidity reserves, which they are
required to invest in government securities, will be raised by
three percentage points to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment of reserve requirements is expected to
meaningfully lower bank lending rates by reducing bank
intermediation cost by at least 0.66 percent," Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Prime rates, offered to the banks' most creditworthy customers,
averaged 21 percent this week while the maximum, non-prime rates
were at around 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lending rates rose sharply last year as Philippine banks became
more cautious amid the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the liquidity reserves would also be raised
from 4 percent to 7 percent so that there would be no monetary
impact as a result of the cut in the statutory reserves, Singson
said.

QUITO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's cocoa exports in the
first two months this year fell by 60 percent over 1997 to eight
million U.S. dollars, a report from the Ecuador Cocoa Producers
National Association said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the export plunge to the El Nino
phenomenon. It said torrential rains arising from the El Nino
phenomenon knocked out flowers and favored the growing of monilla,
a fungus that covers the fruit of the cocoa tree, which caused
a sharp drop in cocoa output this year.

The slump in cocoa exports, the report added, is expected to

GUANGZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
employees in the capital of south China's Guangdong Province are
receiving better welfare benefits from the city.
</P>
<P>
Now, 3.74 million people have participated in social security,
with 64,000 poor households receiving aid. In 1997, employees'
per-capita monthly income exceeded 1,000 yuan, a year-on-year
increase of 12 percent, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The city has intensified efforts to develop such social
benefits as old-age pensions, unemployment insurance, industrial
accident benefits and birth insurance. It has also set up a
minimum wage system, a bottom line for living expenses and a
subsidy standard as well as re-employment and aid-the-poor
projects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 1.1 million people bought old-age insurance
policies, with 350,000 retirees getting 434 yuan per person each
month. More than 60 million yuan was paid to the unemployed at
430 yuan each per month.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou established a re-employment fund and raised 50
million yuan by last year, with more than 8,000 people already
benefiting. So, it was able to keep the unemployment rate below
2.5 per cent, below the national average.

PANAMA CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign Minister
Ricardo Alberto Arias will travel next week to the United States
to discuss proposals for a multilateral antidrugs centre.

<P>
Panama and the United States agreed last December in principle
to establish the antidrugs centre in 2000 and operate it for 12 or
more years in the U.S. Howard Air Base on the banks of the Panama
Canal.
</P>
<P>
The base will revert to Panamanian sovereignty next year, in
agreement with the Torrijos-Carter treaties, signed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The United States would pay Panama a total of 53.5 million
dollars for the houses to be occupied by the personnel of the
multilateral antidrugs centre.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Teahouses are replacing karaoke
and disco halls, bars and cafes are becoming the favorite places
for Beijingers to visit during their spare time.
</P>
<P>
There are now 40 teahouses in Beijing, and the number is
expected to reach 100 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Local teahouses include three groups: small ones that just
provide tea; traditional-style teahouses; and large ones with
multiple functions such as entertainment and food.
</P>
<P>
A modern teahouse manager, Gu Xiaoming, attributed the
popularity of teahouses to their ease of operation and low
cost. Teahouses also provide a more simple and elegant environment
which people seem to enjoy, the manager added.
</P>
<P>
Actress Dong Yunling said she loves drinking tea. She often
visits teahouses, she said, and has a tea room in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that drinking tea helps build better moral
character in people.

Neary, who has now won all 19 of his pro contests and who has

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has taken measures to upgrade the water quality of the Yellow
River, the second longest in China.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River rises on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and flows
through Lanzhou, capital of Gansu. Some 20 major sources of waste
water pollution have been found in and around the densely
populated capital.
</P>
<P>
The water quality of the Yellow River in Lanzhou has
deteriorated to a fourth-grade rating due to rapid social and
economic developments in recent years, according to the Gansu
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou has placed priority on the protection of potable water
resources, with a six-sq.km. area surrounding the city designated
as a first-degree protection zone. The zone prohibits construction
of any projects which might pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
Waste water outlets in the area will either be treated or
closed within a deadline set by the local government, and
inspections will be carried out on all polluting sources in order
to ensure the quality of drinking water meets state standards.
</P>
<P>
The province will require all industrial pollution sources
along the Lanzhou section of the river to fully comply with the
discharge standards by the year 2000 in order to raise the water
quality to a third-degree state rating.

OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada condemned the attack on a
Burmese refugee camp near Mae Sot on the Thai-Burma border,
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Thursday.
</P>

Burmese military forces were reported to destroy Wednesday the

"Canada is appalled by the cross-border attack on Burmese
refugees in Thailand, a painful reminder of the Burmese
government's continued abuse of its citizens," Axworthy said in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to transgressing international boundaries, the
attack represent an unacceptable violation of basic human rights,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Burmese ambassador here has been called in by Canada's
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to be
advised of its condemnation of this act, the release said.
</P>

<HEADLINE>   EU Unsatisfactory With French World Cup Ticket Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Commisison
official said Thursday the French World Cup organizers had not
made a satisfactory offer to distribute more tickets to supporters
from outside the host country.
</P>
<P>
Karel van Miert, European commissioner for competition
policies, made the remark while addressing a European Parliament
session in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the French organizers had offered to
distribute 50,000 of the 160,000 remaining tickets to the national
soccer associations.
</P>
<P>
There are in all 2.5 million tickets available for this year's
cup tournament that kicks off on June 10.
</P>
<P>
"We are not yet satisfied by what we have been offered by the
organizers," van Miert told the European legislators.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, said that under EU laws of fair competition, the
way the tickets for this summer's World Cup tourney have been
distributed discriminates against people from outside France.
</P>
<P>
But the commission admitted that it was powerless to retrieve
the tickets already sold out.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission and the French organizers were expected
to reach a settlement on making more tickets available for
non-French supporters.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the French organizing committee met European
Commission officials last week in Brussels and they are meeting
again this week in an effort to reach any settlement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considers New Steps on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) - The United States said on
Thursday it was considering extending mandate of the small force
of U.N. peacekeepers in Macedonia because of fears the crisis in
nearby Kosovo province could spread.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing
that the U.S. is considering the force of 700 American and
Scandinavian soldiers might be enlarged or given new rules of
engagement.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that's under discussion right now. But yes,
we are looking at what the right mix of capabilities and missions
will best serve a situation that has gotten worse, not gotten
better."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. last week lifted the measures to soften the sanctions
against Belgrade after dozens died in conflict in Kosovo, accusing
the Yugoslav authorities of being responsible for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters
that he is going to ask the U.N. Security Council to review the
earlier decision to withdraw the peacekeeping force from
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly are pleased that the secretary-general agrees with
us that there is a need to have a stabilizing international
presence, a peacekeeping presence in the region," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"Precisely what form that international peacekeeping presence
would take is something that one can discuss," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Mandate of the troops in Macedonia is expected to expire at the
end of August this year and the Security Council decided to pull
them out by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Rubin confirmed that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Annan also discussed the issue and believed the troops will remain
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We do think it's encouraging and important that the
international community is getting behind the idea that if the
current trends don't reverse themselves...one of the grave risks
here is that the violence in Kosovo will spread to neighboring
countries like the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
That's why it's so important to ensure that all steps are
taken, including the possibility of extending the military
presence in Macedonia, the spokesman affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Washington District Courthouse Busy with Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for U.S. President
Bill Clinton and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky were in
court Thursday to argue before a federal judge in Washington D.C.
that independent counsel Kenneth Starr's office should be
disciplined for alleged media leaks.
</P>
<P>
David Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney David Kendall, filed
the complaint about leaks in February. He was joined by Lewinsky
attorney William Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
Leaks about confidential grand jury processes can be punished
by contempt of court citations.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. Judge of the district court Norma Holloway Johnson
is expected to rule on the complaint soon, although even her
ruling may be kept sealed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House adviser Bruce Lindsey was back before
Starr's federal grand jury investigating alleged Clinton affair
with Lewinsky and a potential cover-up.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey returned after Johnson allowed him to reserve some
testimony while the issue of whether some of his conversations
with the president were protected by executive privilege was
hashed out.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House steward Bayani Nelvis made his third
appearance before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
After his testimony, Nelvis did not respond to reporters'
questions. Nelvis and his lawyers also did not say whether he has
completed his testimony or expects to be called back.
</P>
<P>
In his earlier testimony, Nelvis reportedly said he never saw
the president and Lewinsky alone in the White House.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one in three Canadians say
they would move to British Colombia (B.C.) province to live if
they could, according to a new poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Residents in B.C. also agree that their province is the best
place to live in Canada, with 76 percent giving it top marks,
higher than anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
The weather, the scenery and natural surroundings are what make
B.C. the number one place to live and retire, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in December by the Angus Reid Group for
the Royal Bank of Canada, interviewed 1,500 Canadians on
everything from housing and day care to weather and retirement.
</P>
<P>
The results are considered accurate within 2.5 percent, 19
times out of 20.

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai said on Thursday that his country was recovering from a
financial crisis and expected other countries in the region to
bounce back.
</P>

OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Strong economic growth in Canada
will create more than one million new jobs during the next four
years, the Bank of Montreal predicted Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says to Have Assured Washington on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Thursday that he had lengthy discussions on Iraq
with President Bill Clinton and his foreign policy team members.
</P>
<P>
Before winding up his two-day visit to Washington, Annan said
he had reassured the Washington about his pact, reached on Feb.
23, with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated his warning to Iraq of real danger by failing
to honor the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Iraq should understand that if this effort
to ensure compliance through negotiations is obstructed by evasion
or deception, as were the previous efforts, diplomacy may not have
a second chance," he said at a press conference at the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"No promise of peace and no policy of patience can be without
limits. It is my sincere hope that the government of Iraq does
understand this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Clinton, Annan also talked with National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Defense Secretary William Cohen on the issue of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton praised Annan for negotiating the agreement,
which had reduced for the moment the threat of U.S. air strikes on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement, on its own terms, preserves the integrity of
the inspections," Clinton said during his talks with Annan.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement were fulfilled, "then we would be able to do
what the United States has always wanted, which is to complete the
inspection process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Congress, however, was not happy with the agreement, arguing
that the United Nations would soften its stand against Iraq under
the accord.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said that the agreement "is clearly not a sellout."
</P>
<P>
Annan left Washington with a key difference with the Clinton
administration unresolved -- whether the United States, which has
a substantial military force arrayed in the Gulf, has the
authority to strike Iraq without further U.N. action.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Washington should first consult with the Security
Council before it decided to use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States would consult the Security
Council but it need no approval of the United Nations for its
any kind of military actions against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Calls Tuesday's Shooting as Tragic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- As part of efforts to repair
the political damage of Tuesday's killing of three Palestinians,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted Thursday that
the incident was a "tragic mistake."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Arab service of Israeli state
television Channel I, Netanyahu asked the families of the
Palestinian victims to accept his condolences. He also pledged to
make efforts to push forward the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But he defended the action of the three soldiers who opened
fire at the van carrying the Palestinian workers, saying they
truly believed their lives were in danger at that time.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers said they regarded the driver of the van as trying
to launch a terror attack as he drove toward the roadblock near
Hebron and knocked down their commander.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu praised the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for
cooperating in calming the tense situation in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Widespread clashes were triggered in the region by the killing
as outraged Palestinians threw stones and petrol bombs at Israeli
soldiers. Several dozens of Palestinians were wounded by rubber
bullets in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Thursday
telephoned PNA President Yasser Arafat to brief him on the Israeli
investigation into the shooting incident. Mordechai promised that
the final results of the probe would be transferred to the PNA,
calling on Arafat to continue to work to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
Expressing sorrow over the death of the Palestinians,
Mordechai added that he had ordered Israeli forces to avoid
clashing with Palestinian protesters. A day earlier, Mordechai
also phoned PNA deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) to call for
cooperation in preventing the escalation of violence.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Russia
will appoint mutual police attaches in a joint drive to fight
international crime syndicates in accordance with a treaty signed
Thursday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi and visiting Russian Deputy Chairman Anatoly
Kulikov, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of police attaches would streamline the
exchange of intelligence between the two countries, Kulikov said.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the police forces of the two countries would
cooperate closely to track international syndicates smuggling
uranium, diamonds and gold.
</P>
<P>
They would also work together in the prevention, detection,
suppression and investigation of other crimes, including murder,
money laundering, and trafficking in drugs, firearms and
radio-active material, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said there were strong similarities in the crime
patterns of South Africa and Russia. Both were in a period of
transition and were facing new threats in the form of organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
"In both countries, a number of criminal syndicates are
operated by foreigners who ruthlessly exploit the vulnerability
of a state in transition," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Devises Cheap Method to Clear Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Defense researchers in Britain
have developed a cheap, safe and simple method of burning
landmines without having to explode them.
</P>
<P>
The firework-like device, named FireAnt, can be operated by a
battery from a distance of 50 meters, the New Scientist magazine
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It works by directing a jet of flame at landmines from a few
centimeters away, searing a hole in the casing, igniting the
detonator before it can set off the mine and incinerating the high
explosive so that it simply burns off without exploding.
</P>
<P>
FireAnt torches the mine for around 25 seconds, leaving the
explosives to burn themselves out in a few minutes, the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
Because the flame is hot enough to burn a hole through at least
one millimeter of steel in seconds, it can deal with both metal
and plastic landmines.
</P>
<P>
Anti-tank mines, which are bigger, can be destroyed by
simultaneously directing three or four FireAnt at them.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Britain's Defense Evaluation Research Agency,
which developed FireAnt, said that individual unit of the device
could sell for as little as 15 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations puts the cost of clearing one landmine by
the traditional method, either defusing it or blowing it up, at
300-1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With some 110 million landmines still uncleared around the
world, the potential savings could be massive, researchers said.

It works by directing a jet of flame at landmines from a few
centimeters away, searing a hole in the casing, igniting the
detonator before it can set off the mine and incinerating the high
explosive so that it simply burns off without exploding.
</P>
<P>
FireAnt torches the mine for around 25 seconds, leaving the
explosives to burn themselves out in a few minutes, the magazine
said.
</P>
<P>
Because the flame is hot enough to burn a hole through at least
one millimeter of steel in seconds, it can deal with both metal
and plastic landmines.
</P>
<P>
Anti-tank mines, which are bigger, can be destroyed by
simultaneously directing three or four FireAnt at them.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Britain's Defense Evaluation Research Agency,
which developed FireAnt, said that individual unit of the device
could sell for as little as 15 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations puts the cost of clearing one landmine by
the traditional method, either defusing it or blowing it up, at
300-1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With some 110 million landmines still uncleared around the
world, the potential savings could be massive, researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: No Discrimination Against Religious Minority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy
Youssef Boutros Ghali said Thursday that Egypt bears no
discrimination against its religious minority.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not have any form of discrimination, either based
on color, race or religion," Boutros Ghali told a visiting
delegation from the New York-based World Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptians are tolerant by nature and are far from being
fanatics," the minister said, responding to queries on social,
religious and religious affairs in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The minister also denounced various kinds of terrorist acts
which have killed dozens of Coptic Christians in southern Egypt in
1997, saying when terrorists strike all Egyptians are victims.
</P>
<P>
He also expounded the role of the Egyptian government and
religious institutions in upgrading the standard of living for all
social groups without distinction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the U.S. delegates discussed with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak the claims by western media on an alleged
strife between Egyptian Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The delegates, who arrived here Tuesday on a five-day visit,
met Wednesday with Grand Imam of Al Azhar Sheikh Mohammad Sayed
Tantawi and Pope Shenuda III of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been accusing Cairo of persecuting Copts, whose
6 million population constitutes a principal part of Egypt's
Christians. Muslims account for about 90 percent of the country's
62 million population.
</P>
<P>
Some Congressional members have called for the American
intervention to protect the Copts of Egypt, claiming they were
religiously persecuted. They also called for sanctions on
countries where religious minorities were subjected to any kind of
persecution.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Threatened by Terrorist Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said today that
some public tours at the Pentagon were stopped because of threats
by terrorist activities against installations of the Defense
Department in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Washington's largest
federal building went on "heightened alert status" after the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned Wednesday evening of
"possible terrorist activity aimed at installations in the
National Capital Region."
</P>
<P>
"We've been notified by the FBI of possible terrorist activity
in the next couple of days," said Glenn Flood, another Pentagon
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Flood said Pentagon tours that are planned in advance were
continuing but those for visitors who show up unannounced have
been canceled for Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The heightened state of alert began about 6 p.m. Wednesday.
Under such alert, security personnel were screening passes for
those entering the building more closely and might conduct random
searches of packages and briefcases. Access to the building could
also be restricted, Whitman and Flood said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Under Current Account Shoots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit in the
broadest measure of current account jumped to 166.4 billion U.S.
dollars last year, the second worst showing on record, the
Commerce Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department said the 1997 deficit in the current account,
which covers trade in merchandise, services and investments as
well as aid, increased 12.3 percent from the 1996 imbalance of
148.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 deficit is only next to a 168.1 billion dollar
all-time high set in 1987, a year when the U.S. manufacturers were
being battered by foreign competitors and the high value of the
U.S. dollar that helped imports less expensive.
</P>
<P>
Most economists are forecasting that the already high deficits
will rise even further this year as the Asian financial chaos cuts
into the U.S. exports to the region and at the same time enhances
sales of Asian products in this country.
</P>
<P>
Signs of the worsening development was seen in the final three
months of the year when the current account deficit climbed up to
a record high of 45.6 billion dollars, up 5.8 percent as against
the third quarter deficit of 43.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the year of 1997, the investment category registered a
deficit for the first time in the post World War II period. In
this category, the deficit of 14.3 billion dollars in the year
followed a surplus of 2.8 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some economists forecast that the investment category will
likely continue the trend since the United States has become the
world's largest debtor country. It also could mean that foreigners
own more in U.S. assets such as stocks, bonds and real estates
than that the Americans own in foreign assets abroad.
